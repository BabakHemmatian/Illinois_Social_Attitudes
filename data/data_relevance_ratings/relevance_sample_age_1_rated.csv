384540,"you're absolutely right sir and shortly after i posted i realized that the content of my post was making bold assumptions and probably lumping an entire generation under one universal ideology. of course there are exceptions to every rule, and it would appear that you are not only an exception but an exemplary exception at that. while i may sound like i'm quick to judge and that i fire first, i assure you this is something that i have become only recently, as an emotional response to all the bs i've seen taking place around me. i will be the first to admit that i have issues with older folks- having just turned 27 i even hold a little contempt for myself. the reason is both personal and general. on the personal side: i was raised by two of the most selfish boomers on the face of the earth. their marriage was rocky before i was even born- sometimes i suspect that i might have been conceived in hopes of ""repairing"" it. unfortunately, things got worse as i grew up. my mom (suffering from undiagnosed borderline personality disorder) tried to fill the void in her life with aesthetics and material goods and spent the majority of her time at the mall, maxing out credit cards. my dad was miserable and spent ever waking minute in the office, avoiding his family. by time i was 13 they split up; 9 years later they were finally divorced. during that time my dad ran off with another woman he met at work, my mom had my dad thrown in jail for a trumped up abuse charge, and i was constantly paraded around as a puppet to feed their withering ego's. i spent the majority of these years crashing on my friends families couches and trying to find a new surrogate family. by the time i hit junior year of hs my mom's mental illness had grown fangs and she pushed away her freinds and family, sinking into incurable depression. my dad (now remarried to a woman 1/3 his age), having spent the last 10 years hiding from his family obligations in his job, had now been appointed to a partner in his lawfirm and from this point on he became the walking embodiment of the ""infallible republican"". he spoke condescendingly of my mother while she recovered from another in a long line of suicide attempts. he refused to acknowledge his previous family as he literally told me to step in-line with the new one. now in a higher tax bracket, he showed callous indifference to others in times of trouble completely oblivious to all of the support he had recieved when things were at their worst. my mom consumed herself in an eternal quest for youth and beauty, serial dating on on-line dating websites (only men w/ money), and constantly wasting what little money she had on cosmetic surgery. when my mom started to breakdown once again, my father spoke of her with the kind of disdain that i would only reserve for my worst enemies. when she took her life he acted concerned for a few days while his new family and friends watched, and then as time passed seemed to easily move past her demise, finding comfort in his new family (just ahd two kids at 65- he'll be lucky to have enough juice in the battery to see them to adulthood) and his two new houses. he was once kicked out of villanova university for getting involved in anti-war protests. now he only talks to me to tell me that obama is a communist and to call me an idiot when i suggested that the new healthcare bill might have helped my mother get the psychiatric help she may have needed. i see the way that he can forget about his last family and move on without any sense of having learned anything or having been humbled at all. he is more of a right-wing blowhard now than any other adult i know and it is (mostly) all because he now has money and recognition in his line of work. when i once told him that money isn't important to me he tells me (condescendingly) that i know nothing of the world. this was two days after another of my moms suicide attempts when i had just returned from the psych ward, trying desperatley to find anyone else who would get involved in trying to save my mom. he, of course, had a better things to do.  from a general perspective, i turn towards history (or at least my very limited understanding of it). as a young kid i was always fascinated by the 60', specifically the music and cultural shift. i saw woodstock as a high-point, altamont as a low. i studied the works of wolfe, thompson, hoffman, leary, chomsky and the poetry of ginsburg. from an outsiders perspective this decade appeared to be the last one of real promise for the kind of changes that my generation is anxiously waiting for. during this time your enemies were more clear and visible. the movement was larger and it to was more visible. looking back it seems as though those ""sit-in's"" and campus protests, while genuine and heroic as they were, have now only served to show those in control what cards we plebians are holding. i understand and respect the boomers methods of addressing atrocities (and they often worked!!!!) however, i sincerely doubt that any of these tactics would make even the smallest impact today. when the children of the 60's protested it was uncharted waters- you had lbj and nixon running scared. but these days an entire industry has been developed to quell this kind of dissent if it ever arrives again. its almost as if the boomers took on the heavyweight champion of the world, went the distance, and then folded at the last minute. we still don't have the belt, and now the competition is prepared for just about anything we could ever throw at them. to take us right up to the brink and then fail to take off.... that is not only a failure for the boomers generation but a failure for ours as well.    and now, here we are and this same generation that i used to revere in my youth sickens me as i grow older. remove the reasons and excuses for their failure and you'll see many of these same ""flower children"" now in bed with the same negative influences they once fought. i don't know how to view our current state of affairs without seeing it, at least in some part, due to the failures of my parents generation. i am not trying to hurt anyone's feelings anymore than i am trying to find a scapegoat; if one simply looks at this generation from the rose colored lenses of youthful ambition and hope, then there is really no other way to see it. compare the effect, the cultural significance of the democratic convention of 76' to the g20 summit. in ""76"" the whole world was watching....  the g20 summit was watched by mabye a handful of concerned citizens.... through youtube videos and other ""user created"" content. the span of control has completely outgrown our ability to organize and effect social change. an honest, unbiased viewer of history would have to admit that the methods that the ""hippies"" and ""yippies"" used to fight the power back in the 60's and early 70's are completely outdated for these modern times. that ship has sailed. and unfortunately, once one takes a good, hard look at the world we now live today, one has to wonder what real good it did anyway.   do i think that my generation will be able to finish what my parents generation started? i have my doubts. but my ego is such that i know where the line must be drawn between fighting for good, honest social change and simply telling myself that i'm doing enough. i am not doing enough as it is, and i admit that. but i still have hope and i am still waiting to see the smoke.... or any signs of fire. i am not worthy of the cause and i am still too selfish and too consumed with my own life to tackle this much larger, more important challenge. there are plenty of beautiful women out there, and yet i still want one. there are plenty of children already out there in the world (many without homes or proper care) and still i want them. i am as much a part of the problem as you.... and we are as complicit as everyone else. but i know my enemies and they are many: they are those who now support an unsustainable lifestyle only because it currently benefits them (at the expense of everyone else). they are your enemy as well; make no mistake of it. i'm not suggesting that we attack the older generation or hold them in contempt- just that we recognize that they are indeed a roadblock to affecting the kind of change they themselves once championed and that they have (for the most part) become fat off the system which we wish to see so drastically changed. therefore they are our enemies in spirit, if not only in theory, and they should be not be afforded our respect for simply choosing their comfort over ours. this is a zero sum game unfortunately-my goal is to rise above that. however, as long as it remains a zero sum game, one persons gain will always come at anothers loss. think of just how much our grandparents had to sacrifice for their children (our parents) to be offered the opportunities they had simply waiting for them (they were hippies as much by principle as they were by privilege). then think about how little our parents have really had to sacrifice for us. we've all been raised by narcissists (generationally speaking.... how else does one come up with 'latch-key' kids?). the systems thatyour parents have left for us have created a narcissistic snowball effect- it appears to me that each generation becomes more and more self obsessed than the generation before it. of course there are always exceptions and i'm counting on these exceptions to make life at least tolerable for the next 70 or so years of my life. but we are indeed trapped in a psychotic, narcissistic nation and unlike you, i just don't see how we should be thanking our elders for keeping the seat warm for us. i don't like old people. i soon won't like myself for the same reasons. the fact is, at least when it comes to progressive change, age is not a mark of intelligence but rather a mark of stubborn resistance. old people make for terrible revolutionaires",1,,-1

[source: fire with fire, by feminist naomi wolf, p. 221, hardcover]  women are more likely to kill their children than are men: 55 percent to 45 percent. [source: ""women and violent crime,"" a paper by prof. rita j. simon, department of justice, law and society and washington college of law, american university, washington, d.c]  women commit almost all of the murders of newborns. in dade county, fla., between 1956 and 1986, according to the june 1990 journal of interpersonal violence 5:2, mothers accounted for 86 percent of newborn deaths. [source: when she was bad, by patricia pearson, p. 255, note 71.] (according to the dept. of health and human services, in 2003, nearly 60 percent of child abusers and neglect perpetrators were female.)  the idea of women assaulting children is finally becoming admissible in the minds of many americans. much credit for that may have to go to the use of hidden cameras. increasingly, they are catching mothers and female baby sitters in the act of brutalizing toddlers and even babies. ""prime time live"" was among the first to serve up examples of these acts. on november 19, 1997, it revealed nightmarish scenes of mothers clamping their hand over the nose and mouth of their desperately struggling infants. in great britain, researchers using covert video cameras in just two hospitals filmed parents suspected of child abuse, predominantly mothers, in the act of deliberately attempting to smother their infants.  battered-women's advocates excuse this maternal domestic violence against children -- while vociferously condemning the paternal type -- by claiming it stems from such ""syndromes"" as postpartum depression and ""the oppressive patriarchy,"" the latter of which the advocates always blame for women's criminal behavior but never credit for women's good behavior. the advocates cite these syndromes in order to generate sympathy for the mothers (while generating anger toward the men who assault far less defenseless adult women). however, they can't seem to explain the fact that at least as many female baby sitters have been video-taped violently abusing toddlers and babies. hidden cameras are doing what battered-women's advocates and most mainstream media outlets won't do: expose female violence.  women's brutality against small, defenseless children -‚Äì a common form of violence that takes place in the home but which vawa supporters do not call domestic violence -‚Äì suggests what ought to be painfully obvious:  if women, without provocation, batter and kill children, whom they've supposedly been socialized to love, they can, without provocation, batter and kill men, whom they've been socialized -- by the media, feminist literature, and vawa-type legislation -- to distrust, fear, and hate.",0,,
161051,"actually, i've been thinking about this a lot lately.  and i've started to formulate a personal theory about how the internet is essentially changing how this angst manifests itself.  teenage angst is a fairly well known phenomenon.  people going through huge developmental changes and inheriting the responsibilities and stresses of entering the adult world sometimes go through a phase, which is pretty well known by anyone who has been through it.  and is especially well known by older generations who get to observe it all the time in those ""young whipper-snappers"" that seem to have a problem with everything and everyone.  however, in the past, teenagers were relatively limited to their own peer group, namely other teenagers.  what the internet has done is blurred the lines between who teenagers used to hang out with, and who they encounter on a daily basis these days.  and likewise for older people.  just a couple of decades ago, it was pretty much unheard of for a 40-year-old to get involved in a heated debate about a particular subject with a 14-year-old unless they were family, or encountered kids regularly (e.g. through working as a teacher, or some other teen-related job).  in modern times, adults have tended to mix with adults (in their jobs, in bars etc) and kids mix with kids (at school, hanging around on street corners etc).  the internet and particularly social websites have come along and smashed all this apart.  now, for all i know you could be 15 or 75.  i think one net effect of this (no pun intended) is that adults are encountering a lot more of the rebellious, angst filled ""fuck the world and everyone in it"" attitude that you described.  whereas previously we'd be pretty content to go about our humdrum daily lives, we're once again swept back to our youth and are screaming and yelling about all manner of subjects, often in a fairly juvenile, knee-jerk kind of fashion.  that's not to say there weren't angst-ridden, ""change the world to my way of thinking"" adults around before the internet, but i think the number of adults who are developing this kind of attitude is really on the increase, especially online.  the most negative aspect of this, is that i think those who are relatively immature as adults, start to regress towards a rather childish, arrogant, aggressive nature in this context.  add in the protection of internet anonymity and you have a whole bunch of people becoming teenagers again, 20 years after they left their teens behind.  it's a little hard to explain exactly what i'm trying to say, and it's late at night so sadly i don't have the time to be very clear, but i think you can get an idea.",1,,-2

861685,"full text:  **they came, they razed, they left: a visit to a destroyed palestinian village the tiny village of homsa was the latest victims of israel's systematic policy of destruction of palestinian homes in the jordan rift**  *by gideon levy and alex levac	| apr. 12, 2014 | 8:08 am | 6*  israel is continuing to destroy systematically the villages of shepherds who live in the jordan rift. last week, the civil administration demolished homsa, another tiny palestinian village. in january, 160 residents of the valley were made homeless; last year, twice as many were left homeless as in the year before.  again the same unconscionable sights: heaps of debris, bare metal pegs lunging out of the earth, crushed fences, destroyed animal pens and squashed tin huts; remnants of personal property strewn all over; sheep wandering about looking in vain for shade; chickens pecking about; despondent shepherds; wretched sheep dogs; runny-nosed children curled up in grandmother‚Äôs lap and merciless sun beating down.  another palestinian shepherd community trampled into the ground. not the first, nor the last to meet such a fate in this hard, battered valley, whose palestinian inhabitants israel has set itself the goal of cleansing itself of, far from the public‚Äôs eye. step by step, devastating act after devastating act, community after community ‚Äì there are hundreds whose lives and property have been laid waste recently by the civil administration.  it‚Äôs the law that‚Äôs to blame, of course, the occupier‚Äôs law. it‚Äôs the law, under whose apparent aegis illegal outposts are established and legalized in the twinkling of an eye. and it‚Äôs the occupier, thanks to whose auspices these thousands of people, native sons, have neither running water nor electric power nor rights to inhabit the slopes of the verdant, flourishing jordan valley.  in 2013, according to united nations data, israel more than doubled the demolition of homes and other structures belonging to palestinians in the valley, as compared to the previous year. last year, 390 structures were demolished, compared to 170 in 2012, and 590 people were made homeless, compared to 160 the previous year.  the palestinian news agency ma‚Äôan reported that in january of this year alone, 160 more people were left to fend for themselves under the open skies, after the civil administration demolished their homes. on january 8, for example, khirbet ein karzaliyah, home to 25 souls, 15 of them children, was razed; on january 30, the hovels of khirbet umm al-jimal, where 61 people, half of them children, lived, was the victim of a similar fate.  last week came the turn of homsa, located in the northern part of the valley, home to four families of shepherds ‚Äì a total of 30 people, 15 of them children, and some 500 head of sheep.  about half a year ago, last september, the community of khalat makhoul, adjacent to the settlement of hemdat, was almost completely eradicated, leaving 12 families without shelter. the residents have since rebuilt their homes and their sheep pens, and now the community has risen again, phoenix-like, from the rubble. it‚Äôs a joyful, encouraging sight to see. new tents and tin shacks have been erected in place of the ones that were destroyed, new faucets have been connected to the water containers (of course, this site is not hooked up to the water system), plus there is solar-generated electricity in the new khalat makhoul.  together with two of its residents, burhan and bassam bushrat, we went this week to see what the civil administration had inflicted upon their neighbors, members of the homsa community.  immediately after the jewish settlement of bekaot, at the end of its well-tended rows of grape vines which are now covered with protective nets against all intruders, we turn onto a long serpentine, dirt path that ascends eastward into the hills and traverses the fields that belong to palestinian landowners from toubas and tamoun; at present, the fields are being worked by local tenant farmers.  under the blazing light, the wheat and the barley are lush and green now. on the slopes of a remote hill, in the heart of a sea of stalks, far from any other place of habitation, lie ruin and devastation. sitting in a white tent donated by the palestinian red crescent, surrounded by mounds of ruins, is hakam abu al-kabash, a shepherd. the aftermath of the shock is still etched on his face. he‚Äôs 28, the father of four young children, the youngest of whom is 7 months old. he was here last week on tuesday, just after 7 a.m., with his wife, their children and his parents when the forces of the civil administration swooped in to ravage his hamlet.  the troops, israel‚Äôs agents of destruction, a fleet of about 25 vehicles including trucks and bulldozers, accompanied by border police and others, had come to uproot the community, on the grounds that their habitation was illegal, even though they had lived there for years, on private palestinian land. kabash was born here, and for the past eight years he has lived in homsa in the heart of the wheat fields.  the act of demolition was swift;

367421,"*well...this turned into something much longer than i intended but i guess it's a big topic*  constitutional conventions are just those unwritten rules mostly limiting the monarch's power that cannot be enforced in courts but are considered to have the same effect as laws through power of tradition alone. in many cases they originate mostly from the hanoverian dynasty where the german kings didn't want to stay in britain because they were more concerned with their own land in hanover. thus they allowed a minister to be elected the 'first minister of the treasury', i.e. the prime minister, who would run things in the monarchy's absence. this has been happening for so long that it is generally accepted by judges, lawyers, mps and indeed the monarch herself that the powers the prime minister was given cannot be reclaimed by the monarch. one of the best quotes in english case law comes from a case on this, bbc v johns (1989) - the bbc was trying to claim it was an emanation of the crown (being the state broadcaster) and thus was entitled to crown immunity from tax. this would have been an extension of the crown's power. lord diplock said:   &gt;'it is 350 years and a civil war too late for the queen's courts to broaden the prerogative. the limits within which the executive government may impose obligations or restraints upon citizens of the united kingdom without any statutory authority are now well settled and incapable of extension'.   this case has been reaffirmed many times and it is therefore the law that the queen cannot extend her power; i would argue and i think most would agree that reclaiming old powers now exercised by the pm would be extending her power and would thus be illegal. any royal power that involves governing the country such as declaring war, the right to pardon criminals, appointment of peers, c of e officials and ministers, making treaties etc etc is all done by the pm,  foreign secretary or the home secretary or another cabinet minister and as such is not really a royal power any more. she still has plenty of powers she must exercise personally; she must appoint the pm after every election, she must dissolve parliament at the end of the year and reopen it, and she must give personal assent to each law. however, again, these powers have not been used in so long it is generally accepted by legal scholars, mps and the queen herself that she can't use these powers unless instructed to do so by the government. the last time a law has not been given assent was 1708. the closest it came to happening again was 1914 with the government of ireland bill. however even then it was the government of the time that gave him advise on whether he should withhold assent. this was also a special case (i would argue) because the king had made a personal intervention to stop sectarian violence in ireland by holding a conference personally to talk about peace thus he must have felt personally involved. in the end the government suspended the act themselves on the day it passed because of ww1.  again, the monarch has never overruled an election result. it's considered impossible for the monarch to do so. imagine if she did - who do you think the british public would side with; the election or her? i think they would side with the election and quickly remove all power from the monarch if not abolish it completely. the queen knows this and monarchs have know this for hundred of years and so they don't do it. it's been so long that it is conventional that the leader if the winning party is pm. most people view this as meaning it's actually not within the monarchs sole power and is these days both technically and practically illegal. one moment where this may have been close to being broken was when harold macmillan was ill in hospital and resigned in 1963. the young elizabeth ii went to see him. he chose lord home to succeed him and the queen duly appointed him. this upset the conservative party because home was not their first choice but the queen can barely be blamed he because she was following the advice of the pm and there had been an election so the convention was not properly relevant.   now, i'm interpreting the conventions very strictly as law themselves; all they are is traditional ways of doing things not laws passed by parliament but for all intents and purposes everyone considers them to be law...so they are. that's generally how legal positivism, the most influential theory of law in common law systems, works.   the royal powers are getting smaller all the time. the case of attorney general v de keyser's royal hotel (1920) says that if the government has a choice between a royal power and a statutory power that does the same thing they should use the statutory power and the royal power is therefore abolished. in the constitutional reform and governance act 2010 the government made running the civil service a government power not a royal one and they made ratification of treaties a government power not a royal one so in both these cases the royal power is abolished. they had been intending to include the power to declare war but didn't. they may do this in the coming years but as you can see, the fact that the queen can't expand her power and every law passed overlapping a royal power abolishes it means that royal powers are slowly disappearing. in 50 years the queen might have no power left technically just like the monarch has not been able to practically use these powers for centuries. either way the only way is down for monarchical power; all it takes is time.",0,,

819799,"you have lots of options.  consider them.  pick one.  do it.  1.  terminate pregnancy -- this option leaves your life (the outward part, anyway) much the same as it is now.  inside, you may take it kind of hard, but outside, you still get to be a 'normal' college freshman and still get to party and still get to have friends and go to classes and generally operate without any obligations, either short-term or long-term.  you do not have to tell anyone, not even the boyfriend, if you get an abortion.  (i would still suggest that you tell the boyfriend on the grounds that he should know and that it's the decent thing for you to do.)  on the down side, some people are not very on-board with abortion.  if you're one of those, this option may not be for you.  2.  carry to term, give child up for adoption -- option 2 variants really only fuck up your life for about four months.  you probably won't look horribly pregnant for the first five months of pregnancy and, while you'll have to take prenatal vitamins and go to the doc and whatnot, you can still have a reasonably normal-looking college-freshman life (minus the drinking and recreational drugs, if any).  given the time of year, you'll finish out the semester, easily, but your fall semester is gonna be weird b/c you will probably deliver in november.  the last couple of months of pregnancy you will look and feel very very pregnant and everybody will know that you are.  it's not real easy to hide and you will have to tell your parents.  however, and this is a salient point, the rest of your life will not be fucked up by having to be a parent before you really want to be a parent.  also, you get to not kill the baby, which makes the people not-on-board with abortion happy.  downside here is that everybody will know you are pregnant and rather a lot of people will have to be told that you are going to give the baby away b/c they will ask shit like ""do you want a boy or a girl?"" and ""so, have you thought about names?"" and so forth.  you won't get a baby shower.  and you will have to give up nine months of your life (but only four or so will be really truly hideous) to pursue this option... but then you can be ""done"" and move on to things you're more interested in.  3.  carry to term, ""keep"" the baby and raise it.  (you can marry the dude now, later, never.)  -- all of the option 3 variants sign you up for eighteen years of responsibility for another human being and eighteen years of responsible adult getting-along-with this dude who is, by your own admission, not a ""forever"" dude.  even if you don't marry the dude, you need to get support from him for the baby and you should work out custody and crap like that.  you are probably eighteen or nineteen at this moment.  all the time that you have been alive, that is the size of the committment you are signing up for.  if you select an option 3 variant, your life as a carefree college freshman/soph/junior/senior is over.  yes, you can still go to college.  as far as freedom from responsibility, your life is totally and completely over. you wanna go out with friends?  cool!  find a babysitter.  a responsible one.  oh, and don't bother coming home lit to the gills because you have a little one and there might be an emergency.  (this is also why you can't stay home and drink or get stoned.  you have to be ready in case of emergency.)  have fun spending the remaining two and a half years (postpartum) of your college career organizing child care, picking the kid up from daycare, dropping the kid off at daycare, playing with and entertaining and feeding and cleaning up after the kid when you would really rather be hanging out with your peeps or studying or chatting up that cute feller in molecular biology.  want the freedom to date a variety of dudes before you settle on the one?  good luck with that.  many dudes are not interested in chicks-with-someone-else's-baby... particularly not at your age.  hell, not at my age either, and i'm forty.  also, and i just point this out as an aside:  i am a landlord.  i rent housing to poor people, many of them section 8 government subsidized housing.  you know who i rent to a lot?  single mothers in their early twenties, with one or two babies.  some of them work, some of them don't -- it's tough to have a chump-change (no college education) job when you have to pay for childcare on toddlers.  the responsible dude, well, he's generally a dude in his early twenties, without a lot of means to support dependants.  he's not usually married to my tenant, though he might have been in the past.  (persons in their late teens may not have the resources and life experience to make a marriage work over the long haul, particularly when the five-year outlook is bleak.)  sometimes he pays the support and sometimes he doesn't.  (partly this is because he can't pay what he doesn't have.)  when he doesn't pay my tenants, the rent is late and if he doesn't pay support frequently enough, i evict the single mother and her toddler.  being one of those women is not a life i'd choose.  eventually, yes, they get their shit together, if they stop having babies.  eventually the kiddies are all in school for a full day (six years after the last one is born), five days a week.  eventually the responsible dude grows up enough to hold a steady, reliable job and the support evens out a bit.  eventually the single mom can keep her little family's collective head above water and maybe start looking for a decent and undamaged man to spend what's left of her life with.  from watching my tenants, i'd say that this happens about the time she hits her early thirties.  it doesn't have to go like that, but, judging from my tenants, that's the way to bet.  being a single mom in her early twenties is a very very strong indicator for poverty.

887704,"i really do hope that all of this business about fema camps for political dissidents and martial law is fear-mongering or ignorance or something but it is too horrible and there are too many precedents to dismiss it.  *** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlad_iii_the_impaler  when he came to power, vlad immediately had all the assembled nobles arrested. the older boyars and their families were immediately impaled. the younger and healthier nobles and their families were marched north from t√¢rgovi≈üte to the ruins of poienari castle in the mountains above the arge≈ü river. vlad was determined to rebuild this ancient fortress as his own stronghold and refuge. the enslaved boyars and their families were forced to labor for months, rebuilding the old castle with materials from another nearby ruin. according to tradition, they laboured until the clothes fell off their bodies and then were forced to continue working naked. very few of the old gentry survived the ordeal of building vlad's castle.  throughout his reign, vlad systematically eradicated the old boyar class of wallachia. the old boyars had repeatedly undermined the power of the prince during previous reigns and had been responsible for the violent overthrow of several princes. vlad was determined that his own power be on a modern and thoroughly secure footing. in place of the executed boyars, vlad promoted new men from among the free peasantry and middle class, who would be loyal only to their prince.  the atrocities committed by vlad in the german stories include impaling, torturing, burning, skinning, roasting, and boiling people, feeding people the flesh of their friends or relatives, cutting off limbs, drowning, and nailing people's hats to their heads. his victims included men and women of all ages, religions and social classes, children and babies. one german account includes the following sentence: ""he caused so much pain and suffering that even the most bloodthirstiest persecutors of christianity like herodes, nero, diocletian and all other pagans combined hadn‚Äôt even thought of.""[9]  impalement was ≈£epe≈ü's preferred method of torture and execution. his method of torture was a horse attached to each of the victim's legs as a sharpened stake was gradually forced into the body. the end of the stake was usually oiled, and care was taken that the stake not be too sharp; else the victim might die too rapidly from shock. normally the stake was inserted into the body through the anus and was often forced through the body until it emerged from the mouth. however, there were many instances where victims were impaled through other bodily orifices or through the abdomen or chest. infants were sometimes impaled on the stake forced through their mother's chests. the records indicate that victims were sometimes impaled so that they hung upside down on the stake.  death by impalement was slow and agonising. victims sometimes endured for hours or even days. vlad often had the stakes arranged in various geometric patterns. the most common pattern was a ring of concentric circles in the outskirts of a city that constituted his target. the height of the spear indicated the rank of the victim. the corpses were often left decaying for months. there are claims that thousands of people were impaled at a single time. one such claim says 10,000 were impaled in the transylvanian city of sibiu (where vlad had once lived) in 1460. another allegation asserts that during the previous year, on saint bartholomew's day (in august), vlad had 30,000 of the merchants and officials of the transylvanian city of bra≈üov impaled for breaking his authority. one of the most famous woodcuts of the period shows vlad feasting in a forest of stakes and their grisly burdens outside bra≈üov, while a nearby executioner cuts apart other victims.[10]  vlad ≈£epe≈ü is alleged to have committed even more impalements and other tortures against invading ottoman forces. it was reported that an invading ottoman army turned back in fright when it encountered thousands of rotting corpses impaled on the banks of the danube.[4] it has also been said that in 1462 mehmed ii, the conqueror of constantinople, a man noted for his own psychological warfare tactics, returned to constantinople after being sickened by the sight of 20,000 impaled corpses outside vlad's capital of t√¢rgovi≈üte. many of the victims were turkish prisoners of war vlad had previously captured during the turkish invasion. the total turkish casualty toll in this battle reached over 40,000. the warrior sultan turned command of the campaign against vlad over to subordinates and returned to constantinople, even though his army had initially outnumbered vlad's three to one and was better equipped.  ***  http://www.thenagain.info/webchron/westeurope/spaninqui.html  the spanish inquisition was used for both political and religious reasons. spain is a nation-state that was born out of religious struggle between numerous different belief systems including catholicism, islam, protestantism and judaism. following the crusades and the reconquest of spain by the christian spaniards the leaders of spain needed a way to unify the country into a strong nation. ferdinand and isabella chose catholicism to unite spain and in 1478 asked permission of the pope to begin the spanish inquisition to purify the people of spain. they began by driving out jews, protestants and other non-believers.  in 1483 tomas de torquemada became the inquisitor-general for most of spain. he was responsible for establishing the rules of inquisitorial procedure and creating branches of the inquisition in various cities. he remained the leader of the spanish inquisition for fifteen years and is believed to be responsible for the execution of around 2,000 spaniards. the catholic church and the pope attempted to intervene in the bloody spanish inquisition but were unable to wrench the extremely useful political tool from the hands of the spanish rulers.  the inquisition was run procedurally by the inquisitor-general who established local tribunals of the inquisition. accused heretics were identified by the general population and brought before the tribunal. the were given a chance to confess their heresy against the catholic church and were also encouraged to indict other heretics. if they admitted their wrongs and turned in other aggressors against the church they were either released or sentenced to a prison penalty. if they would not admit their heresy or indict others the accused were publicly introduced in a large ceremony before they were publicly killed or sentenced to a life in prison. around the 1540s the spanish inquisition turned its fire on the protestants in spain in an attempt to further unify the nation. the spanish inquisition's reign of terror was finally suppressed in 1834.  ***  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_germany  the nazi persecution of the jews culminated in the holocaust, in which approximately six million european jews were deported and murdered during world war ii. on may 19, 1943, germany was declared judenrein (clean of jews; also judenfrei: free of jews). it is believed that between 170,000 and 200,000 german jews had been killed.   ***  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martial_law  in egypt, a state of emergency has been imposed almost continuously since 1967 due to the assassination of president anwar el-sadat in 1981, martial law was declared. egypt has been under martial law ever since - the parliament has renewed the emergency laws every three years since they were imposed. the legislation was last extended in 2003 and was due to expire at the end of may 2006; plans were in place to replace them with new anti-terrorism laws, but after the dahab bombings in april, martial law was renewed for another two years. [2][3] in may 2008 there was a further extension to june 2010. [4]  martial law allows the government to detain anyone deemed to be threatening state security for renewable 45-day periods without court orders and also give military courts the power to try civilians. public demonstrations are banned under the legislation.  ***  military administrative government was in effect from 1949 to 1966 over some geographical areas of israel, which had large arab populations, primarily the negev, galilee, and the triangle. the residents of these areas were subject to a number of controlling measures that amounted to martial law.[5][6] permits from the military governor had to be procured to travel more than a given distance from their registered place of residence and curfew, administrative detentions, and expulsions were common.[5] though the military administration was officially for geographical areas, and not people, its restrictions were seldom enforced on the jewish residents of these areas.  ***  the philippines was under martial law again from 1972 to 1981 under the authoritarian rule of ferdinand marcos. martial law was declared to suppress increasing civil strife and the threat of communist takeover following a series of bombings in manila. the declaration of martial law was initially well-received by some segment of the people but became unpopular as excesses and human rights abuses by the military emerged. torture was used in extracting information from their enemies.  ***   martial law was introduced in communist poland on december 13, 1981 by generals czes≈Çaw kiszczak and wojciech jaruzelski to prevent democratic opposition from gaining popularity and political power in the country. thousands of people linked to democratic opposition, including lech wa≈Çƒôsa, were arbitrary arrested and detained. about 100 deaths are attributed to the martial law, including 9 miners shot by the police during the pacification of striking wujek coal mine.",0,,

(i tell him i do pick my battles. all of them. lol) he's more into numbers and practicality, which i love about him, because i'm more of an impractical, emotionally driven artsy type. i'm madly in love with him, and vice versa, even though he sometimes looks at me like i have ten heads, and rightly so. he has three surviving grandparents, as the gmil in question's husband has been deceased for quite some time now. lives with his parents, and i live with mine, down the street from one another. we'll be buying a house in around two years' time, and our parents are totally cool with us hanging at home for a little while longer.  &amp;nbsp;  **mil** - saint. seriously. i hit the mother in law jackpot with this woman. gmil is her mil, and treats her like absolute shit. mil is sweet and not at all confrontational and would probably rip off her arm and hand it to you if you asked her for it. slightly anxious but not intrusive or pushy, hates to upset anyone. she's kind and loving, and the mother of 4 boys aged 24, 22, 18, and 16, my so being the oldest‚Ä¶ told you she's a saint. we're very close, as i'm the only other girl frequenting the house besides her (and gmil, but she's actually a beast, not a girl).  &amp;nbsp;  **fil** - also saintly, especially having the mother that he did growing up. holds on to a lot of resentment, but has been there for his mother through everything because despite her shittiness, he still loves her, and realistically none of his other four siblings want much to do with her anymore due to her various shenanigans throughout the years. married to mil for 29 years this year. sticks up for mil almost all the time, because mil will never stick up for herself, and i love him for it.  &amp;nbsp;  **bil1** - 22. away at college. probably won't pop up here much. 0 patience for gmil's shit and as a result, avoids her like the plague.  &amp;nbsp;  **bil2** - 18. also away at college. really good at brushing off gmil's bullshit because he is the most like so out of the other brothers.  &amp;nbsp;  **bil3**- 16, the baby. still in his mouthy teen stage. i love him dearly, and he's really only backtalking gmil right now, to the point where i had to pull him aside and tell him to chill because he's pretty much just goading her on at this point. not that i didn‚Äôt enjoy it lmao. they are mortal enemies. it's hilarious.  &amp;nbsp;  **gfil and gmil2** - mil's parents. married for like 60 years? live next door to mil &amp; fil. gfil is very unwell with an advanced form of cancer, and is going downhill fast. he's being a champ about it, and this is important because gmil has really shown her ass now that the attenvtion isn't on her and her many ""hardships"". gfil and gmil2 are two of the kindest people i have ever met. i never had a grandfather and only have one surviving grandmother left, so i latched onto these two pretty quickly. if there are grandparent soulmates, these two are mine.   &amp;nbsp;  *ps if you haven't noticed by now, this family is crazy close but not in an emotionally incestuous way. they just love each other and get along so well that they just want to be around each other all the time. it literally makes no sense to me sometimes. not that they don't bicker or argue, they do but it's in such a healthy way‚Ä¶*  **lol except gmil.**  &amp;nbsp;  gmil, who i need to come up with a good name for (we call her hammy, because she likes to get hammered and be a little shit to everyone in her vicinity, so maybe that?) is, in my opinion, a narcissist. she has five children, none of whom can stand her, and since her husband died 12 years ago, she has lived with each and every one of them and been kicked out, and lived at my fil's house twice, this time being her second. for some ungodly reason they are building her an in-law apartment on the side of their home (ffs why?) but for now she lives in so's bedroom, which he graciously gave up for her. he is the oldest and had the biggest bedroom, and gave it up at the behest of his parents. he now stays in the now remodeled second tv room, so we have big television to watch in there so no complaints. she's staying here during the remodeling (by her four very handy sons, free of charge) and selling of her house she insisted on keeping for 12 years, though she didn't live in it and couldn't afford it.   &amp;nbsp;  from what i understand, she wasn't a very good mother and was physically and verbally abusive to her children. she was a chain-smoking, drunk-24-hours, irish catholic mom in the 60's. that should tell you everything. my grandmother was a lot like her before her stroke which mellowed her out quite a bit, which leads me to think the behavior is generational/ cultural. slightly racist but very choosy who she expresses that around. she doesn't pull that shit around me, nor will she, as one half of my background is a minority. she paints a picture to anyone who will listen about what a good life her kids had thanks entirely to her hard work (she has never worked a day in her life, she's 76) and how close they all are. they all borderline despise her. she has managed to somehow gaslight every memory of their childhood. every single one.  &amp;nbsp;  since moving into so's home, she has tried to take over and control every aspect of the home. telling bil3 to clean his room and do his homework (he has parents for that, fuck off), yelling at everyone for the way they load the dishwasher (not your dishwasher, fuck off), and not letting anyone hang anything, coats, bags, whatever, from the kitchen chairs she brought over from her own house and insisted we use instead of the perfectly good ones that we already had (they are cheap and ugly, fuck off).  &amp;nbsp;  however, i don‚Äôt usually mind her. at least i didn't until she finally started ramping up her bullshit from mildly annoying to actually insane and just mean. she isn't a bad person, i don't think, but she's pretty selfish and has a painful lack of self-awareness. she is a constant victim, and if you confront her with any of her obvious fuckery, she becomes the victim and will literally cry upstairs for days at a time until you give her an apology. this has led to fil, as well as so, to have a complete inability sometimes to apologize for things they actually did wrong to anyone, because they become instantly defensive. it's irritating but nothing that can't be handled.  &amp;nbsp;  she loves me, funny enough, and probably because i first and foremost do not put up with anyone's bullshit and she knows it. i put up with a lot of hers for the sake of my so and his family, and i let a lot of it roll off my back. i really just hate the way she treats my mil. she has told me jokingly multiple times that she wouldn't want to get on my bad side. i replied ""aw, i don't bite, but why would you intentionally get on anyone's bad side, anyway?"" she didn‚Äôt even respond. i'm sassy as all get out, and she knows it, and due to my adhd my filter is at a constant low. whoops.  &amp;nbsp;  i think, because i've only been ""in the family"" for a short time, she's still love-bombing me to groom me for more heinous treatment in the future, but that remains to be seen. i've got a few gems coming up in the following posts. if you made it all the way to the end, thank you! i know it's a lot of text.  &amp;nbsp;  edit: formatting. i don't know wtf i'm doing.",1,,-1

*people died once they carried out their purpose.* that was it. that was the idea. with every new death that theory was cemented. painters would drop like flies after finishing their magnum opus. writers would collapse after sending in their final draft. but it was not only the art world that was dying. ordinary people followed. the most common reason for death was nicknamed the *""grandparent drop.""* it came right after a grandmother or a grandfather would hold their first grandchild in their arms. out came the baby, down went the grandparents. parents became so worried about their babies being the cause of the own parents' death that they would wait for years until grandchildren were presented to them. still, this common death managed to bring down the average lifespan of the entire human race by two decades.   even though illnesses vanished seemingly over night due to what was called ""purposeful death"" that did not mean children could no longer die. the most famous child death recorded was that of simon parker of leeds, england. he was eight years old when he had died. one cold winter night in november, due to faulty wiring, his house went up in flames. he and his parents had managed to get out safely but his baby sister was still stuck in the house. the parents were not worried about the baby, convinced that her purpose was not to die in the fire. however, that did not stop simon from running back into the house for his sister. he ran back out without a lick of burnt skin, handed his baby sister to a firefighter and collapsed dead. that was his one purpose, to save his sister from the fire.   a statue of his likeness was erected soon after. a reminder that someone could fulfill their purpose at any time and any where. old age no long seemed like a guarantee to anyone after that. anyone but to jay tuppens. when he had first read about simon's story he was only thirty-five and the idea of falling dead for the reason simon did scared him. but now, six hundred and thirty-eight years later, he was jealous of simon. what was even worse was that he had stopped aging at thirty-five. a few stark white hairs at the temples, a thinking line between the eyes,  two crow's feet and that was it. that was his aging. everywhere he looked, he saw people growing up. faces thinning, wrinkling. hair falling out or turning silver and then white. bellies sagging. liver spots appearing. things that people tried to cover up, he envied. every time he looked in the mirror, it was a cruel reminder that he was failing in life. everyone around him found their purpose. he could not. though he tried again and again. he had been a cop, a firefighter, a soldier, a sailor, a marine, a doctor, a teacher, a thief, a murderer, a husband, several husbands, a father over and over again, a writer, a singer, a hermit and a politician. everything and anything to find that one purpose. he even switched from religion to religion, becoming a priest, a rabbi and even a buddhist monk. and every morning he cursed anything that could be out there for his existence. he had turned to drugs, drinking and even suicide. but like all suicides before him, he woke up whole and healthy. death that way was not his purpose.   and that was the only thing he wanted these days. the end. for himself to drop dead.   he found himself wandering los angeles after quitting a job as an eod technician in syria. after being blown up eight times only to wake up naked, having his clothes incinerated, he left the job and moved back to california. los angeles had been the only spot on the planet that made him feel less like a freak than he thought he was. unlike the rest of the world, who lived to search for their purpose, no one in l.a. wanted to die. everyone wanted to be immortal. to live and be young and famous forever. people were always lying about their age. jay had met a man claiming to be over five hundred years old and not looking a day over twenty the other day. of course, jay knew he was lying. he had recognized the guy as a washed up child actor from an online webseries from a decade ago. oh, yeah, this guy was aging alright. could tell by the bad hair plug job and even worse botox injections. still, jay did not call him out. he liked being around other ""immortals.""   let them lie.   the bell chimed when jay walked into henny's diner. it was a faux greasy spoon that was made to look like a 1940's diner. all edward hopper's style. jay could point out all the mistakes the interior had. how the style was actually a mish-mash of jazz age and post-wwii 50's. after all, he lived through them. still he kept his mouth shut. at least they were trying.   ""tuppens!"" said a waitress with liberty rolls and heavy make-up. ""good morning. your usually cup of coffee?""  jay smiled and gave her a wink. ""straight black. no sugar. and, rosie, you got any of those glazed donuts today?""  ""louie just made batch. serve you one?""  ""make it two. i skipped dinner last night.""   he made his way to his usual booth at the end next to the jukebox when he passed a girl sitting at table with a deck of tarot cards fanned out. she looked like a hybrid of hippy and hipster with her hair shaved on one side and rolled into dreads on the other. tattoos covered up both arms. mostly of popculture figures. but a few jay had recognized as religious.   ""hey,"" jay pointed at an angel sigil on the girl's hand, ""i like that tattoo. what is that? gabriel's symbol?""  the girl grabbed jay's wrist. she lifted her head. her eyes were wide and blood shot like she had not slept for decades. jay tried to pull himself free but she held on tighter.   ""jason tuppens? are you jason tuppens?"" her voice came out as a desperate croak.   ""jay."" he yanked back harder but she held on. ""let go, lady. what is it to you?""  the girl let go and grabbed a bag from the empty seat next to her. she opened it and took out a small, cloth covered box. ""three hundred and eighty-nine years. that's how long i have been looking for you. three hundred and eighty-nine years. they told me i couldn't rest until i found you.""  ""who told you that?""  ""the others. the others like yourself. the real immortals. not like the phony ones here. they wouldn't let me die until i found you. made that my purpose."" she took the box into her hands and shoved it into jay's belly. ""here. take it, please!""   jay wrapped his hands around it, unsure what it was. for the first time in decades he felt a little fear. the girl began to cackle as she scooted back in her seat. she rose to her feet and stared at the ceiling.   ""i did it! did you see that, you bastards? it's delivered. now let me-""  she gasped. her body froze, twitched and collapsed into a pile on the floor.   she was dead.  jay jumped back. no matter how many times he witnessed someone fulfilling their purpose and falling dead, he could never get used to it.   ""rosie, you have a *dropper*!""  rosie stuck her head out from the kitchen where she had gone to get donuts.   she frowned. ""aw, shit,"" she let it slip before turning bright red at her own foul mouth. ""sorry, but that has been the third *dropper* this week and it's only tuesday. what is about this place that makes it people's purpose. what did this one do?""  jay held up the package. ""she gave me this box.""  ""what's in the box?""  ""i don't know.""  ""well, open it and find out. see what she died for.""  jay walked up to the diner counter with the box. he settled it down and with a moment of hesitation, took off the top. rosie came over and the two of them peered in. a gold envelope with a red seal rested on the inside. jay took it out. rosie handed him a butter knife. he used it to tear it open and poured the contents out on the counter. a card made out of stiffened cream colored silk fell out. jay picked it up and flipped it over.   ""it's an invitation,"" he said reading the lettering.  ""from whom and to where?""  ""the heavenly hosts. at the vatican. they want to see me.""  ""i've never heard of them.""  ""neither have i. but that girl said she had been looking for me for over three centuries and now she's dead. if they gave her a purpose, perhaps they could give me one.""  ""so, you're going?""  ""for a chance to finally end it all?"" jay smiled. ""you better make those doughnuts and that coffee to go.""",1,,-1

683633,"okay, here's my report (not that there's much interest):  we have about six hospitals within 30 minutes driving time from my house, so i decided to take him to children's hospital, as they're set up for (duh) children. we arrived at 9:15 am our time, and had a short discussion with the admitting clerk. there was no line, and she simply asked name, age, and site of injury, then directed us to the clerk who would take more information.  he was just finishing up with a patient and his mother, and we sat down immediately. i didn't have my son's medical card, but had phoned his mom for the number, but this wasn't needed, as he had all the information on the computer based on the name.  i filled out a short form describing the accident (where, when, what happened, safety equipment being used, adult supervision, etc). this took five minutes, and then we were asked to sit in the waiting area until our names were called.  wait #1 - the waiting areas are broken up into a number of separate rooms. in ours, there were three other families waiting. one looked like a skateboarding injury, and i have no idea what was wrong with other kids.  we waited for about fifteen minutes watching *lady and the tramp* and listening to a dad humming to his sleeping baby. then our names were called, and the boy's weight and height were measured, and a nurse asked for more details about where it hurt, what position the arm was in when hurt, etc. then back to the waiting area.  wait #2: after twenty minutes, we were called again. the nurse asked us to follow the baby footprints on the floor to radiology, where we would have x-rays taken of the arm. off we went and had a seat outside radiology.   wait #3: a newborn baby with a foot deformity was being x-rayed, and we had to wait until they disassembled whatever infant-x-raying setup they had. lots of clanking and clattering behind closed doors, then a team of nurses wheeled out the infant, and we were ushered in. three x-rays taken, total time in radiology, fifteen minutes.  wait #4, back to the waiting room. i dashed out to the bathroom and to grab a cappuccino in the main lobby. we wait for another twenty-five minutes while the x-rays are processed and examined by two radiologists and an attending physician.  wait #5: we are asked to go to an examination room, where we wait for ten minutes. a friendly doctor pops in and says that it doesn't look like a fracture, but wants to examine where it hurts. the boy demonstrates, and the doctor leaves to re-examine the x-rays. he is back almost immediately, confirms no break, wraps the wrist, and explains what to do to treat it. we are given our forms describing treatment, and we head for the car.  then we go for lunch, and then grocery shopping (hence the delay in reporting, sorry).  total time at the hospital - about two hours.  number of forms filled out - a 1 page form about the accident.  total cost out of pocket - 0 for medical services, five bucks for parking, four bucks for a fancy coffee.  cost of services provided - i have no idea, this is never discussed.  so there you have it. i'd be happy to answer any questions.  **[edit]** - well crap. the attending physician just called, and said that another radiologist reinspected the x-ray, and they think that they've found a small fracture. so he's going back in to get a cast, but his mom's taking him this time. no lineup, just straight in. they say. we'll see.  **[update]** - they didn't lie. straight in, straight to the examination room where a half cast was made and he was splinted. so add one hour overall.",0,,

796358,"&gt;i think you are confused by the term parasite. in a biological frame of reference it refers to an organism that lives in or on another being deriving sustenance and shelter from it while providing no benefit to the host. you are referring to social parasitism which, while sharing some attributes, is not the same thing.  actually, i do think an infant could be described as a parasite in the biological sense.  like other mammals, human babies have evolved to obtain their sustenance *directly* from the mother during the period after birth while their digestive tracks are still developing, at the same time providing no real benefit to the mother.   it is only recently in the history of humanity that we have moved away so dramatically from breastfeeding (to the detriment of our children), but it is still widely practiced at least in the early stages of infancy.  just because, through our ingenuity, we have created ways to alter this relationship, does not mean that infants were not ""meant"" to have a biologically-based parasitic-like relationship with their mothers during the early stages after birth.  social parasitism, i think, also has a place in this discussion because, in the case of the infant/mother (caregiver) relationship especially, the outcomes are very similar.  if the infant is strictly bottle-fed, it may not meet the definition of a biological parasite since it does not feed directly off its host.  however, the caregiver must still feed it by some means, as well as provide shelter and perhaps some extent of nurturing beyond the very minimum.  but the food given to the child is food that the caregiver cannot consume herself.  the personal energy used to prepare food, prepare shelter and perhaps nurture the child is energy that cannot go to the caregiver to sustain her own life.  the other external resources used in the care of the child are resources that cannot be used to the benefit of the caregiver.  raising an infant removes resources and energy from the caregiver as surely as if they had been drawn directly from her body.  and the outcome to the infant if these resources are denied is the same as if it were still in the womb: death.  &gt;also, you are completely ignoring one of my points:  &gt;   "" ...but it does not require its mother any longer, simply an accessible source of food.""  &gt;this is the only function this caregiver provides to make the newborn capable of surviving. if it is elsewhere provided, there is no need. i admit that this is unlikely, but not impossible. that is however, the definition of capable of surviving from a biological standpoint.  i apologize; i did not think i was ignoring this point, but perhaps i don't fully understand what you are attempting to imply. are you trying to say that it is possible for a newborn to survive without a caregiver?  because i would have to disagree with this premise.  a newborn child absolutely needs the intervention of an adult human (or, i suppose in ridiculously extreme circumstances, an adult mammal) in order to survive.  first of all, its food has to be prepared, whether automatically by the caregiver's body, or otherwise through the creation of formulas, since a newborn cannot effectively ingest or digest unprocessed plant or animal matter.  then there is the problem of the infant actually accessing the prepared food.  it cannot move to the food source on its own; the infant must either be brought to the food, or the food brought to the infant.  therefore, a caregiver is required in the definition of ""an accessible source of food"" for a newborn.  then, the infant must also be sheltered or it will die of exposure.  again, the newborn cannot find shelter on its own in the first months after birth, so it must either be brought to shelter, or shelter must be brought to the infant.  a newborn requires two of the most basic necessities for life (food and shelter) that it cannot possibly obtain on its own.  if a newborn meets the definition of ""capable of surviving from a biological standpoint"", then why not an unborn child?  the situations seem very similar: both must be provided with food and shelter, since neither can obtain these necessities by their own power.  and the significant point with respects to the definition of personhood should not be *who* provides the necessities, but the fact that in both situations these things must absolutely must be provided.  i hope this speaks more to your point?  &gt;this guesswork is the best we can do at the moment however, as even some very premature babies survive, and some carried to full term do not. we do not have the knowledge to make this distinction beyond generalizations at the moment.  no arguments here.  it definitely would be a whole lot easier to make decisions if we had a full understanding of the topic.  i guess the most that can be asked is that we all try to make the best decisions possible based on the information we do have available.      &gt;conflict is one of the best sources of knowledge; i hope you've learned something along the way, as i have. :)  most definitely.  i am usually wary of debates over highly contentious subjects since they tend to devolve rather quickly, and it's always refreshing when one does not turn out this way.  and i agree: conflict/debate is a great learning opportunity.  i have enjoyed our discussion as well :)",0,,

764944,"born in my dad's car. parents divorced a year later, dad leaving mom with nothing. grew up on welfare in the projects with a depressed mother who was not equipped to give any kind of emotional support or much attention at all to a child who also had depression. sexually abused at around 3 by teenage female babysitter. abused again at around 7 by dad's gf's son who was my age. school was traumatic. mom took in my sister's kids (sister being 15 years my senior), further creating distance between mom and i. school was even more traumatic. bullied. couldn't concentrate. failed everything. held back 7th grade (but met my bff/platonic soulmate that year, so best thing to happen). continuous weight gain from 5th grade on. depression and anxiety worsened as puberty developed. regular anxiety attacks. increasingly bad health. chronic pain from nerve damage (from celiac disease, it turns out). quit going to school in 9th grade for self preservation. forced into juvie for a week for truancy. managed to get past the system. agoraphobic/total shut-in for the next 6 or 7 years. at 19 mom and i moved in with abusive, narcissistic grandmother due to financial stress and mom was already her caregiver. after a couple years of that hell i finally had enough. i dropped 75 pounds. i had a pen pal in brooklyn who had a place for me until i got on my feet, so i took what little money i had and shipped some of my things over and got on a plane and left, even though i had spent the last 6 years not leaving the house. she turned out to be a nutcase. i had no job experience, little education, no money. i tried out the nanny thing. not a good idea. after a few months of hell and near homelessness, i got a job at a phone sex line located in midtown manhattan. then i found a place to live with a really fucking weird jewish dude in his early 50's in a shitty run-down railroad apartment in brooklyn. he had lived there his entire life and had a bit of a hoarding problem. not so much obsessive, just lazy with a sprinkle of ""that might be useful at some point"". i lived there for about two years until he brought in bed bugs (street furniture) and refused to do anything about it. i dated a ton. really tried to force myself to be social and outgoing. at some point i quit the office phone gig for an at home phone gig because i kept getting strep and bronchitis at the office. then i moved in with my punk rock princess former coworker in a much nicer neighborhood. we shared a brownstone that her friend owned that used to be her grandparents house. she was a hardcore party girl. people were over constantly. she was an alcoholic and i developed a very bad weed problem. had a shit ton of fun, met cool people. the friendship turned toxic and that was the end of that. found an awesome basement apt with the chillest bulgarian roomie, had a great time for a good 6 months. landlord ended up being major creepy with me as the target, insisted i leave for no good reason. got fed up of insecure living situations and at that point mom needed help as she could no longer work and grandma was in nursing home, so i decided to move back home. grandmas house was taken by medicaid or whatever to pay for her care. she almost immediately dies after. mom and i find an apartment together. i support her 100% until she gets ssi/ssd (not a lot, but it helps). our relationship is considerably better now, though she gets on my nerves. i still do the phone gig. health is still shit, too much damage done. no social life, but having avoidant personality disorder, it barely bothers me. at this point i'm pretty comfortable with my weirdness. but i do miss ny a lot, just not the cost of living or the shit living situations.",1,,-2

768854,"you can pick a few verses either way and take it literally (like the atheist site does - interesting because usually they are on the attack when it comes to ""literalism"" but here they decide to take the literal position like ""the word abortion never appears""); or you can understand the hebrew or greek language and come to a conclusion about some general views and principals about life.  most of the link was lifted from:  http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/abortion.php  since they are using the bible to support their conclusions, here is the other side of thought:  uses of phrases ""human"" or ""human being""      1. uses ""man, woman, child, son, daughter, baby etc.""     2. since these terms are used for unborn children, then we have evidence that human life is present before birth      3. the bible makes no distinction of any kind in the terms used to describe a fetus.      4. body without spirit is dead: jas 2:26      5. the blood is the life: deut 12:23 fetus has bloodstream at 4 weeks    b.

424225,"&gt;ew, diapers? gross  of course i wipe my own ass. but i wouldn't want to wipe my so's ass, my mother's ass, my father's ass, or anyone else's ass. in fact, i don't particularly even enjoy wiping my own ass as much as i don't want to face the consequences of *not* wiping my ass. i do it out of necessity. if i actually *wanted* a child, i'd have to wipe it's ass out of necessity too, but *i don't fucking want a child.* and wiping it's ass doesn't rank as a top ten reason for why i don't want kids anyhow.  &gt;i hate kids  eh. i don't particularly *hate* kids. i also don't particularly *like* them either. babies and toddlers are far too annoying for me to handle, and no i highly doubt that the child being mine would make any difference. in fact, it'd probably be worse.  &gt;i just don‚Äôt see the appeal  still don't see the appeal. and in fact, if i hadn't seen evidence that some kind of a ""new baby"" and ""baby breath"" smell *does* actually exist, i'd still believe it's 100% bullshit. i've held newborns and young babies. never noticed any scents about them other than when they get around to shitting their pants. now, puppy breath on the other hand, i *can* smell. and puppies are still cute as they go through their own toddler-child-teenager-adult-elderly stages. unlike babies, that really don't start to have any sort of appeal to me until they're seven or eight years old and start resembling an actual human.  &gt;only egomaniacs have kids  nah. i mean, i think egomaniacs are *more likely* to have kids, but not all parents are egomaniacs. lots of them are though. and having kids is most certainly *not* the ""most human thing you can do."" see to me, the most human thing you can do is something that *only* humans are capable of doing. everything... literally *every* organism is capable of some form of reproduction. also, studies suggest that *sex* is actually the biological urge, not babies, and evolution literally had to *trick* us into having babies by tricking us into having more sex.  &gt;i‚Äôm too selfish  in some ways, i totally am. i'd really prefer a bottle of jack to a bottle of formula, and if i don't *have* to change a diaper i'm not fucking going to. i wouldn't be so good at buying my kid toys and shit when there's stuff that i need and want. as far as feeding my kid - well everyone always says shit like ""you'll figure it out."" dude. that is a *moronic* way to go about raising kids. kids deserve to know that there's gonna be dinner on the table - and dinner isn't gonna be a stale box of cereal with no milk because mom can't afford groceries or forgot to go shopping. my fictional kid deserves better than that - and so do your *real* ones.  &gt;the world is overpopulated  even if it's an issue of quality over quantity... my kid will probably be nothing spectacular. i mean, i think i'm a pretty awesome person but i'm not gonna be winning any important prizes in the near future. even if i do somehow manage to pull an olympic medal out of my ass, or a rolex win, 99.8% of the human population will have no fucking clue about it anyhow. eventing isn't exactly an *important* or *well watched* sport compared to other olympic sports. and even so... who really gives a fuck anyhow?

355451,"&gt;i don't personally hold that infants or humans have an inherent right to life. we treat each other as such in order to live better lives with less violence. i might have a right to life but only as long as you give me that right. social contract is good stuff.  so you do believe that we have a right to life? first you say there is no right to life, then you say that there is a right to life via social contract, interest-based human rights theory. it doesn't matter what the source of the right is, but rather whether you believe human beings should be protected from the infringement upon their right to live.   &gt;we usually prescribe being human with being a fully developed adult.   no, we don't. babies are human, infants are human, mentally handicapped people are human, people born with deformities are human, crazy people are human. nobody defines ""being human"" as ""being a fully developed adult"". i was a *human* child. i was a *human* infant. i am a *human* adult.  &gt;we recognize that not all ""humans"" are completely human despite being organisms. for example children, infants and fetuses.  i have never heard anyone say that children and infants are not completely human. i'll at least give you kudos for being consistent with that much, but that notion is, frankly, repulsive to me and probably to most people. what you are implying with that statement is that somehow infants and children are subhuman. i hope you also understand the implications of that classification; do such ""organisms"" have the same human rights, including a right to life? they are wholly unable to enter into a social contract, and certainly they are so weak compared to you that you could visit violence upon them with absolutely no fear of direct retort. but hopefully you will acknowledge that killing newborns and infants is not permissible because they are, undeniably, human beings with human rights.  &gt;there are other characteristics such as empathy, self awareness, the ability to reason for example. so just because you have human dna doesn't make you human or prescribe you ""rights"".   actually, it does. your human rights are not based on your empathy, self-awareness, ability to reason, appearance, capability or any of those things. your human rights are based on the fact that you are human, and insofar as human rights apply to all humans regardless of age, mental or physical status, or appearance, such rights can very accurately be attributed or at least bestowed on a person by virtue of the fact that they are alive and that they are a human organism.  &gt;why should catholic religious dogma define when life begins  it doesn't. birth is one, somewhat less grey point in human development, but there is a far less grey point in human development. a fetus can be ""born"" and survive with medical support over a nearly 20 week range in its development, and this is only with current technology (the future likely holds even greater strides in ex utero fetal viability). the brightline i refer to is of course, conception. in fact, this is the point when life begins, from a strictly scientific point of view. every human organism, indeed every living organism, starts off from a single cell. two gametes (sex cells) fuse to form a single cell of a new, unique, living human organism. before, there is no organism, now there is a new one. this is far more binary than birth, for which labor can be induced or premature, caesarean sectioned, etc independently of the age of the fetus, which can range quite wildly in practice.   why do you feel a need to discriminate based on what the human organism looks like or what it is capable of except to deprive it of certain rights? you seem to have an almost obsessive desire to categorize yellow from green to separate human from subhuman based on arbitrary, subjective distinctions. is it wrong for me to point out that such discriminations are exactly what our rights are supposed to protect us from? yellow and green are not the same; neither are white and black, healthy and disabled, smart and dumb, yet we rightly consider the people who make similar distinctions you wish to make (if we draw the line here, we can call these people human and these people not) people guilty of injustice and reprehensible prejudices.   your argument, if i break it down into a simpler version, is quite simply this: ""i arbitrarily define humanity as green and fetus as yellow. yellow is not green, therefore a fetus is not a human. why can't you see this?"" sorry, but real arguments do not work that way, and no matter how much you dress it up, your distinction is still based on a purely subjective distinction between a fetus and a human. you appeal to a distinction between yellow and green (which i acknowledge is true) to a distinction between human and fetus. but why should the distinction between colors be applicable at all to humanity? i ask you: ""what makes a fetus not a human?"" you reply ""well, silly, fetuses are yellow and humans are green, and yellow is not green."" i then ask, ""well, what makes one green and the other yellow rather than green as well?"" and you might tell me that humanity is a spectrum varying from conception to adulthood based on rational ability or appearance or some other completely arbitrary criteria. can i ask why that is a valid criteria for humanness from a rights theory perspective? it is not inane, it is insane. nobody sees human beings in this way, at least not any sane person. black people are green, white people are green, mentally disabled people are green, infants are green, toddlers are green, adults are green (insofar as human rights are concerned in this nation). why are fetuses yellow? you have completely failed to answer this question, i hope you can realize this. there is, however, an obvious, rational, scientifically undeniable brightline for the origin of the human organism. why must you insist on the arbitrary distinction between fetus and human, except for the express purpose of justifying abortion? think about it.  &gt;hopefully even if you disagree with me on the abortion issue you can at least see my logic behind my decision  hopefully in retrospect you can see that there is no real logical substance behind your decision, it is in fact, upon breaking it down, an empty syllogism that begs the question based on your preconceived and arbitrary distinctions.  &gt;like i said it's hard to tell even the smallest of children that you chopped down a tree when all you did was crush an acorn under your shoe.   it is somewhat ironic that now you are referring to the least rational, subhuman ""organism"" (in your estimation) for verification of your rational distinctions. the smallest of children will also tell me that 1+1 = 11 and that santa claus is real; certainly they don't understand that every tree begins its life as a single cell, then as an embryo living within a seed, and that while it certainly changes in size and shape and appearance and function, the tall tree was and is the one and same organism as when it was contained in an acorn on the ground. but we do understand that. we also understand, in ways children do not, that human beings actually have rights. we understand that our children have rights in ways they cannot themselves comprehend. this may be a stretch for you, but most people actually consider their children to be human beings, and as such believe their children have human rights as well. there are even those who believe that all human beings have rights, that are universal and unalienable, and that such rights, ""human rights"", are applicable to all humans, young or old, black or white, disabled or able-bodied, fetus, infant or adult. religion has nothing to do with it. the liberties of others should be limited, because the liberty to terminate the life of another human being is not within the scope of permissible liberties. the life of a human being can be defined secularly, invariably, and definitively by scientific means, which illustrate for us the precise moment of the genesis of the human organism.",1,1,

933036,"&gt;i would say most of the difference is caused by the infant mortality rate.  it's not just infant mortality. any ""early"" death, whether in infancy, childhood, teen years, young adulthood, etc -- significantly affects the ""average"".  let's say we have a family with a nice round 10 kids.  one dies within months after birth, another in ""infancy"" shortly after turning a year old, a third dies at age 5, another at age 10, the fifth at age 15 -- the other five all live not only to become full adults, but they live ""long"" full adult lives, dying at approximately 5 year intervals between the ages of 60 to 80.  (so we would have a data set of ages that went: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80.)  the ""average"" lifespan of that family of 10 kids would be 38.1 years -- but none of them -- not a single one -- actually died at anywhere around age 38 years.  if you average out those who survived to ""full adulthood"" (in this case pick whatever ""age of adulthood"" you want, whether it is 18, or 21, or whatever) and the ""average"" (and ""median"" in this case) lifespan is not 38 years, but rather 70 years (give or take 5 to 10 years).  &gt;this longer life statistic is more rightwing think tank bullshit.   no, it really isn't.    while some people have always lived to those ages, they tended to be the exceptions.  it is not that people are living significantly longer lives (we don't have anyone living to 150 years) -- rather it is that more people are living long enough to reach retirement; and then more people are living more years in retirement.  take that age array i setup above -- that would probably be a fairly valid ""mix"" of ages for a family of siblings that were born and died in the 19th century.  by the early 20th century, the infant and child deaths would probably have been a lower, probably 2 out of the 10 would not have reached adulthood (rather than 5 of 10); and of the other 3 (the ones who would have previously died in infancy/childhood/teen years) they very likely would have lived *into* adulthood, but probably would not have reached what we call ""retirement"" age (instead dying in their 30's, 40's or 50's).  fast forward to people born in the mid 20th century, and in all likelihood 9 or even 10 out of those 10 kids will likely survive to full adulthood (cf the [cdc data](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4838a2.htm) you cited), and moreover, 7 or more likely 8 of them will live not only *into* adulthood, but long enough to reach ""retirement"" age, and even live a few years *in* retirement.    so, for the 20th century sets; rather than 3 of 8 full adults (and only 3 of 10 siblings) collecting ""benefits"" of the first cohort, we are likely to have 7 of 8 adults collecting at least *some* retirement benefits; and then most of them living an additional year, or two, or five.  and you have to remember that if the median age of death *in retirees* changes from 70 to 75, that means the bulk of people rather than collecting 5 years of benefits (from 65 to 70) will be collecting twice as much, 10 years worth (from 65 to 75); if the median/bulk of them gain an extra 5 years on top of that and live to approximately 80 years, then they will be ""retired"" and collecting benefits for three times as long (and thus need 3x the benefits).  toss in that the subsequent ""supporting generations"" are smaller in size, and the burden of taxation has to grow, not just 2x or 3x, buy manifold.  and [that is exactly what already happened -- a 15x increase in taxation](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/taxrates.html) **and it happened from 1950 to 1990** (under both ""left-wing"" as well as ""right-wing"" administrations).  now the problem is... that was what was necessary to pay for the previous (smaller) generations of retirees.    we now face a generational-inversion, a huge ""bulge"" of people hitting retirement, and who are expected to live in retirement for *at least* as many years as the recent prior generation (i.e. to a median age of ~80), with at least the *possibility* of even longer lives (and with increased medical ""wonders"" probably far higher medical costs to do so).  but conversely, the ""supporting generations"" are even smaller in total size relative to the size of the retiring generation. (iow it was one thing for the baby boom to pay for the smaller ""silent"" generation, it is quite another thing for genx to pay for the baby boom).  the taxation really *cannot* be increased by the ratio that would be needed (what are you going to do? take a 15% payroll tax rate and triple it to 45%? and then expect to take out income, sales, property and other taxes out of the remaining 55% of their paychecks as well? in order to prevent old people from becoming ""impoverished"" you're instead going to *try* to impoverish the entire following generation or two?  note i said ""try""... because that won't work, open rebellion would occur first.)  ---  *and i know your ""solution"" is simple: soak the rich.* but that has never worked either (besides on a societal basis, most of the ""riches"" are actually owned by the ""old"" people you claim to be so worried about).  the plain truth is that social security -- as the system has been constructed (with no ""means testing"", etc) -- was always dependent upon a pyramid of generations. there was no way it (or any other such broad taxation-redistribution system) was ever going to be able to be sustained if/when a demographic inversion took place.",0,,

after all, it's been noted that removing the labia and clitoral hood reduces smegma and enhances hygiene.*  just think about that for a while.  &gt; **occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis may be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).**  there are [2 types of phimosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777539-overview) (also, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/ahawi/i_am_an_uncircumcised_21_year_old_who_never/c0hkc5g)):  * **physiologic**: when boys are born, their penises are immature; the foreskin is fused to the head of the penis (ripping them apart is the first step of neonatal circumcision).  * **pathologic (genuine problem)**: the foreskin becomes unretractable after it was already retractable; this usually happens because the preputial orifice (the ""opening"") becomes scarred and therefore too inelastic.  according to a [2-year study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119091453/abstract):   &gt; the incidence of pathological phimosis in boys was 0.4 cases/1000 boys per year, or 0.6% of boys affected by their 15th birthday  ooooh! big problem!  it gets more interesting, though:  &gt; \[which is\] a value... exceeded more than eight-fold by the proportion of english boys currently circumcised for 'phimosis'.  that means a lot of boys are being circumcised for a condition they don't actually have.  sadly, american doctors have been traditionally ignorant for most of the last century about *physiologic* phimosis, so many boys have been wrongly diagnosed with *pathologic* phimosis and subsequently referred for circumcision unnecessarily.  worse, it's been the advice (until the near past) of numerous american medical organizations and child-rearing resources that parents forcibly retract the foreskin in order to prevent the normal adhesions of physiologic phimosis. however, this forcible retraction rips the foreskin from the head of the penis, which can result in scarring that induces *pathologic* phimosis; the wounded foreskin and head can actually heal together again, which is why it was advised to perform this forcible retraction at each washing, thereby compounding the problem.  furthermore, many legitimate cases could probably be resolved with a few months of stretching (perhaps with steroidal ointment). surgically, preputioplasty is popular in europe and much less invasive than circumcision.  did you know that women get phimosis too? their clitoral hoods are too tight to allow their clitorises to engorge fully and they can similarly suffer from infections as a result.  &gt; **this can also lead to inflammation of the head of the penis.**  this is called [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/), and it occurs in circumcised males as well; it can be caused by excessive washing (especially when an abrasive soap is used), suggesting that over-zealous parents might be causing some portion of cases.  &gt; **decreased risk of penile cancer. although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men.**  again, look at absolute risk.  according to the american academy of pediatrics (same link):  &gt; cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the united states.\[91\]  in countries where the overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of penile cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in denmark\[92\] to 2.9 to 6.8 per 100 000 in brazil93  and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in india.\[94\]  &gt; ...  &gt; an annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases of penile cancer per year per 1 million men. although the risk of developing penile cancer in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is increased more than threefold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies.  there is evidence that the ""benefit"" of circumcision in the case of penile cancer is only conferred to men circumcised in infancy, and there is a strong link between hpv infection of the penis and penile cancer. therefore, it's pretty clear that preventing penile cancer (already an extremely rare disease) is really a matter of preventing a sexual disease that is known to cause cancer: then, why not use the much cheaper and far less invasive approach of pushing safe sexual practices, which must be done anyway.  &gt; **decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases. safe sexual practices remain essential, but circumcised men may have a slightly lower risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases ‚Äî including hiv, the virus that causes aids.**  please [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9rvgf/pascals_wager_again_quite_a_nice_comic/c0e5kjy).  in particular, note:  * [this recent 30-year study in new zealand](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=abstract) reported results that are ""consistent with recent population-based cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce the risk of the common stis in the general population in such countries.""  * [in this recent study out of south africa](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490f-44f5-ac5e-17893a3764ba.asp) modeled various means of preventing hiv, and made the following conclusion about circumcision: ""we were surprised by how little effect it had""; condoms and treatment availability were forecast to be 20x more effective and cheaper. and that's where the hiv prevalence is [11% overall (16% in some parts and upwards of 30% in some age groups)](http://www.avert.org/safricastats.htm)! how much of an effect would circumcision have in the u.s. where the prevalence is *0.6%* (of sexually active adults)?  * of the 0.6% of sexually active u.s. citizens who are infected with hiv, *over half* are men who have sex with men (gays/bisexuals), for whom circumcision has been shown to be useless in a number of studies. a large chunk more of hiv positive individuals are users of intravenous drugs. **the point is that there is a very narrow population that is at risk, so it's insane to target the general population of infants who won't be having sex for nearly 2 decades.**  the circumcision of a *healthy* child is plain genital mutilation and child abuse.",0,,

[skipping a few paragraphs]   century after century of battered children grew up and battered their own children in turn.  john milton's wife complained that she hated to hear the cries of his nephews as he beat them.  beethoven whipped his piano pupils with a knitting needle.  even royalty was not exempt - little louis xiii was whipped upon awakening for his previous day's misdemeanours...   ...an early american mother wrote of her battle with her four month old infant: ""i whipped him 'til he was actually black and blue, and until i _could not_ whip him any more, and he never gave one single inch""   if the newborn was allowed to live, parents would salt it and then bathe it in ice water to ""harden"" it.  the baby was tied up tightly in swaddling bands for it's first year, supposedly to prevent it from tearing off its ears, breaking its legs, touching its genitals or crawling around like an animal.  traditional swaddling, as one american doctor described it, ""consists of entirely depriving the child of the use of its limbs by enveloping them in an endless bandage, so as to not unaptly resemble billets of wood, and by which the skin is sometimes excoriated, the flesh compressed, almost to gangrene"".  [that's just gotta be great for neuron development and motor skills]   swaddled infants were not only more convenient to care for, since they withdrew into themselves in sleep most of the day, but were also more easily laid for hours behind hot ovens, hung on pegs on the wall, and, wrote one doctor, 'left like a parcel, in every convenient corner.'. in addition, they were often thrown around like a ball for amusement. in 16th century france, a brother of henry iv, while being tossed from one window to another, was dropped and killed.  doctors complained of parents who broke the bones of their children in the ""customary"" tossing of infants.  nurses often said that the stays that encased children beneath their swaddling bands were necessary, because they √£could not be tossed around without them'   adults, in the past, like contemporary child batterers, regularly succumbed to urges to mutilate, burn, freeze and drown infants.  the huns used to cut the cheeks of newborn males, italian renaissance parents would ""burn the neck with a hot iron, or else drop a burning wax candle on newborn babies, and it was common to cut the string under the newborns tongue, often with the midwife's fingernail"".  in every age, the deliberate mutilation of children's bones and faces prepared them for a lifetime of begging.   as late as the 19th century in eastern europe, baptism was not a matter of simple sprinkling, but an ice water ordeal that lasted for hours and sometimes caused the death of the infant.  the regular practice of the plunge bath involved nearly drowning the infant over and over again in ice cold water, 'with it's mouth open and gasping for breath'.  the dipping of infants in cold rivers has been considered therapeutic since roman times, and as late as the 19th century, children were often put to bed wrapped in cold wet towels to make them hardy.  [article now comments that most children from middle and upper class homes were sent away to be wet nursed, looked after by servants, then sent away to school, and most kept at home were never breast fed]    one 15th century mother who had moved from an area in which nursing infants was common was called 'swinish and filthy' by her bavarian neighbours for nursing her child herself, and her husband threatened to stop eating if she did not give up this √£disgusting habit'.  ...the long struggle against infanticide.  in antiquity, infanticide was so common that every river, dung heap and cesspool used to be littered with dead infants.  polybius blamed the depopulation of greece on the killing of legitimate children, even by wealthy parents. ratios of boys to girls in census figures ran four to one, since it was rare for more than one girl in a family to be spared.    as late as 1527, one priest admitted that ""the latrines resound with the cries of children who have been plunged into them"".    terrors of the night  ... children were often felt to be on the verge of turning into actual demons, or at least to be easily susceptible to √£the power of the devil'.  to keep their small devils cowed, parents regularly terrorized them with a vast army of ghostlike figures, from the lamia and striga of the ancients, who ate children raw, to the witches of medieval times, who would steal bad children away and suck their blood.  one 19th century tract described in simplified language the tortures god had in store for children in hell : 'the little child is in this red hot oven.  hear how it screams to come out.  it stamps its little feet on the floor'.  [now _that's_ religion]   the need to personify punitive figures was so powerful that this terrorizing of children did not stop at imaginary figures.  dummies were actually made up to be used in frightening children.  one english writer in 1748 describes how 'the nurse tales a fancy to quiet the peevish child, and with this intent makes it come in, and roar and scream at the child in ugly disagreeable notes, which grate upon the tender organs of the ear, and at the same time, by its gestures and near approach, makes as if it would swallow the infant up'.   [here comes the fun part, kiddies]   another method that parents used to terrorize their children employed corpses.  a common moral lesson involved taking children to visit the gibbet, where they were forced to inspect rotting corpses hanging there as an example of what happens to bad children when they grow up. whole classes were taken out of school to witness hangings, and parents would often whip their children afterwards to make them remember what they had seen.    sexual abuse  the sexual abuse of children was also far more prevalent in the past than it is today.  growing up in greece and rome often included being used sexually by older men.  boy brothels flourished in every city in antiquity, and slave boys were commonly kept for sexual use.  sexual abuse by pedagogues and teachers of small children was a common complaint, and even aristotle thought that adult homosexuality must be a result of 'those who are abused from childhood'.   erotic drawings often show nude children waiting in adults in sexual embrace, and quintilian said that even noble children √£hear us use such words, they see our mistresses and minions, every dinner part is loud with fouls songs, and things are presented to their eyes of which we should blush to speak'  tiberius taught children of the most tender years, whom he called his little fishes, to play between his legs while he was in his bath.  those which had not yet been weaned but were strong and healthy he set at fellatio. [mind the teething!] castrated children were considered as especially arousing in antiquity, and infants were often castrated in the cradle for use in the brothel.   the sexual abuse of children continued until early modern times. servants were commonly known to be child molesters, and even parents would masturbate their children √£to make their yards grow longer'. little louis xiii was often hauled into bed by his parents and others and involved in their sexual acts...   ...by the 19th century parents and doctors began waging a frenzied campaign against childhood masturbation, threatening to cut off the child's genitals, performing circumcision and clitoridectomy without anaesthesia as punishment, making children wear spiked cages and other restraints, and opening anti-masturbation sanatoria all over europe.  end quoting",1,1,

491296,"&gt;wait. how is it outrageous for a parent to monitor a child's sexual behavior?   a parents job is to produce an adult.  stripping autonomy from any human being is terribly destructive.  &gt;there's nothing inherently wrong with a lot of things that parents ""control"" - as part of the job description of being parents.  in most cases parents are well-informed in their control.  in sexuality, they are not.  they are imbeciles when it comes to sexuality due to the culture they were raised in.  you want proof of just how harmful their idiocy and ignorance of child sexuality is?  studies have shown parents getting their children put on heavy-duty anti-seizure medications because they can't comprehend that their child is masturbating.  these parents are so profoundly damaged and neurotic that when the doctors told these parents that their child was normal and was simply masturbating, the parents flipped out and demanded that the doctors classify their children as victim of a 'movement disorder'.  they would rather their child have a disorder than masturbate.  that's fucked up.  that's harmful.  in general, control is harmful by itself.  control can be beneficial, such as preventing a child from running into the street into traffic.  but the limitation of autonomy amplifies the destructive nature of any negative consequence derived from an action someone is forced to take.  &gt;in our society, we've decided that age is 18.   but we did not do so by considering any sort of scientific information.  we did not do so by examining the consequences of our actions, or by attempting to create the best environment for children and adolescents.  we did it for mostly political reasons, and pretending like we haven't learned anything in the past few decades of research is simply cruel.  parents don't have the last word on any of the things you pointed out, actually.  the kids do.  they always do, because they are the only ones physically capable of actually partaking or abstaining from every single thing you listed.  whether you like it or not, parents can only provide advisory capacity.  it has been shown, time and again, that it is the parents who try to practice complete abstinence and enforced ignorance that end up with all of the parents on 16 and pregnant.  the parents that teach their kids about sex, educate their kids on how to have safe sex, and allow their kids to pursue meaningful relationships in adolescence are the ones not having babies at 16.  sex can be complicated and have terrible consequences, especially in our society.  take a look at that.  does having a baby at 16 *have to* be a life-destroying event?  why did we design our society so that it is?  why do we put up with a society in which we have to suffer through adolescence starved of affection, pretending that puberty is some sort of... what?  an evolutionary deathtrap meant to extinct the human race that can only be dodged by moralistic crusaders forcing everyone to put on pants and not have kids until just before the birth defect rate starts to skyrocket?  &gt;kids will absolutely discover their own sexuality; a good parent will help them along the way, and a really good parent will talk to them about the importance of boundaries and timing.  i agree with you completely.  a parents job is to raise an adult.  they are to take a child and prepare that child for being an adult human being.  part of that has to be educating them that every single person, at every single age, has a sexual component to their life.  it changes in character as we age, it can be used to exploit us, or it can make us healthy and comfortable with who we are as human beings.  society needs to encourage the parents that are making this happen, and damn those that are turning their kids into neurotic idiots scared shitless of learning basic biological facts about child sexuality, and who abandon all attempt at thought on the matter and just bank on some random number chosen for political expedience being a good enough guide.  &gt;just because a child may inhabit a physical body that is capable of penetration or being penetrated doesn't mean that she or he possesses the emotional maturity necessary to engage in that activity.   how much maturity is necessary depends greatly upon the society one lives in.  naturally, there is no maturity necessary for this at all.  your genitals are no different from any other part of your body.  they've got a lot of nerve endings, but so do your fingertips and your face.  there simply is nothing special about them.  yet, in our culture we hammer children from the youngest age with a necessity to hide their bodies.  this has greatly accelerated and been amplified in the last 20 years or so.  up until the 90s, children were taught that their bodies were their own property and that only they could make decisions about who could touch them, and they were told to tell an adult if someone made them uncomfortable.  today they are told that they are incompetent to make this call.  listen to the adults, don't ever make your own decision.  this, of course, plays right into the hands of child molesters - almost all of whom are parents or close relatives.  molestation by strangers is, statistically, extremely rare.    but you can't teach your child about the dynamics of sex if your position is 'you have no sexuality until you turn 18 years of age' or even if you take the 'liberal' viewpoint of 'you have no sex until you hit puberty around 16 years old, and then your sexuality is just there to try to destroy everything around you and must be fought at all costs'.  neither of those positions gives you a ground for teaching anything.  you really should go back and watch 16 and pregnant again, though.  you will find, those kids are the ones who has lots of parental input.  they are the ones whose parents told them their entire life that they are not to ever have sex before marriage.  they are the ones who believe wholeheartedly in the idea that teaching kids about sex or tolerating adolescent sexuality is a horrible idea.  that is what leads to teen pregnancy.  in denmark and other such places where teenagers routinely sleep over with their boyfriends/girlfriends and have sex regularly, they actually know about birth control and it works.  teen pregnancy is the lowest in the globe.  and the kids are happy, healthy, and not angsty balls of violence.  human sexuality is a huge topic, and i've been studying it for years.  anyone who thinks it can be summed up quickly with a 'dont do it til you're 18, at which point you will magically be emotionally mature enough to make wise decisions and you will never get exploited or hurt' is just wrong.  edit:  here is the study which showed children being put on heavy-duty anti-seizure medication (which carries with is severe side effects) as a result of infantile masturbation:  http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/5/1861.1.long    note the pinhead parents reactions.  they don't give a damn about their childs well-being.  they are obsessed with maintaining their fictional image of their child as a neuter non-human creature.",1,1,-2

677216,"here's some terminology to help you navigate the world of mormonism.  the interactions are solely my perceptions and your mileage may vary.   ----  classes of mormons ----  **tbm**: fully believing, faithful, and devoted member - true believing mormon.  rank and file member, or at least the face everyone strives to wear.  **fanatic**: that special kind of tbm who tries to convert everyone they talk to, argues against evolution education, and claims to see spirits walking around the choir.  they're considered crazy by tbms and tbms are consider lesser beings by fanatics. fanatics are a subset of tbms  **active mormon**: all mormons who attend the main religious meeting (sacrament) at least once a month. tbms are a subset of active mormons.  tbms generally look down or try to ""encourage"" active mormons to be more like a tbm.  fanatics consider active mormons only slightly better than the non-member.  **inactive mormon**: any mormon who does not go to church enough to be active (~1 week / month).  fanatics and tbms alike try to bring them back to the fold and generally just consider them lazy.  technically speaking, this group also includes the members who no longer believe but are on the rolls, members who have never been to church since baptism, and generally anyone who was baptized but has not gone through the name removal process.  (also includes children under 8 who were blessed as infants.  they're removed from the rolls if not baptized by 9).   **jack mormon**: profess some sort of belief in the religion but are not willing / able to follow all of the rules.  often looked down upon by active mormons, especially in regards to smoking, drinking, coffee, tea, or sex.  fanatics consider jack mormons worse than non-members.  they ""had the truth"" and are rebelling against it.  tbms constantly try to ""reactivate"" jack mormons as long as they aren't at risk of catching their disease.   **exmormon**: someone who has denounced the mormon religion after having been counted on the rolls.  there are two breeds.  the real exmormon that went through the removal process, and the exmormon in name only that has simply stated a disbelief in the religion.  the latter is still counted by the church in their membership numbers. many will tell stories of being asked which sin they loved more than the church, or which rule they couldn't follow.  the idea that the doctrine is flawed is unfathomable by most tbms.   **bic**: ""born in the covenant"".  baby born to two members.  jack mormon status or above.  automatically given membership at the blessing and automatically ""sealed"" to both parents spiritually.  in terms of general acceptance and admiration, fanatics &lt;&gt; tbms &gt;= active mormon &gt;&gt; inactives &gt;= jack mormons &gt;&gt;&gt; exmormons.   bic may have once had a level of admiration, but that has long since died out.   ----  other main sects ----  **flds**: fundamentalist mormon - breakaway polygamous sect that disagreed with the church abandoning the practice.   mormons generally don't like the flds for giving them a bad name.  they argue the flds do not have a right to call themselves mormons (definition of irony).   **rlds**: the sect controlled by joseph's wife and children after joseph's death.  they taught a strict dynastic authority structure with their leaders being descendants of joseph smith up until recent times.  they have changed their name to the community of christ.   mormons generally look down on both.  they'll talk about the rlds pity, curiosity, or in mocking tones.  they'll talk about the flds with disgust and borderline hatred.    ----  congregations ----  **group**:  smallest organization.  often seen in low mormon populations, exceptionally rural areas, or military bases.  roughly ~10 - 15 people.   **branch**: a group with a certain number of active priesthood holders (15?).  generally less than 50 people.   **ward**: a branch with a certain number of active priesthood holders (30?).  generally consists of less than 150 members, but   **stake**: a collection of wards.  **area**: a collection of stakes  **mission**: a geographical area assigned to a specific group missionaries.  in terms of size,  group &lt;  branch &lt; ward &lt; stake &lt; mission &lt;= area.   ----  other terms ----  **ecclesiastical endorsement**: the document all byu employees and students must have signed to continue attending byu.  this includes the lds church rules,  3 weeks a month church attendance, and obedience to the larger byu ruleset in addition to the church.  (ie: no beards, curfew).   **temple recommend**: a barcoded card signed by your bishop and stake president that allows entry into the temple.  requires at least one year of membership, full tithe (10% of income), full attendance, clothing and underwear requirements.   **garments**: a special set of underwear with masonic markings that you buy from the church.    **bsa**: boy scouts of america, basically the youth program for boys. co-opted and heavily funded by the lds church.   **personal progress**:  the girl's equivalent to the bsa.  this is about teaching obedience to the church and homemaking skills.  **enrichment**:  the adult woman's equivalent to personal progress.  further teaches home making skills and acts as the stay at home mom's monthly social outlet.   **mutual**:  weekly session for 12 - 18 year old youth who have activities and religious training.  usually held on wednesday nights.    **seminary**: specific religious training for all high-school aged youth (usually 14 - 18).  most often occurs an hour each day before school starts (ours was 6:00 - 7:00 am).  can also occur after mutual has finished once a week, but this one includes homework.  in utah and other heavily mormon areas, kids are allowed an hour off of school to attend seminary in a building nearby.   **priesthood**: the authority to do things in the church. this begins at 12 for boys and continues in four stages, each gaining a little more function.  women do not gain the priesthood.  bishops, stake presidents, and certain other leaders gain a higher version called ""high priest"" that is fundamentally no different than the stage before.   **callings**: your church job.  everything from straightening pictures to leading congregations.   **missionary**: men aged 18 - 26, or women 21+ who give up two years of their life to preach.  they go to an area chosen by the leadership computers, approved by said leadership, and speaking a language assigned to them (mostly english or spanish).  they will follow a strict dress code, be burdened with many more rules, and have very limited interactions with their families (short calls on christmas/mother's day, and letters only).  they are not allowed any interaction with the opposite sex or children (for men).   **senior missionary**: single woman over 40 or retired member/couple.  they mostly do what the younger missionaries do, but without much of the rules and with much, much more freedom.",0,,

""myrna said e'dena told her that when she was a teenager, she and morgan went to dinner at a friend's house one evening. both had been drinking, and when they returned home, morgan attempted to have sex with her. they stopped just short of having intercourse,"" a family insider told the enquirer.  last august freeman was in a car accident with demaris meyer, 48, another suspected mistress. he was driving when the car flipped over several times, leaving them both seriously injured. meyer, who suffered a broken left wrist, right scapula and a torn labrum in the crash, claimed she was never romantically linked to freeman and sued him for negligence. a settlement proposal is due next week.  just four days after the accident, morgan announced that he and myrna had been separated since december 2007 and planned to divorce. whether or not he was involved with meyer, his alleged may-december, grandfather-granddaughter romance with e'dena could have made things awkward at home.  e'dena has accompanied morgan to several hollywood events, including the la premiere of 'the dark knight' last june. their supposed relationship, built on adultery, nontechnical incest and statutory rape, may result in a troubling walk down the aisle.

""becoming mrs. morgan freeman has been e'dena's goal,"" revealed another.  if the rumors are true, it's like woody allen placed another generation of age inappropriateness between him and his familial lover.  in other words, if morgan and e'dena marry, his adopted daughter will become his mother-in-law. their confused children would call his ex-wife 'great-grandma.' ick.  you can see pictures of the happy pair here and here.   ***  a few weeks ago, a disturbing story broke that morgan freeman was maintaining a 10-year relationship with his step-granddaughter with whom he had a questionable sexual encounter when she was young. yes, they are not related through blood, but freeman is 72 and e‚Äôdena hines is now 27, which means she would have been 17 when they first‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ got together. once freeman‚Äôs wife found out about their secret affair she filed for divorce, and now the enquirer is claiming that once proceedings go through, he and hines are set to wed.  ‚Äúmorgan has led her to believe that he wants to marry her,‚Äù says a family insider. another source says, ‚Äúbecoming mrs. morgan freeman has been e‚Äôdena‚Äôs goal.‚Äù  ***  technically it's not incest, but this is still all kinds of wrong.  last year the news broke that 73-year-old morgan freeman had been having an affair with his wife's 27-year-old granddaughter. he never denied the claims, and now his wife myrna is in the process of divorcing him.  well, now the gossip rag that first broke the news is claiming the couple are getting ready to have kids.  ""e'dena wants morgan's baby,"" a close source told the national enquirer. ""she believes that will give her a final hold on morgan and, after his divorce with myrna is over, she will end up marrying him.""  apparently morgan has agreed to try for a baby because he's terrified if he doesn't give e'dena what she wants, she'll go public with the sordid details of their affair ‚Äî which is rumoured to have started in her teens.

they stated that there is no medical benefit to circumcision, and they have more or less maintained this position ever since. thee aap's [last official policy](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686) on infant circumcision was published in 1999 and reaffirmed in 2005, and states:  &gt; existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.  australia's racp last published [its official policy](http://www.racp.edu.au/index.cfm?objectid=b5606813-f174-8fa9-0522ee1fc3053078) on infant circumcision in 2004, which states in **bold** letters:  &gt; after extensive review of the literature the racp reaffirms that **there is no medical indication for routine neonatal circumcision**.  &gt; ...  &gt; review of the literature in relation to risks and benefits shows there is no evidence of benefit outweighing harm for circumcision as a routine procedure in the neonate.  the racp is actually currently in the process of revising its official policy, but it at some published a [preliminary update](http://www.circumstitions.com/news/news34.html#racp) on 27 august 2009 that stated:  &gt; in australia and new zealand, the circumcision rate has fallen considerably in recent years and it is estimated that currently around 10-15% of newborn male infants are routinely circumcised.  &gt; ...  &gt; when considering routine infant circumcision, ethical concerns have focused on recognition of the functional role of the foreskin, the non-therapeutic nature of the operation, and the psychological distress felt by some adult males circumcised as infants. the possibility that routine circumcision **contravenes human rights** has been raised because circumcision is performed on a minor for non-clinical reasons, and is potentially without net clinical benefit for the child.  &gt; recently there has been renewed debate regarding both the possible health benefits and the ethical concerns relating to routine male circumcision. the most important conditions where some benefit may result from circumcision are urinary tract infections, and in adults hiv infection and cancer of the penis. the frequency of these conditions, the level of protection offered by circumcision and complication rate of circumcision **do not warrant a recommendation** of universal circumcision for newborn and infant males in an australian and new zealand context.  &gt; after extensive review of the literature **the racp does not recommend** that routine circumcision in infancy be performed, but accepts that parents should be able to make this decision with their doctors. one reasonable option is for routine circumcision to be delayed until males are old enough to make an informed choice.  the racp's *chair of paediatrics &amp; child health policy &amp; advocacy committee* [wrote this public letter](http://www.6minutes.com.au/articles/z1/view.asp?id=498029) to the editor in response to an outspoken australian circumcision fetishist:  &gt; the key point of the recently released racp statement \[(the preliminary report to which i previously alluded)\] on circumcision is that the racp believes that at the present time **there is not evidence to support routine circumcision of newborn and infant males.**  &gt; your article sends a dangerous public health message that circumcision prevents hiv transmission. it is vital that everyone engage in safe sexual practices such as condom use, whether circumcised or not.  &gt; recent reports of circumcision offering some protection against hiv infection in africa relate to circumcision of adult males, not of infants. further the stated benefits of protection against urinary tract infection are marginal, and **do not justify mass circumcision.** our changing understanding of the relationship between urinary tract infection and chronic renal disease further weakens the case for routine circumcision.  &gt; there is evidence that circumcision does result in memory of painful experiences, and is **not quite as simple and low risk as your report states.**  &gt; the colleges‚Äô recent statement is not anti-circumcision, but clearly states that parents should be informed of risks and benefits, and then supported in their decision. when circumcision is undertaken it should be with appropriate anaesthesia, and by a skilled operator who can minimise the risks of side effects.  &gt; **the option of delaying the decision to circumcise is one way of dealing with the ethical and potential legal issues of undertaking an elective procedure on a minor. the procedure is not to be equated with vaccination, either in its delivery or in its effectiveness.**  so, the aap and the racp both completely disagree with your 'friend who is studying to be a pediatrician'.  &gt; **i'm not an expert on circumcision, but of the dozen or so men/ boys i happen to know about, about half are circumsized, and of those un circumsized, two of them needed medically necessary circumcisions. .. so not only is it not rare to have medically necessary circumcisions**  [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9rvgf/pascals_wager_again_quite_a_nice_comic/c0e5qby) to gain more insight on how silly the medical rationalization is for circumcision.  many boys are circumcised unnecessarily for *physiologic* phimosis and urinary tract infections.  severe genuine *patholic* phimosis is perhaps one of the few appropriate indications for circumcision (after all other remedies such as stretching and less invasive procedures such as preputioplasty have been considered), and it occurs in only up to 1% of men. interestingly, a lot of these cases were probably caused by a meddling parent or an ignorant medical 'professional' who forcibly retracted the immature foreskin of the male when he was an infant (the foerskin is still fused to the *glans penis* upon birth and only becomes retractable years later).  other problems that might indicate a need for circumcision (such as bxo) are indeed quite rare.  &gt; **circumcision actually achieved popularity because so many men came back from wwi with horrific infections in their penises due to the unsanitary conditions in the trenches.**  * then why didn't the french or germans or italians or russians or serbs or belgians or japanes or portuguese or romanians or greeks or etc. start circumcising after wwi? why doesn't the totalitarian chinese government ensure the health of its million man military by requiring circumcision?  * why would sick soldiers who underwent a surgical treatment for their (supposed) illnesses have their *healthy* sons surgically treated for a problem they don't have?  * most men will never see a trench.  * you're completely wrong; circumcision in the english-speaking world can be [traced back to religious nuttery among the higher classes followed by medical and then cultural rationalizations in the extreme](http://historyofcircumcision.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=6&amp;id=71&amp;itemid=50) (and those latter rationalizations were also tainted by religious conviction).  &gt; **i'm in australia so non religious circumcision is not only confined to the usa.**  the only reason anybody would ever consider cutting up the penis of a completely healthy boy would be because some ancestor did so for a religious reason and started a religio-cultural ritual tradition.  i already covered australia by mentioning 'english-speaking world' and [i cover australia explicitly in the link i provided](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9yodm/we_really_do_face_a_phenomenon_which_deserves/c0f2u55) initially.  outside of the english-speaking world, it's strictly something that jews, muslims, a few tribal peoples, and sick people (perhaps 2% of men at the most) do. even in australia, the practice has pretty much died off with only 10%-to-15% of healthy infants being circumcised each year.  &gt;

a ritual sexual experience with a pregnant woman is also art of the initiation period (muller &amp; sangree, 1973)522.  the girls learn from the coquetry and customs of more mature girls with whom they sleep. sexual instruction for girls took place within the swindhe, a form of communal living (cohen and odhiambo, 1989)754.  nayar (india) the tali ritual has been mentioned. gough (1961 [1962:p346])168 further notes that in former times ‚Äúmothers and other matrilineally related women instructed girls in the arts of love‚Äù.  veda child marriage was said to be consummated before puberty (metschnikoff, [1910:p117])181. shashi (1978:p48)182: ‚Äúthe young children start their sexual activities by massaging the older children, and are only then ‚Äúinitiated‚Äù into actual intercourse. intercourse begins at age 5 or 6, initiated by an adolescent or adult: ‚Äúa big girl teaches a little boy by letting him fondle her breasts and hug her. then she opens and spreads her legs and makes the little boy lie on her breasts. she shows him how to open her clothes and insert the little penis with his hand‚Äù‚Äù. ‚Äúmarriage takes place at an early age; it is said that girls sometimes married before puberty, and as we heard this at henebedda, bandaraduwa, and onuni, we see no reason to doubt the truth of this statement. we are indebted to mr. frederick lewis for the information that this is a common practise among tamils‚Äù183.  boys and girls had their ‚Äúfirst real intercourse‚Äù with ‚Äúan older, experienced person‚Äù belonging to the same set, but often also from the parental generation (aunts, uncles). in the austral islands, it is stated that ‚Äúyoung males received sexual instructions from the kariois, young females from priestesses. courses in sexual refinements were given in the karioi-society‚Äù107. on tongareva (penrhyn), a ‚Äúwoman of mature age‚Äù, appointed by the father, practically instructed the pubarchic boy in intercourse after conditioning his preputium108. in hawai‚Äôi, a boy of noble family was equally instructed by a mature chiefess109.  senoufo (ivory coast) one of the main acts of male initiation ceremonies to the poro is a ritual intercourse between the neophytes and their symbolic mother who has just given birth to them. this rite ‚Äúmaterializes the initiatic axiom: senoufo men reproduce themselves by incest‚Äù (zempleni, 1990)358.   mbuti  at menarche the girl may have intercourse in the elima or alima hut (1965:p132-40; 1957:p208; for a specific note on the elima, see turnbull, 1960)574. ‚Äúsexual experimentation is certainly a major element in the elima, but it is combined with a very definite move to widen the social horizons of the girls, and to redirect their attentions into what the parental and grandparental generations consider proper horizons. there are also certain rules about intercourse in the elima hut. the senior girls, or instructors, and the ‚Äúmother‚Äù guide the bamelima in all this‚Äù.  during boy‚Äôs initiation rites (nkumbi), ‚Äú[s]ex instruction takes place spasmodically, but at no time is it either given or taken seriously‚Äù (turnbull, 1957:p199)576. boys aged two to eight play nkumbi, coached by their theoretically ignorant mothers (p202). mbuti practised infant betrothal577.  m  the artificiality of the so-called tablier is widely disputed in the past, although many sources have argued for this explanation (e.g., in the gisu, ganda, nandi, venda, etc.). in zimbabwe (hansson, 1996:p101-2)70, ‚Äú[t]he mother soon after birth began to pull the labia minora of the little girl, to lengthen them to around two centimeters at the time of menarche. they should not be too long, it was said.   this preparation was widespread among the women in mberengwa, though the varemba women put more weight on its importance. during this early period some women said that they ‚Äúmilk‚Äù the clitoris of the little girl. this ‚Äúmilking‚Äù is necessary to prevent the girl as an adult woman from wanting excessive sex or becoming hyper active. bourgeois (1954, [i]:p67-70)71 also speaks of ‚Äúl‚Äôallongement des petites l√®vres‚Äù (ugukuna) from early age until menses; the practice may be mutual.   in dahomey (kossodo, 1978:p113)86, fan mothers practice clitoral masturbation, pull labia, stroke the anus and use water beams for then minutes on the vulva. this continues until age four.   among the zaire baushi, the maternal task of manual preputial adhaesiolysis in infants is institutional, since the condition of permanent fixation is considered kameme, a defect. however, when the prepuce is so forcefully retracted that it it gets stuck permanently under the corona glandis [?], the boy is lufunu (boy with nude glans), and might not get married or have satisfactory sexual relations  in zimbabwe, the custom of ‚Äúchiramu‚Äù or ‚Äúsibale‚Äù was described as ‚Äúaimed at socialising children that induced touching young girls, leading to touching of young girls private parts‚Äù (loewenson et al., 1997:p11)95.  in ghana, (kaye, 1960:p381, 388; 1962:p116-22)96, mothers stimulated infants‚Äô genitalia97  genital touching by older people was also noted by among the marind‚Äêanim (van baal, 1966; cf. money and ehrhardt, 1973 [1996:p132]). gillison (1993:p176)65 describes the process of masturbating infants among the gimi: ‚Äúthe mother insists upon continued contact, interrupting her toddler‚Äôs play repeatedly to offer the breast. masturbation [...] with a baby girl [occurs when] the mother or amau holds her hand over the vulva and shakes it vigorously. she may kiss the vagina [sic], working her way up the middle of the body to the lips and then inserting her nipple (often when the child has given no sign of discontent). with a boy, she kisses the penis, pulls at it with her fingers and takes it into her mouth to induce an erection. several women may pass a baby boy back and forth, each one holding him over her head as she takes a turn sucking or holding the penis in her mouth. when the child then pulls at his own organ, the women, greatly amused, offer squeezes and pulls of their own‚Äù66.  kubary (as cited by ronhaar)134 states that among the wakka, ‚Äú[t]he mothers make the girls fit for copulation prematurely, by breaking the hymen with their fingers. this operation is secret, it is true, but takes place all the same. the mother moreover admonishes the girl to demand proper payment for her favours. the mother sees to it that at the copulation no inconvenience is experienced due to the early age of the girl, by regularly stretching the vulva by little rolls of leaves [...]. the mother sends the child out on her first sexual adventures‚Äù.   for infant females in hawai‚Äôi, ‚Äúmilk was squirted into her vagina, and the labia were pressed together (diamond, 1990) 156. the mons [veneris] was rubbed with kukui (candlenut) oil and pressed with the palm of the hand to flatten it and make it less prominent. the molding continued until the labia did not separate. this chore usually was done by the mother or by an ‚Äúaunt‚Äù [...]‚Äù. the buttocks of infants, males more than females, were molded so that they became ‚Äúrounded and not flat‚Äù, also clearly evolving from an aesthetic motive. a ‚Äúblower‚Äù is designated for each male infant, ostensibly to prepare him for subincision of the foreskin: ‚Äúthe penis was blown into daily starting from birth. the blowing was said to loosen and balloon the foreskin [and] continued daily [...] until the young male was 6 or 7‚Äù, when penile subincision takes place (diamond, 1990:p430-1)157. diamond (p433) reports: ‚Äúindividuals of both sexes were expected to initiate and participate in coitus at puberty, although sexual activity, play, instruction, and so forth occurred much earlier. for instance, as part of exploratory play, the young investigated each other‚Äôs genitals, and young males and females might masturbate each other heterosexually or homosexually. this activity occurred without adult disapproval, and it was considered to be an introduction to adulthood. casual intercourse before adolescence was not an uncommon experience for males (handy and pukui, 1958:p95) and females (pukui, haertig and lee, 1972:p78)‚Äù.",0,,
100774,"&gt; no, it is a criteria. and there's no fine line to be draw, because it's a very complex issue. basically, the closer a thing is to a viable, conscious, human being the more we should treat it like a human being.  that sounds fine in theory, but sounds a little too classist myself. i'd be afraid of how much your common white supremacist might agree with it.  &gt;a fetus is obviously not a viable human being  viability is a spectrum, not a threshold. infants are no more viable, nor toddlers. your average couch potato will starve if the grocery store shelves ever go bare. when you use the ""viability"" argument, you're really talking about convenience. an infant may be no more viable, but it is relatively more convenient.   &gt; for quite awhile it bears absolutely no resemblance to a human being.  appearance means little. appearance was an argument used to claim that slaves weren't human. i'm not willing to use this criteria either... some burn victims are hardly recognizable. they're still people.  &gt; by a viable organism, i mean an organism that tries to maintain its life by seeking out and satisfying its needs.  like the embryo does when it attaches to the uterine wall?  &gt; a human infant seeks food, warmth, and companionship - it is viable.   babies are cute. i'd never harm one. i want one myself someday. but i've still seen enough of them to think that it's laughable that they ""seek"" anything. their necks can't even support their heads. they are indeed no more viable than a first trimester fetus. without constant care, they would soon die. within a matter of just a couple days.  even toddlers are only slightly more viable in that sense.  &gt; so now we can bring in reality 20 years and the future and use it to support our arguments?  the alternative is waiting for the future to beat us to the punch, and enact legislation or policy that was meaningful 5 years ago and not now. the arguments we use now don't affect tomorrow, it affects 2017.  &gt; if a man and women can place their sperm and eggs in a jar and out pops a baby a few months later, then people probably won't have abortions (at least, in places where these technologies exist), so this whole discussion becomes moot.  unlikely. instead, the pro-lifers will try to enact legislation that would force women to have fetuses removed and gestated artificially. assuming that it is no more or less invasive than an abortion, it removes the ""it's her body"" argument altogether. still, both the parents will be financially obligated to support such a child... a parent can't duck out of their liability. it's a right of the child, as many a judge has ruled.  this of course, will be unacceptable to pro-choicers. they'll argue that it's somehow wrong to force them to do this, perhaps even falling back to the ""it's her fetus"" argument (what, before it was part of her body!). some will continue to use the not-completely irrelevant, but grotesque argument that ""what kind of life will that child have anyway"".  far from solving the issue, artificial gestation will only complicate things further.  &gt; big difference. pregnancy is expensive both economically and medically to a woman - an individual. with prisoner we're talking about a social problem and a completely different thing.  the prisoner is just as expensive to society as a fetus is to the woman. i don't think you get to claim one is a social problem and the other isn't.  &gt; when i'm talking about bringing expense into the equation, i'm suggesting that maybe it's not moral to force a woman to assume a huge economic burden just to preserve the life of a piece of tissue.  it's far from certain that it's only tissue. at least, any more than the woman herself is tissue. if the cost is immoral, something i might agree with, then the real issue becomes the lack of universal health care for everyone. this is something i could easily agree to. you should have mentioned it sooner.  &gt; quite simply you are wrong, and do not know the first thing about pregnancy. have you ever talked to a pregnant woman?  subjective anecdotes do not constitute medical evidence.  &gt; actually read anything about the changes a woman's body goes through during pregnancy to support the fetus?  everyone's body changes, until they die and even after death. change does not (necessarily) constitute medical harm.  &gt;pregnancy effects virtually every organ and system in the body of a woman. bones lose calcium to build the bones of the baby, hormone levels change drastically,  none of these are necessarily harm.  &gt; many women become diabetic,  this is harmful. again, i never said harm wasn't common. in fact, i said it could hardly be considered uncommon, let alone rare.  &gt; gain weight, stretch organs  neither are necessarily harmful.  &gt; and skin almost to the point of tearing.  this would be harmful. supposing you don't mean stretchmarks, which are only cosmetic. still, not all women experience ""torn skin"", do they?  &gt; i could go on, and on, and on,  why bother? out of your entire list, only one example is what could be considered harmful.  &gt;i trust you know how to use google and are interested in fixing your vast ignorance on these issues.  i'm not the ignorant person. i said harm was as much as common in pregnancy, but that it was hardly guaranteed. nothing you've said refutes that. i could come up with much better examples than you, but i see no reason to argue your side of the debate.",0,,
619245,"the idea is to balance a healer's late game, and to create a defender's advantage so that it's not a one-sided positioning advantage for healers only. if curse and pestilence can reduce healing by 35% based on defensive positioning, then it would be much easier and more beneficial to defend objectives aggressively.  there are other buffs that i would like to see on healers as well for the solo lane. curse at 20% makes it so that it doesn't reduce potions, self-healing, and last hit magus cloak kills by 50% over 5s. that's huge!  if you figure a potion heals for 10 hp/s (50 hp5), last hitting heals for 60 hp in one second, and the healing ability itself heals for say 25 hp/s over 5s, then you're looking at 50 + 60 + 125 = 235 total hp healed. the change to curse has a net effect of ~70 hp (30% of that). this would be similar to increasing a healer's hp by 70 around level 1-3 in the circumstance that curse is used. this would make it harder to kill healers in solo early game, but curse would become more significant during mid-late game team fights where ritual dagger is online and you're affecting the entire enemy team's output.  another lane change i would make is increasing bluestone pendant's duration from 2s for 30 damage to 3s for 30 damage. it's very minor. it would not reduce a skill warrior's clear potential (which is what the purpose of bsp should be for), but it would make the damage harder to stack on 3 uses since it only stacks twice. a little damage would be lost there, maybe 10 to 30 hp every time 3 skills were chained together. nothing major. a more significant idea is to make the bsp damage passive *only* apply to minions. i could justify why this change would be fair if we looked at the history of warriors in s2 and how many buffs they had received as a whole to put them on par with basic attack warriors such as bellona after her release.   they didn't nerf bellona; they buffed the entire warrior class instead. blue buff respawn timer was reduced from 4 minutes to 3 minutes (on a 2 minute duration). infinite mana. healers with magus cloak / soulstone did not benefit from this but rather lost a unique advantage. bluestone pendant was added which increased a warrior's skill damage output from their infinite mana by 30 *per* use. healers get bullied too easily now and in many cases warriors can outheal them.  the changes to curse / bsp would allow healers to play in solo again in the early game (hog being viable helps as well). late game, there would be more consistent counter-play. you would have a much more viable healing meta that didn't involve 5s win or lose outcomes in fights. everything would be based heavily on positioning instead of allowing a one-sided momentum.",0,,
535789,"first and foremost i'm a humanist, and since other animals aren't humans, i don't have a problem killing them for food. although, large scale factory farming practices are disgusting and have caused me to eat locally sourced food. it's not merely the ability to experience pain that makes it so one shouldn't be killed. and i'm not sure of any logical basis for pain perception being the basis for determining moral worth.   my position is that when a person begins to exist, they have an innate right to life that exists commensurately.  the law of identity tells us that no matter what it looks like, if it's a biological human being, then it is  solely that for the entirety of it's existence, no matter it's place in it's life-cycle.     my position is not based on potentiality, my position is that a human being exists, level of development is not a sufficient moral basis foe determining moral worth. for instance, infants do not acquire distinct self-awareness and memory until months into their lives, best case scenario, infants acquire limited self-awareness three months after birth, when the synapse connections increase from 56 trillion to 1,000 trillion. therefore, any plausible and logically consistent pro-choice argument will have to deny newborns a full right to life. which i would hope is counterintuitive.  i don't think that people are less morally valuable because of the situation their parents are in. so no, i don't think that abortion should be provided, adoptions should always be an option. i know you can leave your baby at firestations in the us. (also of note, i think the only way to end abortion is with a societal shift on the issue. robust socialized secular sex ed and contraception for everyone would effectively eliminate abortion. so i don't vote pro-life because the political party is simply not pragmatic on how to end abortion. i think the only way it ends is by people being better people, more informed, and better cared for.)  no logically consistent pro lifer would argue against abortion in cases of pregnancy being fatal. but an abortion to save the life of the mother isn't the moral equivalent of an elective abortion, furthermore, women tend to risk their safety if they want to have a child. also, in the us, it's less than half of 1% of all pregnancies.    &gt;there are many other fundamental problems with the conclusion that legalized abortion leads to a decrease in crime.  &gt;statistician david murray confirmed that young males between the ages of 17 and 25 commit the majority of crimes. however, if abortion had reduced crime, the crime rates in the united states would have dropped first among young people. they did not. instead, the number of crimes committed by older people dropped first. nearly 60% of the decline in murder since 1990 involved killers aged 25 and older ‚Äî who were born before roe v. wade.8  &gt;murray also found that other nations with high abortion rates showed a large increase in crime about eighteen years after they legalized abortion. for example, in great britain, which legalized abortion in 1968, violent crime has been rising steeply since about 1985 ‚Äï exactly when it should have been declining, according to the donohue‚Äëlevitt thesis. additionally, russia, with the highest abortion rate on earth, has experienced a tidal wave of every kind of violent crime following the breakup of the soviet union.9  &gt;fbi statistics showed that the murder rate in 1993 for 14‚Äë to 17‚Äëyear‚Äëolds in the usa (born in the years 1975‚Äë1979, which had very high abortion rates) was 3.6 times higher than that of kids who were the same age in 1984 (who were born in the pre‚Äëlegalization years of 1966‚Äë1970). additionally, since black women were having abortions at a much higher rate than white women, we should have expected the murder rate among black youth to have declined beginning in about 1991. instead, it increased more than five hundred percent from 1984 to 1993.10  &gt;finally, the huge increase in violent crime that peaked in 1991 and then began to decline is more closely related to the crack epidemic, not abortion. the donohue‚Äëlevitt study confirms that the crime rate rose and fell exactly where crack cocaine was most easily available ‚Äï in the large cities ...this is also confirmed by the rise in crime during the time period 1984 to 1991, after a decline from 1980 to 1984. if abortion were the primary cause of a decline in violent crime, the crime rate would have been relatively stable during the time period 1980 to 1991.   &gt;president obama grew up in a ‚Äúdifficult home environment.‚Äù the central thesis of the donohue‚Äëlevitt study is a refinement of the pro-abortion slogan ‚Äúevery child a wanted child.‚Äù they said that because a difficult home environment leads to an increased risk of criminal activity, increased abortion would reduced unwantedness and therefore lowered criminal activity. however, although criminals may more likely come from a ‚Äúdifficult home environment,‚Äù many talented and gifted individuals have as well, including: john lennon, charlie chaplin, louis armstrong, playwright eugene o‚Äôneill, audrey hepburn, james dean, merle haggard, comedian tim allen... barack obama.  &gt;the point here is this: no matter how terrible a home environment is, no child is certain to become a criminal. crime is not programmed into our dna. any program intended to help exterminate the preborn children of the poor is simply pre-emptive capital punishment ‚Äï curiously supported by many of the same people who oppose the death penalty for adult criminals.  now, this is copied from a pro life article but it lays out the meat and potatoes of what i would have said regarding justifying abortion because it makes the world safer.   i don't condone trying to shame women into not having abortions. and i'm sorry it happens. that's as disgusting to me as it is to anyone else.   i don't concern myself with labeling women murderers for abortion. certainly murder, if it applies, it does so only to positive actions taken to kill some innocent person. i'm not sure a miscarriage would be anything remotely resembling a positive action. it's more a natural death. i wouldn't say nature wanted it one way or the other. it's an amoral force. humans, by their very nature, are moral agents.",1,1,

(off course, secretely i already installed the decss codecs using ssh)  so yes, i cheat a bit. making it look more simple than it might be if you had to do it all by yourself. but then again, it restores their confidence in using a computer. and they need that confidence if they are going to be 'open' to learning new things.  from that point on, installing software using add/remove was something she tried herself. she installed some games and some useless crap that seems neat (like a google translate desktop program), but the she crossed that bridge.   it's important that they feel empowered and i advice everyone that gets to install linux to do take-it-slow, and have the user do certain tasks themselves. also: don't look over their shoulders all the time! that just adds pressure: ""are they doing it right?"" .. ""are they doing something stupid?"" .. etc.  try to act as if you care less than you really do about them getting along with linux.",0,,

515193,"note: some people have complained that the site is down. here's a copy/paste mirror (it was all plaintext if i recall, save for one quoted section):     if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre no doubt asking yourself, ‚Äúwhy did this have to happen?‚Äù  the simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time.  the writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn‚Äôt enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken.  needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if i would let it.  i find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless‚Ä¶ especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head.  exactly what is therapeutic about that i‚Äôm not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  we are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy.  sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all.  we are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers.  remember? one of these was ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù.  i have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood.  these days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a ‚Äúcrackpot‚Äù, traitor and worse.  while very few working people would say they haven‚Äôt had their fair share of taxes (as can i), in my lifetime i can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind.  nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything i have to say.  why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the gm executives, for scores of years) and when it‚Äôs time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours?  yet at the same time, the joke we call the american medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country‚Äôs leaders don‚Äôt see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies.  yet, the political ‚Äúrepresentatives‚Äù (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the ‚Äúterrible health care problem‚Äù.  it‚Äôs clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don‚Äôt get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.  and justice? you‚Äôve got to be kidding!  how can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system?  here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand.  yet, it mercilessly ‚Äúholds accountable‚Äù its victims, claiming that they‚Äôre responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand.  the law ‚Äúrequires‚Äù a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that‚Äôs not ‚Äúduress‚Äù than what is.  if this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.  how did i get here?   my introduction to the real american nightmare starts back in the early ‚Äò80s.  unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line i picked up the absurd, pompous notion that i could read and understand plain english.  some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having ‚Äòtax code‚Äô readings and discussions.  in particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful ‚Äúexemptions‚Äù that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt catholic church so incredibly wealthy.  we carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù were doing (except that we weren‚Äôt steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of god).  we took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.  the intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living.  however, this is where i learned that there are two ‚Äúinterpretations‚Äù for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us‚Ä¶ oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country.  that little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0.  it made me realize for the first time that i live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie.  it also made me realize, not only how naive i had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the american public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù‚Ä¶ and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them.  before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of ‚Äúpaying my dues‚Äù), i felt i finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer.  on the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, i should digress somewhat to say that i‚Äôm sure that i inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father.  i realized this at a very young age.  the significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when i was living on my own as student in an apartment in harrisburg, pennsylvania.  my neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker.  her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement.  instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement.  all she had was social security to live on.  in retrospect, the situation was laughable because here i was living on peanut butter and bread (or ritz crackers when i could afford to splurge) for months at a time.  when i got to know this poor figure and heard her story i felt worse for her plight than for my own (i, after all, i thought i had everything to in front of me).  i was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that i would be ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread.  i couldn‚Äôt quite go there, but the impression was made.  i decided that i didn‚Äôt trust big business to take care of me, and that i would take responsibility for my own future and myself.  return to the early ‚Äò80s, and here i was off to a terrifying start as a ‚Äòwet-behind-the-ears‚Äô contract software engineer... and two years later, thanks to the fine backroom, midnight effort by the sleazy executives of arthur andersen (the very same folks who later brought us enron and other such calamities) and an equally sleazy new york senator (patrick moynihan), we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706.  for you who are unfamiliar, here is the core text of the irs section 1706, defining the treatment of workers (such as contract engineers) for tax purposes.

redditors, do some research before you downvote. normalizing being ""tired of life"" is fucking disgusting apathy/fatalism for limp-wristed, emasculated hipsters who spend too much time on the internet justifying their shitty lives and patting themselves on the back for understanding the ""harsh truths"" of life that, hey, coincidentally, line up with their experiences perfectly!  the book *don't sleep, there are snakes: life and language in the amazonian jungle* touches on this topic, and goes into detail regarding why your crappy sedentary life of smoking weed, playing video games and working 60 hours a week is garbage. it's not because, *wow man, everyone was always as miserable as me, they just didn't have the ability to properly diagnose anyone yet!* no. go do some reading.  relevant thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/askanthropology/comments/53xdpv/do_most_firstcontacted_tribes_report_a_hard_life/  excerpts:  &gt;as /u/brainlaag has described, anthropologists who have studied hunter-gatherers in more stable times typically find that they lead relatively laid back, healthy and contented lives and have no particular desire to join the rest of us in ours.  &gt;anyway, one of the ideas that comes across strongly throughout the book, is how the tribe basically lived like.. kids. beyond ensuring they had food to eat, they had few other responsibilities, and their lives were very laid back. they didn't take anything too seriously, and more importantly, they didn't want to. everett often tried to impress upon them the seriousness of life, but the tribe didn't want anything to do with it. the tribe members were aware of their own ""backwardness"" and they absolutely didn't want to live any other way. any attempts to westernize them was met with hostility.  this all makes perfect sense if you live in a world free from hierarchy, hoarding of resources, and other inequities. okay, they get bitten by spiders and wind up with nasty skin rashes and sometimes have to fend off hyenas or pythons. what's your point? that's exactly why we evolved the fight-or-flight response, and once it's done its job, we're supposed to go back to feeling relaxed -- and i can tell you from personal experience that being in a potentially life-threatening situation, while scary, is not the same thing as having clinical depression for years, or developing panic disorder, or just being lonely. once those fifteen minutes are over, you feel fucking incredible euphoria, then if you're a hunter-gatherer, you probably do a huge dance and follow it up with a feast where you laugh with thirty or so people to celebrate. hunter-gatherers have far more leisure time than any of us, and they don't have a garbage system where 1% of the population owns almost all the resources while a mass media machine pumps out shit on a daily basis to make you think that living is supposed to be taken super seriously and the world is a scary place.  you're just gonna get cancer in the end anyway while you wither away worrying about your money, blaming all your problems on the baby boomers like the losers you are, trapped inside your own heads because you even have a single hour of ""downtime,"" which translates to ""time wasted being neurotic and thinking about terrible things that will make me feel depressed."" every time you browse /r/politics or /r/worldnews, every time you turn on the tv and get bombarded by scary information, every time you get into an internet argument, you're wasting time that a hunter-gatherer would have spent throwing a ball around or singing a song with friends.  who gives a fuck if they had to deal with diseases? if you're all alone in life and don't have a massive support network of totally transparent relationships where the idea of a secret is literally unheard of, and you spend all day reading about shit rather than actually living, *and* you don't get any exercise or sunlight exposure to keep your circadian rhythm in check, among many, many other things, you're going to be terrible at dealing with someone you know getting a disease. but if you don't have to worry about any of that, you'll just assume the sun god will take them away and get on with the next hunt. you'll be too busy supplying your brain with a healthy, constant stream of dopamine while walking (which already alters brain waves itself in a way that makes it hard to brood for too long) to even bother with negative thought processes.  have you ever heard of a tribesman having a panic attack? a tribesman who doesn't feel like getting out of bed in the morning? a tribesman with a bad case of insomnia? a tribesman with severe social anxiety who flat out refuses to participate in ceremonial dances for fear of being judged by the rest of the tribe? because those who've lived among them explicitly report the glaring absence of all those things. the socioeconomic and environmental factors involved in this are somewhat complex, but the gist of why they're happier than us should be obvious, given the above. if you're judging happiness based on whether or not someone dies young, the rate of violence, prevalence of diseases, etc., you're viewing life materialistically, which is not how we evolved to process reality.  music-induced trances, hallucinogenic substances, extreme physical activity, religious beliefs unchecked by an outside world (how can you be miserable if you're ignorant to how bad life can really get?), or even your body going into shock during a fight-or-flight episode are all great ways to explore altered states of consciousness where scary stuff just isn't so scary anymore -- again, especially if you're physically in amazing shape and always get plenty to eat and sleep. your problem as a collective is that you know *too much* about the world, and you spend too much time thinking about it rather than exploring these altered states and ensuring that you're in peak physical condition.  anyway, i'll also drop this here so that you can feel bad about sleeping in separate rooms from your parents as children and perhaps understand that you were doomed to be depressed from birth:  http://www.newsweek.com/best-practices-raising-kids-look-hunter-gatherers-63611  &gt;a cross-cultural sample of 90 traditional human societies identified not a single one with mother and infant sleeping in separate rooms: that current western practice is a recent invention responsible for the struggles at putting kids to bed that torment modern western parents. american pediatricians now recommend not having an infant sleep in the same bed with its parents, because of occasional cases of the infant ending up crushed or else overheating; but virtually all infants in human history until the last few thousand years did sleep in the same bed with the mother and usually also with the father, without widespread reports of the dire consequences feared by pediatricians. that may be because hunter-gatherers sleep on the hard ground or on hard mats; a parent is more likely to roll over onto an infant in our modern soft beds.   &gt;even when not sleeping, !kung infants spend their first year of life in skin-to-skin contact with the mother or another caregiver for 90 percent of the time. a !kung child begins to separate more frequently from its mother after the age of 1 ¬Ω, but those separations are initiated almost entirely by the child itself, in order to play with other children. the daily contact time between the !kung child and caregivers other than the mother exceeds contact time (including contact with the mother) for modern western children.  &gt;one of the commonest western devices for transporting a child is the stroller, which provides no physical contact between the baby and the caregiver. in many strollers, the infant is nearly horizontal, and sometimes facing backward. hence the infant does not see the world as its caregiver sees the world. in recent decades in the united states, devices for transporting children in a upright position have been more common, such as baby carriers, backpacks, and chest pouches, but many of those devices have the child facing backward. in contrast, traditional carrying devices, such as slings or holding a child on one‚Äôs shoulders, usually place the child vertically upright, facing forward, and seeing the same world that the caregiver sees. the constant contact even when the caretaker is walking, the constant sharing of the caregiver‚Äôs field of view, and transport in the vertical position may contribute to !kung infants being advanced (compared to american infants) in some aspects of their neuromotor development.  &gt;observers of children in hunter-¬≠gatherer societies commonly report that, if an infant begins crying, the parents‚Äô practice is to respond immediately. for example, if an efe pygmy infant starts to fuss, the mother or some other caregiver tries to comfort the infant within 10 seconds. if a !kung infant cries, 88 percent of crying bouts receive a response within 3 seconds, and almost all bouts receive a response within 10 seconds. mothers respond to !kung infants by nursing them, but many responses are by nonmothers (especially other adult women), who react by touching or holding the infant. the result is that !kung infants spend at most one minute out of each hour crying, mainly in crying bouts of less than 10 seconds‚Äîhalf that measured for dutch infants. many other studies show that 1-year-old infants whose crying is ignored end up spending more time crying than do infants whose crying receives a response.  &gt;at minimum, though, one can say that hunter-gatherer rearing practices that seem so foreign to us aren‚Äôt disastrous, and they don‚Äôt produce societies of obvious sociopaths. instead, they produce individuals capable of coping with big challenges and dangers while still enjoying their lives.",0,,

425968,"when my parents, the baron and baroness of krasny had their wedding, the celebration was interrupted by a wizened crone. it was the queen of ravens, the lady of fate. she appeared out of smoke during the ball and delivered a message. ""your child"" she said, ""will rule a conqueror's kingdom for many years and so the line will continue on. marry the foe, and you shall be prosperous."" with that she transformed into a flock of ravens and so burst out of the great hall. my father swore the guests into silence. for the king was a dangerous man, and such a prophecy would be a threat to his power. he would not hesitate to kill a child.  eventually my elder brother aidan was born. still aware of the prophecy, they gave him the best of learning. he was an avid reader, and singer, and he was a born rider. he wanted for nothing, except companionship. he spent all his time with tutors and instructors, my parents molding him into a future king. the only time he was free was on his rides. when he was sixteen, fate would start to take hold. it was on a day trip to the market town, when he meet her, maria von borcke. she was in a carriage when a highwayman pulled it over. my brother saw this, and galloped to her aid. aidan rode against the robber, and after exchanging a number of blows, the scoundrel fled. her driver was dead, so he took her up in his saddle a rode for our home, i was ten at the time. when he arrived, he explained what had happen to our parents. they were shocked at such a crime taking place but even more shocked at their guest. our paternal grandfather and lady maria's uncle died in a duel against one another. there was bad blood between them, and they were prepared to send her on her way with the minimum of hospitality required when the remember what the queen of ravens had said. the family shall prosper if the enemy is married. so they supplied their own carriage and with aidan as guard. she had been going to visit her mother's family, who happened to be 2nd cousins of our mother. so say they fell in love is to demonstrate the epitome of the word, understatement. they were madly in love with each other. two years of courtship, they married, him at eighteen and her at nineteen. it took some persuasion, but a favorable comment about the union from the duke and the concession of certain hunting rights in our forests sealed the deal. my brother would accept a commission in a regiment of lancers in the army, earning his way to the rank of captain.  unfortunately, the king caught wind of the prophecy. he accused our father and mother of treason and so sentenced them to death. they were murdered when the king's soldiers broke into our manor and shot them while they were at breakfast. there is a famous painting of the event, depicting my father shielding mother as eight royal guards fire at point blank range while an officer gestures with sword. they arrested me and sentenced me to house imprisonment. they also tried to arrest my brother aidan. his unit was on maneuvers when they attempted to imprison him in front of his men. terrible mistake. they were sent back to the king barefoot and with an ultimatum. release me or else suffer the consequences. he rejected it outright. my brother gathered like minded officers, men who could not stomach the brutal murder and cruelty that had transpired and so rebelled. assembling a force, they marched for the capital. the army sent to crush them instead joined them, swelling the ranks of the rebels. only the kind's guard stayed loyal to the end. the fighting in the streets was bloody. my brother and his lancers cut a path through the fighting and stormed the palace. many brave men died on those palace steps. in the throne room the king and the last of his cuirassiers fought. dismounted were both sides, the armor of the king's men proving difficult to defeat. many men fell. it was only when my brother slayed the king in single combat that the fighting subside. it took thirty minutes for the news to reach all in the city. the king was dead.   at four in the afternoon of the thirtieth day of march, my brother aidan was crowned king to the cheers of hundreds of officers and men. it was not a crown he wanted. two weeks after, word had reach him of war. three rival powers always eager for our rich kingdom, took the overthrow of the previous long dynasty as an opportunity to settle old grudges. my brother obliged. every battle he was at, he was undefeated. after repulsing the initial attacks, he invaded those who had wronged us. they could do nothing to stop him. army after army melted before our might. he expanded our borders to double the size previously. however, he was a reluctant warrior. three times had he tried for peace. three times was he rejected. they demanded unreasonable concessions. so he continued on. five more years of violence ensued. it was terrible those years. neither side willing to give in. calling up the last of the reserves and every available solder, both sides embarked on a final campaign, it was do or die. after months of skirmishes and raids. both massive armies met.   for two days a battle of gigantic proportions was raged. the dead littered the field, the cries of the wounded and dying echoing in the night. it was on the second day my brother sought to end this bloody war forever. summoning up the last of his cavalry divisions, he aimed them towards the flags of the leadership of the allied army, lead by new visby's prince ivan, heir to the throne. he was almost successful. unfortunately, a crack unit of cuirassiers was waiting beyond the rise of the hill. prince ivan and my brother met on the field of battle. i was present at the battle, i was tending to the injured with other noble women. i could not see anything but smoke and dust except for the occasional gust of wind which would wipe a section of the smoke away to reveal a scene of killing and dying. i did not see prince ivan lay low my brother. it was only when six of his lancers returned with his body that i learned. i was distraught, overcome with grief. it was he who supported me, telling me it would be alright. he was a prisoner, captured when his infantry square fell to the 16th dragoons' charge. he was vasily ivanovich, youngest brother to prince ivan. though hardly the time, i was spell bound by him. despite him being filthy and bloody from carrying wounded.   the battle ended that day, and so did the war. the allied army being too mangled and battered to press on. so they proclaimed me queen and allow us to keep our captured territory, with the agreement to take no more land. i was completely fine with this. prince vasily would come to visit me and after years of courting we were married, ending any distrust both sides may have had. we have four children. the prophecy was indeed true. but my brother did not live to enjoy it. i rule the kingdom he conquered, and i wedded the brother of his final foe. though i am adored by my subjects, and my land is free. i'd much rather have my brother as he used to be.",0,,

566815,"by the earliest assessments, certain patterns had already emerged. at age 4, children who had been high-reactive were four times as likely to be behaviorally inhibited as those who had been low-reactive. by age 7, almost half of the jittery babies had developed symptoms of anxiety ‚Äî fear of thunder or dogs or darkness, extreme shyness in the classroom or playground ‚Äî compared with just 10 percent of the more easygoing ones. about one in five of the high-reactive babies were consistently inhibited and fearful at every visit up to the age of 7.  ‚Äúfear is an incredibly heterogeneous construct,‚Äù says daniel pine, a child psychiatrist at the national institute of mental health. pine collaborates on the two longitudinal studies at the university of maryland, conducting psychiatric interviews and functional m.r.i. scans on subjects at several stages. ‚Äúfear of social things is different from fear of physical things.‚Äù the same brain circuitry is probably involved in both, he said, but different fears tend to show up at different points in development: fear of things like clowns, balloons or spiders emerging early in life; fear of things like social situations with peers emerging later. in addition, it‚Äôs relatively easy to avoid the physical things that frighten you; if you‚Äôre afraid of dogs, you can just take a different route to school to keep from passing that bull terrier down the street. it‚Äôs much harder to avoid social fears ‚Äî you can avoid the dog on the way to school, but you still have to go to school.  the children tended to get a better grip on their fearfulness as they got older. by adolescence, the rate of anxiety in kagan‚Äôs study subjects declined overall, including in the high-risk group. at 15, about two-thirds of those who had been high-reactors in infancy behaved pretty much like everybody else.  one such person was mary, now a 21-year-old junior at harvard, who was in the high-reactive group as a baby and was moderately fearful at ages 1 and 2. she didn‚Äôt think of herself as anxious, just dutiful. ‚Äúi don‚Äôt stray from the rules too much,‚Äù she said when we spoke by telephone not long ago. ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs natural for me ‚Äî i never felt troubled about it. i was definitely the kid who worked really hard to get good grades, who got all my homework done before i watched tv.‚Äù mary also was an accomplished ballet dancer as a child, which gave her a way to work off energy and to find a niche in which she excelled. that talent, plus being raised in what kagan called a ‚Äúbenevolent home environment,‚Äù might have helped shift mary‚Äôs innate inhibition to something more constructive. if mary‚Äôs high-reactive temperament is evident now, it comes out in the form of conscientiousness and self-control.  people with a nervous temperament don‚Äôt usually get off so easily, kagan and his colleagues have found. there exists a kind of sub-rosa anxiety, a secret stash of worries that continue to plague a subset of high-reactive people no matter how well they function outwardly. they cannot quite outrun their own natures: consciously or unconsciously, they remain the same uneasy people they were when they were little.  most of the high-reactive kids in kagan‚Äôs study did well in adolescence, getting good grades, going to parties, making friends. scratch the surface, though, and many of them ‚Äî probably most of them ‚Äî were buckets of nerves. ‚Äúit‚Äôs only the high-reactives who say, ‚Äòi‚Äôm tense in school,‚Äô ‚Äòi vomit before examinations,‚Äô ‚Äòif we‚Äôre going on a class trip to d.c., i can‚Äôt sleep the night before,‚Äô ‚Äù kagan told me. ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt like it, but they‚Äôve accepted the fact that they‚Äôre just tense people.‚Äù invoking jungian terminology, he called it the difference between persona (the outer-directed personality) and anima (the inner-directed thoughts and feelings). the persona can be controlled, but the anima often cannot.  nathan fox of the university of maryland says that when the anima erupts in high-risk children, it often takes the form of excessive vigilance and misdirected attention. in the first of his two longitudinal studies of temperament, begun in 1989, he followed 180 children from the age of 4 months and gave them a set of neuropsychological tests when they were between 13 and 15. one test, called the spatial-cuing task, measures vigilance and the ability to disengage attention from a perceived threat. it shows two faces briefly on a computer screen, one on each side ‚Äî the same face looking threatening on one side and pleasant on the other. the faces fade away, and an arrow appears on one side of the screen, sometimes on the side the threatening face had been on, sometimes on the other. the subject must notice the arrow and press a button to indicate whether the arrow points up or down.  adults with clinical anxiety consistently are faster at pressing the correct button if the arrow is on the side of the screen where the threatening face had been, and slower if the arrow is on the other side. (non-anxious adults show no such subconscious preference.) in the kids in fox‚Äôs study, those who were born anxiety-prone ‚Äî even the outwardly calm, well-adjusted ones ‚Äî tended to perform this task like anxious adults, paying more attention to the threatening face whether or not they meant to.  a similar result came from another test fox gave his subjects, called the potentiated startle response. in this test, teenagers are placed in front of a screen and told that when the screen is blue, there is a chance a puff of air will be blasted at their throats ‚Äî a sensation that, fox assured me, is surprising and uncomfortable but not painful. when the screen is green, they‚Äôre safe; they are told that no puff of air will ever come when the green screen is on. then, to evoke a startle, the experimenter plays a loud noise and measures the teenager‚Äôs response (an involuntary eye blink). all subjects have a robust startle response when the blue screen is on, which reflects the fact that they are tensing up in anticipation of that uncomfortable air puff. but anxiety-prone kids startle just as much with the green, supposedly safe screen. they stay on guard, anxious and wired, even when the situation is not threatening. again, this finding held no matter how the subjects behaved in real life ‚Äî and no matter how they were feeling while the test was taking place.  fox‚Äôs collaborator, daniel pine of the n.i.m.h., conducted functional m.r.i. scans on 27 of these study subjects when they were adolescents. while they were in the scanner, pine showed them pictures of fearful faces. sometimes he told them to try to measure how wide the nose was ‚Äî in other words, to focus on a detail that is emotionally neutral. other times he told them to think about how afraid they felt looking at the person in the picture.  teenagers who were in the group at low risk for anxiety showed no increase in activity in the amygdala when they looked at the face, even if they had been told to focus on their own fear. but those in the high-risk group showed increased activity in the amygdala when they were thinking about their own feelings (though not when they were thinking about the nose). once again, this pattern was seen in anxiety-prone youngsters quite apart from whether they had problems with anxiety in their daily lives. in the high-risk kids, even those who were apparently calm in most settings, their amygdalas lighted up more than the others‚Äô did.  temperamental type tends to reveal itself not only in functional m.r.i. scans but also in structural m.r.i.‚Äôs, which look at brain anatomy rather than activity. in 2007 carl schwartz, the harvard psychiatrist who has taken over the follow-up work on kagan‚Äôs two longitudinal studies, put 76 of kagan‚Äôs study subjects in an m.r.i. machine. at the time, they were 18 years old. (baby 19 was part of the sample; mary was asked to participate, but she declined.) he found that the subjects who were high-reactors at 4 months tended to show significant thickening in the prefrontal cortex compared to those who were low-reactors. ‚Äúthis was amazing,‚Äù schwartz told me. ‚Äúthe temperament they exhibited as infants still seemed to leave a fingerprint in the brain 18 years later.‚Äù  he is still trying to work out the exact meaning of this fingerprint; he cannot yet tell, for instance, whether a thicker cortex is a cause of a high-reactive temperament, or an effect, or something else entirely. one job of the prefrontal cortex is inhibitory, putting a damper on signals that come from the amygdala. could it be that the cortex thickens more in the anxiety-prone as it is busy tamping down the overactive amygdala and growing new neural connections? or does a thicker cortex come first, and contribute to a tendency to be anxious in the first place?  one way schwartz tried to untangle his uncertainties was by winnowing from his sample the 14 subjects who had ever been given a diagnosis of social-anxiety disorder. what was left, presumably, were 62 young people who all functioned just fine, at least in the sense of never having suffered from social anxiety. schwartz reviewed their brain images, and the difference between the cortical thickening in the high-reactive group and the low-reactives not only remained; it also became more pronounced. one explanation of this could be that a thicker cortex is protective in the anxiety-prone. he surmises that those 14 subjects who developed problems did so in part because their cortex was thinner, and the high-reactives who had avoided social anxiety had the thickest cortexes of all.  so what do these brain-anxious young people report about their state of mind? anxiety, remember, can occur at three levels: brain, behavior and subjective experience. were the ones whose brains looked anxious on the m.r.i. scans actually experiencing the sensation of being anxious?",1,1,

  a loving mother who can actually care for a child? one who is educated and finically prepared? one who mature and ready? one who had to pass certain standards to even be allowed to adopt? have you looked into what one has to qualify for to adopt?

 i do not know your definition of suffer. also the fact you need most to suffer to see a problem is disturbing but i will post more information for you to ignore. are you fine with even risking that suffering of babies and children? but maybe infant mortality? is 50% most to you?   children born to teen mothers are 30% more likely to be a low birth weight baby and have a 50% higher rate of infant mortality than children born to mothers over 20 years old.   http://www.teenshelter.org/jims_statistics_on_teenage_pregnancy_11-11-06.pdf  remember teen mothers are less likely to graduate.   the poverty rate for children born to teenage mothers who never married and who did not graduate from high school is 78%. this compares to 9% of children born to women over age 20 who are  currently married and did graduate from high school.  hey there are even biological reason teens should not have kids  younger mothers are at high risk of lbw births but research is unclear if this is the result of biological/medical factors (inadequate health care, poor diet before the pregnancy or physical immaturity) or behavioral factors (smoking, alcohol or substance abuse before and during the pregnancy)   children of teen mothers are 50% more likely than children of older parents to repeat a grade, are less likely to complete high school than the children of older mothers, and have lower performance on  standardized tests.  almost half but still very high.   &gt;as many as 48% of adolescent mothers experience depressive symptoms as compared to 13% of adult mothers.  &gt;children of mothers ages 18-19 are almost 40% more likely to have a reported case of abuse or neglect than children born to mothers ages 20-21.   &gt;children born to teen parents are more likely to enter foster care or have multiple caretakers throughout their childhood.  http://www.scaany.org/documents/teen_pregnancy_dec08.pdf http://www.teenshelter.org/jims_statistics_on_teenage_pregnancy_11-11-06.pdf  &gt;children of teen mothers do worse in school than those born to older parents. they are 50 percent more likely  to repeat a grade, are less likely to complete high school than the children of older mothers, and have lower performance on standardized tests.  overall, the authors found that children of teen mothers aged 17 and younger begin kindergarten with lower levels of school readiness than those children born to older mothers. the authors also note that children born to mothers aged 18-19 do not perform much better on most measures than children born to mothers 17 and younger. the children born to mothers in their twenties clearly outperformed those whose mothers were still teenagers at time of birth, and the most consistent and pronounced differences were observed when comparing children born to mothers aged 17 and younger to those children born to mothers aged 22-29. this research suggests that efforts to improve child development should strongly encourage teens to delay childbearing past their teen years altogether and should be accompanied by encouragement to pursue education, employment, and marriage prior to parenthood.  https://ncfy.acf.hhs.gov/library/2005/playing-catch-how-children-born-teen-mothers-fare   general?

 no that is you.   as for grandparents: http://www.aacap.org/aacap/families_and_youth/facts_for_families/facts_for_families_pages/grandparents_raising_grandchildren_77.aspx  nothing here says they are disadvantaged like single teen mothers. in fact it sounds like single teen mothers can be the reason they have to care for a child.  &gt;an increasing number of children in the united states live in households headed by a grandparent. this trend is due to: teenage pregnancies   this hurts your point. lol. i thought a single teen mother‚Äôs love was enough?  &gt;caring for your grandchild can also be very positive and rewarding.   grandparents bring the benefit of experience and perspective. they can also provide important stability and predictability for their grandchildren.  single teen mothers do not have experience.   &gt;i wonder what you would do if your teenage daughter got pregnant.   this would never happen for many reasons. plenty of people actually know how to raise children unlike you. go take care of your neglected child.   &gt;if you pushed for adoption, then you would prove you aren't a good parent yourself.  what? that makes no sense. how about let her choose? i am sure you would harass and verbally abuse your daughter if she wanted an abortion or give her baby up for adoption. bad mother, you are.   &gt; i'd help my daughter raise her child, if that was her wish.   the fact you are planning on your daughter being a teen mother is telling.   &gt;i think that would make me a better parent than shitheads like you, who used to force teen mothers to put their children up for adoption.   nothing about force. you are not a good parent that is what you show with your posts.   &gt;unless you do as much reading as i did about teenage parenthood, please, shut up and stop bashing all teen moms.   you are dumb. stories are not what matters the most. facts, data matter. i can post stories of people who happily gave their child up or had an abortion instead. the emotional appeal is crap.  &gt;i read all of them, asked some people questions, got some answers, made notes. i also read lots of articles, research and stats on single / teenage parents and their children.  now you are a researcher?

""harmful to minors"" offers a plethora of findings, from studies showing that exposure to sexually explicit images does not harm children, to evidence that teens' sexual relationships with adults are not uniformly devastating, to research on the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education in delaying sexual activity.  http://www.salon.com/2002/04/19/levine_talks/  age of consent laws are made, writes levine, by lawmakers who fail to ‚Äúbalance the subjective experience and the rights of young people against the responsibility and prerogative of adults to look after their best interest.‚Äù also in this chapter, levine questions why teens continue to be prosecuted for having consensual ‚Äúadult‚Äù sex at the same time that, in the area of violent crime, ‚Äúchildren‚Äù as young as 11 are being prosecuted as adults.   one of the arguments that we hear quite frequently is that childhood has been ‚Äúsexualized‚Äù by the mass media ‚Äî calvin klein ads, tv, etc. ‚Äî in a different way than it ever was before. do you think there is any truth to that?  i don‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúsexualize‚Äù so much. it implies that children wouldn‚Äôt otherwise be sexual if we didn‚Äôt subject them to propaganda. we might be comforted by the fact that there has never been a generation that hasn‚Äôt looked to the media as corrupting its youth. before there was pornography, there was mtv, and before mtv, there was rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll, before rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll, there was comic books, before comic books, there was dime novels, before dime novels, there was burlesque. and yet each generation of youth somehow managed to grow up and be morally upstanding enough to decry whatever they felt was happening to the next generation.   a lot of the examples you raised in your book of consensual sexual relationships between teens under the age of consent and persons who were considered to be adults, dealt with couples who were not that far apart in age. in one couple, the girl was 13 and her boyfriend was 21; another example you raised was of a 16-year-old girl and her 18-year-old boyfriend. is there any case in which you would feel that the age difference alone would be indicative of a coercive relationship? perhaps if the couple is, say, a 13-year-old and a 35-year-old? or a 16-year-old and a 45-year-old?  there is a social worker named allie kilpatrick at the university of georgia who did very nuanced and in-depth interviews with several hundred adult women about their childhood and teenage sexual experiences. when i asked her this exact question ‚Äî ‚Äúdoes age have any effect on their actual experience?‚Äù ‚Äî she said, ‚Äúno.‚Äù having said that, i would reiterate that if a 13-year-old is having a relationship with a 35-year-old, i would say that that sexual relationship is probably symptomatic of other things going on in that person‚Äôs life, which is the thing that would be most important to me.   http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html   but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.    ''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.   ms. levine argues that sex between teenagers and adults is not always wrong, and that many people are too quick to deny children and teenagers the right to make their own sexual decisions, often by labeling all such contact ''abuse.''",0,,

823389,"i would respect this essay so much more if you focused more on sinead o'connor and less on the ""little shit,"" miley cyrus. if anything, you are completely right about her and yet still use that kind of language against someone who by your logic is a victim. not everyone in the world struggles against evil nuns during their childhood, but everyone struggles, and i think it's very unfair to say miley was never the victim of censorship or patriarchal control of her sexuality. the enemy of my enemy is my friend, until they truly cross the line, and look at what disney does to our society. it's the ultimate mixed bag- they capture so much magic and almost any child in the world can have it but then they also slowly turn us into cartoons and maybe even contribute to our obsession with fantasy-gratification and unquestioning idealism- or, a feminist might worry, into a society of princess-idolators and man-children. they definitely warp the lives of their teen stars and keep them in a childlike state like neutered/spayed pets. miley cyrus acts very immaturely but that's how teenagers act when it's ""me against the world"" and to her that is exactly what her year has felt like. does she even claim to be an activist for feminism? she's guilty of artlessness, sure, but sinead o'connor is guilty of being a controversy seeker and i don't think a rational person should take bipolar antics as a heroic ideal. stop seeing your precious underdog plight feminist innocence as so weak that miley cyrus can taint it. she's being a punk, and the only difference between her and other punk kids is that she's a disney character. it might make it impossible for her lyrics to have meaning to you but it does to lots of teenaged girls and one should be careful of exactly what one is passing judgment on when analyzing miley or her fans.   also, i'm sure miley sees herself first and foremost as a gangster hustla and i'm not sure you'd ever walk up to a black girl in the inner city and tell her to stop dressing like a whore and acting like a fake bitch because she's setting a bad example for women. and as roger ebert stoically put it, maybe we should grade a work of art on how well it meets its own personal goal instead of the purpose we imagine art should have?",1,1,-1

(it was a stupidly minor thing. a minor fender bender with only one car involved -- mine -- and a tree.)  the second it was a rookie cop with an attitude and his first taste of power, someone i kind of knew growing up who wanted to show what a big man he was. acted like a total cock.  he is now the chief of police in that same town, and wouldn't you know it ... he also grew into a good officer. a solid, honest guy who respects the job.  he sure as hell wasn't when he first joined the force, though.",0,,
675277,"no, the extended adolescence is a very harmful condition forced on them by the older generations.  in fact i believe it may be so harmful that it handicaps them for the rest of their life and constitutes criminal neglect.  but that is how our society is rolling right now.  you don't think the ones who mature early are punished?  so you figure if a 13 year old forms a very emotionally mature relationship with another 13 year old, or hell, with an older person for that matter, that it would be respected  and encouraged by their parents?  i don't think so.   and if they don't mature in terms of maturity early but in terms of responsibility, you think they'd be allowed to get a drivers license early so they could get a job?  no, that doesn't happen.  do you think if they matured early intellectually that they would be allowed to pursue advanced topics in school?  no, that doesn't happen.  they're held back and if they want to learn anything else they have to sneak it in on the side while society insists they stunt their academic growth by keeping up with the established school system.    early maturation of any kind is prevented as far as the majority of society is concerned.  sure there are exceptions with some kids going to college at 10, but even in those cases a great number of people would say it is wrong to let them go to class with older people because they may be led to mature faster than the slowest rate possible (the only thing that seems acceptable).  in your analogy, imagine instead you looked out and saw teenage birds being held in the next by their parents and force-fed, prevented from flying or gathering their own food or finding mates.  do you think their wings would still be able to work when the parents let them out of the next far, far after they've passed the time when their wings were supposed to develop?  or would they be atrophied and useless?  i don't disagree at all with your points about giving kids everything on a golden platter.  that's just as bad as preventing them from pursuing maturation at their own rate.  my point is that they're often held back artificially.  with your second group of nephews there, the one in 9th grade, does he have a girlfriend?  is it treated as a serious relationship by his parents?  do they encourage him to be close with her emotionally and develop a very intimate relationship, emotionally and physically?  my guess is no, they likely are scared out of their wits every time they go out, insist on chaperones, ensure they are never alone together, etc.  he's begin prevented from maturing emotionally and in terms of relationships.  that will hurt him in the long run.  parents are meant to help children develop into adults, not simply shepherd them to the point where they are larger children.  it sounds like those nephews will be able to develop in terms of responsibility probably, but you mention they do well in school... that probably means they are being held back intellectually.  notice as you said, when they are expected to act with maturity, they do and they are fun to be around.  that is when they are at their healthiest.  they should be developing independence and all sorts of abilities at their age.  it sounds like they've got exceptional parents, far too many simply hold their kids back in every way possible.  &gt;as an outside observer, the ones that are growing up faster, seem to be being 'punished' by society less than the one struggling at the birdfeeder to be fed.  yes, of course.  as i said, society is structured to hold them back.  the primary way it does this is by convincing people that letting them advance at their own pace is wrong and harmful.  any outside observer who is a member of the society would look and say ""oh, look, they're missing out on their childhood"" or ""oh, they're having their innocence taken away"".  neither of those are true.  people can be allowed to develop maturity in every way as early as they are ready and it doesn't rob them of anything.  holding them back robs them of ultimate potential as life is finite and the earlier you start with things the more chances you have, etc.  you don't hold back someone like mozart and tell him he shouldn't skip out of school and play music all the time, you should encourage it.  by the time he's older, he'll be doing things no one in the world can do because the rest of them don't even start until far later in life.",1,2,-1

670014,"what specifically would you like to know?  i've gone through 2 laptops since then so i don't have the paper or research on hand (backed up on one my externals in storage though), but i could probably answer a few questions.  mind you, i'm not an expert.  it was grad-level work, but it wasn't my field of study (statistics was).    as far as infanticide goes, i'm not sure how to answer the question.  various cultures and various periods of time (bearing in mind that all cultures did not progress at the same rate or in the same way).  for some cultures it was routine to allow newborns to die of exposure if they appeared sickly within the first few weeks after birth.  for some tribes in central asia especially female infanticide was not uncommon.  especially for the nomadic tribes where young girls were considered a burden because they could always raid a village and take a ""wife"" by force, so raising up young girls was considered a waste of time.  they could just steal a wife by force, so their tribe raising up girls was a waste of time.  often the ""wives"" (in this context kidnapped women forced to be wives to the males) would be killed as well if they produced girls the first couple times around and another ""wife"" would be stolen.  in most cultures infanticide as accepted common practice for simple unwanted babies dropped off between 0-500 ad, but as i said before culture hardly moved linearly across the globe and it'd be common practice (especially for so-called sickly children) for another solid 700-800 years in many cultures.  generally speaking (again, not lineral nor uniform), most cultures did not considered ""childhood"" a thing.  by that i mean, children were treated more as miniature adults than they were as ""children"".  this is why throughout history you see adults having no problem sending their children to work at 5 years old.  the children were more immature adults than they were ""children"".    this is a difficult concept for many people in modern day society to comprehend.  we understand young people as having a period of innocence that we call childhood.  we protect children from things like violent images and difficult ideas in order to preserve that innocence.  this is something that is relatively a recent concept depending on culture.  to demonstrate this up until the 1600s and in some cases beyond taking your children to a public execution was considered perfectly acceptable for most europeans.  in fact in some cultures families would attend military battles and watch from afar, understanding that if their side lost they would likely be killed or enslaved as well.  sheltering children from the horrors of the world was not a thing.  i tell you this to give a bit of background on why infanticide was considered ok (especially in the bc times).  all people, from the newborn to the elderly, were considered equal by law.  if a child was too young to survive on its' own, it didn't have the right to survive on its' own.  and if its' parents saw it as more of a burden than a blessing, the community as a whole had no problem with the family simply killing it.  they didn't see the infant as something precious to be loved and groomed into a productive well-adjusted adult as we do today.  adding to this is the fact that the sheer number of children who died on their own was so shockingly high, that you have to put yourself in a different psychological mindset to understand it.  it was not uncommon for a married couple in a non-nomadic culture to have 7-12 children but only have 4 or 5 make it to adulthood.  the family that had all children make it to adulthood without dying was a rare rare thing (and the further you go back the more true it is).  so you have to put yourself in that mindset.  you remember growing up and having 1/2 of your siblings die.  and you know your friends and extended family, and seeing many of your nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends' children die very young.  so the psychology of a young child dying back in history was completely different from what it is today.  in today's age it is rare if you lose 1 sibling, and it's something tragic that everyone cries over and grieves for.  for most of history, especially in the pre-400ad era, this was not the case at all.  when someone has seen literally dozens of young children they know turn up dead, you can imagine how little impact another dead newborn has on the community.  it wasn't a situation where everyone was shocked and outraged that john and jane let their child die of exposure, it was a situation where everyone would collectively go ""well, it was a sickly child and probably not long for this world anyway"".  given these factors it's extremely difficult to judge the parents based on today's standards.  the psychology of the community was not what it is today.  the psychology of the parents was not what it is today.  children, especially infants, weren't seen as precious things with rights that must be respect and protected at all costs.  they were seen as burdens on their parents who at best had a 50-50 shot of making it to adulthood anyway.  so when a parent killed their child (allowed it to die overnight by exposure) it was looked at as an act of mercy if the infant was sick, and not something especially morally troublesome even if the child was healthy.  the infant was the property of the parents, if they didn't want to invest in raising it until it could contribute to the family that was their prerogative.    ---------  so asking me what i think about infanticide is a difficult question to answer.  of course by today's standards it is incredible immoral and wrong.  but i don't judge the parents of 2,000 years ago for their actions because they honestly did not see it as something immoral, few did.  ---------  that's mostly the eurasian thinking, north of the rhine and east.  in the roman and greek influenced lines of thinking instead of seeing a child as a tiny adult, they saw it as a nothing.  specifically celsus (i think) said that it is not immoral to kill a young child or use it for any purpose you saw fit (including sexual) since it had not yet gained the ability to reason.  and any being without the ability to reason was nothing worth considering in terms of morality.  so in this mode of thinking it was considered of no consequence morally to kill and infant, no more so than it would be to kill a bird or a goat.  this is a little more harsh than the eurasian line of thinking as they at least saw the young children as immature adults, who it was ok to let die because if they couldn't keep themselves alive they had no right to live.    but this is where the abortion connection i mentioned in the prior post comes into play.  in this vein of thinking an infant was a *potential* human.  you were not human until you could reason.  therefor an infant was a potential human.  this is the argument many use when talking about abortion; a fetus is not human life but the potential for human life.  this vein of thinking is the exact same except that that ""potential life"" theory continued outside the womb and through the first few years of life.    it's this line of thinking that i personally have a tougher time grasping, but like the eurasian line of thinking you have to remember the psychology of the time.  if you condemn people from 2,000 years ago by today's standards than imagine how you will be judged by people thousands of years from now.  perhaps what we do now will be considered barbaric 2,000 (heck, 200) years from now.   it's been argued by some (i'm not making the argument per se, but i do internally debate it) that hundreds of years from now the idea that humans would intentionally end a fetus's life will be considered a barbaric act done by the ignorant society of the early 2,000's.  that the lack of respect for the potential human life is little different than what people 1,600-2,200 years ago believed when they didn't considered an infant anything more than a ""potential human"".  or maybe this belief is wrong and hundreds of years from now abortion will be considered the necessary stop-gap between the introduction of contraception and whatever form of medicine they create to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the future.    i don't know, no one does.  it wasn't until 1944 that the supreme court ruled that the government was allowed to take an abused child out of a family (in america, i think 1879 in new zealand was the first legal precedent but i don't have my notes).  and that's something to bear in mind.  100 years ago beating your child was normal (spare the rod, spoil the child).  400 or so years ago children from poor families (england) were required to work as part of the poor laws.  1,100 years ago it was legal to sell your child as property.  1,500 years ago it was acceptable to abandon your child and kill it.  and 1,800 years ago (roman empire) having sex with children wasn't considered to be a moral issue.  so while we like to think of how we raise children as the epitome of progress, it would be completely moronic not to recognize that 300 years from now those who come after us will look back and judge us.  just as we judge those that beat their children, sent them to work, killed their infants, and raped their children.  you will say ""we don't do anything that's that bad to kids though!"" and you would be right... but that's the thing about progress, it keeps going even after we are gone.  those who follow us will (if all of human history is a good barometer) be better than us.  and if that's the case, how harshly can we judge our ancestors?  it's all part of progress.  our ancestors sucked in comparison to us, we will suck in comparison to our descendents.  so, back to infanticide and how i feel about it.  i don't judge those who did it 1,500+ years ago when their moral standards and the moral standards of all of their society said it was ok, but i do judge anyone who thinks it is ok today.  no way i couldn't.",1,-1,

he was on fox news. this is a white man, and he was upsetting the fox news commentators to no end. he pointed out - did you see him, john? - he pointed out, a white man, an ambassador! that what malcolm x said, when he got silenced by elijah muhammad, was in fact true, america's chickens are coming home to roost.  we took this country, by terror, away from the sioux, the apache, the arawak, the comanche, the arapaho, the navajo - terrorism! we took africans from their country to build our way of ease and kept them enslaved and living in fear - terrorism! we bombed grenada and killed innocent civilians, babies, non-military personnel, we bombed the black civilian community of panama with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenagers and toddlers, pregnant mothers and hard-working fathers, we bombed qaddafi's home and killed his child! blessed are they bash your children's heads against the rocks!  we bombed iraq! we killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living! we bombed a plant in sudan to pay back for the attack on our embassy, killed hundreds of hard-working people, mothers and fathers, who left home to go that day, not knowing that they'd never get back home, we bombed hiroshima, we bombed nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and in the pentagon, and we never batted an eye. kids playing in the playground, mothers picking up children after school, civilians, not soldiers, people just trying to make it, day by day. we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans, and now we are indignant! because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yards! america's chickens are coming home to roost.  violence begets violence, hatred begets hatred, and terrorism begets terrorism. a white ambassador said that, y'all, not a black militant, not a reverend who preaches about racism, an ambassador whose eyes are wide open, and who's trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised. the ambassador said that the people we have wounded don't have the military capability that we have, but they do have individuals who are willing to die to take thousands with them, and we need to come to grips with that.  let me - let me stop my faith footnote right there, and ask you to think about that over the next few weeks if god grants us that many days. turn back to your neighbour, say ""footnote is over"". now, now. come on back to my question to the lord: what should our response be, right - right now, in light of such an unthinkable act?   i asked the lord that question tuesday, wednesday, thursday, and friday. i was stuck in newark, new jersey; no flights were leaving laguardia, jfk or newark airport. on the day that the faa opened up the airports to bring into the city of destinations those flights that had been diverted because of the hijackings, a scare in new york closed all three regional airports and i couldn't even get here for mr. radford's father's funeral, and i asked god, what should our response be? i saw pictures of the incredible: people jumping from the 110th floor; people jumping from the roof, 'cause the stairwells and elevators above the 89th floor were gone, no more; black people jumping to a certain death; people holding hands, jumping; people on fire, jumping; and i asked the lord, what should our response be?   i read what the people of faith felt in 551 bc, but this is a different time, this is a different enemy, this is a different world, this is a different terror, this is a different reality, what should our response be? and the lord showed me three things, let me share them with you quickly, then i'm gonna leave you alone to think about the faith footnote. number one: the lord showed me that this is a time for self-examination. as i sat 900 miles away from my family and my community of faith, two months after my own father's death, god showed me that this was a time for me to examine my relationship with god, my own relationship with god, my personal relationship with god. i submit to you that it is the same for you. folk flocked to the church in new jersey last week. you know, that foxhole religion syndrome kicked in, that emergency car cord religion, you know that little red box you see, ""pull in case of emergency"". it showed up full force.   folk who ain't thought about coming to church for years, who ain't at church last week. i heard that midweek prayer services all over this country, which are poorly attended, 51 weeks a year, were jam-packed all over the nation, the week of the hijackings, the 52nd week. [incoherent] but the lord said, this ain't the time for you to be examining other folk's relationships, this is a time of self-examination. the lord said to me, ""how is our relationship doing, jeremiah? how often do you talk to me, personally? how often do you let me talk to you, privately? how much time do you spend trying to get right with me, or do you spend your time trying to get other folk right?"" this is a time for me to examine my own relationship with god - is it real, or is it fake? is it forever, or is it for show? is it something you do for the sake of the public or is it something you do for the sake of eternity? this is a time for me to examine my own, and a time for you to examine your own, relationship with god: self-examination.",0,,

259933,"superior japanese copies are folded over 1000 times!  ---- sooooo my life is officially over (not because of doxx attempts) so i'm going gonna retire from /r/hapas  &gt; so for all the attempted doxxers, just call this a complete freak of coincidence. similar coincidences like this make me sometimes feel like i'm not in control.  &gt;  &gt; i just touched down in my fathers tiny no name town after a twenty four hour trip with three separate flights. an airport with two flights a day.  &gt;  &gt; about three weeks ago i found out my father has what appears to be a terminal illness (my friends on here can confirm). as if this wasn't bad enough, i'm being forced (i guess starting tomorrow) into having to live separately from my wife in a tiny one bedroom apartment in a rundown mill down, so my father can tell me the harsh truth while he literally forces me to sleep on a ""cot"" with him next to roaches so he can build up the courage to tell his only reasonably sane son how the rest of his life is now down the toilet. he is literally forcing me to separate from my wife and live with him so he can be close to me and explain why my paranoid schizo brother needs 40+ years of my help and close supervision. my father is not man enough to sit down with me at lunch and tell the whole family his plan. &gt;  &gt; my brother is apparently a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic (though my chinese family doesn't believe this, thinking that my father's fear of jewish psychology turned my brother into the person he is, allowing him to suffer after extreme trauma from losing his tiger mother - who also had extreme covert incest with him), and there's a 99% chance now that my father is going to ask me to take care of my brother in the event that my dad dies. this is what i gleaned from my grandmother although the details of how bad he is (several arrests, extremely disturbing home hygiene issues), and my father will never admit how bad my brother is because he feels this will make him lose even more faith in god, the only thing that probably keeps him barely functioning. my dad lives with my brother and watches him constantly out of fear that he will do some shit like he used to - apparently at one point his apartment was stacked to the ceiling in molded dishes, vomit bags, dirty bloody tissue paper. i suggested to my grandma that we put him in an institution for life but this isn't the christian thing to do. &gt;  &gt; my grandma just told me this, and i just had to tell my wife (she immediately started crying like an infant) that if i am forced to spend the rest of my life in this shitty town caring for my brother (who apparently cannot be left alone because of what he used to do when left alone i the apartment - like a horror movie), that she leave me and go back to china and live a healthy life. this made her immediately start crying hysterically. i told her she does not deserve a fate like the one i'm looking at right now. &gt;  &gt; i sincerely hope none of you people here ever have to say shit like that to someone you care about and the worst thing is that while she was crying like a baby, you feel absolutely nothing. that's the kind of man i've become after twenty years of monthly, yearly, daily agonizing pain that never stops, because i have to pay for the sins of my fucking father.  &gt;  &gt; some people just lose the game of life. if you people ever wondered why eurasiantiger had a hysterical view of life and a dark humor about it all, it's because it was my only way of dealing with a constant horror of just repeated bad luck stemming from my fathers poor decisions and his mental illness (that led him to fetishize asian culture). i literally am posting this in a bath towel leaning on the sink of my grandmother's apartment after showering and laughing hysterically at how shit just never stops. it never, ever stops for some people. it's all just funny to me at this point. one of the greatest potentials of our generation, and a truly brilliant hapa mind flushed down the toilet just for the cost of my father's yellow fever and anemic christian view of the nobility and sanctimony of creating life just for the purpose of creating life.  &gt;  &gt; i also had an epiphany today, that the only real love is love for oneself. if you can love yourself like i do even the worst agonizing horror stories after horror stories your entire life, death after death after death, become bearable. but for my wife i can't let her suffer like that. i told her to leave me if i'm forced to do this. i'm posting this from a tiny bathroom next to the woods in a tiny little rundown horrible town with less people than the building complex i live in in china. there's nothing wrong with being mixed race or asian. if anything being asian seems to negate many of the problems that are almost never ending among my white family, and being mixed with asian gives me the youthfulness and health to deal with horrors that would cripple 99% of men. &gt;  &gt; so you guys got what you wanted, i guess. hopefully years after the fact many of you can realize that everything i said was based in truth about the essentially tragedy of life and how some people are just dealt the worst hand after worst hand to the point you don't even feel it anymore. i put my blog on private simply because i have for the first time, some sympathy for my father, after he called me and asked me dramatically ""are you sitting down?"" before telling me that he was ""very, very sick and i needed to come home, now."" &gt;  &gt; home, being a fucking town  in the middle of nowhere that i have no connection to, whose shitty as an diner has been missing an ""i"" for fifteen years and whose tj max is a town attraction. this is his arrogance.  &gt;  &gt; none of you will ever have to say to the woman you love that you would rather she leave you than suffer essentially a fate worse than death. being locked in with a paranoid schizo and being forced to monitor him until he or you is dead because your 90 year old grandma and terminally ill dad won't be able to. being forced to pay for the sins of your father. and of course none of you will ever even know the amount of cold bloodedness and lack of feelings to me able to just accept something like that. from the ivy league to a town of 12,000 in a three story wooden walkup caring for a forty year old schizo.  &gt;  &gt; enjoy your lives, and be thankful you never had to deal with a fraction of the things i have to experience year after year after year after year after year with no end in sight. &gt;  &gt; as for the attempted doxxing, it has nothing to do with my disappearance. i had been disappearing more and more frequently i the last few months attempting to wrestle with this situation. lots of people noticed that. and you might think this is some kind of plea. it's not. i was planning on leaving for a while to deal with life circumstances that there are no online solutions for, and yeah, are directly related to lots of the shit we talk about here. &gt;  &gt; ladies, be careful of the men you have children with. while on paper it sounds cool to have that tall white guy, not everything is as it seems. highly intelligent hapa babies might not be the best thing ever. i look at the millions my chinese family have and how their kids are successful then i look at how i'm forced to trudge around a grey, trampled little town for the rest of my life just because my father just had, just had to get some pussy.  &gt;  &gt; none of you will ever know the feeling of dread at the shit i confront daily, and the feeling, a feeling i had for the first time, in all earnestly, in my entire life, that i was better off dead than to be cursed to this kind of life long death sentence. you will never, ever know what it's like to go from such highs to such lows and be ruined by circumstances that have you by the neck at every minute, of every day, with no end in sight; and if that fear wasn't enough now i know i am facing a genetic annihilation at the hands of not only paranoid schizophrenia but my father's genetic illness. &gt;  &gt; oh well. this fate is so bad, because i've been trying to get away from my brother and father and memories of my mother for years, and in one day after the hell of watching my favorite city in the world shrink away beneath the clouds to be replaced by this hell hole of overgrown sidewalks and cinderblock wendy's, that i've essentially decided that if this happens, i am going to end my life before then. probably by firearm because my uncle (my father's brother, who is now embracing the reality of my brother) has several. it won't be today or tomorrow, but i'm just saying that i've reached a point today that i've realized that now my father's sins have become so bad that they are ruining other people's lives and it might even just be better for me to go. &gt;  &gt; i want all the hapas out there to remember two things: there's nothing wrong with you, and that life can be particularly cruel to many of us. but it never was your fault. it never was your fault. you're all beautiful and wonderful people regardless of what you look like. &gt;  &gt; peace. and i love you all. if you want to talk to me email because i'm not going to be posting here anymore. my life is sealed in stone now and either i deal with it or i die. &gt; &gt; /u/kool8d2:  &gt;&gt;what??! he had the audacity to tell your to leave your wife behind in china and to live under the same roof again with him instead? screw him. he's done enough damage to your life. don't let him control you. &gt;&gt;if it wasn't for your dedication to r/hapas and all hapa related issues, i'd have pulled an alex buckner on my parents ages ago.   ---- ^(check out copy-kun on) ^[github](https://github.com/jaredhays/copy-kun)!",1,-1,-1

373147,"oh, i could write paragraphs. and probably will. mother was a 16 year old girl who never really knew her father and had about 3 stepfathers over her childhood. she was insolent and hated living with the last stepfather, so she slept around a lot, had a lot of miscellaneous relationships, attempting to get pregnant so she could pin it on someone who would step up and marry her so she would no longer have to remain living with her family. this is the story of how i was conceived as told to me by my mother. the man who stepped up is the man i came to know as my father, 23 to her 16, but genuinely funny, hardworking guy, married her ass and got started on a family with her and me on the way. whether he's biologically my father, i honestly have no clue. i'm probably a milkman baby as i have intense spiral curly hair with no one in either family side to attach it to, though father was abused incredibly as a kid, fed his own vomit, broken arms, etc. and was adopted by a couple who raised him thereafter, who i call my paternal grandparents. so no real way of knowing if my genetics line up without maternal father or any paternal family. he apparently was and still is unaware that she plotted my conception, and still thinks i was an accident. so i'm a planned accident somehow?  fast forward 5 years and they divorce. mother and father both experimenting with drugs, my mother falls into it much heavier than my father as far as i could tell back then. she becomes extremely possessive of her children, me and my younger sister, as leverage. father hardly ever sees us, grandparents even less, we're completely isolated and stuck with a drug-addicted and increasingly mentally unstable mother. i had to step up a shit ton as a kid, blah blah blah. at 6 years old i'm finding my paternal grandparents' phone numbers somehow, calling them, and telling them my mother is dead because she is out cold on a couch from drug usage and won't wake up. they come get us, we stay with them until mother throws a big enough fit and is seemingly okay again, usually a week or two, and repeat the cycle of scary childhood. mother continues to deprive us of constant, spews crazy hate and stories about our family to us to get us on ""her side"", etc. family would send us gifts for birthdays and holidays but we never saw a thing, probably sold for drugs, but she moved us around about 9 times without telling anyone, so who knows.   father mostly moved on with his life and didn't care about us much, just attempted starting new families, so we were never fought for. paternal grandparents are begging for contact the entire time, though, not sure how much my mother got out of them for payment and such just dangling possible visitation over their heads. finally paternal grandparents coerce their son, my father, somehow, to start fighting for custody. i'm 10 at this point. i don't know my family. i only know my mother and all she's told me about everyone and feel sucked into her bullshit because i love my mother and she needs me and i feel like i've never known anything else. my mother  is flirting between many men, skirting by without a job, playing up some probably imaginary disease that makes her bed-ridden and i'm taking full time care of her and my younger sister. mom gets notice of custody battle, and freaks the fuck out. proceeds to take me and my sister and move without telling a single soul where we're going, gets a man she's dating to come with her, presumably has him take everything out in his name, because we weren't located for an entire year. one day police show up and i'm on my way to my father who i've been literally groomed to hate, and his new family of wife and 5 kids. dad gets custody except full summers are awarded to my mother still somehow. did about 6 months with father before he got tired of it, so off to paternal grandparents we went.  they never became legal guardians, not sure if out of laziness or just never realized how permanent it would be. my sister, who is basically a small version growing up to be my mother, threw a fit for a straight 7 months begging to be with her mother again until finally no one could take it anymore and they made a deal with my mother than she could have full custody of my sister if i never had to visit my mother ever again (something i actually wanted). my mother had always adored and loved my little sister and had treated her like a goddamn princess and had since sobered up as far as i had heard, so they just let sister go a state away to her. not sure how this worked legally, if at all, but i spent the rest of my school years in a tiny town raised by my grandparents with zero contact with mother, father, or sister ever again. father even moved in next door on grandparents' land at some point but never wanted anything to do with me, so we just called it.   fast forward to a year in my own place, blah blah blah, not letting my backstory get the best of me. mother calls grandmother (grandfather has since passed) out of the blue and asks if grandma would like my sister to come stay the summer, that she needs a break. grandma is a very overly kind soul with strong old values of family comes first, anyone in need can count on me. she's delighted of course. she takes my unruly teenage sister knowing my mother thought her problematic, but ""country living"" would do her good. my sister shows up with all her belongings. my mother never takes her back and starts having new kids with her new husband. just unloaded her kid on my grandmother. my grandmother doesn't even bat an eye, she'd just never pursue legal action or think it unjust. she just thinks it's her calling and god expects this of her. so my retired, living off 1k a month grandma takes in this 16 year old she's had no contact with and starts raising her. my sister within just a month or two starts scamming my grandma for every bit she's worth. manipulates her until her 401k and life insurance from my grandfather is just fucking dry. this was supposed to be my college money, and possible inheritance. all gone. i didn't get to go to college.  a short look at my sister within just the first year:  begs and pleads for a brand new car. for months. she does not quit. grandma caves and gets her a brand new pt cruiser, they pick out together. in two weeks, my sister ""trades"" it for a beat up fucking old ass truck because she wants a truck more, and it stops working within two weeks. no more car. she asked for a new car again. she starts screaming about how she wants a baby and wants to be a mother at 16. my grandma thankfully does the right thing and gets her birth control, she refuses to take it and intentionally gets pregnant so she can move in with a guy and get married and not have to live with my grandmother anymore. re: my conception. she is mom 2.0. has a baby, marries an abusive guy i went to highschool with, gets into drugs, consistently begs for and receives money from my grandmother, and now it's ""for the baby"", ""we need to pay the $600 phone bill she runs up because she needs a phone"", etc. all this time i'm now being called jealous and unwelcoming and not taking family seriously because this shit is ludicrous and i'm trying to save my grandmother from herself. she doesn't stop until she doesn't have a dime left. finally turns to me for help with budget and fixing her to be able to scrape by on $1k a month again. my sister in just 3 years has three kids by three different men, has been in jail twice and released because pregnant and small counties like these don't want to pay for the pregnancy, is a horrible drug addict, and has had at least one job making money with prostitution.   the only good family i ever really knew was my grandma, and i was near shunned for 3 years in favor of my sister and she was given every cent of money that could have helped me further my education and stability because my grandma has a ""you can take care of yourself, everything goes to family in need"" mentality.  i tried going to community college anyways with scholarship money, but can't access it without fafsa. can't get fafsa without parental information. grandma is not my legal guardian and her information is inadmissible. my father refused. i finally broke after 8 years of no contact and called my mother to beg for the information so i could go to school. she accused me of stealing her identity, and hung up. can't go to school without parental info until 25. i never understood how my fucked up childhood would hurt my future.  weird messed up things mom has done include:  threatening suicide anytime she thought i didn't love her enough and showing me the instrument of choice. going batshit about a thread on the floor and terrorizing the household for a full 6 hours, then apologizing profusely the next day and begging forgiveness. taking all my possessions and burning them as punishment. the list really almost never ends.  dad is so messed up on drugs now with him and his wife that his whole face and mouth have rotten out and he's un-recognizable. he currently steals from my grandmothers barn and such nightly to feed their addiction and can't hold a job anymore. has been imprisoned at one point for beating his wife. they're still together.   i could go on and on about extended family but it's really only hearsay as i never met them. /rant, dear god",1,-1,1

320057,"when i was in middle school, the big thing to do on the weekends if you were a ""cool kid"" was to attend the catholic youth organization (cyo) dances at one of my town's four parishes.   that parish was saint jude's.  i went to public school like many other attendees from both in and out of town did, but anyone who paid the five dollar entry fee was allowed into the dance. the parish made a killing off of those dances and off of all of the hormonally-charged pre-teen shenanigans that went down within those holy, hallowed walls of saint jude's deteriorating gym. the gym was so bad that even after they ripped out the soggy and cracked wooden floors, the tiled court that they put in was so shitty that you could pull up some of the tiles with your finger. whenever i played basketball in that god-forsaken gym i had to pray to god that i wouldn't slip on a tile shifting below my feet or step on a piece of gum or a speck of some junior high-schooler's bodily fluid from the dance the night before.   the place was skeevy as all hell but it was all we had in those days so no one cried too much about it.  whether there was rain, sleet, snow, or toxic sludge pounding down on us from the heavens, we would - without question - show up for those dances every friday night during the school year. every single bit of youthful degeneracy and infantile indiscretion could be found at saint jude's on friday nights. friday nights at saint jude's - affectionately dubbed ""the whorehouse on the hill"" by the kids - could make a coke-fueled night at studio 54 back in the 70s look like tuesday night bingo at the retirement community just down the road from the parish. there was simply nothing that the chaperones - all moms from the parish - could do to stop the spaghetti strapped girls from performing some sort of bizarre, hip-hop-infused mating ritual with the boys who all were convinced that if they just wore more quicksilver and billabong t-shirts from pacsun to go with their rope and pukka shell necklaces, they would eventually fend off all of the competition from the other dance-goers and land themselves the coveted job of ""apparel model"" at our local mall's pacsun store.  i may or may not be joking about that.  if you managed to grind it out with casey or kelly to the booming sounds of usher or lil jon on any given friday night, you would be the man for the rest of the upcoming week. if you managed to then get with casey, kelly, or both fine young ladies at the dance in one of the bathrooms or away from the prying eyes of one of the more puritanical parish parents chaperoning then you would henceforth shed your title as ""the man"" and ascend to the throne of flyness as ""the lord of the dance,"" conqueror of all caseys, kellys, and courtneys.  years after those wild middle school nights at saint jude's were gone, some knob jockey decided to complain to the school about the dances and how there was so much awful and degenerate behavior going on. somehow they got our local paper and then our city's magazine to write about the infamous dances and once the word got out around our county and some calls were made to the holy head honchos who ran the school and the parish, the dances were shuttered forever.  word got around to us dance alumni who had long moved onto college and beyond about the dances being shut down and we all reminisced with each other about just how crazy, fun, and critical they had been to us and for our development as teenagers and kids growing up. not long after the dances were shuttered, dwindling enrollment and financial troubles within the archdiocese and the church meant that saint jude's had to close their catholic school and all hope that those dances might be revived for a new generation of kids from our town and all over the county was gone for good.  the last middle school dance that i attended was my eighth grade recognition dance at the end of the year. it was a dance that you had to sort of get dressed up for and the boys wore collared shirts with khaki shorts and the girls wore dresses. this dance was a lot different from the dances at saint jude's because this was more of a formal dance and there wasn't much of any grinding or ""dirty dancing"" going on that i can remember; it was mostly guys and girls dancing in the slow dance way that you do at prom in high school. this meant, of course, that at least two-thirds of the kids stood around awkwardly and didn't interact with the opposite sex while the remaining third-or-so had either the looks or the bravery to approach one another and have a better time than everyone who watched from the sidelines. everyone spent most of the time just huddling around in their own little cliques and circles and trying to entertain themselves or trying to find a way to get the attention of some guy or girl that they wanted to dance with before the night was through. it was all very juvenile and funny looking back on it now and it feels bittersweet in a way since none of us can ever get back to that place again in our school's cafeteria-come-dance hall and since - for me personally - that year may have been the best and most memorable year of my childhood.  at the end of the dance i had to use the bathroom and when i was done i got this feeling and just had this urge to walk through the school one last time before leaving it behind. i walked around past classrooms i had sat in and through the gym and locker room and art and music rooms as well but i couldn't get to the wing of the school where i had my favorite class with my favorite teacher; these metal gates were put up to keep kids out of certain parts of the school each day after everyone went home and the gates were set up on this day to keep people from walking through there during the dance. when i went back to the cafeteria the dance was over and nearly every person had left and had filtered out of the place. there was a song playing and it was the first time that i had heard it and it instantly got to me and made me stand in the empty cafeteria and listen to it the whole way through while some chaperones and parents were cleaning up. the song was wish you were here.",1,1,

518397,"first of all, thanks a bunch for the detailed response, i'm extremely glad to hear you liked my cards.  i deliberately made arcane unraveling do nothing in aggressive match-ups (although technically it could net value with mad scientist), because i think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue. all the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with secrets and have mad scientist-esque effects into the game. i'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but i think against control it could be insanely useful.  i think shadow summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first shadow bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the bomber), and you can only hero power once per turn. if you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own i don't think it's that strong at all.  for tinkerer, i imagined this card less as a jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-gazlowe. i think if you even have two cards on board that generate spare parts (like a gnome and yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. two extra spare parts with gazlowe or antonidas or even auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them.   beastmaster can have synergy with hunter cards obviously, allowing you to houndmaster anything, enable kill command, etc. etc. this can let you do stuff like turn 4 yeti turn 5 beastmaster + houndmaster, or turn 3 harvest golem turn 4 coin beastmaster houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. it also synergizes with druid of the fang, i don't know if that's enough to make beast druid viable but i think it's worth considering. and, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior black knight + mark of the wild with hemet nesingwary; a 6 mana assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1.   generator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. and they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for avenge; redemption will be bad if they kill the generator, noble sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.  i'll agree that shadowy archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than creeper, but it is a class card)?  for the tortoise, it does seem limited, but i think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. a comparison could be made with hogger in terms of how 2/2 taunts can snowball out of control. also it's a beast, though i don't know how useful that is.  i didn't consider the shade comparison with fel imp at all, i think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it i was thinking of the synergy with floating watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. also with blood imp on board he grows faster than shade as well, although not by much. he's probably a much worse play in the early game, but i think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.  for neighborhood blacksmith, i think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. and if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better greenskin. which for current warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.  thanks again for the response!",0,,

(our pediatrician actually pointed out that high testosterone in utero makes a person's, regardless of gender, ring finger grow much longer than their index fingers, and this has been linked to toddler and adolescent aggression -- the test, that is, not the fingers, the finger length is a sign of this. my daughter's ring fingers are way longer than her index fingers. the doc explained, quite simply, she was bathed in higher testosterone because of the maternal hormones which in turn were probably caused by a lot of sex during pregnancy which my wife, well, demanded.)  anyway, she's such a delightful girlie girl who alighted on dolls at the toy store and had to have one. her brother tried toting the doll around a little now and then to simulate holding a baby like we had trained him to do when his sister was unborn and on the way... but that would last maybe 5 minutes and is pretty rare. those books opened a fascinating venue to me that sits well with my notions of the powerful effect of hormones and makes me realize just how little we knew in the 70's. anyway i'm rambling...",1,1,-1

""when people believe x, they often act in objectionable ways y, using x as their justification for such actions"" is a simple and relevant observation.  &gt; in short, it's fallacious thinking.  fallacies refer to proofs, not evidence.  i don't offer history as a proof of the incorrectness of your beliefs, but simply as evidence that their frequent consequences (since i'm almost certainly having this discussion with a consequentialist) are negative and highly objectionable.  &gt;  so it looks like this is where our opinions differ. i don't believe in human rights. i believe in the right of sentient beings (aka ""people"").  ""sentient"" is not a term with an agreed upon meaning, so it would be best (for this discussion and for future ones you may have) to describe what sort of beings you mean explicitly; for my part, i understand ""sentient"" to mean ""capable of suffering"" which is probably more broad than you intend.  &gt; if it's all about ""human"" rights, but has nothing to do with potential, then consider this: a random clump of cells from my body is indistinguishable from the clump of cells that comprise the totality of a zygote.  that's certainly not true.  if it were true, we wouldn't be having this argument in the first place: we would be talking about antechronosian stem cells, and not embryonic stem cells.  clearly the cells from an embryo can be distinguished from a random clump of cells from your body.  &gt; this, cutting off a tiny chunk of my skin, or drawing some of my blood, is murder, because it kills something that you've defined as ""human"".  i've defined the term [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/info/6mcm0/comments/c049o1r) when i said ""biologically, it's undeniably human: it's a complete living organism composed of human cells.""  a random clump of cells from your body is not a complete living organism; it's a part of an organism.  &gt; this, cutting off a tiny chunk of my skin, or drawing some of my blood, is murder, because it kills something that you've defined as ""human"".  please don't sink to the level of such ridiculous straw men.  &gt; therefore, either your definition of human does need to include potential  you've failed to show any such thing.",0,,

""custom servers have always been extremely popular with battlefield pc players. with battlefield 3, we‚Äôve introduced a custom servers program to console gamers. response has been overwhelmingly positive. custom servers gives players the ability to tailor the settings and parameters of a given server, which directly affects gameplay. it also gives players more choice as they select which server and gameplay style they like best.

930909,"asian women are infantilized. it's incredible how many 30-year-old women act like little princesses here in china, they wear babydoll dresses and carry around pacifiers and giggle behind their hands all the time. it didn't use to be this way, it's because of the koreans and taiwanese (who take their cues from the japanese) that women think it's fashionable and ""kawaii"" to act like little girls.   there's a lot of sexualization of younger girls in japan, hence the schoolgirl fetish. people in china don't talk about sex openly since we still value women's virginity and crap, but in reality we have massive issues with sex slavery and pedophilia. (yes, we are a nation of repressed perverts.) when we praise a women's beauty, we say she is ""delicate"" in appearance, like a slender little girl. we are obsessed with fragility.   by pretending to be in pain, women make themselves more submissive and ""childlike"", as if the not-so-impressive penis were a lot bigger than it actually is. the rape/domination fetish is huge in asia, i have no idea why - it extends to gay relationships too and to women's fantasies about gay guys. (no kind of porn comes close to the rapity rape in yaoi and slash.)  edit: i'll also note that this submission fantasy is primarily women's, not men's. when i was study japanese culture at uni, we noted that ""kawaii culture"" was a way for women to refuse to grow up and become boring old housewives-cum-slaves to their husbands and mother-in-laws, the way anime/otaku culture allows men to cling on to their childhood fantasies. because there is so much pressure to fulfill certain responsibilities in real world japanese society, modern young women rebelled by throwing themselves into 'selfish' consumption rather than the production demanded by postwar japan. only young girls could have fun.   chinese women are a little lighter on the real-world constraints, but there's the same sort of fantasy - to be young and rich and beautiful, to be wholly desired rather than forced to wait on others. a lot of these women who are running around with pacifiers and writing rape porn are wealthy, successful professionals (and probably quite feminist in sensibility). i guess in our eyes that fantasy can be immature, but it helps create a kind of psychological breathing room - ""i'm not ready, i'm still a girl, i still want to be protected"" - in a society that really demands of its women both independence and the shouldering of all the responsibilities of motherhood.   that's not to say that asian women all embrace childishness rather than get forced into this narrow set of rules about what women should be like. one of the things that annoys me about my country (china) is how we're so desperate to copy each other. ""the nail that stands up is the first hammered down."" it's like we're afraid of being even slightly disadvantaged in our chase for success, so we do everything ""right"" in order to give ourselves the best chance, without regard to what success means. so you have to be ivory pale and underweight and obsessed with gucci to nab a wealthy shanghai banker? every fucking women tries to lighten her skin and go on the boiled veggies diet. so a wealthy shanghai banker *has* to have a model on his arm and drive a bmw? every fucking banker buys a model for mistress and a fleet of bmws.   if crying a lot in sex is what we're ""supposed"" to do, i'd guarantee everyone will do it even if they've only seen it off porn, and most of that porn has come from one country, and most of that porn in that one country has come from one stupid meme. trends are unstoppable here. even if they think a fantasy of submissiveness is stupid many women will still do it since they don't want to look unsophisticated.",1,1,-2

''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.  ms. levine argues that sex between teenagers and adults is not always wrong, and that many people are too quick to deny children and teenagers the right to make their own sexual decisions, often by labeling all such contact ''abuse.''  https://www.routledge.com/products/9780805809145  long-range effects of child and adolescent sexual experiences myths, mores, and menaces  making a unique contribution of placing the current sexual exploitation of children and adolescents firmly in its historical context, this book looks at the family's and society's roles in child and adolescent sex abuse. unlike most previous studies, this study allows a range of responses from negative to positive and avoids the methodological problems inherent in many other studies. most studies combine the age groups of children and adolescents, whereas this study separates these different age groups and compares the nature and outcome of sexual experiences of children with those of adolescents. utilizing sophisticated analytical measures, the author's findings repudiate many commonly held assumptions and serve to calm current hysteria regarding sexual abuse of minors.  http://www.alternet.org/story/12960/what_judith_levine_is_really_saying  levine has taken considerable heat for holding up as a ""good model"" the netherlands' age of consent law, under which young people ages 12-16 can legally consent to sex with older people who are not parents or authority figures, but under which charges can be brought if teens or their parents (with the approval of the council for the protection of children) believe the young person is being exploited. but her support for the dutch law cannot be taken out of the context of that country's social welfare system and relaxed cultural attitudes about sex.  in order ""to give children a fighting chance in navigating the sexual world,"" levine says, ""adults need to saturate it with accurate, realistic information and abundant, varied images and narratives of love and sex.""  if a person truly has the good of young people in mind, one would hope he or she would be interested in what research has to reveal. ""harmful to minors"" offers a plethora of findings, from studies showing that exposure to sexually explicit images does not harm children, to evidence that teens' sexual relationships with adults are not uniformly devastating, to research on the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education in delaying sexual activity.  allie kilpatrick is one source for levine. the book of allie is on routledge.  ask yourself why there is a systemic desire to suppress facts in favor of emotional arguments. why do you help perpetuate by downvoting my own posts on the subject and refusing to listen to alternative views?",1,0,-2

 and tons of mill yers do drugs today...  &gt; i'm sorry that you've polluted the world so much that it's going to be almost impossible to fix, but how is this my fault because i'm young  the green movement is also a boomer thing.  if you wanted to see a more fucked up world, see one where environmental reform never happened, and industry was like how it was during the first half of the 20th century.    but anyways.  the boomers all aren't one thing.  they aren't all former hippies and current conservatives.  no.  most grew rural.  many grew up in farms.  the country back then was much more conservative, in general, so boomers themselves were more conservative.  but this was the first time a really big generation gap happened, so boomers were stereotyped with being really liberal, when compared to today, they're not really *that* liberal.  they were very idealist youth and wanted sincerely to help the world, but some were conservative douchebags.  they will grow up to hold more or less the same beliefs they held when they were younger.  the conservative boomers became conservative adults, and the liberal ones remained liberal, but simply seem less liberal because the country, as a whole, has become *more* liberal since then...thanks to the active liberal boomers of the 60s and 70s.  those *liberal* boomers redefined what the status quo of society is, and now we're judging them based off this new line, as opposed to where they were.  the boomers aren't shitty people.  they're older people, and we're thus inclined to blame them for everything shitty, even though *we're* doomed to do shitty things when we come to power, and our children will blame us.  and they aren't a monolithic thing, but many, many different types of people who emerged generally more liberal in an era that was much more conservative--which means many of them were also conservative.    please take some time and consume some culture from the 60s.  movies, music, television is great.  i actually really enjoy watching 60s stuff because they show how much has changed.  you can get a real palpable sense of optimism and wanting to improve the world from the boomers, even from conservative-minded programs, like wait until your father gets home.  and throughout this media, its made very clear that the boomers were *just as angry* with the greatest generation, as *you*, franklin, are with *them*.  it's all cyclical.  note: i'm 26 years old.",1,-2,1

308092,"an excerpt from this article summarizing a number of research studies (http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-childhood-development/young-children-and-screen-time-television-dvds-computer/ ) -    research shows that, for children under 3, it‚Äôs not just what‚Äôs on the screen that matters but that it‚Äôs on at all. even if the tv is simply ‚Äúon‚Äù in the room where the child is playing, there are negative effects. for example, a study found that when an adult tv program was on in the room where babies or toddlers were playing, the children didn‚Äôt play as intently or as long as when the tv was off.3 ‚Äúbackground tv‚Äù also affects how a child interacts with his or her parents. when the tv is on, parents tend to be more distracted and less attuned to their children and their needs, reducing the quality of the interaction. young children are better able to complete complex and sophisticated tasks when they work with an adult or older child. when parents are attentive, children are also more likely to engage in independent goal-oriented play, higher quality play, and more focused play.4  what about tv programs intended for young children?  tv programs meant for babies and toddlers don‚Äôt really help them learn, and in some cases may slow down their learning. the more tv a child under 3 watches, the more likely he is to have trouble with reading and paying attention later on.5,6 a study from 2007 found that the more television a baby 8 to 16 months watches, the fewer words she knows.7 it doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs watching educational programs such as ‚Äúsesame street‚Äù because babies learn by interacting with real people ‚Äî not screens.8 early childhood experts agree that because infants and toddlers learn differently from older children and adults, they don‚Äôt benefit from direct teaching, which is the technique most commonly used in ‚Äúeducational‚Äù tv shows and baby videos. baby einstein brand videos are just one of the many videos developed and marketed to parents of very young children as ‚Äúeducational.‚Äù but with research showing no benefit, and under threat of a class-action lawsuit for deceptive advertising, disney began offering refunds for the videos in 2009.  not only has screen time been linked to language delay and smaller vocabularies, but studies show that the more television infants and toddlers are exposed to, the more likely they are to be inactive and obese,9 have difficulty sleeping,10 and show aggression. a study published in 2009 found that the more tv a 3-year-old was exposed to (watching it or in the room where the television is on), the more likely he or she was to act aggressively.11 screens provide a lot of stimulation, but it‚Äôs all energy ‚Äúin‚Äù and no energy ‚Äúout‚Äù or expended.  this may explain why young children act out after hours of watching, and why hours in front of the tv can lead to weight gain.12 research shows that with every hour of television, children consume an additional 167 calories.13 there are several reasons why children who spend a lot of time watching tv put on extra pounds: the number of food ads they are exposed to while watching can increase their appetites; many kids get into the habit of snacking while watching; and they burn off very few calories burned while watching.14  very young children learn best by relating to real live people, but they also learn by moving and doing. screen time detracts from children using their communication skills, and if they don‚Äôt practice their face-to-face interactions, they may lose their ability to evaluate emotions as well. part of the problem with screen time is that young children who watch tv and dvds or use computer games may be substituting these activities for free play. play, as it turns out, is the ultimate ‚Äúpersonalized educational curriculum,‚Äù with each child creating his own challenges and solutions ‚Äî at little or no cost. it teaches children to think abstractly about different situations and learn from other people‚Äôs perspectives, and it taps into their curiosity, motivating them to learn.15 play provides children with opportunities for different types of learning ‚Äì physical, social, emotional, intellectual, and language development ‚Äî in a context they understand. because of this, children are more likely to retain what they learn while playing. this is why child development experts insist that play is essential to social, cognitive, emotional, physical and moral development.16",1,-1,

587675,"in 1969, hale was again hard at work, unable to turn her back when confronted by a young, drug-addicted mother, too intoxicated to care for her baby. lorraine hale had encountered the young mother and her baby in dire circumstances and had sent the pair to clara hale for help. hale was then 64 years old, but she could not refuse the desperate pair. indeed, she had no choice when the mother disappeared while hale made a phone call in another room and left the baby behind. hale took the tiny baby girl and nursed her through drug withdrawals. the young mother had other children, and when she returned to hale's residence, she brought the others and left them, too. eventually she returned to take the children back. hale sent the family off with her blessing and never charged a penny for her help. within a few short weeks mother hale's apartment was packed from wall to wall with 22 drug-addicted babies. some of them were abandoned; some were orphaned. as mother hale told the tale to irene verag of newsday, ""before i knew it every pregnant addict in harlem knew about the crazy lady who would give her baby a home.""  slowly the hales (clara, daughter lorraine, and sons nathan and kenneth) allowed their lives to become virtually consumed by the effort to instill hope and to inject healing into the lives of addicted parents in harlem. the dedicated family worked day and night to support their cause. mother hale kept the frailest of the infants in her own bedroom, cradling them and walking the floors all night when necessary to comfort each one through the painful experience of detoxification. the younger hales took as many jobs as was necessary to bring in the funds to support the many, many children who came into their home. ""it wasn't their fault they were born addicted. love them. help one another,"" hale explained to others, as quoted in the chicago tribune.  it is not difficult to understand why those who knew hale adopted the appellation of ""mother"" when referring to her. it is difficult to comprehend the extraordinary sense of love and commitment that must have driven hale to suffer with these babies. keeping the babies clean and fed, a maxim at hale house, must have been a burden by itself. many were premature and sickly. some had become addicted to heroin in the womb. the babies often suffered from shaking fits and shivering. they would scratch at their own bodies and make themselves bleed. by far the majority of babies were born addicted to crack cocaine. developmental delays and passivity were commonplace symptoms among the babies at hale house. the detoxification process took weeks, and mother hale strictly refused to administer drug therapies to her youngsters. instead she comforted them through their withdrawals with personal care and compassion. ""we hold them and touch them,"" are often quoted words from hale, as noted in the new york times. she continued: ""they love you to tell them how great they are, how good they are. somehow, even at a young age, they understand that."" many of the youngsters were withdrawn in their behavior, but hale had a knack for bolstering fragile egos by providing the children with persistent verbal reinforcement, hugs, and smiles.  it was not long before the benevolent work of the hale family came to the attention of noteworthy philanthropic citizens, civil welfare bureaus, and public assistance agencies. the hales succeeded in securing a federal grant to renovate a five-story house on 122nd street. the spacious harlem brownstone was dubbed hale house. percy sutton, the famed philanthropist and president of the manhattan borough, arranged public funding. john lennon, of the world-famous beatles, donated thousands of dollars to hale house before he died, and the john lennon spirit foundation perpetuated his generosity with annual contributions after his death. other distinguished personalities also recognized the honorable work of hale house and contributed generously throughout the years in support of the cause.  by 1984 hale house had acquired a staff of seven college-educated care-givers along with a license to house fifteen children and a reputation for never refusing a child. in an interview with the los angeles times' beverly beyette, mother hale confessed that she would defy the authorities, but never would she leave a child in need. ""sometimes we have 30 or 40 [children],"" she confessed. ""[when inspectors come by] we hide them. they say, 'oh, mother hale, don't you give us any trouble.""' many of the children were referred by public agencies, including the police and hospitals. others were simply abandoned by their mothers.  the founding of hale house coincided closely with the isolation by medical science of the virus known to cause acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (aids) in humans. this deadly and incurable virus can be easily passed among drug addicts who share needles. the virus can also be passed from mother to infant. very little was known about the disease or its treatment at that time, but hale courageously accepted and cared for children who were known to be infected with the aids virus, loving and nurturing them the same as all the others.  in 1986, it was estimated that over 500 babies and toddlers had been rescued from drug addiction and the pain and loneliness of aids via hull house intervention. children of all races and backgrounds, from two weeks to three years, were sheltered and given the same personal care. the work at hale house did not stop with caring for the child victims of drugs and aids. the parents of hale house children were offered counseling and assistance in finding housing. the goal of hale house was to reunite the families by teaching the parents to shoulder the responsibilities of life. in order to be reunited, addicted parents were required to participate in a rehabilitation program of approximately 18 months in duration. during that time they were required to maintain contact with their children via weekly visitation. it is a testament to the success of the program that in 1989, after 20 years of operation, only 12 of the many hundreds of children who had passed through the doors of hale house had had to be placed for adoption. wayward youths and other addicts also received help and direction to lead useful lives.  mother hale was honored by president reagan during his state of the union address in 1985. she was invited to washington, d.c., where she was seated next to mrs. reagan during the speech when the president introduced her as ""a true american hero."" she received the applause of the supreme court and congress with her characteristic humility. in 1989, she was honored with the harry s. truman award for public service.  hale was honored many times during her life. despite the accolades, throughout the years, mother hale's thoughts were always with the needy children who were brought to her for assistance. in 1986, she told herschel johnson of ebony that, ""i'd like for it to go down in history that we taught our children to be proud black american citizens, and that they learned they could do anything, and that they could do it for themselves.""  in 1990, the 84-year-old hale was invited to los angeles as an honored speaker at a symposium for care givers and social workers who were working with the problem of infant drug addiction. the public by then was familiar with mother hale's work and her reputation. her words came nonetheless as a surprise to the professional crowd. mother hale, as quoted by beyette, had little else to say except, ""help one another. love each other,"" a refrain that she echoed many times throughout her life. dr. ernie smith, also in attendance at the conference in los angeles, heard the no-nonsense words of love from mother hale, and he reiterated the message. he said, according to beyette, ""well, mother hale didn't have a ph.d. or an m.d. or 'any other kind of d,' but she took in that first drug baby back in 1969. 'all she had was a rocking chair.""'  hale continued her work. ""when i get to heaven, i'm going to rest,"" she told beyette. as her health began to fail, she became too frail to hold even the tiny babies whom she loved so dearly. she died of complications from a stroke on december 18, 1992 in new york city. clara hale and hale house are credited with saving the lives and futures of many hundreds of babies over the years. at her funeral in new york she was eulogized by reverend carolyn knight of the philadelphia baptist church, who praised mother hale as ""the moral conscience of this [new york] city."" mother hale's work has been perpetuated by the hale foundation in new york.""

128723,"i'll respond to some of this:  &gt; what can that mean? that somehow iq is not heritable for poor children but is heritable for rich children? that‚Äôs impossible, surely. kids are kids; if iq is (let‚Äôs say) 50 percent heritable for human beings, doesn‚Äôt that have to mean that it is 50 percent heritable for rich and poor alike? the confusion arises partly from the difference between the underlying heritability of iq and its measurement over the life span. the correlation between the midpoint of parental iq and the child‚Äôs iq starts fairly small in early childhood and continues to increase. in the best review of twin studies, genes accounted for only about 22 percent of the variance at age 5, 40 percent at age 7, and a whopping 82 percent at age 18. so there‚Äôs lots of room to push and pull mental ability in infants and toddlers. it doesn‚Äôt mean that the reshaped mental ability will stay that way, but it will certainly produce changes in the measurement of it while the children are young.  i have no idea why you posted this. this has absolutely nothing to do with the relationship between ses and the heritability of iq.  and actually, if you continue reading the article, then author says this:  &gt; we know from other studies that low-ses mothers often don‚Äôt talk much to their children, often leave them in low-stimulation environments‚Äîoften, not to mince words, have terrible parenting practices. that indeed will produce a big environmental effect on low-ses infants that has no counterpart among high-ses children.  so your *own* source is admitting that low-ses children face an iq deficit because of environmental factors. did you read this? if so, why did you ignore it?  &gt;  two studies published this year have made life significantly more difficult for those who continue to be optimists. the first one is by florida state university‚Äôs kevin beaver and five colleagues, who asked how much effect parenting has on iq independently of genes. the database they used, the national longitudinal study of adolescent health, is large, nationally representative and highly regarded. the measures of parenting included indicators for parental engagement, attachment, involvement and permissiveness. the researchers controlled for age, sex, race and neighborhood disadvantage. their analytic model, which compares adoptees with biological children, is powerful, and their statistical methods are sophisticated and rigorous.   if you actually look at the full study, the ""measures"" of parenting that they studied did not seem to be significant. here is what the study considered to be parenting measures:  &gt; in order to examine the potential influence of parenting-related influences on verbal iq, eight parenting measures were included in the analyses...the first set of measures was directly related to the adoptive mothers of the youth and measured variation in maternal disengagement, maternal attachment, maternal involvement, and maternal education. first, following previous research (beaver, 2011), a five-item maternal disengagement was created that included items capturing the interaction between each respondent and their mother. adolescents, for instance, were asked to report how warm and loving their mother was, how much they talk with their mother, and the overall quality of their relationship with their mother. these items were then summed to create the maternal disengagement scale where higher scores represent more maternal disengagement (Œ± = .72). second, in line with previous research (schreck, fisher, &amp; miller, 2004), a two-item maternal attachment scale was developed. this scale included two questions asked to the adolescent about how close they feel to their mother and how much they think their mother cares about them. responses to items were summed with higher values representing more maternal attachment (Œ± = .70). third, and similar to previous scales (crosnoe &amp; elder, 2004), a maternal involvement index was included in the analyses. this index was developed from questions asking each respondent about their interactions with their mother during the previous four weeks. for example, youth were asked to indicate whether they had engaged in 10 different activities with their mothers during the previous four weeks, such as going shopping, playing a sport, and going to the movies together. responses were coded dichotomously (0 = no, 1 = yes) and were summed together to create the maternal involvement index (Œ± = .60). fourth, a maternal education variable was included that indexed the mother's highest level of education successfully completed.  &gt; the next series of scales were directly related to adoptive fathers of the youth and measured variation in paternal attachment, paternal involvement, and paternal education. similar to the maternal attachment scale, the paternal attachment scale was developed from two items. youth, for instance, were asked to report how close they feel to their father and how much they think their father cares about them. these two items were summed together with higher values representing more paternal attachment (Œ± = .77). second, paternal involvement was measured with the same strategy used to measure maternal involvement. specifically, youth were asked to report how many of ten different activities they had done with their father during the past four weeks. items were coded dichotomously and the responses were then summed to create a paternal involvement index (Œ± = .65). third, a paternal education variable was included that indexed the father's highest level of education successfully completed.  &gt; the final parenting measure included in the analysis was a parental permissiveness scale. this scale measured variation in the amount of monitoring, supervision, and autonomy that mothers and fathers provided to the youth. during wave 1 data collection, adolescents were asked questions about the degree to which their parents allow them to make their own decisions about watching television, their choice of friends, and their bedtimes. a total of seven items were included in the parental permissiveness index with all responses coded dichotomously (0 = no, 1 = yes). the scale was coded such that higher values represent greater levels of parental permissiveness (Œ± = .58). it is noteworthy to point out that this same scale has been used previously (barnes &amp; morris, 2012).  this isn't very convincing. no one over at atc asserts that iq is determined by ""how much they talk to their mother"" or whether they went to the movies recently with their mother. i don't believe anyone has asserted that a ""warm and caring"" mother has a significant impact on iq. if you want to find the impact of parenting on iq, then look at how much the parents push the child to succeed academically, for example.  &gt; how can parenting and socioeconomic status play such minor roles in determining iq, when scholars on all sides of the nature-nurture debate agree that somewhere around half of the variation in iq is environmental? the short answer is that the environment that affects iq doesn‚Äôt consist of the advantages that most people have in mind -- parents who talk a lot to their toddlers, many books in in the house for the older children, high-quality schools and the like. instead, studies over the past two decades have consistently found that an amorphous thing called the ‚Äúnonshared‚Äù environment accounts for most (in many studies, nearly all) of the environmentally grounded variation. scholars are still trying to figure out what features of the nonshared environment are important. peers? events in the womb? accidents? we can be sure only of this: the nonshared environment does not lend itself to policy interventions intended to affect education, parenting, income or family structure.  are you even reading what your posting? this just asserted that *half* of the variation in iq is environmental. this pretty much contradicts your entire thesis, and i don't think it's incompatible with the claims at atc  &gt; ""cultural differences"" aside, you would have to admit that whites and blacks in america have a similar environment, go to the same schools as mandated by the law, learn the same things, have affirmative action to put them into places based race and ethnicity, which clearly don't work because, as i said, iq is largely, around .8 to .9 percent heritable.  no. they don't live in the same environment. america is still extremely segregated by race. they don't go to the same schools as mandated by the law. the law mandates that students can't be *prohibited* from certain schools because of their race; not that everyone must attend the same schools. they don't learn the same things. and affirmative action only benefits a small portion of blacks.  &gt; to prove my assertion, the headstart program doesn't work and needs to go.  no one ever argued that headstart was successful.  but if you want to see an intervention program that *has* been successful, then search ""kipp middle schools"". or you can look at one of the recent threads posted at atc  &gt; the environment can moderate the effect of genes - a phenomenon called gene-environment (gxe) interaction. several studies have found that socioeconomic status (ses) modifies the heritability of children's intelligence. among low-ses families, genetic factors have been reported to explain less of the variance in intelligence; the reverse is found for high-ses families. the evidence however is inconsistent. other studies have reported an effect in the opposite direction (higher heritability in lower ses), or no moderation of the genetic effect on intelligence.  lol, this proves absolutely nothing. your study says right there that the evidence is inconsistent.   &gt;

[‚Ä¶] increases in heart rate of 55 bpm have been recorded [w/o effective anesthesia], i.e. ~ 1.5 the baseline rate. after circumcision, the level of blood cortisol [stress hormone] increased by a factor of 3-4 times the level before circumcision. [‚Ä¶] an infant may also go into a state of shock to escape the overwhelming pain. [‚Ä¶]  &gt; behavioural changes in infants resulting from circumcision are very common, an can interfere with parent-infant bonding and feeding. the aap task force on circumcision notes increased irritability, varying sleep patterns and changes in infant-maternal interaction after circumcision. [canadian investigators report](http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2/) that during vaccinations at age 4-6 months, circumcised boys had an increased behavioral pain response and cried for significantly longer periods than did intact boys. the authors believe that 'circumcision may produce long-lasting changes in infant pain behaviour'. that study suggests that circumcision may permanently alter the structure and function of developing neural pathways.  ---  [maimonides](http://books.google.com/books?id=sf6fbjne0yyc&amp;pg=pa65&amp;lpg=pa65&amp;dq=%22decrease+in+sexual+intercourse+and+a+weakening+of+the+organ+in+question%22) (for secular origins, [kellogg](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201109/circumcision-social-sexual-psychological-realities)):  &gt; [w]ith regard to circumcision, one of the reasons for it is, in my opinion, the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible. [‚Ä¶] how can natural things be defective so that they need to be perfected from outside, all the more because we know how useful the foreskin is for that member? [‚Ä¶] the sages, may their memory be blessed, have explicitly stated: ""it is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him."" in my opinion this is the strongest of the reasons for circumcision.

374730,"part 2:  i'm 21, but i feel simultaneously young, like i never had normal teenage years and am just starting now, and old, like i've had a moment of clarity about my life, some older person's wisdom that 1. i know nothing, (whereas in my teenage years i thought i knew everything, which gave me in my mind carte blanche to act like a jerk,) and that's normal, 2. i need to turn my life around, and stop hating everything and everyone and being angry, and 3. that i'm really young still, like if i was an old man who could go back and do things over and start at 20, that's how old i feel in my youth. i think a whole lot of my generation are going to start having this realization soon, and shed the angry nerd and angry jerk thing and work on developing nice, appealing, actually social and human personalities and improve looks. that's what i'm trying to do, is to fix my personality and looks in order to become, rather than a ""nice guy,"" or a ""bad ass,"" a ""good man."" i want to be a good man, a true man, an excellent man, in at least some field, with a passion and drive to improve in my passions and hobbies. like john c reilly in magnolia, and as you may or may not have guessed, my passion is film. but i do think a surge of that realization and urge to change will sweep my generation like a fire through a wheat field as we realize we don't want to wallow in anger anymore.  perhaps some national or global crisis will facilitate or necessitate that. perhaps some real, imminent crisis, a war, a bad depression, etc, will make my generation step up as we're about to wake up. like if your house was being burgled, and you had already started to wake up before everyone else, and then the burglar set off the alarm. i think my realization that i need to start actually having a nice personality and being a fucking human being was a product of natural and gradual change and maturity and really just ""growing up,"" and as i feel the malaise in my generation is widespread, perhaps the ""waking up"" will happen in a wave, and start before and after some crisis necessitates the waking up, the burglar alarm that makes us start working toward some important goal and re-asses what's really important and what we feel about our lives. as louis ck says, ""everything is amazing and nobody is happy,"" and later on the opie &amp; anthony show: ""there's still a lot of fat we need to shed from our country before we have to move grandma into the attic and sell apples on the street corner in order to not starve to death. we still have hot dog eating contests and the superbowl."" in putting these two maxims together, my theory is that our culture is superficial and frivolous and focused on the wrong things, which can spawn widespread malaise, unhappiness, and anger. ""we know things are bad, worse than bad."" the angry rationalist's reaction is therefore to bow out. if the society experiences some crisis wherein its priorities shifts and it self-corrects, the individual is more likely to align or care about the society and greater community, and work on himself in order to work on society. narcissism will be replaced with community and charity, frivolity by responsibility, selfishness by teamwork, etc, etc... and the thing is, the ""normal"" members of my generation are sort of already adept at efficiency, teamwork, all that good stuff. (my beef with them has always been that they're phonies, i go to a very capitalist right wing business school, full of these fledgling gordon gekkos, all very achievement and task oriented, but strident and grating in their networking and personalities. in the wake of some national crisis, i suspect mere quibbles over personality will disappear, although political differences remain. hopefully political discourse will become more civil.)  i hear a lot of angry older people (actually a minority of the generations, of course, but i think centered around generation x, which statistically had a difficult life, as there were so many of them born, and in a time where their parent's (who statistically, being born in the depression, had very easy lives, as there were so few of them born, don draper notwithstanding) divorce rates were high, saying that my generation is the worst one ever. and i actually believe that's true. but where our conclusions differ is that when i was a teenager i thought everyone else in my generation was the worst ever. now i realize i was part of the problem by not engaging, by removing myself, by treating other humans like garbage, by being an angry narcissistic baby, which is the worst cruelty one can inflict on fellow man. as the ancient greeks said, these actions, ""although causing no harm, cause pain."" so i do think my generation is generally the worst ever right now, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the anti-social meanness of the outcasts i once was, to the superficial phoniness of the achievement oriented, capitalist ""upper castes"" of my generation, the ""normals,"" as it were, but what generation isn't terrible in its adolescence?. but again where our conclusions differ is that i think my generation is going to experience a 180 degree shift in priorities, gradually or suddenly, and have to step up, and will hopefully become one of the greatest generations by the time we all come of age and mature.  whereas generation x statistically had difficult childhoods and adolescents, i think they're going to be powerful and effective leaders in middle age and elder age, perhaps during turbulent and awful time (think jon stewart). they're equipped to deal with it, and will stay consistent in that in order to be successful. i think my generation, meanwhile, has had easy childhoods and adolescence, and will have a difficult adult period, which will make us change and adapt but come out ""good."" in the end.  the stereotype of generation x was that they were depressed, cynical youth, but i think men like jon stewart and louis ck are actually the rule in that generation now rather than the exception, and will actually be great ""moralists"" when they run society. the boomers were never all that moral. they talked the talk but didn't walk the walk. jon stewart and louis ck, despite (or perhaps because they're comics) are sane voices in an insane world, and i'm amazed this insane world accepts them. they're only going to grow more important to us as they get older, i believe. as pamela adlon said of louis ck, ""you're not a comedian. you're a teacher."" listening to louis ck's rant (not an angry or loud rant, really, more of an ambling speech with some comedy) about modern society on opie &amp; anthony (part 1 of 3 of the greatest and most truthful thing i've heard in years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=indwcenfhtq&amp;feature=related ) makes me so hopeful. because despite the fact he's talking about how bad things are, he's shining a light on it. what a great man. and i think he's going to inspire my generation.  the ""angry nerd"" thing has got to go. nobody is genuinely nice anymore. but i think that's going to change. i hope.  tl;dr mean nerdy assholes fuck themselves over.  and of course this theory is very american-centric, although i am a canadian in canada. forgive me.",1,2,1
953696,"i notice you made no mention of having kids yourself. you'll hope for tolerance and patience from the public when you have one. i would never suggest that someone take a infant or toddler to the movies though.  as my children grew to the age where one would expect them to sit through a meal without acting up, i would take them to the car and sit in there with them untill they chilled. that's the only real time out that works with a child. it's work though, because you have to do the time out with them.  i hate using the term ""time out"". that's a load of crap. one time i went to pick up my son from a visit at grandpa's. my son had a bloody nose so i asked him what happened. ""he said i had a time out."" no hyper kid is going to keep their head in a corner so sooner or later you have to force it in there. i never did ""time outs"" with my kids except in the car where they aren't going anywhere.",1,-1,

966689,"thank you all for your replies so far! it's been extremely interesting and oddly comforting to see some of my own experiences with a particular family member having been played out with others.   my experience is quite long and since i've religiously kept record of the mishaps for the inevitable restraining order, i've a lot to work with here.  my fiance steven and i took over as the live-in care takers of his grandfather after his grandmother passed suddenly. though grandma was in poor health with her copd, she was always expected to live out grandpa. grandpa suffers from alzheimer's and pain issues that left him either confined to his scooter or bed. a few big issues, which were worsened by his alzheimer's is are his ocd and generally being a man-child.   making it into her 80s, grandma lived a life of physical and emotional abuse. her only relief was, ""i'll earn my reward in heaven."" aside from being ordered and literally pushed around, she also had to deal with grandpa's fixation on animals. cats ruled everything around him. he'd obsess every night if his cat wouldn't come in. he'd become irrate and lock grandmother on the porch all night until she'd be able to call him to say his prince had arrived.   mid-long story short, grandpa is a really hard person to take care of. his children are well aware of this and often get drunk at holidays and cry/yell out, ""that bastard dad killed mom."" when he died, 3/4 of his children flatout refused to have anything to do with the immediate problem of his care. only one lives in town, but her response was, ""i'm not giving up my life for *him!*"" this came from the woman who had her house/property taxes/any financial help she needed taken care of by her father.   in the end, my fiance's mother came up and spent a total of 6 months taking care of her father. she is a god damn saint and felt it was her duty. in this time, she was named executor of his estate. it should be noted that grandpa did quite well for himself and gathered a great deal of wealth and property through his hard work and smarts. my mil was in charge of bills and such (grandpa with his alzheimers and mail hoarding had long been unfit for this duty), so it only made sense.  by the end of that summer, she was feeling a great deal of guilt over missing another half-year of her children's lives and being away from her husband. her daughter was entering her first year of high school and her son has down's syndrome, so no one could blame her.   i quit my job and my 1-year-old, fiance, and i packed up to come take on duties. at first, grandpa had told us that we'd move into one of his other properties and just come by daily to cook, spend time with him, etc. we all decided that we'd settle into town with him for a few weeks and get a feel for what exactly his needs were.   forward a few months and we weren't ever quite comfortable with leaving him. our lives had become a mirror of his late wife's, only he didn't quite love us enough as he did her, so we experienced an added bit of cruelty. there were enemas demanded. insults and fine china were hurled across rooms when we took an added five seconds before arriving after being called upon to place his coffee mug on the table 7 inches from his arm. we were told, ""i accidentally dropped it and it rolled across the room."" it was the worst when his genius came out and we knew damn well that the smirk on his face was in indication of his still keen ability to manipulate.   my gripe isn't even with him. though i had no clue what i was getting into at 19 and how it'd effect my years to come, i wouldn't change this growing-up-experience for anything. so what if i had to be highly medicated?   **this is where my actual story starts!!! sorry. a bit of back story was necessary to understand the situation.**  so it turns out that grandma spawned a walking, constantly talking mass of feces. grandpa's son rolled into town (he lives at the opposite end of the state). he'd just been fired from his job and spent the first few hours of his visit talking about how he'd often just sit in his vehicle during work calls listening to music instead of doing his job. he bragged about it. in the next sentence, he'd say that *the* blacks and *the* mexicans were the reason his job had been taken away. right, dude. i didn't pop off at the mouth, because it's not exactly my style, but i took a few good mental notes of his train of thought.   a few beers in and trips to the side of the house to ""smoke some herb"" went by and he started broing out about how he came up here to start getting a few of his (read: grandpa's) properties under his ""belt,"" while he ""rode the unemployment wave.""   whoops. he found out that months ago grandpa had planned on us moving into one of his (read: ""uncle"" willy's) homes. we didn't know it, but all hell was about to break loose.   we were on the back porch taking one of our much deserved breaks from indentured servitude (we were apparently wrong to think we could have an extra ten minutes or two to ourselves when a family memb was in town, as we assumed they were there to pick up at least the slightest bit of slack), when we heard screaming. this was grandpa's volume of choice, so we assumed willy might have been in some deep shit, so we rushed in to try to calm grandpa down.   nope! willy was yelling at grandpa about how he'd given *his* home away. it ended with grandpa coming around the bend to yell at us in front of his son that he'd never told us any such thing and that whoever told willy such a thing lied and we were the root of it. i'd never seen such a thing.   the basis has been set, so i'll get to the meat.  we became willy's targets. on various trips and occasions (and these are justbthe times i heard with my own big ears), my fiance, 1-year-old son and i **murdered** grandma. willy's efforts of screaming at grandpa for hours would tire him, so he'd create these scenarios where he'd try to convince grandpa to kick us out. he'd make up different causes of death and even employ the use of time machines and teleportation devices to explain exactly what we'd done to grandma. we (he even added that our infant was also involved) sold drugs and raped and murdered people. i. shit. you. not.   worst was when he'd bring his sweet son to town. his son has actually tackled his father when he was spewing his abuse at me. this particular time, grandpa had just been admitted to hospital and i made the mistake of asking if he knew where grandpa had last placed his rosary. ""i'm not your fucking maid you pieces of shit. i'm tired of fucking cleaning up after your fucking messes."" his son is an absolute angel. he actually breaks down in tears every time something like this has happens and says sorry to me!   willy has brought grandpa in to a lawyer to have properties signed over to him (g-pa's still a smart enough cookie to know better) and even tried to sue for conservatorship (he made the mistake of going to a lawyer who's friends with the family and the whole situation was made allmthe gas at the next family wedding).   i've had to change the locks, up my dose, and crawl into my ""panic closet"" every time i hear a car pull on the street because of this pos. he's a narcissist/sociopath (imo), which his siblings acknowledge. why the hell do they still take his calls or allow him in their houses for holidays when he does the same shit to them? can anyone shed light on this?   in my family, if someone's only goal in life is to be a complete assfuck, they'd be excommunicated. why is this behavior allowed?  **tl;dr:** don't read. there's a lot of fantastic stories here. i just had an extra beer or two and did a fixated vent.",1,1,-1

392613,"&gt;convenient of you to ignore two of the three points that i made.  you've got to be kidding me. i addressed the other three further down in my post. sorry, here, have a wall of text your majesty.   &gt;changing the name of something doesn't make it any different...an abortion is still the same event in reality whether you call it baby-killing or abortion  wrong. an abortion is terminating a pregnancy. ""baby"" is not a medical term, the proper term is ""infant"", which is the result of the very last stages of pregnancy, after labor and/or birth. **""baby-killing""** is an act of homicide against an already-born infant, and if you know if that happening, i would hope you would go to your local police department and file a report immediately. words and their meanings aren't there for ornamental purposes.   &gt;unilateral adoption is quite legal and commonplace in america, and other countries. women are under no obligation to involve, or even inform the father.  which may be true, but it doesn't mean fathers are never involved. in those situations, it's really not anybody's business why the father may not be involved except the couple in question and their family. mra speculation about other people's family planning choices are useless and fucking nosey, and most likely incorrect anyway. it could be the dad's choice, the mom's choice, his grandmother's choice, nobody knows. it's not our family so it's not our business. tend your own garden.   &gt;do you realize that giving a baby up for adoption need not involve a pre-arranged family that will take in the child?  please, enough with the hypocrisy. let's not even pretend you give a shit about where the baby is placed or what happens to it, seeing that you're arguing for its legal and sanctioned abandonment by it's own parents.    &gt;do you realize that many babies put in the system do not end up getting adoptive parents?  let's not pretend you give a shit about that either. as long as a baby is an opt-out situation, that's all you're concerned with and you know it. for what it's worth, i wouldn't put my child into the adoption system if i gave birth. i know too much about how shady and fraudulent it is.   &gt;your ignorance of the facts means you are not able to accurately discuss these issues.  there goes miss cleo again with his amazing powers of jack-squat, making another completely irrelevant assessment.        i am accurate about one thing; the sex-ed you received, if any, was a sham. you must've come up in the dubya years of abstinence-only sex education mandates. you remind me of him, actually.   your insistence that this ridiculous topic we are discussing isn't easily avoidable is hilarious. millions upon millions of people manage to go their whole lives without dealing with safe haven laws, coerced adoptions, and abandoning their fucking kids. the solution has been used for millennia and it's is an effective one. if you don't know how to properly use a condom each and every time you have sex to prevent these problems, that doesn't mean others are required to lend your obsession any credence in discussions on said problems.   when told to wear a condom, this is the mra mantra: ""yeah but what if she does blah blah blah blah blah"". great, but we were asking about the guy, and the choices he makes. a topic that gets little to no focus compared to the hand-wringing about what women are doing to steal teh spermz. because single motherhood on barely any child support is such a lucrative income. mras will cop-out until the end of time before they will say they know the laws are complicated and suck a lot of the time **for everybody**, so they will *wear a condom* instead of trying to chase their dream of child abandonment. as a feminist, my ideal world has equality and humanism, but as an adult, i learned to accept that life isn't always fair. :)  wear a condom and fuck your partner and leave feminism out of it already because, frankly, responsible sexually active people are sick of this financial abandonment nonsense being discussed constantly, **as if it's feminist's fault for not doing more to keep you from putting your sperm in vaginas**.  &gt;the fact of the matter is that a woman, even if she births the child, is never forced to raise said child.   yeah, becoming a parent is a total a picnic for the woman. they throw single parents parades and everything, you know. by the way, i don't believe your above statement. federal and state laws contradict you. got a link or something? parents have immunity in some areas, but some parental obligations may linger depending on the situation. every situation is a different complex tragic story. the ""safe haven"" laws weren't drafted out of some desire to give lazy mothers the same opportunity to be deadbeats that fathers have always had. it was created to save newborns from being abused or harmed or killed. just because some people here don't care about their offspring doesn't mean the child shares that luxury. safe havens are utilized mostly by teens and the very poor. sometimes parent/children are reunited. this is just not not as simple as mras want to make it.   &gt;she has a choice. men do not.  celda, it takes so little time to read a bit about [the truth and complexities behind these types of laws](https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse.aspx) that i think you just have a different google than the rest of us. are you behind the chinese firewall or something?

543552,"i completely agree that it is not only lowering the age of consent that would accomplish the changes needed in society.  i don't even think it should be done as a first step.  the fact that our society developed in such a way that we can't provide for young people starting families is a very real issue.  luckily, we have developed very reliable ways to entirely divorce sexuality from reproduction.  in reality, this has always been the case.  in the past, before we had birth control, abortion and infanticide were simply a fact of life.  people didn't debate whether it was right or wrong, it was viewed as as natural as sickness and death of the elderly.  as we developed more sophisticated birth control methods, then infanticide fell away, and then the pro-life movement started moving against abortion.   right now, though, we have the technology to provide kids with the birth control necessary to protect themselves.    &gt;in our current society, it takes much longer to reach a point where we can provide for ourselves and our offspring.  yes, and i would argue that is a grave handicap and the source of almost all mental illness in our society.  as society developed, we reached a point where companies needed well-educated workers and had little use for an uneducated workforce.  society then faced a problem.  they needed more years to educate their young, but the natural drive of the young was to start families in early adolescence.  at that time, we didn't know much about neurobiology.  we didn't know about lobes and cortexes and neural networks and the like.  and religion had a big hold on the populace.  so society moved (not necessarily consciously) in what i think is a wrong direction.  they started infantilizing their young.  they had another option.  they could have continued teaching their children (meaning 'next generation', not necessarily prepubescent as the word really means) in such a way that they developed the skills and emotional maturity to start a family and acknowledge their natural desires and provide outlets for them while continuing their education. i believe that would be the better way to go and would result in less psychological harm.  the course taken was one of sheltering, of starving the growing brain from the experiences it needed to properly develop.  when a human being has ""crises"" (extremely emotional events, from your first skinned knee to your first blowjob to your marriage) it causes brain development.  that is what causes the brain to develop.  without those crises, the brain does not develop.  &gt;we have evolved such that sexual maturity happens years before we have the higher reasoning skills that we develop as our frontal lobe matures (which usually reaches full maturity as late as age 25)   as i said a bit ago, the brain only develops when it has intense emotional experiences.  learning information is not brain development (well, there's debate about that, but its clearly not development on the scale of things such as having an existential moment when you realize you and everyone else is going to die).  when people have children, there are substantial brain structure changes.  when people form relationships with other people, brain structure changes.  when people form different kinds of relationships (say, sexual), brain structure changes.  it can even change from deep contemplation and study.  it is not necessary that we allow adolescents to actually give birth and have children, the same development could probably be reasonably assured if we simply exerted the effort to teach them.  if we would allow them to have a multitude of extra-familial relationships with people of all ages (platonic), they will still develop the complexity in that frontal lobe.  as it is now, the frontal lobe sits idle, never being stressed.  we even censor their entertainment, believing we are ""protecting"" them.  what we are doing is starving their brain of what it needs to develop.  it is no different from keeping a child locked in a closet and forbidding them from learning to read or write or learning to speak.  if they do not learn it while their brain is plastic and during the time period during which the brain evolved over millions of years to develop, it won't happen.  they will grow up with a partially formed brain, unable to deal with complex emotional issues, probably suffering from depression and anxiety disorders, unable to maintain long term relationships (50+% divorce rate ring a bell?), etc.  and they certainly won't have the emotional maturity when they have kids to step back and say ""this experience will be overwhelming/scary/devastating/enthralling to my child but i need to let them figure their way through it on their own so that they learn"" when they have their own kids, and the cycle continues.  pregnancy is so very easily avoidable that i don't see why it warrants as much concern as you give it.  adolescents are more than capable of understanding how and why to use prophylactics.  i grew up in the 90s.  throughout my pubescence, i and all of my peers were inundated with information about aids.  my father vividly described to me how entirely my life would be destroyed if i ever got a girl pregnant.  even the slowest of kids can understand this.  they are biologically predisposed to.  the kids that you see that don't use condoms or whatever do so because they've been improperly educated.  they've been exposed to absolute idiots who preach that condoms kill the sensation or, much much more often, that abstinence is the only birth control and that condoms have a high failure rate.  those kids don't see the point.  if it is explained to them before it is an issue, there will be few problems.  &gt;it comes down to the simple argument that children are different from adults. they do not have enough physical brain and mental maturity, nor enough experience to make certain decisions  children are different from adolescents, that is true.  adolescents are not different from adults except in very, very, very minor ways that are entirely tied up with how they are raised as children and what experiences they are able to have as an adolescent.  adolescents learn from mistakes much faster than children (there was just a study about this on reddit a couple days ago) and understand long-term consequences.  they understand the nature of mortality and death.  they can easily understand that once they hit puberty they start taking a birth control pill or using a birth control device as a simply matter of course, as simple as getting braces for crooked teeth or glasses for poor eyesight.  one difference there is, however, between adolescents and adults, is that adolescents desperately need to have these experiences.  adults, with their almost entirely static brains, can't learn from those experiences.  adolescents, if they don't have them early enough, can never develop entirely.  &gt;i remain unconvinced that simply changing the age of consent will remove enough of the potential harms that exist. i think that most of the harms arise out of other complications from our modern society.  in that we completely agree.  i think society needs to start by education children with the intent of raising them to be competent adults.  i think that children and adolescents need to develop a multitude of extra-familial relationships so that they can experience many different perspectives and develop their own personality.  they need to learn how to carry themselves to gain respect from peers, and also from elders and juniors.  right now, they are usually locked into their peer group and their immediate family and very little, if anything, else.  they need to learn responsibility, of the consequences to their actions, etc.  the big change that needs to happen is that people need to see adolescents, even young ones of 12 or 13, as adults simply missing experience.  treat them and educate them like you would a guy whose on his first day at work.  they are competent individuals.  they are actually far, far better at learning than you are.  they are more resilient and robust than you are in every conceivable way.  and there is absolutely no value to being an invalid.  if you've got a 12 year old who couldn't live by themselves for 6 months if you left them a few thousand dollars, then you're a bad parent.  it is ridiculous how poorly people treat their kids, and how badly society looks down on them.  we used to think that the worst case scenario is that they simply waste some of the early part of their life in idle playtime which really isn't so bad at all.... now we know that this has extremely grave consequences to their psychology.  it's nothing short of child abuse to shelter kids as much as they are as far as i can see.   society will need to change a great deal with their attitudes towards sex also before an elimination of the age of consent would be useful as well.  if people maintain this bizarre notion that sex is something sacred to be put on a pedestal and handled like some ultrarare perversion that only the depraved commit except in the privacy of a darkened bedroom with a spouse, any sexuality they would develop would likely be as dysfunctional as the sex life of most people nowadays.  fraught with shame, fear, desires they are too embarrassed to even discuss, no understanding of it as a necessary and important part of being a human being, as acceptable to share with others as eating a meal together.",1,1,-1
108586,"i think about this a lot. for a long time i've been trying to determine if childhood was really as golden as i recall or if the world has changed in some fundamental way that makes now worse. i think the answer is that as a child i was allowed to live in a bubble and behind a wall of protection that separated me from the reality of the world was created by my family. my grandparents on all sides were survivors of the great depression and ww2 and my parents the earliest baby-boomers. i think my grandparents and parents created this separation on purpose, as a matter of fact i didn't even have friends outside the family until third grade. we lived in the country and we were very poor, but i never really knew that. my world was filled with imagination and it seems every toy i owned was an empty vessel i had to use imagination to fill. i played outside from dawn to dusk, drinking from a water hose and eating from the fruit trees my great grandmother had planted during the depression 40 years before i was born. i explored endless expanses of old forest but to me they were battlefields in europe, or yavin, and i was a general leading my dog, little cousin, and the rebel alliance against darth vader, nazi's, and skeletor. during the summer my world was green and hot, but in the fall when all the shadows grew long and days short my green world would explode into reds and yellows and i can still smell the musk of fallen leaves on chilled air. christmas was a time of magic, the world was decorated in colored lights and people were nicer. haunting melodies would fill my heart as silver bells and the first noel played on the radio. i can still close my eyes and feel the warmth and peace of the home i had.  then i grew up and in my late teens went into the army, after that i moved to north georgia, and in my late twenties i came home and it was all gone. not just the feelings, the places. road construction and development demolished my forest, including an ancient pecan tree that was the center of my world as a child. rolling hills leveled to build subdivisions, and the treasures i buried in the earth now under concrete and endless rows of the same middle class home. i can't revisit my childhood or put it to rest because it was eaten by the american dream. my great grandmother and her family had lived there since before there was an america, we are cherokee and avoided the relocation that you know as the trail of tears, we looked white and i can't prove it but i believe it's because my ancestors intermarried with pre-columbian explorers.   what i miss most about my childhood is the feeling of home, and what drives me is the desire to recreate it somehow before i die, so my children and grandchildren can know what that really feels like.",1,2,1

428873,"here's the whole thing at once - complete with all images reuploaded to imgur - just for you:  [**surreal estate**](http://i.imgur.com/5v9zdsf.jpg)  in cities: skylines (read our review here), you can follow around the various npcs who move into your city. however, when there's tens of thousands of citizens, and you're swamped with the tasks related to building and managing a metropolis, it can be hard to keep tabs on a single person's life for very long, and difficult to find them again later. i thought i'd fix this problem by creating a city in which only a single home could be built. then i'd see who moved in and keep track of their lives. here's what happened.  [**welcome to the empty neighborhood**](http://i.imgur.com/lw41ebf.jpg)  i begin by drawing some roads, but when it's time to zone them, i use the smallest brush to make only a single square available for residential housing. i've enabled the game's money and building cheats, and i put in everything else necessary for a city: a power plant and electrical lines, water and sewage pipes, a police station and fire department, schools, a garbage incinerator, and a couple unique buildings. it's a functioning city, but there's only enough real estate space for a single family. then, i wait.  [**crest heights**](http://i.imgur.com/ul7nt3x.jpg)  i'm about to give up‚Äîit's been quite a while and nothing has happened‚Äîwhen suddenly a tiny house is built. there are no residents, but i give the lilac residence, as it calls itself, its own district. i pass the time by creating a bus line that runs by the house, and make other improvements to the city in case anyone ever moves in. no one moves in. buses begin trundling by, carrying no passengers. i wait some more.  [**the telltale scooter**](http://i.imgur.com/btpmc4x.png)  as i'm scrolling around the map, i suddenly notice a little blue scooter parked at the curb near the house. its info tag says it's owned by oscar richardson. i've got a tenant! the scooter also tells me oscar works at the town's incineration plant. that means, essentially, he takes his own garbage to work and sets it on fire. he seems happy about it, though. i click on the house: along with oscar, there is another adult and two teens. i've got a family! now, to spy on them.  [**the invisible family**](http://i.imgur.com/vmeguvl.jpg)  having only four citizens in the city, you'd think it would be easy to spot them. it ain't. clicking the high school tells me two students are inside it, and i also determine that someone has enrolled in the college down the street. but i don't actually see anyone, including oscar, outside. days pass and i still haven't actually seen the richardsons in person.  [**nancy richardson**](http://i.imgur.com/gzcd7e0.jpg)  finally, i spot someone. it's nancy richardson, the other adult, and she's headed to university, the city's cleverly named university. she walks right past the line of eager, empty buses and heads there on foot. i follow her all the way there until she disappears inside. i don't see anyone else for a long while.  [**ashton mason**](http://i.imgur.com/1xpqpt9.jpg)  i spot someone else walking through the city and get excited, but it turns out to be a wealthy elderly tourist. i find his suv parked nearby. in a city with a number of tourist attractions including a stadium and a museum, he's decided to visit a small playground. a small, empty playground. have it your way, mason, you old weirdo.  [**ashton richardson**](http://i.imgur.com/31keelg.jpg)  finally, one of the teenagers appears, ashton. five people in the city, and two have the same first name. he's walking from the house to a plaza. as i watch, he stops, puts a skateboard on the ground, steps onto it, and does a few ollies. that's teenagers for you, right? always with the ollies. meanwhile, more tourists have begun to arrive, some by plane, no doubt having read rave reviews of our small empty park. i build a metro line because the tourists been walking in from the airport, dragging their rolling suitcases behind them.  [**oscar richardson**](http://i.imgur.com/cwuhmzz.jpg)  oscar, the richardson family patriarch, finally appears. he takes a bus outside his house and rides to work. well, part of the way to work. the busline only goes downtown, and he has to walk the rest of the way to the incineration plant to burn his family's garbage. i add a new bus line that will drop him off right outside the plant.  [**katie richardson**](http://i.imgur.com/vslerhx.jpg)  my city is growing, as much as it can. i notice the population has increased to five: oscar and nancy have had a third child. nancy has graduated university u, and is now working at the elementary school teaching her only student, the kid she and oscar just had. thanks to everyone (except oscar) becoming educated, the house has leveled up as well, though i thought the original house looked cooler. i also finally spot katie richardson returning home from high school.  [**career path**](http://i.imgur.com/hnfztiz.jpg)  oscar is the only one with no education, which makes me sad. his lack of book smarts is also preventing the house from leveling up again. i delete the garbage incinerator building, hoping he'll take his demotion as a sign he should go to school. it's not necessary: the house levels up because ashton has become well educated. oscar doesn't go to school, but gets a job at the presumably empty stadium, which has been visited by a total of three tourists. i build a new bus line just to transport him there.  [**terry richardson**](http://i.imgur.com/42cske5.jpg)  cities: skylines has an in-game version of twitter i'm so used to ignoring that i've only just now realized the richardsons must be the only ones using it. sure enough, the feed is full of their banal chirps about smoke detectors and beautiful sunrises. i'm not sure where they're seeing these sunrises: the game has no day/night cycle. maybe they're all high on bus fumes. their chirps allow me to finally locate the newest member of the family, though, terry richardson. she's in the park with nancy. she's described as a teen but she looks like a little kid. she's also playing with a stuffed animal.  [**jobs**](http://i.imgur.com/asgugy6.jpg)  ashton and katie have both graduated high school. ashton is working at the stadium with his dad, probably pressured into carrying on the family business of morosely standing around in an empty stadium. katie works at the observatory, which is much cooler. at this point, everyone pretty much has their own private bus to take to work, though katie prefers to walk.  [**and then there were four**](http://i.imgur.com/hweczoi.jpg)  i notice one day that the town's population has decreased by one. uh-oh. i check in with all the richardsons. katie is missing. like any concerned city god, i immediately check the local hospital and doctor's offices, as well as the two cemeteries. nothing. i finally realize what happened. like many young adults, katie simply moved out of her parents' home. with only one house in town, she had no choice but to move out of town completely. she's gone.  [**empty nest**](http://i.imgur.com/vfevunv.jpg)  ashton moves out soon after. time passes, and terry leaves the nest, too. i'm down to two citizens, and they're both now seniors, and retired. oscar spends his time in a park, wandering around and occasionally chirping. nancy does the same. weird thing is, they do it in two different parks, located across the street from one another.  [**parks and wreckage**](http://i.imgur.com/vjcdjis.jpg)  i'm a little bothered that they're not spending their autumn years in the same park together. did they agree to meet in the park but didn't specify which one, and they're simply both waiting for the other to arrive? or do they just not care for each other because she let the kids move away and he still smells like burnt garbage? i watch them for weeks as they mill around, just yards apart. they never return home. is the empty nest simply too painful now?  [**it tolls for she**](http://i.imgur.com/brwghxj.png)  as i'm watching nancy's park, i see a vehicle come around the corner, one i haven't seen in this city before. it's a hearse. nancy is still alive, but the mortuary seems to have gotten a hot tip. the driver, albert ward, gets out, unconcerned that he's blocking the richardson family private bus fleet. nancy is now dead. ward and his partner load her into the hearse and drive to the cemetery. this is terrible, but not the most terrible thing that will happen today. not by a long shot.  [**dazed and confused**](http://i.imgur.com/sidxqi7.png)  oscar is still standing in his park when the hearse arrives for him not much later. they load him in, as they did nancy, but he's not dead. he's alive. he's confused. i bet he is. ""what's happening? where are you taking me? my wife was supposed to meet me in the park. do you know where my wife is?"" yes. they know where his wife his.  [**oh no**](http://i.imgur.com/np6uq5z.jpg)  he's still alive in there.  [**just visiting**](http://i.imgur.com/ebinr8u.jpg)  as the hearse arrives, oscar's status changes briefly, so briefly i don't manage to get a screenshot of it. but i swear it says 'visiting: cemetery.' is that what they told him? is that how they got him in the car? ""come on, pops, we're going to visit the cemetery."" then, he's in the ground. visiting hours are over, oscar. you're now a permanent resident. at least he and his wife are in the same park for a change.  [**new beginnings**](http://i.imgur.com/gixqqmh.jpg) my chirper feed is still going off. is oscar chirping about smoke detectors from his coffin? no, it's several other people, members of a new family. they've moved into old richardson place. and why wouldn't they? great location. two parks nearby. amazing bus service. no noisy neighbors.  life goes on.",1,1,1
273893,"&gt;now, suggesting that it would make sense to be attracted to 20, 25 and 30 year olds simply does not hold in a world where people rarely lived that long to begin with.  life expectancy in the upper paleolithic age once you made it to 15 years old was 54. they had very high infant and child mortality rates, but if you made it to being a teenager, you were pretty good to go. so really the reproductive age was about the same as ours.  and 14 would still not be the age at which to successfully produce offspring. as i've already noted, girls who have only recently had menarche are far worse at giving birth to children than 20-35 year old women. they also aren't as fecund as older women (a high percentage of a woman's menstrual cycles for the first few years after menarche don't actually involve ovulation). but, here's some science backing me up:  &gt;adolescent mothers [&lt;=19] had significantly lower weight gain in pregnancy and higher rates of low birth weight compared to the adult mothers  [maternal weight gain and pregnancy outcome in adolescent girls in ibadan, nigeria](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22428513)  &gt;compared to women between the ages of 20-35, pregnant women under 20 are at a greater risk for death and disease including bleeding during pregnancy, toxemia, hemorrhage, prolonged and difficult labor, severe anemia, and disability.  [consequences of early childbearing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12264602)  &gt;adolescent growth in girls less than 16 years who have a child nearly stops, even if nutrition is good. maternal mortality among adolescents is higher than it is among women aged 20-30. maternal morbidity is also higher in girls aged 15-19. the main pregnancy complications are severe anemia, renal complications, eclampsia, pre-eclampsia, and labor complications (e.g., vesico-vaginal or recto-vaginal fistulas). they are most common in the youngest adolescents. poor quality of prenatal care contributes greatly to poor pregnancy outcomes. prematurity and low birth weight are also more common among adolescents than other age groups. the perinatal mortality rate of infants born to adolescent mothers is also greater: 104-120% greater in sao paulo, brazil and 73% greater in india.  [adolescent pregnancy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12290181)  &gt;the authors attribute the greater frequency of premature births among 9-16 year olds to immaturtity of uterine muscle fiber, deficient prenatal care, and the emotional tensions to which the adolescents were subjected, as well as to medical complications of pregnancy and general maternal physical immaturity.  [pregnancy in the adolescent. ii. comparative study between primigravida from 9 to 15, 16 and 17 years old](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12267372)  &gt;anthropologist laila williamson notes that ""infanticide has been practiced on every continent and by people on every level of cultural complexity, from hunter gatherers to high civilizations, including our own ancestors. rather than being an exception, then, it has been the rule.""  &gt;joseph birdsell believed that infanticide rates in prehistoric times were between 15% and 50% of the total number of births, while laila williamson estimated a lower rate ranging from 15% to 20%. both anthropologists believed that these high rates of infanticide persisted until the development of agriculture during the neolithic revolution. comparative anthropologists have calculated that 50% of female newborn babies were killed by their parents during the paleolithic era. decapitated skeletons of hominid children have been found with evidence of cannibalism. the children were not necessarily actively killed, but neglect and intentional malnourishment may also have occurred, as proposed by vicente lull as an explanation for an apparent surplus of men and the below average height of women in prehistoric menorca.  this is just from the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infanticide#paleolithic_and_neolithic) article on infanticide. it was all over the place. women would abandon healthy infants for any number of reasons.  which agrarian societies didn't know that sex leads to pregnancy? i've never read anything suggesting that.",1,0,0

""see you soon, jeany."" the guard waved before returning to his post. she walked on, somewhat awkwardly, as all the tension in her muscles slowly eased.  mihla arrived at the train station and walked straight to the benches. they were all empty. her heart sank as she took a seat. she leaned forward and placed her head in her hands, struggling to hold back tears. suddenly there was a slight echo of shuffling footsteps just behind her. she sprang to her feet and spun around. a tall man approached and set down his briefcase.  ""jeany!"" he threw his arms out and leaned towards her. ""make this look natural,"" he said, whispering through his smile. she embraced him tightly. ""shall we find ourselves a drink?"" he picked up his briefcase and put his around around her, lightly pushing to get her feet moving. they climbed the steps and took a left once they got to street level. ""you're late,"" he said. ""i had nearly gone.""  ""i'm sorry,"" she said.  ""no matter, let's get this done,"" the man said. they turned a corner and ducked into an alley way. the briefcase whirred as he opened it and several lights blinked on and off briefly before resting in a solid state. ""okay, it's ready. place your hands in the two squares there."" she did as instructed and immediately there was a shrill beeping sound, followed by more whirring noises. a shiny gelatinous substance filled the squares and a thin layer coated her hands. it was hot, and she fought the urge to pull them away. there was another beep and the thing seemed to be powering itself down. ""now remove your hands, and shove them in the snow for about ten seconds. that'll help it to solidify faster."" again she followed his instructions. ""now this will start to break down in an hour at best, so whatever you do, don't get off the train until you get to where you're going."" she nodded. he snapped the briefcase shut and tipped his hat. ""good luck, jeany ellslund."" with that he was gone.  she got back to the station just as her train was arriving. she took a seat on the bench and watched as the doors opened, releasing a flood of people. after several minutes the crowd had cleared and the announcement for boarding passengers was made. she stood up and walked slowly to the attendant. he held his screen out to her. ""identity please."" she placed her hand on the screen and watched the outline form around her fingers and palm with a sequence of flashes. it beeped and the attendant flipped it around to read the results. ""welcome aboard ms. ellslund.""  it had taken five hours for the train to make its way completely across the country. she was awoken by the announcement of the last stop, her destination. the sun was just starting to creep over the horizon as she stepped off the train. in the hurried crowd she spotted a lanky boy watching the faces as they passed. they made eye contact and he approached. ""cousin mihla?"" she smiled.  ""you must be garrent."" she dropped her bag and hugged him.  the trip to the farm was a quiet one. as they winded their way down a long dirt road, mihla couldn't help but stare in awe at the countryside. she'd never been out of the city. she'd never seen mountains, and rivers, and long rolling acres of grass and trees. garrent shifted in his seat. ""granny's told me lots about you."" mihla turned to him and offered a weak smile.  ""i don't remember much of her. it was such a long time ago.""  ""yeah... that was a while before i was born,"" garrent said. he focused his attention back on the road. occasionally he glanced back over. she suspected there was something on his mind.  ""something bothering you?"" she said.  ""no. it's just..."" he shifted uncomfortably. ""so you're an actual fugitive now? they're looking for you in the city and everything?"" mihla took a deep breath.  ""yes. they are,"" she said. ""it's complicated."" she fiddled with a flap on her coat and looked out the window again. they made the rest of the trip in silence.  mihla stared in disbelief at the large sprawling home as they were pulling up. she'd only ever seen city dwellings, small and efficient spaces tightly packed together. garrent took her bag and led her to the front door. just beyond, and old woman rose from her chair to greet them as they entered.  ""aunt lundy!"" mihla said and wrapped her arms around her. lundy pushed her out to arms length and looked her up and down.  ""my my child, how you've grown!"" she hugged her again. ""garrent, take her coat. have a seat child! i'll get you something to drink."" garrent couldn't help staring as mihla removed her coat and handed it to him. lundy returned with a glass of water and stopped, putting her hand up to her lips. she walked over and put wrinkled hand on mihla's stomach. ""what a tragedy. what a shame,"" she said, gently rubbing.  later that evening, gathered around the fire, lundy recounted the tale of bahn. ""long ago, in my grandparent's generation, a great disease spread across the world. it happened quietly at first, and spread so quickly that no one could figure out how to stop it before every human being on earth was infected. but this disease was unlike any that had ever been known. there was but one symptom. mothers were no longer able to reproduce healthy babies. they would not last a day outside the womb. people, distraught from the natural order of things being disrupted, descended into chaos and it was a frightening time. then, one day, a miracle child came into the world. bahn. it was the first healthy child in several decades and it came just as the youngest women were on the verge of losing their reproductive function. she was taken to a special laboratory where scientists worked day and night. eventually they took everything from that child. she did not make it through her first year. but whatever it was that they found in her, they were able to use it to put healthy babies into every able woman. without her, our species would not be here. and that's why we celebrate her sacrifice every year. let us be blessed in her name.""  everyone was quietly watching the flames, reflecting on lundy's words. garrent looked around the group. ""i don't understand,"" he said finally. ""if a baby is such a blessing, why is mihla running away.""  ""it's complicated, dear child,"" lundy said. she was staring at the floor, subtly shaking her head.  ""i'll tell him,"" mihla said.  ""oh, no, there isn't a need for that,"" lundy said.  ""it's okay,"" mihla said. ""i want to."" she looked into each one of their eyes and took a breath. ""when i was just reaching my teenage years, i was tested at school. all the girls were. my report came back and showed that i wasn't valid. that means i could not survive childbirth."" she wiped a tear away from her cheek, but immediately persisted. ""when that happens, they send you to the doctor, and they take away your ability to have children. but it doesn't always work you see."" garrent's eyes fell to mihla's stomach and remained fixated there as she spoke. ""in those rare cases, like mine, they send you to a special part of the birthing center. they lock you up there, like a prison."" her voice began to crack as she wiped away more tears. ""it's a death sentence.""  after dinner, lundy led mihla to one of the guest rooms. she put her bag in the corner and sat on the bed, eyes downcast. lundy quietly left. several minutes later she returned holding a glass of pale green liquid. ""you'll be deathly ill, for about a week. it will be rough. maybe one of the hardest things in your life."" she frowned as she set the glass on the table next to the bed. ""after that, everything will be back to normal."" mihla said nothing. she couldn't bring herself to even look up. lundy walked out, closing the door behind her. mihla sat, staring at the glass, and she cried.",0,,

israeli studies have shown an increase in uti risk in the week(s) of healing.  * utis are caused in intact boys when meddling parents or 'doctors' forcibly retract the immature foreskin---a practice that has until recently been promoted by ignorant doctors in circumcising countries, because they didn't understand physiologic phimosis (which is normal and *protective*).  * ""a recent scandinavian study found that girls and boys \[who are intact\] have about the same incidence of uti in the first year of life. girls have a four times higher incidence of uti in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys... yet surgery has not been proposed to reduce the incidence of uti in girls.""  * women are [30 times](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231574-overview) to [50 times](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm) mores likely than intact men to contract utis.  * the *national kidney and urologic diseases clearinghouse* does *not* recommend circumcision in its list of [uti prevention measures](http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/utichildren/#prevent); in fact, the only surgery they mention is the reimplantation of ureters for children with vur (vesicoureteral reflux), and even then they acknowledge a less invasive method involving an injection of collagen---nothing to do with cutting up the penis.  * the aap's [official policy](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686) (published in 1999 and reaffirmed in 2005) is: *""existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.""* with regard to utis, the aap notes that previous studies are probably marred with confounding factors, but using them: *""using numbers from the literature, one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a uti  during the first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants. although the relative risk of uti in uncircumcised male infants compared with circumcised male infants is increased from 4- to as much as 10-fold during the first year of life, the absolute risk of developing a uti in an uncircumcised male infant is low (at most, ~1%).""*  utis are a *piss poor* justification for circumcision.  &gt; **and in those with vesicoureteral reflux, about 25%.**  circumcision will not help you much; after all, circumcision doesn't even help a healthy child in any way that can be called appreciable.  &gt; **infants are at the highest risk for long-term kidney damage from uti which can progress to hypertension and renal failure.**  ... if left untreated; you're not a rural red-neck, though: you'll be smart enough to put your child on antibiotics when you notice the signs. circumcision has nothing to do with anything.  &gt; **reduction of pathologic phimosis which occurs in roughly 1% of uncircumcised males**  * as you've already noted, *pathologic* phimosis is rare.  * most cases are not that severe and can be completely solved with stretching over a period of months (perhaps including steroidal creams).  * surgically, much less invasive methods than circumcision exist, such as [preputioplasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=preputioplasty&amp;oldid=315877738).  * most 'phimosis' cases in the west (that is, america) are misdiagnosed [physiologic phimosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777539-overview) that is normal in boys up to the age of 10 years, but still found in adolescents up to the age of 17 or so.  * most genuine cases of *pathologic* phimosis were either the result of genetic pre-disposition (say, from bxo) or---much more likely---the result of meddling parents or 'doctors' who forcibly retracted the immature foreskin of a boy with *physiologic* phimosis, causing scarring and a resulting loss of tissue elasticity.  &gt; **reducing the risk of penile cancer**  the [american academy of pediatrics](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686) says:  &gt; cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is **0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the united states.**91  in countries where the overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of penile cancer  varies from **0.82 per 100 000 in denmark**92  to 2.9 to 6.8 per 100 000 in brazil93  and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in india.94  &gt; ...  &gt; an annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases of penile cancer per year per 1 million men. although the risk of developing penile cancer in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is increased more than threefold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies. nevertheless, in a developed country such as the united states, penile cancer is a rare disease and the risk of penile cancer developing in an uncircumcised man, although increased compared with a circumcised man, is low.  similarly, the american medical association and the american cancer society do not support the notion that routine circumcision should be recommended to prevent penile cancer.  instead, studies seem to indicate that safe sexual practices (avoiding hpv) is the best means for reducing one's risk; after all, circumcised men can still get cancer of the penis, and most cases begin on the glans penis rather than the foreskin anyway. in other words, condom usage is not only the least invasive protection from hpv and penile cancer, but condom usage is the *best* protection.  from what i've read, patients with penile cancer often delay notifying their doctors for up to a year; it seems that resources could be better spent educating men to notify their doctors as soon any anomalies appear.  &gt; **reducing hpv and other sexually transmitted disease**  children don't get stds (unless you consider those infants who contracted herpes from a mohel during a circumcision); by the time this is an issue, your son will be old enough to decide for himself whether or not he wants to get a circumcision; hopefully you will have taught your son to wear condoms and practice safe sex by this time. *condoms and safe sexual practices are the most effective ways to reduce your risk to stds*.  besides, there is no clear consensus that circumcision is a worthwhile or even effective strategy for preventing stds; after all, the u.s. is the most circumcising western nation and yet it has the highest rates of stds in the modern world----at least 3.5x higher hiv infection rates than other, non-circumcising western countries. that is to say, circumcision certainly hasn't helped appreciably.  there are too many confounding factors and basically all of the studies are statistical in nature---not much hard biological evidence to forge a causal link between having a foreskin and being more susceptible to stds. for instance, plausible hypotheses for the biological link between circumcision and a reduction in hiv risk have yet to be shown in the lab despite years (sometimes decades) after proposal. in fact, [it's been shown that langerhans cells act as a barrier against hiv-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=langerin&amp;oldid=264768640#clinical_significance).  also, consider [this recent 11 year study in new zealand (published in 2008)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=abstract) reported that ""consistent with recent population-based cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce the risk of the common stis in the general population in such countries.""  given that you're at least from a country as developed as new zealand, that study suggests that circumcision is worthless.  even if circumcision did reduce the risk of contracting stds, [it wouldn't be a cost effective strategy](http://www.reddit.com/r/health/comments/a17tn/college_of_physicians_and_surgeons_of_british/c0fe687). consider [this 2009 study](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490f-44f5-ac5e-17893a3764ba.asp), in which they modeled various means of preventing hiv in south africa---where 20% of the population is afflicted with the virus---and made the following conclusion about circumcision: ""we were surprised by how little effect it had""; in fact, condoms and treatment availability were forecast to be 20x more effective and cheaper;  [from the abstract](http://www.ias2009.org/pag/abstracts.aspx?aid=2033):  &gt; circumcision had a limited impact in reducing both new infections (range 3%-13% reduction) and deaths (range 2%-4% reduction), and its impact was overshadowed when combined with the other interventions..   and that's where the hiv prevalence is 20%! how much of an effect would circumcision have in the u.s. where the prevalence is *0.6%*.  so, rather than cut up your son's penis, teach him to wear a condom.  &gt; **the incidence of complication in male circumcision is roughly 2% (bmj), with the overwhelming majority of these consisting of non-life threatening bleeding and only case reports of more serious complications... i am again inclined to take the ""risk"" of a minor complication over that of major pathology.**  routine circumcision removes what would become 8 to 15 square inches (flaccid) of mechanically functioning, erogenous, protective tissue from a healthy child. *circumcision is itself a major complication of bad medicine.*  what's worse: circumcision provides no appreciable health benefits, an opinion that is echoed by every major medical organization in the world.",0,,
969706,"(edit: i suspect this will get some downvotes from people who equate natural selection with morality)  this misses a big part of why men are more sexually territorial than women are (or at least, why men are sexually territorial in different ways).  in evolutionary terms, on an evolutionary timescale, reproduction is (or has been) cheap for men and expensive for women.   over the past millions of years, when average lifespans were in the 20s, a woman might expect to have one child per year if she kept very busy, and might expect to raise a child she had in adolescence to adolescence itself. a child she had at age 25 she might not expect see past infancy. if she expected her children to thrive and reproduce competitively themselves, she would very likely wish to either have fewer children, or to ensure a stable and capable extended family to help care for them. from a biological imperative stance, it matters little when she has zero children, or has ten weak children who never reproduce-- either one is evolutionary death for her genes. in fact the most efficient use of her as an organism might be to raise only one or two exceptionally capable children who will have lots of strong offspring.  because children are expensive for her, she has reason to breed with only the most eligible males she can find, i.e., the ones who are likely to produce the healthiest, strongest, most competitive, best cared-for offspring. alpha males, in other words.  a male, on the other hand, could have an indefinite number of children. in wilder and more brutal times, it would be more desirable for the clan/tribe/species to have the fittest and most ""survivable"" males reproduce with the greatest number of females, since a lactating female is necessary for infant survival, but a male is not, strictly speaking.   moreover, in wild and brutal times, it is valuable to have some members of the tribe/clan/species be violently territorial and aggressive for the benefit of the offspring. however those are not necessarily desirable traits in the proximity of infants. male lions in a pride contribute almost nothing to family life (they rarely even hunt, instead they simply take first dibs on whatever the females catch). their value is in being a big, strong, and relatively disposable/replaceable protector of territory against hyenas etc who would otherwise threaten the infants.  following the above, it stands to reason that in brutal, dangerous, and short-life-expectancy situations, females would seek first to mate with the most survival-capable males, and males would seek to mate with pretty much any female who is willing.   iow, while females might prefer to have a dedicated male to assist with child-rearing and protection, they might also have a powerful impulse to mate with ""alpha"" males, even if it means sharing the male with other females, to make the best use of their limited reproductive capacity. similarly, while males might prefer to first mate the most survivable females, they can spread their genes further by simply reproducing with any female, at little consequence to themselves.  occam's razor suggests this as a ready explanation for all kinds of mating and courtship behaviors throughout the animal kingdom, as well as for a whole host of societal and historical phenomena in human society. for example, following the above, the youthfulness of a female would be a very significant indicator of the survivability of her offspring in evolutionary time-- when lifespans extend only into the twenties, a girl of fourteen would have a very good chance of not only living long enough to rear the child, she would also likely have extended family and resources available, and she would have fewer (or no) children to compete for resources. meanwhile, a male's age would matter little, and older might actually be an indicator of better and more survivable genes.  all of this suggests a pre-civilized state where aggressive males compete intensely for alpha status to monopolize the young females, and where females would seek alpha males, even if they had no monopoly. indeed their offspring might benefit from the ""harem"", compared with the offspring of isolated couples. (remember, mother nature's first mandate is reproduction, not dignity).",0,,

last year, twice as many were left homeless as in the year before.  again the same unconscionable sights: heaps of debris, bare metal pegs lunging out of the earth, crushed fences, destroyed animal pens and squashed tin huts; remnants of personal property strewn all over; sheep wandering about looking in vain for shade; chickens pecking about; despondent shepherds; wretched sheep dogs; runny-nosed children curled up in grandmother‚Äôs lap and merciless sun beating down.  another palestinian shepherd community trampled into the ground. not the first, nor the last to meet such a fate in this hard, battered valley, whose palestinian inhabitants israel has set itself the goal of cleansing itself of, far from the public‚Äôs eye. step by step, devastating act after devastating act, community after community ‚Äì there are hundreds whose lives and property have been laid waste recently by the civil administration.  it‚Äôs the law that‚Äôs to blame, of course, the occupier‚Äôs law. it‚Äôs the law, under whose apparent aegis illegal outposts are established and legalized in the twinkling of an eye. and it‚Äôs the occupier, thanks to whose auspices these thousands of people, native sons, have neither running water nor electric power nor rights to inhabit the slopes of the verdant, flourishing jordan valley.  in 2013, according to united nations data, israel more than doubled the demolition of homes and other structures belonging to palestinians in the valley, as compared to the previous year. last year, 390 structures were demolished, compared to 170 in 2012, and 590 people were made homeless, compared to 160 the previous year.  the palestinian news agency ma‚Äôan reported that in january of this year alone, 160 more people were left to fend for themselves under the open skies, after the civil administration demolished their homes. on january 8, for example, khirbet ein karzaliyah, home to 25 souls, 15 of them children, was razed; on january 30, the hovels of khirbet umm al-jimal, where 61 people, half of them children, lived, was the victim of a similar fate.  last week came the turn of homsa, located in the northern part of the valley, home to four families of shepherds ‚Äì a total of 30 people, 15 of them children, and some 500 head of sheep.  about half a year ago, last september, the community of khalat makhoul, adjacent to the settlement of hemdat, was almost completely eradicated, leaving 12 families without shelter. the residents have since rebuilt their homes and their sheep pens, and now the community has risen again, phoenix-like, from the rubble. it‚Äôs a joyful, encouraging sight to see. new tents and tin shacks have been erected in place of the ones that were destroyed, new faucets have been connected to the water containers (of course, this site is not hooked up to the water system), plus there is solar-generated electricity in the new khalat makhoul.  together with two of its residents, burhan and bassam bushrat, we went this week to see what the civil administration had inflicted upon their neighbors, members of the homsa community.  immediately after the jewish settlement of bekaot, at the end of its well-tended rows of grape vines which are now covered with protective nets against all intruders, we turn onto a long serpentine, dirt path that ascends eastward into the hills and traverses the fields that belong to palestinian landowners from toubas and tamoun; at present, the fields are being worked by local tenant farmers.  under the blazing light, the wheat and the barley are lush and green now. on the slopes of a remote hill, in the heart of a sea of stalks, far from any other place of habitation, lie ruin and devastation. sitting in a white tent donated by the palestinian red crescent, surrounded by mounds of ruins, is hakam abu al-kabash, a shepherd. the aftermath of the shock is still etched on his face. he‚Äôs 28, the father of four young children, the youngest of whom is 7 months old. he was here last week on tuesday, just after 7 a.m., with his wife, their children and his parents when the forces of the civil administration swooped in to ravage his hamlet.  the troops, israel‚Äôs agents of destruction, a fleet of about 25 vehicles including trucks and bulldozers, accompanied by border police and others, had come to uproot the community, on the grounds that their habitation was illegal, even though they had lived there for years, on private palestinian land. kabash was born here, and for the past eight years he has lived in homsa in the heart of the wheat fields.  the act of demolition was swift; it was all over in an hour. they came, they razed, they left. according to kabash, no one bothered to explain why. maybe the troops were in a hurry ‚Äì another tent encampment was demolished that same day, belonging to another shepherd, abed al-fadiya, not far away, near the settlement of hamra.  three days earlier, civil administration personnel, armed with cameras, had come to homsa and documented what they saw, on what turned out to be the eve of its destruction. it was a bad omen. on the fateful day, the workers removed the meager household effects, cranes lifted up the huts and the pens, and the bulldozers crushed the remains, flattening the hamlet, as residents watched from the side. as easy as pie.  not a word about this appeared in the israeli media. i couldn‚Äôt find any mention of it this time even on websites of israel and palestinian human rights groups that generally report on such events. who cares? more palestinian rubble in the jordan valley? boring, routine.  ‚Äúwhere will the child go?‚Äù asked the neighbor from khalat makhoul, burhan bushrat, himself a study in the survival of ordeals, in reply to my question about kabash‚Äôs infant. ‚Äúthe baby was here and so was his mother,‚Äù the father said in a flat tone of voice. ‚Äúand now he is out in the sun.‚Äù what will you do? kabash is taken aback by the question. ‚Äúwe will stay here. we will rebuild. where can we go?‚Äù  the spokesman of the coordinator of government activities in the territories told haaretz this week: ‚Äúthis was an illegal structure [referring to kabash‚Äôs home, although we asked about the community in general], which was built without a building permit. the request of the owner for a permit was not completed after a process of two years. with no response having been received from the owner or his representative at the institutions of the civil administration, it was decided to implement the demolition order on april 1.  a source within the administration explained the process in the following way: the original demolition order was issued to the structure‚Äôs owner on may 10, 2012. prior to the owner‚Äôs appeal, which was submitted on august 2, 2012, he was given three extensions. on march 6, 2013, the owner was told he had 30 days to demolish the structure himself.  a boy loads a newborn lamb onto the back of a spluttering subaru pickup. the sheep pen used to be here, and the tent where the family lived was over there. grandma jamili is sitting in the white tent of the red crescent and half a dozen toddlers are snuggling up to her, all of them barefoot and with runny noses, their faces covered with sores and flies. some of the children have blonde hair and blue eyes.  the closest school is 20 kilometers away; the children are usually transported via a cart hitched to a tractor. now they are all sleeping in the open, in the cold and in the heat, and the men watch over the sheep, which have no pen, all night. an open packet of biscuits, half eaten, protrudes from the heap of household goods they managed to salvage, along with a pair of tattered gold-colored women‚Äôs shoes. the small silver-colored suitcase in which kabash keeps his documents is also part of the pile. a t-shirt with the words ‚Äúour theater‚Äù emblazoned on it in hebrew flaps on the clothesline in the spring breeze, next to a palestinian keffiyeh.  not far away, at the entrance to bekaot, something different is flapping in the wind: a banner, announcing ‚Äúindependence day. 7 pm in the amphitheater. berry sakharoff, knesiyat hasechel and fireworks. the jordan rift. an israeli success story.‚Äù on our independence day, fireworks bursting in the air in the skies over the jordan valley will illuminate the surrounding fields on a dark and joyous night.",1,1,1
416514,"&gt; that was quite a response.  not really, if it wasn't convincing :d  &gt; i still disagree that public schooling is anymore of a terrible brainwashing experience than say, watching tv or reading reddit or anything else where a source of authority tells you what to think.  isn't tv a brainwashing experience?  it's definitely a large influence, and many people's only source of news -- which is damned dangerous nowadays, if you ask me.  reddit, as has been noticed by others, is a site with a large number of people who tend, more often than not, to agree on certain things -- individuality, civil liberties, religion, and so forth.  as we know from social psychology, too much agreement leads to groupthink, group polarization, and other fun phenomena.    but it's not so much the existence of a source of authority (even though milgram's experiments clearly demonstrated the danger of having an authority around, even if just for an hour), but rather a continual process of molding.  you've seen, i'm sure, what marines are like after, what, 13 weeks of boot camp?  consider twelve years of milder instruction.  we all know the saying ""garbage in, garbage out.""  when fed false premises, we derive false conclusions.  &gt; a resilient individual will protect their identity and values, and continue to think as an individual regardless of what is thrown at them.   it's far more complex than that.  consider [this old candid camera clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7srixn2muc), milgram's experiment, the stanford prison experiment, or the hofling hospital experiment.  or the holocaust.  any war, in fact.  any country.  consider [the eight stages of genocide](http://www.genocidewatch.org/8stages.htm).  how many people are resilient and willful individuals?  is this the norm or the exception?  are you resilient and willful?  and how does thinking as an individual (i notice that you were careful not to say *acting* as an individual) display your resilience and will?  isn't it rather easy to think daring, rebellious thoughts, and do nothing about them?  every process of human thought that can be interrupted, short-circuited, misdirected, or generally fucked around with can and *is* fucked around with.  can you really think, with a thoroughly modern knowledge of psychology and sociology, that twelve years of authoritarian structure do not have an effect on someone?  resilience and will are illusions lent to the subject by other external phenomena; the natural state of man is ignorant, innocent vulnerability to whatever mental processes are currently occurring, and whatever those processes might be slave to -- which are inevitably outside actors.  &gt; if public schooling turned you into an ignorant void for authorities to step on, you were not very resilient or willful to begin with.  sweet talk will get you nowhere with me.  i was neither resilient nor willful.  i was a rather vulnerable, na√Øve child.  i was shaped by just about everything and everyone *but* myself.  at least, that's how i perceive it.  my mother would probably consider me extremely willful, and i was indeed rebellious and obstinate, but being willful is in the eye of the beholder.  i joined the military, which molded me too.  i would say that i didn't become truly myself until a period of seclusion led me to the values i have today, but that isn't true.  i've simply been molded by different things.  i am the sum total of my experiences, my thoughts, and my influences.  to say that public school turns all kids into brainless drones is a misunderstanding of what i have said -- which is that it is a collection of many influences filling half your waking hours for fully two-thirds of your childhood.  resilience and will aren't two traits of a person, like str and int for someone's d&amp;d half-elf.  people show different responses to different kinds of oppression.  for instance, a religious muslim man is horrified by being stripped naked and straddled by a young female guard.  i'd think this was vaguely hott &lt;3.  he similarly thinks nothing of the strictures and requirements of islam, whereas i view them as senseless and silly.  resilience and will are functions of value systems.  imagine that you were born in india, to a traditional family.  do you honestly think you'd be wandering around the countryside making beef shish-kabobs and fondling untouchables?  my favorite question to ask evangelists who bother me is whether they think they would still be christian if they were born in pakistan.  no matter the response, it's always amusing.  and isn't it interesting that, in the us, we have different beliefs than other developed, western, industrial nations?  we're just about the only one left with capital punishment.  we're far more religious than other industrial nations, and definitely deny evolution an alarming percentage of the time.  if humans were basically all the same, and the percentage of resilient and willful people were roughly constant across populations, wouldn't it follow that our mainstream would be roughly the same as that of the uk, or france, or germany?  france has definitely had its share of resilient and willful people -- the list of philosophers, master writers, and scientific thinkers is tremendous -- but who are the swiss geniuses? :-)    &gt; edit: furthermore, we didn't have a sham representation entirely. this was at a hick school in texas. arbitrary rules were discussable with the administrator, most rules were there for clear reasons but arbitrary ones were debatable and breakable under reasonable circumstances. our student council was mostly concerned with organizing social events, but did have representation at school faculty meetings in order to voice their opinions. while these opinions may have been disregarded for the most part, they were voiced nonetheless (it should also be noted that many of the teachers who voice their opinions at faculty meetings are also disregarded.)   okay, so what did your student council accomplish?  i might have missed that for your discussion of just how effective a sham your representation was.  did you guys change the grading scale, or declare a special holiday for someone respectable who died, or institute a change in the standard curriculum, or protest the damn high school competency exams?    of course the teachers were disregarded.  they're employees :d  &gt; a social hierarchy based on seniority has also been around long before the dawning of public schools. take for example native american tribes, where the elders of the tribe command considerable amounts of respect compared to younger ones. consider even animals in the wild, where the generally older stronger males have their pick over mating partners in patriarchal species. many of these ideas that are ""indoctrinated"" are actually the result of millions of years of natural selection.  yes, social hierarchy based on seniority exists outside of school -- i never said that public school invented the concept.  my point was that school officials are unwilling and unable to stop the evolution and existence of this hierarchy, which i believe has only negative effects on social development.  in families and many other situations, it can and does have positive effects.  &gt; to an extent schools do promote nationalism, but so do baseball games. no one is accusing baseball games of force-feeding children nationalism, and yet the national anthem is traditionally sung at baseball games (to my knowledge this happens at most sporting events worldwide) and the flag is flown. it most certainly happens at the olympics.  i'm not sure if you understand what i mean by nationalism -- i don't mean people coming out of public school saying ""rah!  go u.s.!  go u.s.!"" -- but rather their belief that a nation is necessary, that the people of their particular nation are somehow more important than those of other nations, that efficiency and ""correctness"" are the marks of a virtuous nation, that this nation's government be compulsory, and so forth.  in other words, if i were to criticize baseball or any other sport, i would not criticize it on the grounds that the star spangled banana was played at every game, but rather that two warring tribes were fighting a little war.  (someone said on a ted talk that sports are to war what porn is to sex, which amused me)  better that than a real war or riot, and i don't criticize sports (although they don't interest me).",0,,

798244,"in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i‚Äôve been turning over in my mind ever since.  ‚Äúwhenever you feel like criticizing any one,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äújust remember that all the people in this world haven‚Äôt had the advantages that you‚Äôve had.‚Äù  he didn‚Äôt say any more, but we‚Äôve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that. in consequence, i‚Äôm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician, because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. most of the confidences were unsought ‚Äî frequently i have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and i snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  and, after boasting this way of my tolerance, i come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point i don‚Äôt care what it‚Äôs founded on. when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction ‚Äî gatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn. if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ‚Äúcreative temperament.‚Äù‚Äî it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again. no ‚Äî gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city for three generations. the carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we‚Äôre descended from the dukes of buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather‚Äôs brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the civil war, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.  i never saw this great-uncle, but i‚Äôm supposed to look like him ‚Äî with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father‚Äôs office i graduated from new haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war. i enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that i came back restless. instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe ‚Äî so i decided to go east and learn the bond business. everybody i knew was in the bond business, so i supposed it could support one more single man. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, ‚Äúwhy ‚Äî ye ‚Äî es,‚Äù with very grave, hesitant faces. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays i came east, permanently, i thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington, and i went out to the country alone. i had a dog ‚Äî at least i had him for a few days until he ran away ‚Äî and an old dodge and a finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than i, stopped me on the road.  ‚Äúhow do you get to west egg village?‚Äù he asked helplessly.  i told him. and as i walked on i was lonely no longer. i was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  there was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew. and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides. i was rather literary in college ‚Äî one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ‚Äúyale news.‚Äù‚Äî and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the ‚Äúwell-rounded man.‚Äù this isn‚Äôt just an epigram ‚Äî life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york ‚Äî and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals ‚Äî like the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end ‚Äî but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  i lived at west egg, the ‚Äî well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard ‚Äî it was a factual imitation of some hotel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby‚Äôs mansion. or, rather, as i didn‚Äôt know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor‚Äôs lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires ‚Äî all for eighty dollars a month.  across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i‚Äôd known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.  her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven ‚Äî a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy ‚Äî even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach ‚Äî but now he‚Äôd left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he‚Äôd brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  why they came east i don‚Äôt know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn‚Äôt believe it ‚Äî i had no sight into daisy‚Äôs heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens ‚Äî finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body ‚Äî he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage ‚Äî a cruel body.  his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked ‚Äî and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.  ‚Äúnow, don‚Äôt think my opinion on these matters is final,‚Äù he seemed to say, ‚Äújust because i‚Äôm stronger and more of a man than you are.‚Äù we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  ‚Äúi‚Äôve got a nice place here,‚Äù he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.  ‚Äúit belonged to demaine, the oil man.‚Äù he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. ‚Äúwe‚Äôll go inside.‚Äù  we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it ‚Äî indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise ‚Äî she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression ‚Äî then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.  ‚Äúi‚Äôm p-paralyzed with happiness.‚Äù she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i‚Äôve heard it said that daisy‚Äôs murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  at any rate, miss baker‚Äôs lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again ‚Äî the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‚Äúlisten,‚Äù a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.  i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  ‚Äúdo they miss me?‚Äù she cried ecstatically.  ‚Äúthe whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there‚Äôs a persistent wail all night along the north shore.‚Äù  ‚Äúhow gorgeous! let‚Äôs go back, tom. to-morrow!‚Äù then she added irrelevantly: ‚Äúyou ought to see the baby.‚Äù  ‚Äúi‚Äôd like to.‚Äù  ‚Äúshe‚Äôs asleep. she‚Äôs three years old. haven‚Äôt you ever seen her?‚Äù  ‚Äúnever.‚Äù  ‚Äúwell, you ought to see her. she‚Äôs ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  ‚Äúwhat you doing, nick?‚Äù  ‚Äúi‚Äôm a bond man.‚Äù  ‚Äúwho with?‚Äù  i told him.  ‚Äúnever heard of them,‚Äù he remarked decisively.  this annoyed me.  ‚Äúyou will,‚Äù i answered shortly. ‚Äúyou will if you stay in the east.‚Äù  ‚Äúoh, i‚Äôll stay in the east, don‚Äôt you worry,‚Äù he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. ‚Äúi‚Äôd be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.‚Äù  at this point miss baker said: ‚Äúabsolutely!‚Äù with such suddenness that i started ‚Äî it was the first word she uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  ‚Äúi‚Äôm stiff,‚Äù she complained, ‚Äúi‚Äôve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.‚Äù  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look at me,‚Äù daisy retorted, ‚Äúi‚Äôve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.‚Äù  ‚Äúno, thanks,‚Äù said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, ‚Äúi‚Äôm absolutely in training.‚Äù  her host looked at her incredulously.  ‚Äúyou are!‚Äù he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. ‚Äúhow you ever get anything done is beyond me.‚Äù  i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she ‚Äúgot done.‚Äù i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  ‚Äúyou live in west egg,‚Äù she remarked contemptuously. ‚Äúi know somebody there.‚Äù  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know a single ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúyou must know gatsby.‚Äù  ‚Äúgatsby?‚Äù demanded daisy. ‚Äúwhat gatsby?‚Äù  before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  ‚Äúwhy candles?‚Äù objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. ‚Äúin two weeks it‚Äôll be the longest day in the year.‚Äù she looked at us all radiantly. ‚Äúdo you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.‚Äù  ‚Äúwe ought to plan something,‚Äù yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  ‚Äúall right,‚Äù said daisy. ‚Äúwhat‚Äôll we plan?‚Äù she turned to me helplessly: ‚Äúwhat do people plan?‚Äù  before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  ‚Äúlook!‚Äù she complained; ‚Äúi hurt it.‚Äù  we all looked ‚Äî the knuckle was black and blue.  ‚Äúyou did it, tom,‚Äù she said accusingly. ‚Äúi know you didn‚Äôt mean to, but you did do it. that‚Äôs what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúi hate that word hulking,‚Äù objected tom crossly, ‚Äúeven in kidding.‚Äù  ‚Äúhulking,‚Äù insisted daisy.  sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  ‚Äúyou make me feel uncivilized, daisy,‚Äù i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you talk about crops or something?‚Äù  i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs going to pieces,‚Äù broke out tom violently. ‚Äúi‚Äôve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read ‚Äòthe rise of the colored empires‚Äô by this man goddard?‚Äù  ‚Äúwhy, no,‚Äù i answered, rather surprised by his tone.  ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don‚Äôt look out the white race will be ‚Äî will be utterly submerged. it‚Äôs all scientific stuff; it‚Äôs been proved.‚Äù  ‚Äútom‚Äôs getting very profound,‚Äù said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. ‚Äúhe reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúwell, these books are all scientific,‚Äù insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. ‚Äúthis fellow has worked out the whole thing. it‚Äôs up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.‚Äù  ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to beat them down,‚Äù whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  ‚Äúyou ought to live in california ‚Äî‚Äù began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  ‚Äúthis idea is that we‚Äôre nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. ‚Äú‚Äî and we‚Äôve produced all the things that go to make civilization ‚Äî oh, science and art, and all that. do you see?‚Äù  there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  ‚Äúi‚Äôll tell you a family secret,‚Äù she whispered enthusiastically. ‚Äúit‚Äôs about the butler‚Äôs nose. do you want to hear about the butler‚Äôs nose?‚Äù  ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why i came over to-night.‚Äù  ‚Äúwell, he wasn‚Äôt always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúthings went from bad to worse,‚Äù suggested miss baker.  ‚Äúyes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.‚Äù  for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened ‚Äî then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  the butler came back and murmured something close to tom‚Äôs ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  ‚Äúi love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a ‚Äî of a rose, an absolute rose. doesn‚Äôt he?‚Äù she turned to miss baker for confirmation: ‚Äúan absolute rose?‚Äù  this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said ‚Äúsh!‚Äù in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  ‚Äúthis mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù i said.  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk. i want to hear what happens.‚Äù  ‚Äúis something happening?‚Äù i inquired innocently.  ‚Äúyou mean to say you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù said miss baker, honestly surprised. ‚Äúi thought everybody knew.‚Äù  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt.‚Äù  ‚Äúwhy ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù she said hesitantly, ‚Äútom‚Äôs got some woman in new york.‚Äù  ‚Äúgot some woman?‚Äù i repeated blankly.  miss baker nodded.  ‚Äúshe might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù  almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.  ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt be helped!‚Äù cried daisy with tense gaiety.  she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: ‚Äúi looked outdoors for a minute, and it‚Äôs very romantic outdoors. there‚Äôs a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he‚Äôs singing away ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù her voice sang: ‚Äúit‚Äôs romantic, isn‚Äôt it, tom?‚Äù  ‚Äúvery romantic,‚Äù he said, and then miserably to me: ‚Äúif it‚Äôs light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.‚Äù  the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn‚Äôt guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest‚Äôs shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing ‚Äî my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  ‚ù¶",1,,1

524600,"&gt; **the benefits (accoridng to the neutral mayo clinic) circumcision may have health benefits, including**  according to the [american academy of pediatrics](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686) (keep in mind that circumcision is currently a [prevalent religio-cultural tradition in the u.s.](http://circumstitions.com/docs/knmg-policy.pdf)):  &gt; existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.  about the specific items you listed:  &gt; **decreased risk of urinary tract infections. the risk of urinary tract infections in the first year is low, but these infections may be up to 10 times as common in uncircumcised baby boys. severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later on.**  that's the relative risk; consider the absolute risk, as discussed by the aap:  &gt; data from europe, based on a largely uncircumcised population, report uti rates of 1.2% for infant boys.73 the number is similar to the rates of 0.7% to 1.4% reported for uncircumcised males in the united states and canada.72,74  in comparison, uti rates for circumcised male infants in the united states and canada are reported to be 0.12% to 0.19%.72,74  although these cross-cultural data do not provide information on specific individual risk factors, the similarity of european and american uti rates for uncircumcised male infants support an association between circumcision status and uti. using these rates and the increased risks suggested from the literature, **one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a uti during the first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants.**  *utis are rare!*  almost all utis are quickly eradicated with simple antibiotics, which are much cheaper and much less invasive than subjecting *healthy* infants to genital-reduction surgery.  consider [these numbers](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti/):   &gt; wiswell's sensational statistic, that circumcision resulted in a ""ten to hundred times decrease in urinary tract infections in circumcised boys,"" has often been quoted; however, it is misleading. in fact, utis are so rare in any case that, using wiswell's data, 50 to 100 healthy boys would have to be circumcised in order to prevent a uti from developing in only one patient. (using more recent data from a better-controlled study, the number of unnecessary operations needed to prevent one hospital admission for uti would jump to 195.49)  according to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):  &gt; utis are rare in men, so all cases require investigation.  *did you ever pause to think about the other sex in this case?*  according to a [scandinavian study](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti/)):  &gt; girls and boys have about the same incidence of uti in the first year of life. girls have a four times higher incidence of uti in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys.  and according to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):  &gt;  uti is 50 times more common in women, with about 5 per cent per year developing symptoms.  &gt; uti is uncommon in men below 60 years of age, but the frequency is similar in men and women in older age groups.  and according to [emedicine](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231574-overview):  &gt; adult women [in the u.s.] are 30 times more likely than men to develop a uti.  good lord!  *where's your argument for messing around with female genitals? after all, it's been noted that removing the labia and clitoral hood reduces smegma and enhances hygiene.*  just think about that for a while.  &gt; **occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis may be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).**  there are [2 types of phimosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777539-overview) (also, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/ahawi/i_am_an_uncircumcised_21_year_old_who_never/c0hkc5g)):  * **physiologic**: when boys are born, their penises are immature; the foreskin is fused to the head of the penis (ripping them apart is the first step of neonatal circumcision).  * **pathologic (genuine problem)**: the foreskin becomes unretractable after it was already retractable; this usually happens because the preputial orifice (the ""opening"") becomes scarred and therefore too inelastic.  according to a [2-year study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119091453/abstract):   &gt; the incidence of pathological phimosis in boys was 0.4 cases/1000 boys per year, or 0.6% of boys affected by their 15th birthday  ooooh! big problem!  it gets more interesting, though:  &gt; \[which is\] a value... exceeded more than eight-fold by the proportion of english boys currently circumcised for 'phimosis'.  that means a lot of boys are being circumcised for a condition they don't actually have.  sadly, american doctors have been traditionally ignorant for most of the last century about *physiologic* phimosis, so many boys have been wrongly diagnosed with *pathologic* phimosis and subsequently referred for circumcision unnecessarily.  worse, it's been the advice (until the near past) of numerous american medical organizations and child-rearing resources that parents forcibly retract the foreskin in order to prevent the normal adhesions of physiologic phimosis. however, this forcible retraction rips the foreskin from the head of the penis, which can result in scarring that induces *pathologic* phimosis; the wounded foreskin and head can actually heal together again, which is why it was advised to perform this forcible retraction at each washing, thereby compounding the problem.  furthermore, many legitimate cases could probably be resolved with a few months of stretching (perhaps with steroidal ointment). surgically, preputioplasty is popular in europe and much less invasive than circumcision.  did you know that women get phimosis too? their clitoral hoods are too tight to allow their clitorises to engorge fully and they can similarly suffer from infections as a result.  &gt; **this can also lead to inflammation of the head of the penis.**  this is called [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/), and it occurs in circumcised males as well; it can be caused by excessive washing (especially when an abrasive soap is used), suggesting that over-zealous parents might be causing some portion of cases.  &gt; **decreased risk of penile cancer. although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men.**  again, look at absolute risk.  according to the american academy of pediatrics (same link):  &gt; cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the united states.\[91\]  in countries where the overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of penile cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in denmark\[92\] to 2.9 to 6.8 per 100 000 in brazil93  and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in india.\[94\]  &gt; ...  &gt; an annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases of penile cancer per year per 1 million men. although the risk of developing penile cancer in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is increased more than threefold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies.  there is evidence that the ""benefit"" of circumcision in the case of penile cancer is only conferred to men circumcised in infancy, and there is a strong link between hpv infection of the penis and penile cancer. therefore, it's pretty clear that preventing penile cancer (already an extremely rare disease) is really a matter of preventing a sexual disease that is known to cause cancer: then, why not use the much cheaper and far less invasive approach of pushing safe sexual practices, which must be done anyway.  &gt; **decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases. safe sexual practices remain essential, but circumcised men may have a slightly lower risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases ‚Äî including hiv, the virus that causes aids.**  please [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9rvgf/pascals_wager_again_quite_a_nice_comic/c0e5kjy).  in particular, note:  * [this recent 30-year study in new zealand](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=abstract) reported results that are ""consistent with recent population-based cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce the risk of the common stis in the general population in such countries.""  * [in this recent study out of south africa](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490f-44f5-ac5e-17893a3764ba.asp) modeled various means of preventing hiv, and made the following conclusion about circumcision: ""we were surprised by how little effect it had""; condoms and treatment availability were forecast to be 20x more effective and cheaper. and that's where the hiv prevalence is [11% overall (16% in some parts and upwards of 30% in some age groups)](http://www.avert.org/safricastats.htm)! how much of an effect would circumcision have in the u.s. where the prevalence is *0.6%* (of sexually active adults)?  * of the 0.6% of sexually active u.s. citizens who are infected with hiv, *over half* are men who have sex with men (gays/bisexuals), for whom circumcision has been shown to be useless in a number of studies. a large chunk more of hiv positive individuals are users of intravenous drugs. **the point is that there is a very narrow population that is at risk, so it's insane to target the general population of infants who won't be having sex for nearly 2 decades.**  quit bullshitting yourself and everyone else.  the circumcision of a *healthy* child is plain genital mutilation and child abuse.",0,,
669949,"oh boy i'm gonna have fun with this. you made a nice attempt at gish galloping but i'll manage. first of all i'm going to disregard your first 2 links, as they come from huffpo and wapo, which would be the equivalent of someone on the right using breitbart and gateway pundit as their sources as to why hillary is corrupt. i'll acknowledge roots seeing as i've never heard of them until now, but looking at the article its quite clear they have a severe bias. okay okay here we go:  &gt; trump nominated sen. jeff sessions to be the next u.s. attorney general  the first one claims he is racist because he hired an attorney general who is white whereas obama hired attorney generals who were black. that does not make him a racist, it just means he hired someone who happens to be white. if that's the case then obama is a racist for hiring a black ag and not considering a white one. also i should point out that sessions helped de-segregate schools in alabama and he got the death penalty for a kkk murderer who killed a black kid.  &gt; trump referred to mexicans as ‚Äúrapists‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminals.‚Äù  no he did not, this is an outright lie and has been debunked. if you actually listened to his speech you would know that, but you don't care, you'll believe whatever is forced down your throat. he clearly said that some (not all) illegals crossing the border were committing murder and raping.   &gt; in trump‚Äôs mind, he owns ‚Äúthe blacks.‚Äù  this is referring to when he said ‚Äúlook at my african american over here.‚Äù while this was silly of him to say, this is no way means that he thinks he 'owns' black people. god, the mental gymnastics with you guys is astounding.  &gt; according to trump, black protesters should be assaulted.  no, this is just wrong wrong wrong. he jokingly said ‚Äúmaybe he should have been roughed up"" about the protester who happened to be black. notice i put caps on happened to be? if the guy had been white, yellow, green or orange he would have said the same thing because he is a protester. not everything is a race issue (unless you're a democrat).  &gt; trump condemned the ‚Äúafrican-american president‚Äù on baltimore riots.  is obama not an african-american? since when? he said that because the issue was about the riots going on in baltimore, where there is a strong black community, and how obama was doing next to nothing to resolve the issues. obama was supposed to close the racial divide, not widen it.  &gt; trump and white nationalism go hand in hand.  this is just a plain fucking stupid claim, and you guys think you're superior to republicans when you make statements like this? please. fyi campaign donations are not hand delivered by the people who donate. trump has no control over who supports his campaign, he could get a donation from cthulu and he wouldn't know.   &gt; trump named a white nationalist as his chief strategist.  just because bannon is the owner of breitbart does not make him a white nationalist. so far there is no solid evidence of him being racist in any way. aren't white nationalists also anti-semitic? if so then why would he employ ben shapiro, milo and david horowits to write articles for them?  &gt; trump believes in the complete shutdown of muslims, from registry to banning their entry into the u.s.  first of all, it wasn't a shutdown of muslim entry to the us. it was a travel ban for countries that have been known for terrorist activity (which happen to be primarily muslim countries) fun fact: these countries were chosen by the obama administration and implemented by trump. another fun fact: out of the top 10 muslim countries in the world, only one of them is on trump's ban (iran). don't believe me? take a look: http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/muslims/pf_15-04-02_projectionstables74/ we still take in muslims from indonesia, morocco, pakistan, nigeria and many many more countries.  &gt; trump wants black people to know, ‚Äúwhat the hell do you have to lose?‚Äù  not even gonna try with this one, you guys are grasping at straws  &gt; trump believes that black people live only in chicago.  no he doesn't. trump refers to chicago a lot seeing as the murder rate in the inner city is higher than nyc and la combined and this is primarily due to black on black violence (this is a fact, facts aren't racist)",0,,

254185,"**part three**  far from injured, hadrian aldkin, shadow elf of the umbraniel republic and venture ranger-turned saint tryneth junior, sat cross-legged in the dirt, unsure of what to make of his situation as two of helen's ‚Äúcannibalistic‚Äù fae elves sat on either side of him. while not adverse to having beautiful women on either side of him, he wasn't quite sure how to feel about the fact that one was weaving flowers into his short smoky gray hair while the other was investigating his arm, apparently fascinated by the fact that he was purple and not whatever-pale-fleshy-color that the sun elves were.  pondering the sequence of events that brought him to the current situation while eating an offered green fruit whose name was beyond him, hadrian was still having difficulty trying to reconcile the fact that when he woke up that morning, he was considering the notion that helen was perhaps right, and that they were, indeed, going to be eaten. several hours later, one of which was spent watching a crazy old fae elf abuse and lecture the guards and the patrol who captured them, the young shadow elf soon found himself in a large celebration, watching the fae elf warriors dance in a circle about a massive bonfire while one of the elves at his side kept feeding him these strange, delicious green fruit.  hadrian's decision on how to deal with this dissonance was simple: stop thinking and enjoy it. it was particularly easy for hadrian as he watched the strange situations his fellow survivors were in. poor helen still seemed distrustful of the fae elves, and was currently hiding behind madame swiftfowl, the two of them the target of what he assumed were the male fae elves' advances. hank, the tall elf with the thick brown sideburns, found himself attended by what hadrian assumed was one of the village's skilled healers. he smiled when hank was led off by the young female, only to return with a disheveled look, a smile on his face, and the young woman latched onto his arm. now, hank was surrounded by numerous youths, all of whom were trying to stick various objects to the sides of their heads in an attempt to imitate his impressive facial hair.  and lambda... well, the young shadow elf couldn't even look at lambda. not without laughing. first paraded around the fae village like some god, hadrian soon realized that they probably thought lambda was *actually* a god. even when hadrian told lambda his suspicions, and lambda removed his armor to prove that he wasn't, the sudden change in lambda combined with the impressive display of lights seemed to only fuel their belief that he was some kind of holy spirit. after being made the center of their celebration, somehow or other the tall human found himself surrounded by mothers bearing infants and children hanging off his arms.  *‚Äúaj gralanu! aj gralanu! nweh injef kavanu!‚Äù*  the noises of the celebration faded when a positively decrepit hunched elf appeared with a booming voice and an ancient knurled staff decorated with feathers and raw gemstones. ushered to his feet by the beauties by his sides, hadrian, having long given up the thought of resisting, approached the ancient elf. standing besides the armor-less lambda, the party of survivors stood before the diminutive elf, the crowd behind them silent. surveying the outsiders before him, the elderly fae elf nodded several times before turning around, making his way into the thicket.  ‚Äúwe following elder westin, yes?‚Äù  hadrian jumped in his skin when he heard the crazy fae elf whisper in his ear. keen on getting away from the grammatically impaired fae elf, hadrian stiffly walked forward, a quickened pace needed to keep up with lambda's lumbering gait. from the hushed murmurs, the shadow elf could tell that the once-celebrating fae elves were not far behind, the large number of them the only reason his pointed ears could perceive their muted footfalls.  peering ahead, the purple-skinned shadow elf saw torches lining the twisting path, bursting in brilliant pale green flames as the oddly-quick elder westin passed them. his mind quickly switching to that of an enchantment enthusiast, hadrian pondered what manner of enchantment was necessary to cause the torches to light up by proximity.  his mind lost in the first serious train of thought that he had that evening, that fastidious young man was rocked from the sanctity of his mind when he walked face-first into lambda's back. cursing while clutching his nose, hadrian peeked around lambda's massive frame to discover the reason for the giant to halt in his tracks.  having spent the last hour in a state of willful ignorance, hadrian was completely unprepared for what he saw. a large amphitheater stood before him; large enough to house the entire village and then some, cut into the earth and lined with carefully smoothed stone. at the bottom was a massive alcove, cut into the dark gray face of a cliff. shaped into a dome, the stage was easily more than four times hadrian's height, and many times wider. beckoned to the front row by the eccentric old elf standing at the side of the elder, hadrian was able to get a clear view of the massive mural painted on the domed wall as he descended into finely crafted amphitheater.  to his untrained eye, it was clear that the mural told a story. with every available space packed with the oddly angular figures of various sizes, the mural had a strange geometric wholeness to it, the symmetry somehow significant but to the young hadrian it was stylistic choice. arranged in concentric circles, the figures increased in size until they reached the center, where a massive dark figure with elongated blue fingers seemed to be protecting a group of prostrating white figures from small red and black figures. at the central figure's feet was a similar figure, broken and laying on the ground, surrounded by smaller white figures who were holding oddly-shaped black sticks.  slamming his staff into the ground twice, the elder quickly silenced the crowd and hadrian's thoughts, the sound reverberating off the curved stone wall behind him. as he spoke, the fashion-blind elf began to speak in his halting basic, translating his words.  ‚Äúfriends! dark times have fallen on us! the pale ones of the south, steal friends and family! we prayed, and great nekkus answered! stands now here the great meedon seeksvotu, savior of elves, before and again!‚Äù  gesturing to lambda, the crowd seated behind the survivors exploded into cheers. hadrian, clasping his ears from the sudden outburst of noise, began to rapidly process the words he heard, his mind making rapid connections.  *oh please no...*  the elder spoke, addressing both the crowd and the outsiders. when he finished, he turned expectantly to lambda while their translator spoke.  ‚Äúelder westin want recount your story, great seeksvotu,‚Äù he said, bowing slightly. ‚Äúwhile the meedon seeksvotu and his friends know old story, elder westin wants retell the young ones of the meedon's greatness to make warriors ready. would be acceptable?‚Äù  staring at their translator and the elder, poor hadrian's head spun as he realized what had happened. turning to his companions, the young elf flinched when he realized that they, including lambda, were looking to him.  *why are you assholes looking to me?!?*  ‚Äúoh, of course!‚Äù hadrian said, trying not to let his nervousness slip into his voice. ‚Äúthe great lam- i mean, meedon seeksvotu, would certainly enjoy hearing you regale his tale once more!‚Äù  hadrian quickly shot a glance at lambda, who gave a slight nod of approval. or at least, hadrian hoped it was approval.  ‚Äúwhy you answer for seeksvotu?‚Äù asked the translator, frowning. ‚Äúcan not meedon speak for himself?‚Äù  ‚Äúuh... he can! yes, he can!‚Äù answered hadrian, breaking out into a cold sweat. ‚Äúbut uh... it's dangerous. his voice. so i speak for him. yes, i am hadrian, the speaker for meedon seeksvotu.‚Äù  the translator turned to the elder and began to quietly converse with him in the fae tongue. his heart hammering in his chest, hadrian was hoping that they'd buy his lie. if they did, it'd mean he would be making most of their decisions from now on, instead of leaving it to the oft-silent lambda. he wasn't sure if that would be for the best.  ‚Äúwhat say makes sense, hadrian, speaker of seeksvotu,‚Äù the eccentric elf said after turning back to face him. ‚Äúcertainly, with thunder voice breaking walls, it better safe for you to speak for seeksvotu.‚Äù  ‚Äúgood, good,‚Äù hadrian answered cheerfully as all his nervous energy seemed to drip away. ‚Äúso will you begin the story?‚Äù  ‚Äúof course!‚Äù the translator answered cheerfully before turning to the elder and translating for him.  hadrian sighed as he leaned back in his seat, not sparing the giant next to him a glance. as if the week wasn't eventful enough already, the shadow elf was now going to listen to a fae elf with a poor fashion sense give a broken translation of the story explaining why they considered lambda a god. hadrian briefly wondered if it was coincidence, or if it had something to do with the ancient human presence on aendellisys, as evidenced by the ruins that he had been investigating and what lambda said days before.  as the wizened old elder cast his magic to darken the stage and begin his tale, the shadow elf simply decided to stop thinking and enjoy the show.",0,,

561582,"i don't give *one fucking shit* if no one reads this but you, chewy_roses. its going to be incredibly wicked long-winded, so get comfy, if you want.   to make things easier, i am a 29 year old, white male who grew up and lives in upstate ny. by ""upstate,"" i mean the albany/troy/schenectady area. i was born in 1982. my parents are 63 (dad, henceforth, dad) and 59 (mom, mom). i drink a lot of beer, go skiing, celebrate st. patricks day with a zest you can't imagine (even though i'm sicilian), go to festivals (alive at five), go to parties in the woods, have snow tires, sleep with downstate girls (thank you, suny albany!). this is where i come from (maybe a little more, but we don't have time for that), but that's not important, right now.  my father was a first generation sicilian. his father was born just before he and my great-grandmother came over on ""the boat."" he is the oldest of six children born in the bronx. his father (grandpa) was a bit of a hustler. he owned butcher shops in the city that were fronts for illegal gambling. he wasn't in the mafia himself, just someone looking to make a buck.   dad was a delivery boy. someone called in a bet, grandpa would ""process"" it, my father would deliver a receipt to whomever placed the bet. if they won, he would go tell them when and where to collect. my father never said anything about people losing. not trying to sound ominous, but he never did.  my mother (mom) was the younger of two. i'm not supposed to say names on reddit, but her older brother was actually nicknamed ""bud."" i always thought that was rad. her father (gramp) grew up in philadelphia and was in world war two. her mother was from corpus christi, texas. i don't know how they met.  my grandpa got caught up in something bad. my father never told me what happened with this other than, he moved his family upstate, a mob ""enforcer"" was supposed to kill my grandfather and, to pacify him, my grandfather made him one of my uncle's godfather and gave him his (the enforcer') name.   my father tried to settle into life in the country. it must have been the late 50's or early 60's. he was enrolled into the local schools. he was a quiet child, odd, since he was the oldest. my grandfather (on my mother's side, gramp) didn't think much of him, and this was years before dad started seeing mom. when i was older and able to understand things a bit more, gramp would tell me that dad had a ""chip on his shoulder.""  oh, the ""chip."" apparently, oldest children are supposed to be ""successful, go-getters"" who are born-leaders or something. i don't know what happened to my father. he was very intense. at least two of my uncles were more alpha than dad. i think...  i can't call dad a ""hot-head"" because he was more about focused anger than rage. its not like he was a powderkeg waiting for a spark. there is conscious to his rage. one of his younger brothers (let's call him joe) was partying at a local motel when he was a teenager, doing acid and drinking brews. joe was hitting on some dude's girlfriend. that dude got upset. drunk, idiotic upset. he hit my uncle joe so hard, part of his face ""drooped,"" like he had a stroke. dad was outside when this happened. when he found out, he went into a blind rage. his friends held him back. he went off and took his anger out on a tree, ripping branches off like a madman. everyone thought he settled down. he said he wanted to talk to the guy that hit his brother. he ended up hitting the guy, with a chair, in the face, several times. this was related to me by a friend of my uncle joe's; everyone thought my father killed the guy.  they thought dad knocked his eye out. turns out, there was just a bunch of blood and somehow, hair, over his eyesocket.      grandpa was an awesome businessman, except when he wasn't. he made and lost several fortunes. when he went upstate, he got into the horseshoe trade.there was a horse-racing track in delaware. grandpa knew the guy that supplied all the horseshoes to this track. well, he died. grandpa saw an opportunity. he built a warehouse on his new land in upstate ny. he made horseshoes. he got somewhat rich.  my mother must have been caught up in the ""sexual revolution"" because, despite having strict methodist parents, she became pregnant, in1968 (she was 17). it was with some guy (she always lived upstate) whose father owned a trailer-park near the town she lived in, upstate. her parents sent her away. a child out of wedlock was a huge deal in our town of 900. i don't know what her parents hoped to achieve or what moments of healing transpired, but they allowed her (and my brother) back. it probably had something to do with her eventually marrying the guy who got her pregnant (more on that, later).   a note on mom and dad, pre-*me*. dad is four years older than mom. our town is small. the high school was 6th through 12th grades. my parents were coy; from what they told me, they ""knew"" each other in school and really, *really* liked the beatles. for whatever reason, my mother went off and lost her virginity to my oldest brother's father. that almost ended my parent's relationship (and me and my next oldest brother's existence). i don't know what happened with them. from *my* experience with girls, anything is possible (for better or worse).  dad went to vietnam. he was a marine. never once did he talk about anything that happened over there. when i was a kid, however, i went through the huge, antique desk in my childhood home and found a bunch of pictures of him with his ""war buddies"" and with a vietnamese woman. she was nude. i never told my parents about my discovery. even then, i knew that my father had been through an incredible ordeal and mom wasn't about to make him feel bad and strip him of the ""tokens"" of said ordeal.  mom was married to my oldest brother's father for two years. they lived in a trailer in the trailer park his father owned. all i know of what happened was what *my* father told me....over three decades after it happened (i was 20). the guy left in the middle of the night, mom moved back in with her parents, mom got divorce papers in the mail six months later.  i'm not entirely sure what transpired next. over the course of a few years, dad came back from vietnam and re-connected with mom. they were married in, what i want to say is, 1974? (sorry, mom and dad). my other brother was born 7/7/77 (no shitting you) and i was *supposed* to come around early december, 1981. it was almost february 1982 when i arrived.   over the course of the 1980's and 1990's, my family (extended, that is) fell to pieces. i swear on my dog, lobo, i am not making this up (except most of the names). my aunts and uncles:  * johnny- (the **coolest** of my uncles, gave me my first beer) married before my father (although dad was the oldest), johnny's wife left him after 30 years of marriage and 3 children. his wife, a chain-smoking skimmy-as-shit woman turned out to be lesbian. she gained almost 100lbs. within a year of divorcing. i always thought she was the coolest. johnny moved in with his mother after the divorce and reverted back to partying like it was the 70's or 80's (read: cocaine and acid). his mother died in 2001 and he has been really unhinged since then (more on that, later)  * jake - married a wonderful women; they had three boys, the oldest was going to be the next peyton manning (he was an amazing football player, 6'3"" 190lbs as a high school sophomore, and even had light brown hair like peyton). they had what i thought was the best marriage until ""peyton"" died in a motorcycle accident (way too common for where i'm from). i don't see jake and his wife anymore. they live 45 minutes from my parents but have distanced themselves from the family (falling out at a family reunion that spilled over into their son's funeral).  * chucky-boy - a hard-luck case. the biggest goof in the family (*lovable* goof). he married a bus driver, who turned out to also be a lesbian. they had three kids, but one of them was from *another guy!* (i swear i'm not making this up) the fucked up thing was, he *was* the most successful. he started building a huge, awesome house (it had a silo with a staircase in it!) she divorced him before it was finished and took all the kids to chicago. he lived in the unfinished house, despite being in debt and paying child-support out the ass. he drank like crazy, survived a triple-bypass, but still died a couple of years ago.  * ""joe"" - he was the hippy, free spirit (like billy crudup in jesus' son). he had 3 kids, but he did too many drugs with his wife. after they divorced, neither of them got the kids. joe's brother, johnny, is now shacked up with her. johnny's oldest daughter actually got custody of the youngest daughter.  * sara rose -the only aunt-by-not-by-marriage, she did well for herself; four daughters and a great husband, but she lives in pennsylvania  * daniel - married for 12 years, turned out to be gay, got divorced  i guess its time to get to the point. the thing is, there are so many obstacles and hurtles to love. people's lives get ruined by love. sometimes, you're on top of the world and think you're awesome. sometimes, your life is crumbling around you.   my father was a solid 5'9"" 190lbs sicilian. my mother looked like melissa gilbert form ""little house on the prarie."" but, they both got old. dad got wrinkly and mom got fat. they turned into faded, sagging, weathered versions of what i had seen in pictures from long ago. their sex life probably died out in the 80's. this happens to *every* couple as long as they stay together. at some point, there is something more important than physical looks. i am jealous of people who have this, even if its a couple of fat, acne-covered teenagers who can't stop looking into each others eyes.  what i'm trying to say is, looking beyond appearance requires an elevated perspective. you can't look for aesthetic beauty in your lifemate forever, unless you alter the criteria for the aforementioned beauty. my parents looked at their whole life together. of course they weren't going to be physically attracted to each other at 50 the way they were when they were 25 (or maybe they were). i think older married couples or life-partners have figured out how to overcome this.  tl;dr yeah! you fucking wish.",1,,1
928340,"part of the problem is that some of the parents who are spending a lot of play time with their kids *are* assholes and are, purposefully or otherwise, teaching their kids to be the same.  but the issue here is not whether you should give your child love and attention.  that's a straw man argument that often comes up when talking about this subject.  *of course* you should give your child love and attention.  but that is not the same thing as having scheduled play time where you act as a playmate for your child.  adults are not proper playmates for a child most of the time.  children should almost always play with other children some of time, and by themselves some of the time.  adults should create a reasonably safe and stimulating environment for play that is age-appropriate.  adults should set and enforce appropriate rules and limits around play.  adults should share ideas and experiences about play.  adults should only participate in play activities with their children if they are the same as the activities the adult would normally engage in.  of course, that's part of the problem:  adults are acting like children, and often engaging in many of the same play activities they enjoyed in childhood (video games is one of the big examples).  by itself there's nothing wrong with adults playing, in fact it's very healthy.  the problem is when adults engage in age-inappropriate play activities with their children.  this is especially true if such play is a regularly scheduled activity with the intent of ""normalizing"" or ""improving"" the child, or creating/maintaining emotional bonds with the child.  this doesn't mean that you can't help your children play.  if they're struggling with something to the point of giving up in frustration, help them figure it out.  maybe demonstrate how to do it.  playmates are really the best for this most of the time, but of course there are and should be limits.  it also doesn't mean you can't watch your children play and encourage them.  of course you should - that's one of the joys of being a parent!  but you're not there to see who can build the best lego spaceship or get the highest score on the video game.  your role is to be a guide, a mentor, a protector when truly needed, and a role model for what they should be like when they become an adult.  adults these days are confused or utterly unaware of the differences between a playmate/friendship bond and the normal healthy loving bond between a parent and their child.  the key differences are that a parent sets boundaries/limits and rules for a child, acts in an age-appropriate manner to model proper adult behavior for their child, and gives their child unconditional love and respect.  playmates and friends are great, and a child should have many of those relationships throughout their life.  but those relationships need to be with other children, not with parents or even other adults.  adults are increasingly adopting the mistaken belief that there's a dichotomy between playing with your kids and being a cold, distant parent and not having the love of your children.  what they don't understand, or have forgotten, is that under normal circumstances children don't show love or appreciation for their parents in the same way that they show affection or appreciation for playmates.  they will show they love and appreciate you even if you don't play with them, as long as you show that you love and appreciate them.  do other things with them besides play!  that means things like reading a book to or with them, going on a picnic, having a conversation about their day or their hopes and dreams or whatever they want, letting them help with housework (really - even kids as young as 2 or 3 under appropriate circumstances and supervision), and many other activities too numerous to practically mention here.  the point of the article, for me, is that our cultural acceptance of adults as playmates for their children comes as a byproduct of negative trends in our society:  isolation of families, excessive focus on conforming definitions of ""success"" and materialism, and unhealthy levels of childishness among parents and adults in general.  many middle- and upper-class children don't have enough opportunities for spontaneous playful interaction with other children.  they don't get enough chances to play by themselves either, which means they aren't developing skills like self-calming and independent pursuit of learning.  they develop an unhealthy excess of reliance on their parents and other adults, and a deficit of courage and desire to explore and learn on their own.  and that is a growing tragedy and a danger to the fabric of our society.",1,1,1

481425,"i'm in university studying ancient greece and rome. i'm afraid you are very wrong. some people certainly lived comparable lifespans to today(i'm looking at you, augustus) but the vast majority died much younger. i'll hunt down a citation and add it to this comment in a little bit.  edit:  from the oxford classical dictionary, 3rd edition:  &gt; there is little evidence with which to estimate the age structure of the population of ancient rome, and even less that of ancient greece because greek funerary monuments, unlike roman ones, rarely record age at death except in the case of extreme youth and extreme longevity. what follows must therefore be treated with extreme caution, as must any such model. it is estimated that in rome ‚Äòmore than a quarter of all live-born roman babies died within their first year of life‚Äô (hopkins). about one-third of the children who survived infancy were dead by the age of 10. upper-class females in their early teens tended to marry males who were at least ten years older. in rome, however, the legal age for marriage was 12 and 14 for females and males respectively (see marriage law). sepulchral inscriptions, no doubt biased in favour of the upper classes, suggest that in the roman world the median age of death was 34 years for wives and 46.5 for husbands. the study of skeletal remains from classical athens has produced comparable results, viz. 35 for women and 44 for men. life expectancy was appreciably lower for women at all social levels, largely because of the debilitating and often lethal effects of childbirth. probably less than one per cent of the population attained the age of 80 and anyone who did so was judged remarkable, as [lucian's] catalogue of octogenarians in macrobii suggests. notwithstanding the brevity of human life, threescore years and ten still constituted the proper quota of years (cf. solon 27. 17f. west, iambi et elegi 2). maximum life-span, viz. about 100 years, appears to have been the same in antiquity as it is today. old age is commonly described as hateful and detestable in classical literature and many lives would have been characterized by increasing incapacitation and loss of mobility from the beginning of the third decade onwards. (the study of skeletal remains at the romano-british cemetery at cirencester indicates that 80 per cent of the population suffered from osteoarthrosis). particularly disadvantaged and scorned were spinsters and widows. certain races had a reputation for extreme longevity, notably the long-lived ethiopians, whose life-span was put at 120 years. many greeks and romans would only have had an approximate notion of their exact age in years, as the expression p(lus) m(inus) ‚Äòmore or less‚Äô, which is frequently found on roman tombstones, indicates.   it's from the entry for ""age"".",0,,

(that is not a moral judgement. the point is that early and mid-teens were abandoning education and becoming mothers before they were socially and emotionally equipped for it.) the public assistance did not make it a good life, but did make it a bearable life.  what works? headstart classes for the youngest and after-school care for all children of working or in-school mothers, tuition vouchers for job and technical training so that it did not come from the general home stipend, subsidized payrolls for employers offering job training, rent subsidies paid directly to the landlord in lieu of cash housing subsidy (get them out of government owned and managed public housing ghettos), food stamps (rather than cash more easily diverted to alcohol, tobacco, drugs), mandatory pre-natal care and parenting classes as a condition of assistance, capping total assistance per mother and per household to discourage additional births. requiring work or community service was politically popular rhetoric but unproductive, but allowing them to work without their earnings reducing the assistance was very positive. home visits (inspections) by social workers enforcing minimum child care, sanitation and nutrition standards, restricting residence to registered household members, vigorous prosecution of fraud.  that differs from the liberal laissez-faire doctrine that sees counseled goals and enforcement of standards as a trampling of civil rights, personally demeaning, alienating and a retardation of individual growth.  i apologize for the long answer, but i was asked.",1,1,

 yes, our cjs needs to be re-examined and altered to insure equality exists for all americans.  yes, some police officers need to do a better job of remaining professional, adhering to their training, keeping cool &amp; not allowing the human suffering and oppression of children many witness on a daily basis to erode their humanity or basic human respect for others.  just as some single &amp; married moms need to do a much better job of parenting by raising, nurturing, socializing &amp; supervising infants, toddlers and children who mature into fairly happy, responsible teens and adults respecting their peaceful neighbors &amp; the authority figures responsible for maintaining peace in our neighborhoods.  i'm sorry to pick on moms, though they are the caregivers we look to keep us safe, cared for &amp; loved right from our start.  peace. _________ doctors ross and dietz offer insights into how our early childhood development plays a key role in determining the type of individual we mature into.  robert k. ross, md, president and ceo of the california endowment, addressed inmates at ironwood state prison offering a compelling overview of the role that exposure to childhood trauma plays in the lives of *emotionally troubled* and chronically ill american teens and adults.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscnub_kbuw  at 2:12:25 in this documentary about mafia hitman and victim of early childhood trauma/abuse, richard ""the iceman"" kuklinski, dr. park dietz explains why young richard most likely developed into a emotionally disturbed, paranoid, cruel, heartless teen and man who did not give a frig about anyone else, including his wife and kids.  https://youtu.be/qxgi72w2h7u?t=2h12m25s __________________________ *(ny times may 18, 2015 - rise in suicide by black children surprises researchers)*  black *(children's)* lives matter; take pride in parenting; *end our national epidemic of child abuse and neglect*; end community violence, police fear &amp; educator's frustrations",1,2,-1

878206,"i think you should agree with the christian grandmother of the infant that the child should be baptized by explicitly following the example set by god made flesh, the holy savior - jesus christ.  ----------------------- jesus was 30 years old (luke 3:23) *now jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. he was the son, so it was thought, of joseph* when (matthew 3:13-17) *13 then jesus came from galilee to the jordan to be baptized by john. 14 but john tried to deter him, saying, ‚Äúi need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?‚Äù*  *15 jesus replied, ‚Äúlet it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.‚Äù then john consented. 16 as soon as jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. at that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 and a voice from heaven said, ‚Äúthis is my son, whom i love; with him i am well pleased.‚Äù*    ------------------------------ there are no passages/scripture in the bible that require infant baptism (and keep in mind the scripture passages requiring ot infant circumcision do not mean nt baptism, they mean chopping off the foreskin of the penis.  if the circumcision argument applied then females would not be eligible for baptism).  the bible does have matthew 25:31-32 31 (*‚Äúwhen the son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 **all the nations** will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.*), where *all the nations* is **interpreted** to include infants, which is used as justification to support infant baptism.   there is no example in scripture of a baby being baptized. however, to conclude from this that babies are not to be baptized is unsupported. neither are there any specific examples of the elderly being baptized, or teenagers, or little children. instead we read about men (acts 2:41; 8:35) women (acts 16:14-15), and entire households being baptized (acts 10:24,47-48; 16:14-15; 16:30-33; 1 co. 1:16).  the precedent is that baptism is not required at a set age. _____________  the covenant with christ (new/full covenant)  infant baptism, and full covenant theology, denies the doctrine of unconditional election. god does not elect you based on who your parents (and by extension, grandparents) are and what they believe.  infant baptism denies limited atonement, too. the new covenant is a covenant in christ's blood. for whom did he die and shed his blood? the elect. to say one who is not elect and not atoned for is in the covenant of his blood means jesus died for all men and those excluded are excluded by their choice or by their failure to ""take advantage"" of the atonement, potentially made for them.  an infant cannot make that choice nor take advantage of accepting the covenant.  additionally baptism is a public profession of personal faith in christ, signifying the reality of being born again. can an infant profess faith?   since there is no explicit command to either baptize or withhold baptism from infants/young children, interpretive prudence requires us to look for precedence in the previous (ot) covenant. as we do this, we see that god, at least one time in history, has explicitly commanded that the sign of the covenant be administered to a person who does not yet possess that which the sign signifies. some may argue that an individual‚Äôs willingness (or ability  e.g., an infant) to agree to the covenant terms is not a prerequisite for membership in the covenant community.  you can infer, from genesis 17, that an individual may enter the covenant through the faith of another.   the sign of the covenant is commanded by god to be given to infants‚Äînot to all infants, indiscriminately‚Äî**but only to those infants within the covenant community; only to children of parents who are within the visible household of faith.**   if the parents of the child/infant do not acknowledge or accept the covenant, then this principle cannot be applied to support the non-election of the infant through baptism (and a christian priest should know this and should also realize that to do so would be a mortal sin).  consider telling the grandmother that to best follow the example exemplified by jesus christ, and in keeping with a strict interpretation of the holy bible (in order to accommodate the well meaning wishes of the grandmother), that the child will (1) be 30 years old to best follow the example of christ, and (2) to have to atone for his/her sins, and (3) to elect to enter into the new covenant with christ.  anything less would be a mockery of the substitutionary or vicarious atonement of jesus christ (i.e., christ died for our sins).  -------------------- &gt;am i over reacting? i think this is a huge problem but maybe i'm just being sensitive maybe its not big deal to just splash some water on the kids head?  personally i do not think you (or your brother if he feels the same way) is over reacting.  if you give in to the misguided, but well meaning, wishes of the christian grandmother right away, you can expect that precedent to be followed for everything in that child's life that the grandmother can influence.   good luck to you.",0,,
744187,"a recent big surprise for me has been the legal analyst: a toolkit for thinking about the law by ward farnsworth. i'm an electronic engineer, son of a mechnical engineer, so i've always viewed lawyers as parasites, but farnsworth has shaken up my world view.  back in 1776 adam smith suggested three conditions, together sufficient for a nation to become wealthy: peace, low taxes, and a tolerably exact administration of justice. farnsworth persuades me that the administration of justice is difficult and that good law and good lawyers make a substation positive contribution to wealth.   a real eye opener is the logic of collective action by mancur olson. like many a classic it is heavy going and i've failed to finish it. however when he published it in 1965 it overturned traditional wisdom about how the world works and the implications of his insights are still filtering through to the world at large.  my third suggestion for mind blowing reading matter achieves profound weirdness by means of excessive orthodoxy. economists have had some success in understanding the economy. the insights of smith into the division of labour and ricardo into comparative advantage have implications that were contrary to the common sense of their day and have yet to be assimilated into our popular wisdom.  simply buy an undergraduate economics text book, such as principles of economics by gregory mankiw, and accept the ""orthodoxy"". this will take you into a looking glass world. the media will report ""the petrol shortage continues even though the government has imposed price controls."" and you will realise that the petrol shortage continues *because* the government has imposed price controls.",0,,

i know many teen girls are too immature to care for a baby, but that doesn't apply to all - or even most - of them. the articles i linked were about challenges of teenage motherhood and how teenage mothers can and should be helped. what is that you don't understand? these are real life stories. about good, though impoverished mothers. why are you comparing these girls to your own unfit mother? why are you speaking for their children?  of course if by ""a better home"" you mean a richer home, then sure, you can deprive all poor people of their children. at least half of single mothers in us live in poverty; but there are many poor married couples too. you avoided answering the question if you would like all of them to place their offspring.  can you show me research that says most children raised by teenage parents suffer? of course not. because there is none. but you know what? how can you know if the same people who became parents as teenagers would be better 10 years later? don't you know that many teenage pregnancies occur in pathological families?

did they think i was not able to be a loving mom? their statement portrayed me as unfit when all i was, was an unwed mother. i needed support and someone to stand by me. no matter how great a life an adopted child receives, it can never compare to the love that a birth mother can give to her child. the security of that love is very nurturing and healthy for the child. i don't think social workers spend enough time studying this. the loss of a birth mother's love is very painful for her child as well as for herself. i know, for myself, my heart has been broken and though i have found my child after many years, my heart will never fully recover from the emptiness i sufferred without him.  &gt; having said that, i got pregnant at 17, didn't drop out of high school, but got out early by taking the ged (since i hated high school), and was invovled with doing various drugs and people that sold drugs from about the age 15-18, although i personally was never addicted to anything. i don't know what this says about how i was raised, but sometimes i wonder how i would have fared if my ""teenage"" birth mom had raised me - she was 17 when i was born. what's better to have in your life, material possessions or the love and closeness of a bio-family? i wish i could have had a little of both and will always wonder what if.   unless you do as much reading as i did about teenage parenthood, please, shut up and stop bashing all teen moms. start with reading all these stories.  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/50zz5z/serious_children_of_teen_parents_what_was_growing/  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/20tdof/serious_children_of_teen_parents_what_was_growing/  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/1q7qoy/children_of_teenage_parents_what_was_it_like/  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/5z7fha/children_of_teen_parents_what_was_your_life_like/  https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2n2ppo/serious_children_of_teen_parents_how_is_your/  i read all of them, asked some people questions, got some answers, made notes. i also read lots of articles, research and stats on single / teenage parents and their children.",1,1,0

191037,"&gt; yes i'm familiar with ""eternal september"" and other elite buzzwords used to denigrate democratic management of content.  dude, that's a biased, superficial, and simply fallacious understanding of the term. **first**, the social content is democratically produced both *before* and *after* any eternal september effect. (example: reddit policy did not substantially change before/after its own es.) thus es cannot possibly mean what you think it to mean, to ""denigrate democratically-produced content""‚Äîthe two are totally orthogonal concerns (they don't imply the other).  **objectively**, eternal september is just a social phenomenon. any thoughtful person would realize there are both desirable and undesirable aspects to website/forum scaling. in particular, and you conveniently gloss over this point, it is important to understand that  *lowest-common-denominator*-produced content is not the same as *democratically*-produced content‚Äîthat's the moral of the story of eternal september. does that make sense so far? so, while es is sometimes used *by* some smart but elitist redditors, there is nevertheless an underlying reality for what's going on. the phenomenon is what matters for analysis.  **more generally**, content quality is always evaluated separate from the content system, not the other way around. in your sloppy reasoning you have conflated the two without  *justification*.   **even though you claim familiarity, you didn't raise nor acknowledge any of these 3 basic issues. i did. see the difference? i'm just saying, maybe you should think on this a little, before continuing to claim there's something wrong with what i've said and continue to say.**",0,,
107314,"&gt;are you suggesting that we go back to the 1930s where a woman's only value is having and raising children?   the opposite, i'm suggesting that having children is a big risk and investment and if we don't see a switch in how people get access to stable jobs and income we're going to have a serious problem going forward.   &gt;, but a lot of 18 year olds are still far too immature to handle the responsibility of raising a child.   yes... hence the whole 'living at home and benefitting from grandparents help' part.   &gt;do you really expect grandparents to raise their grandchildren and provide financial security for them? that's ridiculous. they've already raised their children, it's time for them to enjoy their later years.   i don't think it's a particularly good idea, but with falling middle and lower class wages it's not 20 somethings who have the resources to do so.  also, people have much better quality of life available in their 50's.    but why does that need to be the way it is?  just because that's been the notion since the 1950's doesn't make it a sensible or sustainable system.  maybe that only worked before the advent of the pill?    &gt;a person's early 20s is about growing into a responsible adult and finding their passion, it's not just about having babies because it's the ""right time"" for it biologically. and to suggest that a woman should just put off education so that they're in their best child-bearing years is absurd.   quality education will still be there 2 semesters from now.  but your body might be far less cooperative about having children at my age.  biology imposes a fairly hard limit on women, unfortunately, and addressing that can be very expensive (and still runs into walls).    i agree, we haven't hit the wall yet.  but we're seeing more and more people (particularly women) in post graduate degrees.  that sounds good, but it means they're not entering the workforce until 26 or 27, and the jobs they are getting aren't enough to cover student loan payments.  so much for education being the path to prosperity.    &gt;with all the advances in prenatal care it is perfectly safe for most women in their mid-30s to have children.  yes... but not so much late 30's.  if society continues to (unfairly) make it harder for people to establish themselves financially until later we're going to have a lot more of that as a problem.  &gt;also, women with high levels of education wait longer to have children because they are focused on a career, which will only help the child in the long run financially.  she says to someone surrounded by people with phd's who can't find willing spouses, and many of whom get paid worse than our student internships in science and engineering.    but i agree, more education is more money and more stability in general, eventually, but the payoff is delayed, which puts off having children until later.  that system can only go on so long though, we can't have everyone being in school until they're 27 or 28.    if you had kids earlier your financial stability would really be a benefit to the grandchilden, and your parents stability would be for your  children.  i'm thinking of this more as a negative consequence of economic instability than as desirable outcome.  &gt;i currently work in early childhood education that serves a lot of children of teen parents and very young parents, and i assure you that the grandparents are not always able to provide help to those parents.  a lot of parents can't provide either, and definitely grandparents aren't doing it now, that was my point about a societal shift happening.    &gt;plus, do we really need people to have a lot of children? i think our planet has enough people, we don't need to just make more willy-nilly.  er... the fertility rate in rich countries has dropped to below the population replacement level in a lot of places.  it's about 1.4 in germany and 1.3 in japan, who are in the worst shape.  right now countries (other than japan) are trying to make up that gap with immigration, but immigration only a strategy when other countries aren't affluent either, and have people to spare.  a worldwide significantly shrinking population creates a whole mess of other problems.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate  there are 64 territories there where the fertility rate is below the population replacement level (which is technically above 2 but we can assume 2.0 for our purposes). and the us and a few others are teetering on 2.0.  the japanese solution to this problem is a massive effort to completely restructure their economy after a decade of disaster.  that's preferable as a whole, but it's also not working.  germany is just importing turks and other europeans.    individually we all have to cope with the world we live in, not the world as it should be.  yes, ideally we would like to see wages refloat and economic stability return to make the whole issue moot.  but that's not happening, and the world leadership has more or less made  clear they're not really interested in trying to seriously change that.  so then every person needs to ask themselves what they personally are going to do given that they could be stuck still paying off student loans at 40 without any way to support a family.   &gt;a woman's  while the limits on womens biology are stricter than on men, it's not really a woman's issue so much.  the  root of the problem is that people are too poor to to properly support children until they're approaching too old to have children.  either you try and make everyone richer earlier - which is the ideal, or people have to have someone else support the children.  particularly when the current economic pressure seems to indicate the problem getting worse not better (except in france who seem to have managed to slowly convince people to have babies, mostly algerian immigrants in the south, but babies at least).    &gt; it's time for them to enjoy their later years.  keep in mind part of the problem we have is that people are living healthier lives longer, and then unhealthy lives even longer still.  that sounds good, and like it shouldn't be a problem.  but it is, because the longer people live on retirement benefits and the higher healthcare costs are for  people who live longer the larger the population base you need to support them.  china (mainland china) has what they call the 4-2-1 problem, 4 grandparents, each having  one child, who have then had one child.  so how are 2 adults supposed to support 4 retired parents and children?  the economics on that are impossible.  fortunately, for all the complaining we do about chinas fertility  rate, it's higher than a lot of western countries at 1.73.    hard to 'enjoy their later years' when basically it's impractical for people on average to work much past 70 (again, hard limits on biology) but with no money to sustain them for the next 15 or 20 years of  their lives.    &gt;are you suggesting   no, i was, to use  my own phrase, wondering.  the current system we have is not working.  what people will do about it as it becomes clear governments are not making the right choices to refloat the middle and lower class is not at all obvious.  i would suggest demanding a minimum wage of about 18 dollars an hour and a top marginal tax rate of 70% on the top 0.1% but well, both of those seem to be non starters.",1,1,1

lebanese people -verbal agreements  * i don't know what it is with lebanese people, but generally speaking they are generally word-of-mouth verbal agreement type of people. and its convenientally as hell, they trust you to get shit done, so i get shit done, no red tape involved. http://i.imgur.com/vciuefs.png. like i don't understand how lebanon people fit into the 6 generations curve at all, there a misnomer in terms of marketing. maybe the data  i have is really ancedotal, but i've noticed all lebanonese businessmen are like this, that its all service face-to-face driven most of the time. most of the data i have here are those in gen x or baby boomers, older lebanonese people. i find that across the globe, most gen z boomlets are similar in many ways in terms of purchasing behavior (as technology is global , whereas in the past it was more culturally driven geographically.   * gen x is really hit or miss i think in terms of adapting to technology. gen y uses older software solutions that have been around for longer. gen z generally has the spoiled / highest standards needed / and ready acceptance of tech, gen y is sort of blends the new school and old school ways of doing things  ---------------- ## back to yellow pages, and the 6 generation types  * its interesting to note that yellow pages uses a4 or a5? paper type, slightly smaller than the 8.5""x11"" standard paper. its also interesting to note that currently, yellow pages spans 4 columns, but is going to 3 columns down the road, with just an overall increase in number of pages. the reason why is because old people can't read for shit and need larger font sizes  * who really uses the yellow pages anymore now that google is around? you would be surprised by how many people who can't google or properly search for things. gen y and gen z boomlets generally know how to navigate around the internet pretty well, but gen x is hit or miss. gen x is generally more republican - sided, as well as wealthier overall due to working longer  * generation x is a substantial part of our income. generation x generally has higher margin markups, and lower maintenance overall, compared to gen y (they just do research all day long and never pull the trigger), gen z is too young since there in high school at the latest, no business for us here  ----------- ##who advertises in yellow pages? vs. google?  * back to yellow pages. the vast majority of people from what i've been told is that gen x, and baby boomers are the vast majority of people that use the yellow pages. most notably, the yellow pages is similar to angie's list, its mostly service-based companies that need to be done in person. pest control from orkin, directtv, plumbing services, graphic design, lawyers (first page has a really big one), nail and salon treatment, septic services. you won't see many good-driven industries inside the yellow pages (best buy, homedepot, things of that nature)  * advertising in the yellow pages is significantly higher than anything i've seen with advertising on google, cpc, social media keyword ads run, adsense, etc. depending on the size of the page you want, as well as whether its 1 or 2 pages, the total tab can run anywhere from upwards of $6000/month as i'm told, depending on whether you package services together, and that's just for your geographic region. orkin does this a lot in their yellow pages, but they get discount deal packages, so they probably pay$3000/ month here  * compared to google organic traffic (which is free), actually let's compare that to paid based advertising in google. google makes a vast majority of its money through companies advertising through there, adsense marketing.   * they also recently did away with righthand banners and now put the top 4 paid links in a normal listening, mostly due to the fact people are using phones now and could not see the paid advertisement  * there is a company that i know offhand that is spending $1million / month on seo advertising, as well as grossly revenues of about $600 million and growing out all the time.  * **what is my point here? i am getting off topic**? my point here is that i don't know that much about older demographic purchasing behaviors since i haven't lived that time frame, and because of the longer history, there's a much more variety in subdemographics within baby boomers and gen x. people from different nationalities, from different continents, etc. its hard to say what the purchasing behaviors here",0,,

570944,"&gt; i wouldn't even call it a mental illness, given that there is a movement among the members of that community - just like there has been in the deaf community - to try to get us to accept it as a normal but unique way to relate to the world.  why? i think the autism community wants to move away from calling it a mental illness because there's a stigma around the term ""mental illness"", but the real problem here is the stigma and not the classification. the stigma of being diagnosed with a mental illness is a separate issue from the very real and true fact that:  &gt;a brain development disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior  meets the qualification of   &gt; a psychological or behavioral pattern that occurs in an individual and is thought to cause distress or disability that is not expected as part of normal development or culture  granted, i agree that there's no reason to treat the mentally ill with such stigma (it's obviously something they're not capable of controlling), but to try and change the facts simply because the autistic community doesn't enjoy being ostracized because people are unable to cope with the mentally ill is dishonest and simply false.   &gt; one has to first of all define what an impulse is  here you are:  &gt;urge: an instinctive motive  &gt;humans have certain desires to do things - and they ought to be wise in how they approach the task of fulfilling their goals.  yes, that's exactly my point. most humans have, at some point in their lives, had a desire to do something inappropriate such as strike another person who's aggravating them. we're largely capable of controlling these desires, because we understand that violence isn't a part of appropriate social interaction.   that doesn't mean i think all autistic children are ticking time bombs, or that all adults are well-behaved individuals. but it's ignorant and dangerous to assume we shouldn't be more mindful of individuals with a disease characterized by:  &gt; impaired social interaction and communication  especially in light of the fact that an impaired communicative ability means they're sometimes unable to voice their frustration adequately.  &gt;i think that people who live in a rigid structure throughout their childhood and youth tend to act out childishly because they are treated as children - even as they get older. they aren't given the opportunities to socially mature. they don't have a proper adolescence; they don't have the opportunity to learn how to act as an adult among adults. i've seen this more among those with cerebral palsy. autistic folks seem to have enough opportunities to grow up socially, it seems to me.  &gt;the upshot, however, is that if a person is given the role of a child... and all of his decisions are made for him... then that person might very well frequently act out as a child would in that situation - because that person has the same need to manuever around and affect the social politics of the environment that a child has.  yes, there's a well-known sociological theory called ""labeling theory"" describing exactly what you've said here.  that means nothing to the individual who has to deal with an autistic adult, however. in fact, i'm not even arguing with you that society needs to treat the mentally ill differently: we do. there's a large stigma regarding the mentally ill which still persists, and much of society could stand from education regarding mental illnesses.  that doesn't mean we need to whitewash the diagnosis of autism because the public reacts in a negative way that the autistic community doesn't approve of.  &gt; certainly, people like schizophrenics are known to act out physically in relation to their imaginary world. they may flutter their eyes, or they may walk in circles. but those actions do not mean that they are oblivious to hazards around them, or ways in which they might cause harm around them.  schizophrenics have an abnormal perception of reality. if your perception is abnormal, you may in fact be incapable of distinguishing between what's real and what's not - especially if your brain function is abnormal.   i can tell you from personal experience my aunt is a diagnosed schizophrenic who threatened my grandmother with a knife because she believed my grandmother was trying to kill her by poisoning her cereal: this is actually how they came to realize she was suffering from schizophrenia.   the point of medicine isn't to gloss over facts you find disconcerting or unappealing: it's diagnosis and treatment, even if the treatment is simply learning how to cope with a disease. society's reaction to that disease should not have even the slightest effect on the medical knowledge regarding that disease.",1,-1,0

876593,"wow.  really?  that's the argument you are going to go in swinging with?  most of her talking points have been refuted a long time ago.      &gt;by embracing gay marriage the legal establishment will have declared that the public purposes of marriage no longer include anything to do with making babies, or giving children mothers and fathers.     which is why sterile people are not allowed to marry.  neither are senior citizens.  i think i got that answer from an email featuring dr. laura in 1999.  hint:  marriage isn't about babies.    &gt;losing it (as john o'sullivan makes abundantly clear) means losing marriage as a social institution, a shared public norm.    this isn't a bad thing.  we lost slavery as a public norm and female subjugation too.  sometimes the old ways are not the best ways.  saying ""that's the way it was"" doesn't translate into ""that's the way it should be"".    &gt;family structure does not count.    okay, i admit, i took this out of context.  i just wanted to agree with her on something.    &gt;the question is not whether this is a battle we can win, but whether it is a battle we can afford to lose.    it sucks when other people get rights equal to your own.  this whole equality thing, such a sham.  lame!    &gt;the consequences of our current retreat from marriage is not a flourishing libertarian social order, but a gigantic expansion of state power and a vast increase in social disorder and human suffering.    whoa, hold up.  did she just say what i think she just said?  she is blaming unnecessary wars, a broken economy, blow-hards like rush limbaugh, unemployment, drug issues and the like on *marriage* failing as an institution?  really?  all of our ills are because we didn't take care of the institution of marriage.  no, really.  less drinky-drinky before posty-posty miss maggie.    &gt;the good news is that a marriage recovery appears to be on its way: rates of divorce have dropped, illegitimacy is leveling off, marital fertility is on the rise, adult commitment to marital permanence is increasing, and the next generation's dislike of divorce is rising; the consensus that children do better when parents get and stay married is now broad, if shallow.    actually i think this has more to do with the uncertain times we are in.  no one wants to throw away their only life-line and potential backup income source.    &gt;the bad news is that gay marriage will gut this marriage movement, and reverse these gains.    precisely.  for every homosexual couple that weds, 17 heterosexual couples realize their marriages are meaningless shams, they will get into drugs, booze and encourage their children to get pregnant before they graduate.    &gt;marriage will no longer be a carrier of the message that children need mothers and fathers.    it never was.  single parents anyone?    &gt;instead the law will legitimate the principle of family diversity: that adults get to form the families they choose and children will resiliently adjust.     *legitimize*.  c'mon, proofread with me.  also, adults do get to choose the families they want to have.  and children will adjust.  you think having gay parents is any worse than having a disabled parent?  one with brain damage?  a fugitive parent?  an absent one?  a religious nutbag of one?  no?  well the kids seem to be doing okay with the really bad parents.  having gay parents isn't a bad thing.    &gt;school textbooks, teen-pregnancy programs, and abstinence education (to mention just a few venues) will all be forced to carry this new unisex marriage vision.    as they should.  y'know *why* people think kids with gay parents will have a tougher time?  because they will be bullied for having gay parents.  because uninformed twits like miss maggie keep teaching kids that being gay is wrong.  if everyone grew up thinking that gay parents were no big deal, people wouldn't get bullied over it.     &gt;what will happen to american civilization then? marriage is a universal human institution. we do not know of any culture that has survived without a reasonably functional marriage system.   they will learn to accept people that are different and make a positive contribution to the world?  look north you silly twit.  canada.  where i live.  gay marriage is *legal*.  our society has not fallen apart.  we are stronger for it.    &gt;if marriage and children are just one of many private lifestyle choices, people stop getting married and they stop having children in numbers large enough to replace the population.     what?  what?  no really.  what?  tom and buck get married, so couples around the country say to each other ""oh, let's just not have kids"".  seriously.    &gt;(one child is enough to make you a mother. when marriage is unreliable, just how foolhardy do you expect women to be?)    ""honey, i wish i could marry you, but two lesbians in iowa have just tied the knot.  i'm afraid our love is just an empty shell of a useless sham.  we must never speak again.  i shall go to my grave barren in protest.  goodbye.""      &gt;marriage is not an option, it is a precondition for social survival.    ‚ô´hy*per*bole!‚ô´    &gt;but when a society abandons the marriage idea altogether as a shared public norm, do not expect private individuals to be able to sustain marriage.    ""well honey, i like you a lot, but since our marriage is a value-less sham in a failed institution, i'm just going to have to divorce you for over-cooking tonight's roast.  the kids?  oh since the institution is flawed, i no longer love them.  actually, i don't think i ever did.  i always thought the red-headed one was a little bitch.  pass the peas would you?""    &gt;winning the gay-marriage debate may be hard, but to those of us who witnessed the fall of communism, despair is inexcusable and irresponsible.    whoa.....  she just brought gay marriage to communism.  apparently all the communists were gay-married.  who knew?     wow.  maggie gallagher is what is wrong with the world today.  it's not that she has a different view point, it's that she expresses it so poorly and makes so many logic-free leaps that it is stunning.    as an aside, i loved that the on-page ad was for a dating site asking me to find my lesbian match.",0,,

901669,"you're treading on very thin philosophical ice here.  you are claiming a right to property but not a right to free speech?  i'd like to know how you justify this.    you can't obtain property without speech.  speech - communication - is absolutely necessary to get property.  so how can you not have a right to speech?  and further, you aren't born with property.  you are born with the capablity for speech.  i would say the right to speech is inherent as part of our being human - the right to property is a social construct.  we aren't born with a property-gathering instinct.  that has to be learned.  (to be specific, i'm not saying we're naturally communistic either, but rather we're something of a blank slate where society impresses its views on property onto the youth.  if they're born in america, they learn about self-fulfillment through wealth accumulation.  if they're born in bhutan, they learn about inner peace and the impermanence of the physical world.)  as such, i wholly reject any notion that government can or should be solely concerned with the protection of property rights.  for one thing, such a government you're describing is totally fantasy and unlikely to ever exist.  that makes it real easy to describe the hypothetical advantages of a place which has no danger of actually existing to prove you wrong.  in literature, this is commonly called a *utopia*, and since you brought up rand, i'll assure you - galt's gulch was very much a utopia in the literary sense.  you know what made galt's gulch work?  everyone agreed to obey the rules.  that's it.  with a small group of people, absolutely any governmental system can work - from galt's gulch to the most self-less collective - if everyone is there because they believe in it and are all working in good faith to keep the system going.  if you're curious sometime, just to illustrate what i said, go read up on the [oneida colony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oneida_colony) sometime.  it was a collectivist free-love commune from the late *19th* century that managed to function perfectly for roughly three decades.  what tore it apart, ironically, was their children rebelling and deciding they wanted traditional marriages.    i'm not saying this to advocate this way of life, but only as an illustration of the point - a highly idealistic social experiment will only work so long as everyone in it honestly wants to help make it work.  that's why overly simplistic utopian governments - from plato's republic to rand's gulch - would not work in real life.  they have to be resilliant enough to tolerate differences in opinion and to resist internal forces working perhaps against the ideals of the system.  that's why all modern successful countries are founded on compromise.  and a no-compromise approach such as trying to institute a strict libertarian system would similarly either a)fail utterly, or b)just devolve into a slightly less statist version of what we have today.  and what's the point of tossing the baby out with the bath water if you're just going to end up right back where you were?  and that is why i reject your proposition on the nature of government, both philsophically and pragmatically.  and as far as the cra goes, honestly...  can you scientifically *prove* that it caused race relations to get a thousand times better?  no.  but when you can look at the era pre-cra and then the era post-cra and see such a massive watershed change in race relations...  no one with any honesty wouldn't admit it at least had a huge amount to do with it.  when large change is wrought, the largest identifiable contributing factor is probably responsible.  occam's razor.",0,,

509491,"the usual discussion of the ""replacement rate"" is in terms of children per woman per lifetime, not children per 100 or 1,000 people per year. so, assuming a 50/50 sex ration in the population, to keep the population stable, you would need the average woman to have:   - one child to replace herself; - one additional child to replace a male member of the population; and - a fraction of a child to make up for infant mortality, infertility, etc.  with modern medicine being what it is, that fraction is quite small in the developed world -- about 0.1 of a child.   the social and economic consequences of falling below replacement in any given country really depend a lot on the situation. the standard response of ""now this small number of young people have to take care of this large number of old people"" is a little bit too simplistic. how long do people live after they stop being productive enough to sustain themselves, given better health and less-physically-demanding jobs? how much of their productivity during their careers can be set aside to cover their retirement costs? is the cost of a certain standard of medical care for the elderly going up or going down? do retirees remain integrated into families or mixed-age communities, or are they clustered separately?  are there people available from other countries who are willing to come and work?  are life expectancies continuing to increase or leveling off?  further, assume that the birth rate drops to a new, stable level -- even if the level is below replacement. there will still be a difference between the era right after the drop and future eras. right after the drop, there will be a large [""demographic bulge""](http://4cwswx3jkegiq3b3b22mhltymm.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image4.png) of middle-aged people with relatively few in the generation underneath.  as they age further, the population profile will be shaped more like a [weather balloon](http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/storymaker-photos-red-bull-stratos-skydive-twitter-12101412-515x387.jpg) (or felix's balloon, in this case). but that bulge is temporary. once the last high-birth generation dies, even if births remain below replacement, the slope down from the higher elderly population to the lower productive population will be much gentler. in fact, a significant part of america's looming crisis in social security and medicare payments is due to a temporary bulge as the baby boomer generation ages through.  but let's go further and assume that there is a global decline in birthrates to some level below replacement, and we are just taking the whole human economy as one unit. if the decline were hugely steep and sudden, then the negative consequences could be quite dramatic. important areas of the economy would not be able to pass on their specialized knowledge or continue to innovate because there would simply be too few people around to join the ranks.   but many of the doom-and-gloom aspects of declining population are not necessarily inevitable. remember that much economic politics is fixated on gdp: we want to have the most total amount of stuff, or some other country will dominate us. but a population (and its total economic footprint) can shrink while at the same time individuals become wealthier. with dramatic increases in the efficiency of communicating and storing information, along with more and more automation, institutional memory in industries may be less important than before, and fewer workers can perform more tasks.   moreover, many of the tasks in the modern economy are actually about dealing with the consequences of human society having too much *scale*.  we have to provide products for such a huge number of people, so it is vital that the production of each one become greener, cheaper, less resource-intensive, suited to a lifestyle lived in a smaller space, less dependent on rare materials, etc., etc. if there were a significant contraction in population, society would lose quite a bit of economic prowess, but it would also be relieved of the extreme pressures currently bearing down on land, natural resources, transportation infrastructure, etc. so fewer people might mean that it takes a lot longer to build a smart, green car. but fewer people might also mean that there is a less urgent need for a smart, green car.   and that sort of highlights the elephant in this room as well. if humanity continues to grow, it will face exhaustion of the natural resources that underpin the economy or a dramatic decline in the standard of living -- in fact, probably both. if we level off at a replacement level, then we will be in a three-way race between our ability to deliver the same or better lifestyle with fewer resources, accepting a step down in lifestyle, or exhausting the planet and being forced into a step down in lifestyle.   so the dramatic consequences of population *loss* aren't actually all that different than the dramatic consequences of continued population *gain* or even of steady replacement. it's just that the race looks different, and its possibilities may actually be a bit more open. the question becomes whether a smaller number of people, albeit with *fewer* resource constraints, can provide the same level of output per person as their parents did, when their parents had fewer free resources but were able to take advantage of better economies of scale in their output.   of course, at *some* point, if the population decline were really *permanent*, that race would be lost. there are some outputs that really require a global set of industries to support them and make them viable in terms of cost, and so a human population falling toward zero would by totally unable to produce some things that a global planet would enjoy. but during the period of decline when you're still talking about having billions of people on the planet, it's not necessarily the case that everything that's cutting-edge now will just *break*.   what all this ignores is that there are important and natural feedback mechanisms in societies that genuinely feel threatened by low birth rates. they start heavily incentivizing the decision to have children.",0,,

803985,"i think this is another good example of a baby boomer in love with himself and his ""generation"". let's not forget these are the same people who protested against the vietnam war, not because they didn't believe in the war, but because they didn't want to go to war themselves (remember, 'nam had the draft), and then the same well-raised folks elected bush into office twice, full-well knowing the guy was a warmonger out to start some global fights. why? they were all past drafting age. every generation believes they had a better childhood than their kids or their grandkids when they start to get old. i find it pretty amazing this guy claims that just because his generation played outside, they managed to come up with some of the greatest innovations in history. i think the real reason the boomers managed to survive so amazingly well is antibiotics (duh!). of course, thanks to their ""prescribe pennicillin for everything"" attitude (okay, that was more their parent's attitude, but they continued that practice), our generation gets to deal with things like extremely drug resistant tb, not to mention the fact that some of those ""history's greatest innovations"" the boomers came up with are things like: cellphones, dvd players, video games... the boomers were born to parents who split the atom, sent a man to the moon and invented the computer. so far, all the boomers seem have done is figure out how to make money off the achievements of the first half of the 20th century. i'm not trying to say being from generation y makes me better than them; far from it. but baby boomers will go down in history as the biggest polluters the world has ever seen (unless our generation some how manages to cop out and stick our heads up our butts, like our parents did). i find it pretty hard to buy into the concept that because they had a different childhood, they were somehow better than our generation. not to mention i was raised in the 80's and i experienced pretty much everything this article talked about. video games and tv didn't play a large role in my life until i was a teenager, and i think that is still common for a lot of kids (if they're parents are on the ball).",1,0,-2
736506,"its part social conditioning, part facts (i mean, you literally know less about the world when younger), and part gauging repercussions.  its funny that teen on teen is considered okay when the negative outcomes from that sex can be identical as between teen on adult.  a lot of people beg the question ""sex between a teen and adult is immoral/wrong"".  if you can find a teen who has sex with an adult and then it emotionally damages them, while sex with another teen wouldn't, you can very possibly find a teen where sex with another teen in shallow, unstable teen relationships might harm them but sex with an adult in a stable relationship wouldn't.  the arguments from one side are simply denying that alternatives exist, in a form of false dilemma. either teens have sex with each other, doesn't hurt them, or teens have sex with adults, which hurts them.  historically, the age of consent was far lower, and that pretty well indicates that they didn't actually think sex beyond that age was a problem; they actually thought sex outside marriage was the problem.  now we've inverted these rules. sex as a teen is a problem, sex outside marriage isn't.  in the ancient eras, making boys drink a guy's sperm as a ritual initiation was acceptable. they didn't consider it immoral. now we would. i think that's a good thing. i think force or coercion is the biggest factor in morality.  lets say in 200 years, what if people decided it should be lower, and that sex shouldn't be seen as an everliving terror, but as a a normal, uninteresting, and basic part of human life. these theoretical people might regard sex between someone 16 and 16 or someone 16 and 60 as ""well, people will do what they want, and we want to let them because we like giving people freedom and agency, and its just sex"".  i guess its really a combination of things, maybe stemming from puritan roots. sex is special, sex is dangerous, sex is sinful, sex is desirable to get, sex is a human need, but sex in the wrong way is a horrific and damaging process, etc etc.  sex isn't like any other crime. it is a normal process that may conditionally be a crime if we simply don't like how its been performed.  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  ---   needless to say, many disagree. dr. david spiegel, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at stanford university, said that minors were too young to consent to a sexual relationship with an adult, even if they say they want it.  ''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.  a model for that balance can be found in the netherlands, she argues. in 1990 the dutch parliament made sexual intercourse for people between the ages of 12 and 16 legal as long as there was mutual consent; the law excludes adult family members and authority figures like teachers and members of the clergy. parents can overrule a child's wishes only if they persuade the council for the protection of children that they are acting in the child's best interest. children can also bring charges if they feel they are being exploited or coerced.  but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.  the university of minnesota press has already received some 800 e-mail messages and 200 phone calls about ms. levine's book, most of them fiercely negative, said douglas armato, the press's director.   ---  http://www.salon.com/2002/04/19/levine_talks/  http://www.alternet.org/story/12960/what_judith_levine_is_really_saying  now, in omparsion to this op story of a woman sexually abusing her own child, fuck her. people like her are awful and they shouldn't be given a pass. spend some time in prison.",0,,

 &gt;  &gt;  &gt; favorite shows?  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; your top 3 movies? &gt;  &gt;  &gt; assuming you watch some modern shows that are set 60-70 years ago, mad men for example, do you find them an accurate depiction of that time?  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/xove1/_/c5obdod?context=1) (methusela1915):**  &gt; he's sleeping now but i'll do my best. he worked in big advertising for a number of years actually, a whole area of his life that we didn't even touch on.  &gt;  &gt; all he watches nowadays is baseball. but i've heard my mom comment that mad men gave her a vague feeling of familiarity and she didn't know why. finally she realized it was because it reminded her of her childhood and the clothes my grandma and grandpa wore.   *****  **[question](/r/iama/comments/xove1/_/c5oaqt3?context=1) (clubber_lang):**  &gt; i'd love to hear more details about why you didn't like roosevelt. this is a really great ama -- thank you! &gt;  &gt; edit: great username, too!  **[answer](/r/iama/comments/xove1/_/c5oblck?context=1) (methusela1915):**  &gt; i think it was the clashing of two strong personalities. or rather, roosevelt's incredibly overpoweringly strong personality and my grandpa's youthful strong opinions. but he thought roosevelt was a very domineering personality who always had to have things his way and who would appoint yes-men rather than people who were really competent. we have a letter somewhere where he describes it, i'll see if i can find it tomorrow.  &gt;  &gt; edit: and thanks, he loves that song.

969189,"*the following comment comes from another thread and is a rebuttal of accusations that male circumcision has appreciable health benefits.*  &gt; **the benefits (accoridng to the neutral mayo clinic) circumcision *may* have health benefits, including**  according to the [american academy of pediatrics](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686):  &gt; existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.  now, about the specific items you listed (read the aap report too):  &gt; **decreased risk of urinary tract infections. the risk of urinary tract infections in the first year is low, but these infections may be up to 10 times as common in uncircumcised baby boys. severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later on.**  that's the relative risk. ask yourself what the absolute risk actually entails. according to the aap:  &gt; data from europe, based on a largely uncircumcised population, report uti rates of 1.2% for infant boys. the number is similar to the rates of 0.7% to 1.4% reported for uncircumcised males in the united states and canada. in comparison, uti rates for circumcised male infants in the united states and canada are reported to be 0.12% to 0.19%. although these cross-cultural data do not provide information on specific individual risk factors, the similarity of european and american uti rates for uncircumcised male infants support an association between circumcision status and uti. using these rates and the increased risks suggested from the literature, **one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a uti during the first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants.**  *utis are rare!*  almost all urinary tract infections are quickly eradicated with simple antibiotics, which are much cheaper and much less invasive than subjecting *healthy* infants to genital-reduction surgery.  consider [these numbers](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti/):   &gt; wiswell's sensational statistic, that circumcision resulted in a ""ten to hundred times decrease in urinary tract infections in circumcised boys,"" has often been quoted; however, it is misleading. in fact, utis are so rare in any case that, using wiswell's data, 50 to 100 healthy boys would have to be circumcised in order to prevent a uti from developing in only one patient. (using more recent data from a better-controlled study, the number of unnecessary operations needed to prevent one hospital admission for uti would jump to 195.49)  according to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):  &gt; utis are rare in men, so all cases require investigation.  *did you ever pause to think about the other sex in this case?*  according to a [scandinavian study](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/uti/)):  &gt; girls and boys have about the same incidence of uti in the first year of life. girls have a four times higher incidence of uti in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys.  and according to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm) (and keep in mind that circumcision is [rare in the uk](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9yodm/we_really_do_face_a_phenomenon_which_deserves/c0f2u55)):  &gt;  uti is 50 times more common in women, with about 5 per cent per year developing symptoms.  &gt; uti is uncommon in men below 60 years of age, but the frequency is similar in men and women in older age groups.  and according to [emedicine](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231574-overview):  &gt; adult women \[in the u.s.\] are 30 times more likely than men to develop a uti.  good lord!  *where's your argument for messing around with girls'/womens' genitals? after all, it's been noted that removing the labia and clitoral hood reduces smegma and enhances hygiene.*  just think about that for a while.  &gt; **occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis may be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).**  there are [2 types of phimosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777539-overview) (also, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/ahawi/i_am_an_uncircumcised_21_year_old_who_never/c0hkc5g)):  * **physiologic**: when boys are born, their penises are immature; the foreskin is fused to the head of the penis (ripping them apart is the first step of neonatal circumcision).  * **pathologic (genuine problem)**: the foreskin becomes unretractable after it was already retractable; this usually happens because the preputial orifice (the ""opening"") becomes scarred and therefore too inelastic.  according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=phimosis&amp;oldid=318620912#incidence) (and the sources cited there):  &gt; a commonly cited incidence statistic for pathological phimosis is 1% of uncircumcised males.  ooooh! big problem!  many cases could probably be resolved with a few months of stretching and some kind of steroidal ointment. surgically, preputioplasty is popular in europe and much less invasive than circumcision.  did you know that women get phimosis too? their clitoral hoods are too tight to allow their clitorises to engorge fully and they can similarly suffer from infections as a result; one solution is removal of the clitoral hood, which is probably illegal to perform on minors in the u.s. (on account of the anti-fgm federal law), though it is a valid elective procedure for adults.  sadly, american doctors have been traditionally ignorant for most of the last century about *physiologic* phimosis, so many boys have been wrongly diagnosed with *pathologic* phimosis and subsequently referred for circumcision unnecessarily.  worse, it's been the advice (until the near past) of numerous american medical organizations and child-rearing resources that parents should forcibly retract the foreskin in order to prevent adhesions. however, its this forcible retraction that rips the foreskin from the head of the penis, which can result in pathologic-phimosis-inducing scarring. the wounded foreskin and head can actually heal together again, which is why it was advised to perform this forcible retraction at each washing, thereby compounding the problem.  &gt; **this can also lead to inflammation of the head of the penis.**  this is called [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/), and it occurs in circumcised males as well; it can be caused by excessive washing (especially when an abrasive soap is used), indicating that over-zealous parents might be causing some portion of cases.  &gt; **decreased risk of penile cancer. although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men.**  again, look at absolute risk.  according to the american academy of pediatrics (same link):  &gt; cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the united states.\[91\]  in countries where the overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of penile cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in denmark\[92\] to 2.9 to 6.8 per 100 000 in brazil93  and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in india.\[94\]  &gt; ...  &gt; an annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases of penile cancer per year per 1 million men. although the risk of developing penile cancer in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is increased more than threefold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies.  there is evidence that the ""benefit"" of circumcision in the case of penile cancer is only conferred to men circumcised in infancy, and there is a strong link between hpv infection of the penis and penile cancer. therefore, it's pretty clear that preventing penile cancer (already an extremely rare disease) is really a matter of preventing a sexual disease that is known to cause cancer: then, why not use the much cheaper and far less invasive approach of pushing safe sexual practices (such as using condoms), which must be done anyway.  &gt; **decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases. safe sexual practices remain essential, but circumcised men may have a slightly lower risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases ‚Äî including hiv, the virus that causes aids.**  please [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9rvgf/pascals_wager_again_quite_a_nice_comic/c0e5kjy).  in particular, note:  * [this recent 30 year study in new zealand (which followed a group of boys from age 3 to age 32)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=abstract) reported that ""consistent with recent population-based cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce the risk of the common stis in the general population in such countries.""  * [in this very recent study out of south africa](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490f-44f5-ac5e-17893a3764ba.asp), they modeled various means of preventing hiv, and made the following conclusion about circumcision: ""we were surprised by how little effect it had""; condoms and treatment availability were forecast to be 20x more effective and cheaper. and that's where the hiv prevalence is 20%! how much of an effect would circumcision have in the u.s. where the prevalence is *0.6%* (of sexually active adults)?  * of the 0.6% of sexually active u.s. citizens who are infected with hiv, *over half* are men who have sex with men (gays/bisexuals), for whom circumcision has been shown to be useless in a number of studies. a large chunk more of hiv positive individuals are users of intravenous drugs. **the point is that there is a very narrow population that is at risk, so it's insane to target the general population of infants who won't be having sex for nearly 2 decades anyway.**",0,,

788773,"another explanation of these data is found in barlow, sakheim, and beck's ( 1983) theory of the role of anxiety and attention in sexual responding. it is possible that viewing homosexual stimuli causes negative emotions such as anxiety in homophobic men but not in nonhomophobic men. because anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection, this theory would predict increases in erection in homophobic men. furthermore, it would indicate that a response to homosexual stimuli is a function of the threat condition rather than sexual arousal per se. whereas difficulties of objectively evaluating psychoanalytic hypotheses are well-documented, these approaches would predict that sexual arousal is an intrinsic response to homosexual stimuli, whereas barlow's (1986 ) theory would predict that sexual arousal to homosexual stimuli by homophobic individuals is a function of anxiety. these competing potions can and should be evaluated by future research. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/freud.html",0,,

282286,"yeah, it is one of those chicken/egg things. i mean theoretically, all people have a self, it may just not be a healthy or well adapted one. but this ""lack of self"" is kinda how the above conversation happened. we were discussing the theory of the *self concept*, which is sort of the collected stories you tell yourself *about* yourself. the healthy self concept matches with what happens in the environment. so a person who tells themself they are a fabulous basketball player but plays very badly has a very inaccurate self concept. but that person may change the story to ""i really enjoy playing basketball even if i'm not very good at it."" this brings the self concept into alignment with reality and eases their distress because they are more likely to experience things that are consistent with their expectations.   well, i noticed growing up in a abusive environment throws a real wrench into this process. the child is forces to adopt the stories *the parent* tells about them in order to be congruent with the environment. it actually makes *more sense* for the child to adapt a self concept of ""i'm a loser, i can't do anything right"" because it makes what happens to them consistent. the end result is the child has to enmesh with the parent to have a self because it's the only way things make sense.   this also means the later distress doesn't come from the self concept not overlapping the environment, but from the self concept forcing the individual into self-fulfilling prophecies to force the environment to match. the end result is we engage in a lot of unconsciously driven behaviors that keep making those stories true. because it's actually a very intense process to rewrite them. changing the self is often an unpleasant process.   so with self esteem, self love, or any self positive aspect: try asking youself what is the story you tell yourself about those things? that's how your self views them and you may be unconsciously sabotaging the process because if you have self esteem then you cease being *you*. and remember that all your dissociated parts will also have a story.  one of my problems with our understandings of self-esteem and other positive psychology terms is that they were studied on healthy people. the view of positive psychology was to focus on what was going right  instead of wrong. and what traumatology is teaching is the the path from right *to* wrong it more important than the signs at either end.",1,1,-1
117523,"**tl;dr** - didn't care about music for a bit, linkin park and green day were my favorite bands in middle school, my musical tastes exploded in high school, i currently attend music school for classical piano.  **basic information**: born in 1992.  currently studying classical piano at a conservatory.  i also play violin and drums.  **context - my parents**: my mother had some natural musical inclination.  she never really had the chance to exercise it or nurture it growing up in taiwan, it wasn't until she moved to the united states as a young adult that she had the opportunity to take a few years of piano lessons.  she has always had a relatively amateur love for classical piano music.  my father, on the other hand, has no musical *talent* per se, but he loved his records as a teenager in the 1960s and all that stuff.  **early childhood**: i more or less grew up at the piano.  before i could even reach the keyboard, i was wandering over to the old digital keyboard we have in our house and plunking out simple tunes.  my mother started searching for a piano teacher for me when i was only 3.  we discovered shortly thereafter that i had perfect pitch and an incredibly good ear otherwise.  i had my first piano teacher from 3 to 5, and then i switched to the teacher whom i had until college, a graduate of curtis.  i began violin lessons at the age of 6, and continued them until college.  i disliked it much of the time, but in retrospect i wish i had taken them more seriously, when played *well* the violin is a truly beautiful instrument.  **the ""brat"" years**: late elementary school and middle school.  around the age when kids really start to develop their own independent tastes in music (and when a lot of them, *especially* myself, become conceited little piece of shit asshole brats).  up until this point i just listened to whatever i heard in passing - mom and dad's cds and the shit that my classmates listened to, which was, as i recall, mostly britney spears and the backstreet boys.  i hadn't really taken an active interest in music, didn't have any ""favorite"" anything (band or song or album).  i really enjoyed the crappy radio station that my bus driver listened to every morning, so i started listening to the radio a whole bunch.  then things progressed really fast - after that, i remember really enjoying linkin park (meteora was the first album i ever bought), then sugarcult (i still listen to start static and whatever the next album after that is sometimes for nostalgia's sake), then green day - this was right around when american idiot was coming out, if not a little before.  then i discovered all the rock and prog groups of the 1960s and 1970s via my dad's cd collection (i remember really liking pink floyd and yes in particular), and that led to discovering dream theater and rush, my two favorite bands for *years*.  it was also around this time that i picked up the drums.  i'm fully self-taught, never took any lessons.  i remember my mom being pretty peeved  that i was devoting so much of my energy and time to the drums and not the piano or the violin, and that i was blasting dream theater all day.  i wasn't the greatest at rebelling.  but dammit all if i didn't love those drums, for years i dumped every cent i ever earned or was given into them - new pieces of equipment, new cymbals, new drumsticks and drumheads, etc.  hell, they're still one of my prized possessions.  i may only be able to play a few times a year these days but i still love them to death - a musician's emotional attachment to their instrument(s) can be a blessing and a curse all bundled up into one.  **high school**: all of that ^ , took place in the course of about three or four years.  i was just constantly discovering and devouring new music.  in high school, i discovered a bunch of things that really changed the course of my music listening - how easy it was to purchase cds, torrenting and pirating, jazz, metal, and a love for performing.  i had always learned my favorite songs on the piano, but for the most part i kept them to myself.  i performed at a school talent show freshman year (can't remember what i played), piano and vocals, and that broke down all the stage fright barriers.  i was really diving head-first into music in all aspects -playing it, studying it (took a music theory class in 9th grade as well), and listening to all sorts of different kinds of it.  my piano teacher and my mother were both getting pretty fed up with my lack of interest in classical music.  i was learning and playing through the pieces my teacher assigned to me but i never really cared about or identified with any of them.  finally, in an act of desperation, she gave me a homework assignment one week to listen to [rachmaninoff's 3rd piano concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5mxu_7btra).  the horowitz recording i linked to is *the* recording that i discovered in my mom's cds, listened to every day for years and fell in love with.  that really changed my opinion of classical music, and i started exploring it more.  i continued getting more and more involved with music, and when the summer before senior year came, i took one of the biggest, most daring, and potentially stupid jumps in my entire life - i approached my parents with the idea of going to music school.  i had no idea how they'd receive it, but i didn't really care either, because i realized that it's what i wanted to do.  when i was younger, teachers, parents of classmates, etc, always saw my talent and urged my parents to put me into conservatory pre-college programs, saying i should one day go to music school for college.  i was never a fan of the idea.  i don't know why.  maybe i felt that hobbies and academics should be kept separate.  maybe i just hadn't developed the burning, engulfing passion yet.  but after years of rejection, i was finally ready.  preparing for auditions was a lot of work, but i did it, and got into an amazing school.  i still feel that straying from serious music for so long put me at a disadvantage compared to those who had studied and practiced with the same intensity i had for a year, for their entire lives.  but in another sense, i'm grateful that i hadn't been raised that way - *most* of the people who practiced for 8 hours a day through their entire childhoods were forced.  to me, there's still a sense of wonder and excitement about the fact that i get to devote my life to music.  i'd hate to lose that just for the sake of having a leg up on my classmates.  **college/present**: my main job when i'm home is at a gas station (laugh if you want, it's really not that bad, it's a small family operation in a small town and the people around here are great), but i still make decent money on the side playing gigs, teaching, composing, etc.  as for what i listen to these days - obviously a lot of classical, but also a lot of everything else.  i just bought the new daft punk cd on tuesday, i got the new she &amp; him a couple weeks ago.  recently i've been enjoying sufjan stevens, arvo part, and keith jarrett.  i never really considered my music taste to be particularly broad, but in comparison with my peers, (and per their feedback), it seems that objectively, it *is* really broad.  i have an ever-growing collection of nearly 600 cds, and nearly 6-7x that in digital downloads on my hard drive.  i could bore you for hours talking about my favorite artists and composers and what makes me enjoy them so, and the things i love about just living and breathing music in general, but i think the floor has been mine for long enough.",1,,1
666049,"&gt; more and more, i'm understanding why in the past, say pre-1970's, why single motherhood was socially frowned upon. not so much because of a ""moral--sex out of wedlock"" issue, but that people knew raising a child without the mentoring styles of both parents is critical to the healthy development of the child.   i think you need to look waaay further back than that to really get a good concept.   by the 1970's, and even the several decades (and possibly a century or more) prior to that -- people were already ""forgetting""\* the reasons why a ""woman/mother led"" household, and yes especially with *""bastard""* children... was inherently problematic for a society.  note that i did *not* use the ambiguous/euphemistic ""single parent"" family; and i also didn't say ""single mom"".  because the problem was recognized not as simply (or even mainly) a result of missing ""*both* parent roles"" (as even your note above seems to imply) -- historically it was recognized as the lack of a father, a ""patriarch"" so to speak.  --  consider widows with orphan children were pitied because of that -- because of the fact that through war or disease or accident the father was no longer there -- and everyone *knew* that meant a really tough life for the remnants of the family; and it wasn't just a lack of income, but rather a lack of a leader/guardian/guide as well as a lack of a ""provider""... that woman and her children were seen, much as they are in the animal world, as vulnerable ""prey"".  **by contrast,** a man who was a ""widower"" with children, even when the mother died in childbirth and left him with a newborn infant -- sure people offered him their *sympathy*... but no one ""pitied"" them. (why? well, it was understood that the duties/role of a ""mother"" could be done by a wet nurse and/or any series of ""nanny"" types, and/or housekeeper, cook, maid, etc -- without necessarily all *that* much of a negative impact; certainly not the kind of problems that happen when there is no father {or when the father is such a weakling that the woman ""rules"" &amp; runs the family}).  --  as to the understanding of why... well i'd strongly suggest that you read a piece like this one: http://no-maam.blogspot.fr/2012/06/woman-most-responsible-teenager-in.html -- to gain a better understanding of what i would call the problems of female-led households/families...  keep in mind that what i would call the ""historical"" view\*\* of family (which yes really ought to be able to referred to as the ""traditional"" view of family; but alas that term ""traditional"" has been redefined) -- is not the same as what people nowadays call the ""traditional"" family. the ozzie &amp; harriet 1950's era us ""nuclear"" family (the double entendre &amp; occasional mistaken conflating of ""nuclear family"" with post-atom-bomb ""nuclear era""), or the various other kindly-but-somewhat-inept ""dads"" of the b&amp;w television era -- which structure was already a massively modernized, psycho-babbly ""feminist/socialist"" aberration, and a far, far cry from the truly ""traditional"" (historical) patriarchy.  the root of the problem, the beginning of the destruction of the family was two distinct things:   * first was the so called ""tender years doctrine"" -- that romanticized &amp; vastly exaggerated the importance of the child-mother bond -- and which was then used to essentially invert the traditional/historical ""ownership/custody"" of children... and it massively undermined the ""patriarchal"" structure (destroyed the very foundational ""pilings"" on which civilized society has been built).  * second was the advent of public then compulsory ""schooling"" -- which further supplanted and replaced the role of the ""father"" in pretty much every other regard (in a sense ""relieving"" men of the main *responsibility* for educating/raising/guiding their children -- and of course essentially *destroying his authority* in that regard as well -- rendering him as little more than an emasculated ""advice giver""... eventually devolving to what, as i already noted, is a role of being a lame ""dad joke"" guy).  --  \*i say ""forgetting"" but of course that really isn't true -- it was more that people were quite purposefully and quite smugly, arrogantly choosing to disregard ancient human wisdom/understanding of family structure, family dynamics, child raising, rearing, instruction &amp; mentoring, etc -- and substituting modern, so called ""scientific"" methods.  ---  &gt;now it's almost encouraged like a new career for single women. can't get a job, no problem. here's a way to get free housing (subsidized housing), free medical care (subsidized medical), free food (food stamp card) and other related goodies! nevermind the poor kid is going to be raised in subsidized housing, which is inevitably located in neighborhoods that are ground-zero for gangs, drugs and all-around crime.  indeed.  have you ever read [""the garbage generation""?](http://www.fisheaters.com/garbagegeneration.html)  and of course the whole thing -- while it happened stage by stage, bit by bit -- is arguably no accident at all (whether it is truly a result of a ""grand plan/grand conspiracy"" i doubt -- but there is no question that there certainly were elements and groups that quite openly stated their aim to ""destroy hierarchy"", and who also stated that as part of that they aimed to undermine, hobble, and eventually eliminate/destroy the man/father role -- i think the reality is that each stage ""aligned"" with a sort of collusion of interests {social, economic, financial, political} to push things on to the next level and take advantage of people via that).  and remember what i noted above -- that the underlying reason why people ""pitied"" widows &amp; orphans was that they were essentially ""vulnerable prey"" all to readily ""consumed"" by wild things...  well isn't that what we're seeing today with the kids from these ""woman/mother led"" households/families ???  the kids (and women themselves) are vulnerable ""prey"", ostensibly turned into ""consumers"" instead of ""consumed"", but in reality still having their substance ""eaten out"" by opportunistic ""wild things"", and eventually turned, tricked, manipulated into becoming lifelong indentured servants/dependents; with the ""state"" as the ultimate ""daddy"" ... and thus kept in a sort of perpetual adolescence, prevented/precluded from really becoming anything like the kind of independent adult humans that might otherwise have the potential to become.",1,-1,0
824342,"**part 3: masculinity, dominance, submission and self-determination**  this naturally clashes strongly with an understanding of masculinity as dominance. both feminist gender theory and traditionalist gender norms often conceive of masculinity in terms of dominance and femininity in terms of submission. this contains some truth but it is an oversimplification which ignores a feature of traditional masculinity that has been long-ignored; traditional masculinity, owing to its hierarchical nature, contains *a significant component of submission*.  as explained in my articles *separating the 'boys' from the 'men'*  (http://www.reddit.com/r/masculism/comments/11w04k/separating_the_boys_from_the_men_male_heirarchy/), the platonic essentialist nature of the socially-mandated male role results in a multi-tiered hierarchy of ""real manhood."" those who are not ""real men"" are practically treated as a third gender. those who are ""real men"" compete with each other in order to attain superiority, and eventually an ""alpha"" status defined by possessing the ability to revoke an inferior's ""real manhood"" and socially emasculate said inferior. for the purposes of this article, let us call those ""real men"" who lack ""alpha"" status ""betas"" and let us call those males who lack ""real man"" status ""omegas.""  traditional masculinity, whilst often mischaracterized as being centered on dominance, *mandates* that a beta submit to his alpha so as to avoid being rendered an omega. sure, the beta isn't as good a man as the alpha (by social standards), but he is *still* a ""real man."" the penalty for unsuccessful rebellion is a loss of status, which may reach the level of social emasculation.  as i have argued above, traditional concepts of gender are heavily grounded in notions of maturity - hence how ""grow up"" and ""man up"" are functionally synonymous. a beta who unsuccessfully rebels against the alpha is often called a ""brat"" or ""punk"" - two terms with immature connotations (bringing to mind discontented children/teenagers who dare question their allegedly-omniscient elders). to be a ""real man"" is to not act like a child male (a ""boy"" - a common emasculating slur), and to rebel is childish.  in short, real men *acknowledge rank and obey their superiors*. the military is an institution held as the height of masculine, and it is brutally hierarchical (and, in what would be a paradox to those that define masculinity purely in terms of dominance, it is the soldiers rather than the officers that are considered more macho even though the officers hold command).   as such, submission to authority is not inherently emasculating, but rather *masculinity-mandated* under certain conditions.   when asserting one's own self-sovereignty (which is inherently rebellious since it denies the legitimacy of others' dominion over oneself) is seen as transgressive of the gender norms, when surrendering one's will is seen as properly masculine, when obedience is elevated to virtue, it becomes impossible to see traditional masculinity as being about dominance alone. when knowing one's place and being a good soldier is a masculine duty, one can scarcely describe traditional masculinity as empowering men to live their own lives on their own terms.  and it is *this* self-sovereignty-sabotaging ideal of masculinity which is being aspired to.  **[continued below]**",1,-1,1

868353,"i only just found the thread and there are 200+ comments, so this will most likely never get read, but i'm posting anyways because it's not the kind of story i tell very often.  or ever.  the story involves my maternal grandma and her first hubby.  they had two little daughters together, and had just had their third baby.  the husband was forever stepping out on my granny, and she found out that his mistress had given birth pretty much at the same time she'd been delivering their 3rd baby.  she'd had enough, and told him to get the hell out.  even though the guy didn't love her, he was pissed off that she'd kick him out, so he decided to take revenge by kidnapping the baby.  new paragraph because walls o' text suck.  he knew my grandma's work schedule, so he showed up while the house was empty -- well, empty except for the baby and the nanny.  he shoved past the screaming nanny, grabbed the baby, grabbed a bag of clothes, etc., and then swung by the kitchen to grab some bottles and powdered milk/formula -- not exactly sure what they fed babies in the 1950's.  he took everything to the car and drove off to his parent's house a few hours away.  at some point the baby was hungry -- she was a few months old at this point, so he fixed her a bottle and fed it to her while he drove.  here's the kicker: *it wasn't powdered milk*.  it was powdered soap.  by the time he got to his hometown, the baby was sick.  eventually he got her to the hospital, and eventually they discovered that she'd been poisoned.  they tried to save her, but couldn't.  it was horrifying and tragic and my grandmother never talked about it.  i found out from my mom, who made me swear never to mention it to my granny.  she later went on to marry again -- my grandfather -- with whom she had my mom.  and my half-aunt went on to grow up, marry, and have a daughter, whom she named ""marisol,"" after her dead baby sister.  one more bit: the guy didn't go to jail or anything, since i guess it was ruled accidental.  his two older daughters -- my half-aunts -- grew up seeing him and loving their dad.  they had kids, including my cousin marisol, but never told them what their grandfather did to his youngest child.  i always assumed their mom had told them, like my mom told me.  so cut to a few years ago, my cousin is visiting -- not marisol, but her younger sister -- and i make a reference to the ""family secret.""  i quickly realized she didn't know what i was talking about and tried to backtrack, but it was too late.  i ended up just telling her everything, from the affairs to the kidnapping to the killing to the origin of her older sister's name (she knew none of it!).  she listened to it all quietly, and wide-eyed, then after i was done she stood up, went into the bathroom, threw up, and started sobbing.  she is *really* close with her grandpa.  i've never gotten along with her, in large part because she's an evangelical christian who has spent years telling me that i'm going to burn in hell, but i still felt/feel bad about ruining her image of her ""poppy.""      tl;dr: granny's first hubby accidentally killed their baby daughter while attempting to kidnap her.  years later i tell my cousin what her pop-pop did, she pukes.",1,0,-2

926477,"(don't think this was other_one's intention, but...)  shouldn't this be on the jailbait subbreddit? whenever i read stuff like this on reddit, i give the person who submitted the link and the people who championed his submission in its comments page the benefit of the doubt that they are merely pointing out some logical inconsistency or making a joke, and not throwing some pathetic why-does-society-prevent-me-from-getting-it-on-with tweens pity-party. sometimes, i'm not so sure this is the case.  seriously,  a little perspective people. yes, we in the west celebrate a play about a (probably) late-teenage boy getting it on with a pre-teen girl. no, this does not make those who celebrate the play yet believe in age of consent laws vile hypocrites. i believe that this is an easily debunked line or reasoning, but first, a little background about the necessity of age of consent laws.  evidence shows that through much our prehistory, people would boink almost as soon as their bodies told them too. however, if current hunter-gatherer societies are any indication (and most anthropologists believe that they are), these early-age sex acts were still heavily regulated by the elders of the group. rights of passage rituals would celebrate the young people's passage into puberty and rebirth as sexual beings, and often, young people were coupled up and married in group ceremonies. in short, reproduction was still somewhat controlled. hardly a free-swinging commune of man-on-girl-child love. moreover, early-age sexual behavior was necessary for the survival of the species. when people live to be late 30s/early 40s,  and children ween until they're three or four, and infant and childhood mortality is super high, you gotta start breeding as soon as possible.  in our more recent pre-modern and modern era, when women were basically chattel (an overstatement, but not by much), it was common to marry off very young girls to older men. of course, many of these arrangements were not consensually. either way, the idea was this: women are either reproductive or un-reproductive. this was the principal function which they served, and this was often codified into law. a women could either breed for reproduction or breed for recreation (prostitution). in certain societies, if they were lucky, women could opt out as nuns, but this was not often the case. they almost always were forbidden from being productive (as opposed to reproductive) as land-ownging farmers, blacksmiths, etc. and this extremely repressive model worked well for the world for a long time (much like the institution of slavery). it guaranteed the continuity of property, genes, etc. (it's worth mentioning that romeo and juliet waited to poke until after they were married. this is a minor point, but one worth mentioning.)   in the post-sexual revolution world, women and men (in the west at least) are free to enjoy sex with almost whoever they please. so why not tweens? basically, this is because women are no longer merely reproductive. women now have the choice to postpone reproduction or abandon it all together. a twelve year-old having sex is at significant risk of becoming a pregnant. (yes, abortion is an option. no, not everyone will chose it, and thus it proves an unacceptable risk.) though she is physically mature, she has not yet achieved the intellectual or emotional maturity to function as a productive member of society, let alone as a mother. she was not yet at an age where she is legally allowed to make most of her serious life-decisions for herself, and now her life is forever changed.  now she is in serious danger of not completing her education. now she is at risk of becoming a dependent of the state. women in the post-sexual revolution world now expected to be economically self-suffiecient, and yet this girl finds herself in serious risk of not attaining the needed tools.  (a personal note: my mother was the head of her class, but became pregnant at the age of fifteen. she now makes good money as a nurse. she could have been a surgeon.)  are we limiting the liberties of the twelve year-old girl by forbidding her to have sex with others? yes. because she is legally a child. we limit the liberties of children all the time. a four year-old is not allowed to cross a street whenever it wants to. why? because he does not know enough to act rationally in his self interest. in a similar way, a twelve-year old girl does lacks the mental and emotional tools to make a reasoned decision about access to her reproductive organs. and because this is the case, early pubescent girls are protected by the state from the advances of fully mature, legally adult men. this is extremely reasonable.  (much in this comments thread concerns the total relativity of morality. let me suggest that morality is flexible base on the needs of a society, but that we are hardwired, in a sense, for certain types of moral thinking and social behavior. for more on this: http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10717915)  so why do we celebrate romeo and juliet? because it is a masterpiece of the western canon. does this mean we endorse pre-teen sex? no more than our celebration of king lear endorses a strong monarchy as the ideal system of governance. no more than our celebration of bront√´ or dickens is a celebration of the 19th century english class system. the reason we do not condemn these works based on our current moral framework is because we can understand the certain popular values change over time based on (often) progressive developments (like the women's liberation movement) and yet we can still recognize in these works something applicable, human and/or good.  i suppose it's perfectly natural for some men to be attracted to pubescent girls. i myself am attracted to women around my age (27), but no matter. however, i consider it repulsive for a grown man to even half-entertain the thought of using an emotionally and intellectually undeveloped girl for his personal sexual gratification. call me a prude.",1,-1,1
497191,"no, there isn't. there are however no contesting measurable data, and we use the best tools and methods we have. hence, it is considered true until successfully challenged. not by default, by some inherent authority, but because the method itself has been proven sound and holding up to scientific peer review. yes, i say proven. atom half-life is real and measurable. we might find a more accurate method though, and this would be a good thing. that is how science works. that is how human understanding works.  yes, we might be wrong, it might not be 300 million years old. it might be 310. or 298. but if you really believe humanity is so stupid we can be wrong in dating by 299 994 000 years, then i can't really understand why you don't challenge other scientific accomplishments - such as combustion engines, satellite communications or semiconductors. after all, these technologies could, and shoul, be divine creations, since our own science is so apparently inadequate.  and just so you know, there is also no scientific proof you're not a crab or a potato.",0,,

813093,"&gt;infinity minus infinity is zero, as any quantity subtracted by itself cancels itself out.  this is not true.  for example, the total number of all natural numbers minus the total number of *odd* natural numbers is not zero, even though both sets of numbers have infinite members.",0,,

875794,"&gt; yeah, it's only mainly leftists who want to shift responsibility from themselves onto others. that's why communism and all it's derivatives are so popular as an idea.   well, i would argue that it (alas) **isn't** only the ""leftists"" -- in part because the concept of ""entitlement"" (and the disavowal of any responsibility or necessity of effort) has become such a popular meme/line of thought that it is no longer at the left extreme (communist/socialist) nor of the right extreme (fascist), but that those extremes (which are but two sides of the same totalitarian coin) have so entrenched themselves that it is now the ""center"" or mainstream.  hell, even ""conservatives"" (so called, and ironic because whatever they were purportedly ""conserving"" has been long lost, conceded and compromised away) -- are bound up in the collusion; just via a different rationale.  &gt;it plays on the natural human want of reverting back to a child-like state where all necessities are provided &amp; all you do is have fun and do whatever you want.  i think it not only *plays on* -- but it does everything it can to create, foster, and even force people back into (or more correctly to *stay in*) that mode -- it is the long-term fulfillment of an ""infantilization"" scheme, one which took generations of stage-by-stage infiltration to achieve.  the modern ""prolonged adolescence"" (not only through the teen years, but now through the 20's and even up to -- if not beyond -- age 30) is *no accident*.  nor is it some *natural* ""evolutionary"" requirement of higher technology nor adaptation to wider societal affluence.  it is the opposite -- it is a conscious\* *policy* driven thing: everything from the carefully staged/managed, dragged out (and thus delayed/debilitated) curriculum in schools; to child-labor laws (you are rendered *incapable* of supporting yourself, but via the quite ingeniously aimed policy of *forbidding* people from hiring you), to the mandatory/compulsory schooling through age 16 (and in some cases/regions even a dropout is required to get a ""work permit"" from their local school before they can obtain legitimate employment, and then the hours are limited); to the funding/grants -- not to mention pervasive indoctrination and ""guidance"" -- that encourage (nay drive) young people to delay entering the workforce for many years beyond...  rendering them far less than ""full citizens""; and indeed doing virtually everything possible to maintain and to even ""fetter"" or ""hobble"" them into remaining *irresponsible* ""quasi-children"" far below what they are naturally/organically capable of being.  \*albeit based entirely on disingenuous/dishonest rationale(s).  ---  &gt;they pointed to a bunch of data saying a child who eats lunch does better in school.. **they missed the whole point.** the fundamental question was whos damn responsibility is it to take care of the child? the parents thats what.  i would argue that they didn't ""miss"" the whole point.  the shifting of responsibility away from parents was entirely intentional.  the ""socialist"" goal has *always* been to disable/dismember the family, and to achieve (take steps towards) the eventual ""state"" (aka ""village"") control of infants &amp; raising/indoctrination of children-- if they could manage it, they would remove infants from parental care the *instant* after they were weaned (if not before), and having thus removed them entirely from the ""dysfunctional"" family (especially any ""patriarchal"" one) and place them into a full-time government-controlled boarding-school system.  and every aspect has been to slowly -- step by step -- move towards that goal: kindergarten, 4-year old kindergarten, various ""day-care"" etc -- these are all just stepping-stones along that path.  &gt;they then pointed out that ""not all parents can afford lunches for their child"" and i'm willing to bet if you examined nearly every case you'd find one of gaylubeoil's expertly defined north american women.  &gt;[...]  &gt;if you can afford all these things as a mother yet not pack your child a lunch, you aint broke, you're just a piece of shit.  actually if you spend your money on various nonsense, then you are doing *exactly what the system wants* -- you are indeed being a ""piece of shit"" in terms of parenting...  but that simply reinforces (proves) the ""socialist"" theory that the natural family-structure (however decimated, debilitated and undermined) is hugely ""dysfunctional"" -- see you can't even feed them, even when we gift you the means to do so!  and thus that it *must give way to the state* (hilary clinton's gynocentric ""village"") as being ""more responsible"" and ""more caring"" (even though it should be patently obvious -- at least to anyone with eyes to see -- that said state's factory-style system is anything but responsible or caring, and that it's ""product"" is {at best} inferior, is {on average} virtually useless, and {at worst} becomes psychotic and ""sociopathic"" {society-destroying} level criminality).",1,,-1
204615,"i'm genuinely curious what your point is besides passing judgement on me, then coveringing your ears and saying ""nu-uh you don't know how hard we have it"".  so far you've asserted that  1. i'm in college and haven't finished it yet, or that i've finished it and have gotten a job from my parents  2. that i'm well-to-do because i'm older than you (i'm 25 btw and live *well* below the poverty line)  3. that i'm a moron because i don't (pointlessly) blame an entire generation (a dubious concept at best) for every failing i have.  4. that anybody disagreeing with you is either old money rich or an idiot  but what have you said? ""baby boomers are bad because i'm not doing as well as i think i should"". it's a weak argument. **you** decided to go to college and collect debt, **you** are the one who feels like he's entitled to money just for existing, **you** are the one blaming older people for your shitty attitude towards life. i'm not saying that there aren't decisions made in the past that cause difficulties for younger people, but i'm sorry, that's how the world works. maybe you were raised with the expectation that the world owes you something, and now that you're older and haven't gotten it, you've become bitter.  i find it painfully ironic that you're calling older people who disagree with you ""entitled"" when you're the one that's expecting handouts because you feel like they were promised to you. that's pretty much the exact definition of entitled. also ironic is your childish labeling of dissenters as ""butthurt"" when you're the one who has their fucking jimmies rustled enough to write a post blaming everyone but himself for not making money. yeah, you're not butthurt, you're just calling for anonymous old people to ""suck a dick"" because you don't have all the toys you want. **nope, no butthurt here**  but, no, i guess i'm the idiot because you're an immature twat who thinks:  &gt;i work 80 hour weeks at one of the most well known tech companies in the fucking world for $12 an hour  oh fuck, *i* would *love* to make $12 an hour! but of course, you work in the tech industry so you *deserve* more money because... reasons.  &gt;because you won't fucking retire.  because it's a simple as that. every baby boomer refuses to retire just to stick it to us. it's not like they were and are poor and can't afford it, no! apparently in your world, poor americans didn't exist until the 21st century. despite your narrow, uninformed, bitter, and pathetically shortsighted view of the economy, 90% of your paycheck isn't getting funneled into vacation funds for baby boomers.   &gt; i remember when children modified cell phones to carry their own provider and pre-teens came up with an at home aids test.  again, no innovations happened as a result of the baby boomer generation. none at all. modern computing, the internet, cell phones, numerous medical advancements, these were happenstance that those ungrateful old bastards were lucky to stumble upon!  &gt;and what the fuck did your people do when they placed their wrinkly gnarled hands on such miracle breakthroughs? you jacked up the price by the hundreds.  this just in: capitalism is an invention of the baby boomer! round of applause for another astounding display of economic knowledge!  &gt;maybe i'm tired of watching your people favor bail outs yet sticking us with student loan debt that i'll have to work like a dog to get out from under.  yes, because you were forced to go to college. i bet they didn't even tell you exactly how much it would cost and definitely didn't require you to approve those loans.  &gt;just die already and the economy will fix itself.  bravo, kid, ever think of writing for the harvard business review?  &gt;(all of your edits)  yes, everyone who disagrees with you is either an old fogey or a ""hipster"" (unclear what you mean by this) who has yet to finish college and face the grim coldness of the real world, the world you seem to have an exceedingly difficult time adjusting to. they have yet to learn that they're as disposable as you, something that was totally unexpected despite everyone with half a brain knowing that everyone and their mother is clamoring for a place in the tech industry.  &gt;you had your chance to see it coming, but you ignored it until bad things started happening...to you  right, because you apparently have impeccable foresight which is why you're in such a good situation now!   ...wait  &gt;much like environmental issues, many of your kind thought 'what do i care, i'll be gone'  again, it's not like **baby boomers invented the environmental movement or anything**   &gt; i've grown up with the internet, believe me, i have a pretty strong case of just not giving a fuck  riiiiiight, you don't give a fuck. that's why you're so angry you needed to post your temper tantrum about how much you hate old people and call everyone criticizing you an idiot. again, **no butthurt here**  tbh it sounds like you just have some personal issues you're taking out on everyone older than you, which is just pathetic.  tl;dr i would be shocked if you actually read all of this.",1,-2,1

471985,"i agree that if we are to have a min wage, it should be tied to inflation or else like you said it would fall in real value every year.  however, i guess then the real point for discussion is how much minimum wage should be able to cover.  i think it should be able to cover just enough for shelther and food if you are living smart. this means, no extras such as cable tv (admittingly some sort of internet should be part of the min), no data plan for your cell, basic clothes, 1 ply toilet paper, etc.  of course depending on the city, we would probabbly need to adjust the minimum wage for that as well since the cost of living for each city can vastly vary.  the problem of increasing min wage so much that people can afford luxuries creates an allocation problem.  lets use the extreme example of saying some how the left gets min wage such that someone can afford a small house, with a wife and 2 kids.  well shit, if that is the case, there is going to be a rush for anyone to get the easiest jobs possible because for many, that is all they want in life.  now the medium hard jobs that paid this much before the min wage increase will now see a shortage because all of the people who were working those jobs went to the easy jobs.  the issue here is that people tend to be rational in the sense, they look at effort and reward. every rational person would want to get the most reward for the least effort. this is also why communism will never work.",0,,
259788,"if it makes you feel any better, there is hope for those kids if they can just make the leap to recognizing how ridiculous the educational system is.   i was always the ""smart"" kid growing up, and also the weird one, and i dare say my catholic education was more repressive than most, although my teachers either loved or hated me because i learned early on how to walk the line between being different and being disruptive, so they could never punish me (especially since i never had less than an a+ average). this was even more pronounced in high school, where i went from being the weird smart kid to the gay atheist at the top of his class at an all-boys jesuit prep school. i can honestly say that i never once studied for a test, and like you i excelled in writing and i can comfortably say that i got a's on plenty of essays that were totally lame but written with exceptional style.   i'd say that i fall somewhere between yourself and your camp compatriots; i definitely could handle complex material far beyond my years, but i also knew exactly how to takes tests and get by without ever actually trying. all the learning i did was done outside the classroom, and i basically looked at school as a job where i had to put in my eight hours a day in order to a) keep my parents off my back and allowing me complete financial and social freedom and b) do plays and c) look at lots of pretty boys all day. if i had actually *given* a flying fuck about school, i probably would have wanted to die. but not giving a fuck is a powerful thing, and basically the only option i can see for survival of the truly gifted in an environment as oppressive as our education system.  (best example of not giving a fuck would be when during theology class i asked my married, viciously catholic theology teacher if he had ever given a guy a blow job, and casually mentioned that i had.)",1,2,-1
912324,"**jimbob/michelle:** i know a lot of people think they are hankering to be on camera to make money, but i think they have built a real estate business that can fully support them without tlc around.  if anything, they want to be on camera to rehab their reputation so they can go on the conference circuit.  it's painfully clear that they had all those babies because michelle loves being pregnant and having a newborn, and jimbob loves...making babies.  now that there aren't any infants, it seems to me that they'd rather go collect speaking fees at conferences than actually parent their children.  **josh/anna:** after his public humiliation, josh is probably being a right old jerk to anna, even though she has been a perfect angel in the media.  she seems to be super deferential to him, so i bet she's just kind of taking his sour personality to try to protect her children.  she'll keep pumping out his babies and doing what she originally promised to do for that dude, and he'll keep being a smarmy weirdo.  josh clearly loves working in politics, and as soon as he can, he'll probably try to worm his way back into a lobbyist job, even if only in little rock.  **jana:** while many people say they don't think she lives in the main duggar house, i think she does.  she's a pretty integral part of raising all those younger kids now that the older girls are gone.  she has that big garden on their property, and she'd have to be spending a lot of time back at the house to care for that, too.  i think i saw a blueprint of the duggar house somewhere that included a guest bedroom, and i wouldn't be surprised to learn that jana has been given her own room because it's ridiculous that a 27-year-old woman has to share a room with girls between 7 and 11 years old.  i think we'll see her married before 30 because, in duggar years, it's getting a bit ridiculous for her to be unmarried.  i think she will go for a tlc wedding, but choose to shy away from cameras in her married life.  **john david:** probably doesn't live at home, seems to be building up a set of very profitable businesses, and seems to be an all-around actually good guy.  i think he'll eventually find an equally humble and industrious wife, and while they may have a tlc wedding, they won't feature very heavily on the show by choice.  **dillards:** i think something terrible happened with jill's most recent birth, and while it may not be as extreme as an emergency hysterectomy, i think it broke something inside of her.  she's grown up being promised that good things in life are blessings for being very devout, and it's got to be crushing to her to have her ultimate desire (a million babies all born at home) unfulfilled.  i don't think motherhood is quite what she expected, and i don't think she's especially happy- not that she could or would ever express such a thing.  derick is going to try to expand his devoutman brand by being annoying on twitter until tlc totally shuts them out of the show and they have to unwillingly slink into obscurity.  derick won't allow jill what she needs to get her mind right and she'll sink into depression as she goes unfulfilled.  expect more instagram pictures of bible verses and volunteer work at a church.  **seewalds:** ben is growing into a decent dude- not the brightest bulb, but clearly working hard and he loves his family.  he'll probably land some youth pastor job somewhere, perhaps specifically looking to be near the vuolos, perhaps with jeremy's help.  jessa will pump the tlc appearances for every dollar they are worth because she's not stupid.  i think that she'll have one more baby before jinger explains how birth control works, and then the babies will stop for a while, they will eventually adopt.  they caught some early flack because she's stuck up and he seems dim, but i think that they are growing up together and will be fine.  **vuolos:** jeremy is clearly doing some kind of rescue mission with jinger, and teaching her how to be a proper adult.  she is still the stay-at-home-wife (and future mother), but she's going to be opened up to reading and thinking because jeremy clearly doesn't desire a wife like anna or jill.  after more than a year of marriage, they will start making some babies, but they will likely be spaced out and there won't be a billion of them.  they probably will go to real school, and while they will make occasional tv appearances, they aren't going to be a regular feature the way the seewalds probably will.  **joe/kendra:** they are gonna pump out babies and take the place of the vuolos on counting on as regulars.  eventually, her ""bubbly"" personality is going to annoy everyone and make us long for more of jessa's side-eyes.  neither of these people is that compelling, so it will be more of the duggar brand ""watching paint dry"" boring.  **josiah:** he'll eventually court again, if not marjorie, someone very similar.  he's just too interesting and outgoing as a person to want to be with someone with a personality like wallpaper paste.  he can make 100 kids, and everyone will continue to speculate that he is secretly gay, and his choice of somewhat modern wife will do nothing to stop the rumors.  **forsyths:** upon marriage, austin seems to be the most mature husband aside from jeremy.  he clearly loves joy and wants to be a father.  he will provide for her and actually make her happy, because he will work to instill a little more confidence and independence in joy.  they will have a large family, but only as large as he can reasonably support because he's not an idiot.  i think that as he gets more screen time, he'll become a more popular son-in-law, but they will want to step out of the spotlight so that they can more responsibly raise their children.  **jedidiah, jeremiah, jason, james, justin, jackson:** honestly, i can't even tell these ones apart.  i expect more alert stuff, going into trades/jobs/small business ownership that doesn't require higher education.  maybe one will break out, but i feel like jimbob and michelle think that things went wrong for josh because he went to the big city with the fancy people, and they will actively try to prevent their younger sons from leaving the immediate area.  i would speculate on how well that turns out if i could even differentiate these kids from one another, but i can't.  i don't see the tv franchise existing long enough to support any of these guys by the time they are ready to marry, but who knows.  **johannah, jennifer, jordyn, josie:** these girls are going to have a radically different childhood than their older sisters.  they don't have a ton of younger siblings to care for, and while they will inevitably get farmed out to babysit cousins, that's different from the sister-momming the oldest 5 did.  jimbob and michelle are going to be 65/66 by the time that josie is 20, and all but checked out from parenthood, really.  the girls will probably have more freedoms, as is common among youngest siblings, and perhaps even more opportunities.  if any of the girls end up in a real college, it's going to be one of these girls.  **tyler:** he counts, now.  he'll get to 18 and either leave, try to fall back on his mother for support, or he'll go the way of the other duggar boys.  it's too early to tell, but he has potential outside fallbacks that the other boys don't.",1,1,-1

152120,"the air smelled of daisies as the sun shone down. the chattering of the crowd grew ever louder as the sweltering day dragged on. thousands of busy passerby rushed back and forth, boarding buses, admiring fashionable store window displays, and resting under shady trees. i felt a drop of sweat drip down my neck as i scanned the throng. a blinking green life bar hovered over each head, bobbing quickly to the beat of their brisk steps. an elderly gentleman with a fedora and a gilded cane hobbled to my left with a near-depleted gauge gracing his brow, while a toddler being guided by her mother's hand had a nearly full one. most of the people in the crowd had half-full life bars (or half-empty, for pessimists). i noticed the discreet sign for the bus stop and ceased my people-watching. i adjusted my suit and sat on the bench next to a small child.   i did a double take. the person next to me was most certainly not a small child; in fact, she was a woman who had to be in her 80's, at least. her status as elderly wasn't challenged by her appearance. her face was etched with deep wrinkles and topped by wild gray hair. she wore a simple green dress, almost as wrinkled as she was, and clutched tightly in her hands was an old-fashioned handbag. the only thing that made her stand out was her life bar: it was completely full, a phenomenon i'd previously noticed only in babies. before i could process the impossibility before me, the woman turned with accusing eyes. i hastily closed my mouth and stared away, but it was too late. with astonishing speed, she rose to her feet and disappeared into the crowd.   bus forgotten, i gave chase. i dashed after her, frantically searching for the inexplicable life bar. in such a big crowd, the meters tended to blur together. i bumped into what must have been a dozen people, but i didn't stop to apologize. i couldn't afford to lose her. finally, i spotted an infant's life bar, snaking through the street above a wild gray tangle. i watched as the woman ducked into a small building, advertised by a colorful wooden sign. i quickly approached it, and groaned. the building was a daycare. this woman knew what she was doing.   i entered the place, and the murmurs of the shoppers outside was replaced with the shrill cries of children. multicolored toys were scattered across the floor, and hassled caretakers were being pulled in every direction. full life bars were streaking across the room, frustrating my efforts to find my enigmatic target. but out of the corner of my eye, i saw a small back door swinging shut.   i pushed my way through the mass of screaming tots and sprinted into the back alley. last night's rain had not yet evaporated; the walls were slick with grimy water, and the old woman was standing up to her ankle in a puddle. she was grinning at me.   ""very impressive,"" she crooned in a soft voice. ""not many people can see me for what i am, much less follow me without my allowing it. well done.""   ""cut the crap,"" i growled. the woman only grinned wider. ""why don't you explain to me how your life bar is so full?""   she giggled and took a step forward. ""oh, that's simple. i didn't want to die. i needed more life. and so..."" she rested her mottled hand on my shoulder and leaned in. ""...i took it.""   suddenly, my knees started shaking. black spots began to rapidly fill my eyes. i tried to push her hand off, but i found myself without any strength at all. my legs gave, and i collapsed to the damp concrete ground. i looked up helplessly at a gorgeous young woman, life bar full to the brim. she took out a makeup mirror, and her eyes lit up with joy.   ""i must thank you,"" the witch said. ""you were particularly delicious. i haven't felt this good in centuries!"" she calmly walked back into the daycare. with a shaking hand, i just managed to look at my phone. in the dim reflection was an unfamiliar old man, with deep brown liver spots disfiguring his face. above him was a nearly depleted life bar.",0,,

589836,"when i was in middle school, the big thing to do on the weekends if you were a ""cool kid"" was to attend the catholic youth organization (cyo) dances at one of my town's four parishes. that parish was saint jude's. i went to public school like many other attendees from both in and out of town did, but anyone who paid the five dollar entry fee was allowed into the dance. the parish made a killing off of those dances and off of all of the hormonally-charged pre-teen shenanigans that went down within those holy, hallowed walls of saint jude's deteriorating gym. the gym was so bad that even after they ripped out the soggy and cracked wooden floors, the tiled court that they put in was so shitty that you could pull up some of the tiles with your finger. whenever i played basketball in that god-forsaken gym i had to pray to god that i wouldn't slip on a tile shifting below my feet or step on a piece of gum or a speck of some junior high-schooler's bodily fluid from the dance the night before. the place was skeevy as all hell but it was all we had in those days so no one cried too much about it. whether there was rain, sleet, snow, or toxic sludge pounding down on us from the heavens, we would - without question - show up for those dances every friday night during the school year. every single bit of youthful degeneracy and infantile indiscretion could be found at saint jude's on friday nights. friday nights at saint jude's - affectionately dubbed ""the whorehouse on the hill"" by the kids - could make a coke-fueled night at studio 54 back in the 70s look like tuesday night bingo at the retirement community just down the road from the parish. there was simply nothing that the chaperones - all moms from the parish - could do to stop the spaghetti strapped girls from performing some sort of bizarre, hip-hop-infused mating ritual with the boys who all were convinced that if they just wore more quicksilver and billabong t-shirts from pacsun to go with their rope and pukka shell necklaces, they would eventually fend off all of the competition from the other dance-goers and land themselves the coveted job of ""apparel model"" at our local mall's pacsun store. i may or may not be joking about that. if you managed to grind it out with casey or kelly to the booming sounds of usher or lil jon on any given friday night, you would be the man for the rest of the upcoming week. if you managed to then get with casey, kelly, or both fine young ladies at the dance in one of the bathrooms or away from the prying eyes of one of the more puritanical parish parents chaperoning then you would henceforth shed your title as ""the man"" and ascend to the throne of flyness as ""the lord of the dance,"" conqueror of all caseys, kellys, and courtneys. years after those wild middle school nights at saint jude's were gone, some knob jockey decided to complain to the school about the dances and how there was so much awful and degenerate behavior going on. somehow they got our local paper and then our city's magazine to write about the infamous dances and once the word got out around our county and some calls were made to the holy head honchos who ran the school and the parish, the dances were shuttered forever. word got around to us dance alumni who had long moved onto college and beyond about the dances being shut down and we all reminisced with each other about just how crazy, fun, and critical they had been to us and for our development as teenagers and kids growing up. not long after the dances were shuttered, dwindling enrollment and financial troubles within the archdiocese and the church meant that saint jude's had to close their catholic school and all hope that those dances might be revived for a new generation of kids from our town and all over the county was gone for good. the last middle school dance that i attended was my eighth grade recognition dance at the end of the year. it was a dance that you had to sort of get dressed up for and the boys wore collared shirts with khaki shorts and the girls wore dresses. this dance was a lot different from the dances at saint jude's because this was more of a formal dance and there wasn't much of any grinding or ""dirty dancing"" going on that i can remember; it was mostly guys and girls dancing in the slow dance way that you do at prom in high school. this meant, of course, that at least two-thirds of the kids stood around awkwardly and didn't interact with the opposite sex while the remaining third-or-so had either the looks or the bravery to approach one another and have a better time than everyone who watched from the sidelines. everyone spent most of the time just huddling around in their own little cliques and circles and trying to entertain themselves or trying to find a way to get the attention of some guy or girl that they wanted to dance with before the night was through. it was all very juvenile and funny looking back on it now and it feels bittersweet in a way since none of us can ever get back to that place again in our school's cafeteria-come-dance hall and since - for me personally - that year may have been the best and most memorable year of my childhood. at the end of the dance i had to use the bathroom and when i was done i got this feeling and just had this urge to walk through the school one last time before leaving it behind. i walked around past classrooms i had sat in and through the gym and locker room and art and music rooms as well but i couldn't get to the wing of the school where i had my favorite class with my favorite teacher; these metal gates were put up to keep kids out of certain parts of the school each day after everyone went home and the gates were set up on this day to keep people from walking through there during the dance. when i went back to the cafeteria the dance was over and nearly every person had left and had filtered out of the place. there was a song playing and it was the first time that i had heard it and it instantly got to me and made me stand in the empty cafeteria and listen to it the whole way through while some chaperones and parents were cleaning up. the song was wish you were here.",1,-1,1

533151,"mobile, please excuse my typos.  i was  raised by my single mother, never met my father. my grandparents were half american half austrian, grandfather a diplomat died before i was born. i don't know what my grandmother did, but my mother was born in indonesia as an american citizen. she lived there in her childhood, visited family in austria often, was good friends with a prince. i don't know his name or anything, i only know her stories.. i could ask my aunt but i'm not in the mood.   my mother went on to study in the us, ba, ma and started working on her phd. she worked as a translator, translating ~20 different languages. not verbal translation rather books or other stuff, so mostly text. she was good friends with the dalai lama, met him at a talk at an indian reservate (don't know where). she was born in the 1950s and was at woodstock. she married a french professor living in the us that was born in lebanon, they had a house a car etc.   i know a funny story from her marriage, the reception (dinner afterwards) was at the home of a good friend of the family, amar bose. (bose corp. ceo.) he provided the food and the seating, but there were not enough tables. so he and his family just took their chairs and ate off their lap. in his own home. my aunt told me that she was really embarrassed, but the host and his family didn't mind as much as everybody else did.(pictures exist, it would take some time to get them through)   they split up, but my mother kept his last name. the name of her man, not bose :-) now i was born, i have no idea who my father is, but i have my mothers ex's last name, so if anybody asks i just say it's probably him.   i was born in a car infront of the hospital, at least that is what i recall my mother saying, could have misinterpreted and only her water broke in the car. whatever. my mother already had started to become mentally ill, and heard voices that told her what to do. because of her connection to buddhism, i got a buttload of tibetan names on my birthcertificate (that i don't have, and can't get because i am not in the us and can't recall all the names nor say who  she said was my father) i was carried around by her, she decided to couchsurf at friends or total strangers. she had her visa card and quite a lot of money from her past, and decided, or the voices told her, to travel around. so i was homeschooled, and learned quite a lot, especially how to navigate because her voices told her to go somewhere, but not where we ""wanted"" to go. i'll skip ahead a bit, we were in 35 countries, i learned to speak 2 languages, german and english. i learned how to read while i was very young, so i wouldn't be bored. (i read the bible, dostojefski, tolstoi, shakespeare and numerous manuals before i was 8) she proved to be insane quite often, telling me i was switched at birth by the cia for a robot, or screaming at me because ""i wasn't her son"". she yelled at strangers because they were present, not because of something they had done.   when i was 10 we were in austria again, visiting my aunt and grandmother, when child protection services was called. they tried to contact me, not because of my batshit insane mother, but because i hadn't visited school as austrian law forces you to. well, they came and we were in england, then scotland, then ireland, back to wales to see the queen as she took a tour through gb. we missed her, traveled back to scotland, stayed there for almost a month but had to travel back to austria because the debit card had been withheld by an atm. now back in austria, my aunt had recommend a school for me to attend. i went there, and was quite happy. a bit bored, but happy. the school was nice people were friendly, and the teachers didn't mind foreigners.the last 2 schools i was in weren't that friendly to foreigners. cps got hold of us, and i went to a ""kriesenzentrum' a center where children with problems in the family stay until a solution has been found. i was there the full amount of time one can stay. then i ""sent"" to a wohngemeinshaft, a home with ""caretakers"" and 7 other children. i stayed there for almost 6 years, finished elementary school or whatever it's called, and attended a higher technical school for electronics. i wanted to do something with computers but the software department was already full, so i just did electronics. 5 years later, a few weeks ago i had my ""diplom und reifepr√ºfung"". managed to finish the school and in the next week im inscribing to the austrian university of economics.   i left the wohngemeinshaft ~3 years ago, and got into a ""program"" that helps kids from wgs live their own. so i have my own apartment, get weekly money for food, most of the stuff i need is payed for by the austrian government. i couldn't live on my own because i am not an austrian citizen and am not allowed to work... and i want to study.   well, there was a lot left untold, i lived on the street, i once was kidnapped by my mother and searched for by interpol, i had a lot of stupid bureaucratic problems, and because i don't have a social security number, i couldn't even work in the us. oh and i don't have a health insurance in a country that has a mandatory insurance policy, the government just pays for all my accidents and health related stuff in cash. i was never mugged while travelling, even through we slept in the ghettos of paris.   i remember random people i met as a kid, kids from boston that i played with, a girl that always gave me free hot chocolates in an internet cafe in edinburgh (until the cafe was replaced by some coffee chain). some guys in their 20s that played chess with me in scotland, a ship burning on the isle of man, a woman who let us in her home in paris, as we were walking by. her son with whom i played some starwars ps1 game with. or was it ps2?  a police officer who kicked in our door in syracuse because my mother called 911 for a non emergency and decided to hang up. and other random memories. i remember stuff from when i was 6 or 7 years old. and hello to you random reader, i think this thread is dead. if you read this far, you can ask me whatever you want i'll try to answer as good as i can. this is a brief summary of my life, and who i am. if you know who i am, or found it out, i know this account isn't anonymous. i don't care for it, and i would use a better account to hide my identity.   btw, if you still are here, do you know an old multiplayer tank game that was popular ~2000, there were 4 teams, red blue yellow and purple. you played looking at the top of your tank, there were barricades, that you could pull around, and powerups lying around giving you supermines homing shots and other stuff. homing shots were green. you had room refill your gasoline, and you were able to drive over water if you found a platform. there were clans piling up barricades that would make half the map the base of one colour. it was turnbased, but really fast turns and simultaneous.  i forgot the name of the game and i haven't found it in the past 5 years..",0,,
400290,"the op mentioned pictures other than self taken shots by former girlfriends as well as some kind of phone image of a *really* young girl so my take away is that he's downloading images that are not necessarily willingly provided by the subjects of the photos, are of girls he has never dated or even has known and may even be quite illegally young. he's technically breaking the law in either case, though, by possessing child porn. but from what op said this doesn't look like it's a case of only having old ex girlfriends' photos available.     also, in terms of teenage women and pregnancy- how about this statistic i found: ""adolescents age 15 through 19 are twice as likely to die during pregnancy or child birth as those over age 20; girls under age 15 are five times more likely to die.[2,6,7]"" ""many biological, economic, and cultural factors‚Äîsuch as poverty, malnutrition, **immature reproductive tract**, child marriage, and gender inequities may compromise the health of a pregnant adolescent[6]"" http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/component/content/article/436-adolescent-maternal-mortality-an-overlooked-crisis  or how about: ""‚Äúchildbirth is the number one killer of teenagers,‚Äù the metro today warned, while the daily telegraph reported that ‚Äúone million teenage girls 'suffer death or injury from pregnancy'‚Äù."" ""worldwide, complications in pregnancy are the ‚Äúnumber one killer‚Äù of girls and young women aged 15-19, the report says, adding that 50,000 teenage girls and young women die during pregnancy and childbirth every year, in many cases because their bodies are not ready to bear children. babies born to young mothers are also at greater risk: each year about 1 million babies born to adolescent girls die before their first birthday. in developing countries, if a mother is under 18, her baby‚Äôs chance of dying during the first year of life is 60% higher than a baby born to a mother older than 19. many adolescent girls know little about family planning, let alone where to get it. girls‚Äô low status within families and communities means they lack the power to make their own decisions about whether or when to have a baby."" http://www.nhs.uk/news/2012/06june/pages/teenage-pregnancy-death-rate-concern.aspx  yes, these statistics involve third world countries with poor healthcare, but isn't that an **even more** valid measurement of what an immature reproductive system is actually capable of handling under natural conditions? the modern medical interventions in first world countries obscure the fact that, left to the natural conditions which have predominated throughout human history and are still prevalent today in impoverished countries, teenage motherhood is incredibly more dangerous than adult motherhood. if you couple this with a society in which women have no reproductive choice then you're likely to have a rash of dead teenage mothers and/or sickly infants if there aren't age restrictions. and just because there are modern medical interventions that lessen maternal mortality for teenage girls doesn't mean that having a pregnancy at that age is somehow as healthy as having one as a mature woman.     also, i would never advocate *burning* anyone as a punishment. if someone is so obsessed with a sex act that will certainly harm others against their will and/or prior to reasonable ages of consent then they can have chemical castration to take away their sex drive.   i don't want to just accept that they're going to be out there encouraging the production of child porn and potentially acting out their fantasies at some point when the images they're illegally downloading aren't enough to satisfy. i'm going to hope that they meet justice and are prevented from upping the demand for sex tourism, child porn and other such criminal offenses.    also, in some us states the age of consent *is* 16. and we also allow people to go die in wars for years before we let them get legally drunk. so, age of consent laws are certainly not uniform and aren't without their own levels of confusion, that's true. but i really can't see what good can come of a 16 year old having sex with a, let's say, 32 year old. of course people in their teens will have sex with other teens and should have birth control and std protection available, but a full grown adult who seeks out children whose minds are not fully developed and who often are still dependents of their parents is not usually seeking them out as equal partners to have a regular and mature sex relationship with. generally there's a predatory nature to it, the children are ill informed in terms of the dangers that are facing them and the older partner gets off on or relies on that level of ignorance / manipulate-ability. i think age of consent laws serve a very important function in providing protections to prevent that kind of victimization. life is certainly going to have gray areas but when the bulk of certain situations are going to cause harm to immature, unprepared people then providing them some protections from that isn't a wrong thing to do. and punishing those adults who overstep the boundaries that we agree to as a society through legal channels is just a part of our duty to preserve stability and safety for as many children as we can.",1,1,-1

896039,"i agree that one almost always has a moral duty not to sell weapons (or cars, or booze) to a person that they feel will not use the item properly.   i also agree that gun rights do tend to fall into a cost/benefit analysis.  however, i don't think that ""intended"" purpose of the device should weigh in at all. i don't give two shits if guns were inteded to give orgasms and cure cancer, and i don't care if alcohol was designed to kill babies. i care about weighing their value, and the value in solutions to the problems they cause.   personally, i believe, constitutional issues aside, that any law abiding citizen of decent mental health (i wouldnt disqualify somebody because they had add in junior high) ought to be able to own and carry a firearm, subject to reasonable restrictions put in place only to insure that people not able to legaly have them do not, and that the person can safely operate the weapon.   i also believe that any law abiding citizen should be able to purchase and consume any mind altering substance they want, provided that they do not harm, or risk the safety of others.   same principle for cars. law abiding citizens, able to correctly operate it, etc.  i don't think that the intended purpose, or the best wishes of eliminating side effects should factor though. we must examine reality as it is.",1,1,
160709,"no, that's basically just propaganda they teach in schools. the truth is basically that:  a) the schools were equally funded. b) there isn't really any correlation between money spent and academic achievement anyway. c) they found that the difference in achievement was due to peer group and family, not differences in schools.  basically they found that if you put one black kid in a class with 30 white kids, the black kid will perform on the same level as the white kids. so they went and made classes of 15 black kids and 15 white kids, so after desegregation both black kids and white kids did worse than before.  the coleman report got finished, and it was one of the biggest studies ever conducted on anything. they didn't understand statistics as well then, so they literally interviewed 600,000 people even though it would have been valid with a far smaller sample, which they didn't know. however when they saw the results they basically realized that segregated schools didn't make any difference. so what they did is they decided to release the report in washington on the hottest day of the summer without telling any of the press, so no one showed up and covered the story. then they went ahead with forced busing which is what they wanted to do before.  anyway, i'm not claiming the concept of desegregation is bad, just that the way it was done has completely fucked up our schools, and they remain fucked up because of it to this day.",0,,
460919,"i heaved my grandson onto my knee. his purple shirt had a familiar crest right in the center but boy was he getting heavier. i bobbed him up and down as best i could but the aches start right away. ""grandpa...tell me about why you're here again."" i let out a sigh, this was the only story anyone asked me for. i'd accomplished so much and they were all hung up on this one tiny detail, just because i changed the world- without even trying to.  ""well jaime, it was a long time ago. i mean a long time ago, before your mother was born even! can you imagine then? we didn't have those fancy implants to tell us the time like you do, or those communicators, we had these things called 'cell phones'.""  ""did you call the dinosaurs grandpa?"" i laughed and shook my head.  ""well now we both know i didn't. you just googled that last time.""  ""i know grandpa, i just wanted to hear your laugh.""  ""how'd i get so lucky with you and your mother huh? anyway, i'd been designing a program for all the cellphones. you see, your grandpa wanted to help people with his mind but he'd been through some hard times at work and had to go off on his own. your grandmother was sick too, so in order to save both her and the world, i started working as 'racketeer'. i never heard anyone- but i did help...guide them to the right light.""  ""grandpa...did you steal?""  ""yes. and you shouldn't do that- but i, for whatever reason, decided it was the only logical option. so i started to program and work, just as i had for many companies before except this time it was my own projects. my own designs and my own profit."" i had to stop bouncing jaime at this point, it was too much on my knees.  ""eventually i started to hit it big, and i got greedy. i managed to make people think they were giving to a charity for a disease, i even had it add on to every credit card swipe i could so everytime someone bought something, i had a piece of it. some people didn't like this, which in hindsight is understandable. these were the heroes, like the one on your shirt!"" i tickled the both, my fingers weren't filled with pain at least. ""they started to track me down, they turned me in a few times, some of them were as smart as grandpa which i was glad to find out. it felt so rare to have someone on my level, you'll understand that some day i think, anyway they turned me in to a few authorities. when that didn't work they started to turn me into the companies i was stealing from and eventually one of them, the danger, told your grandmother what i'd been up to. right after she gave birth to your mother."" the finger started to ache in the joints.  ""is that why we don't see grandma?"" i paused.  ""yes. she didn't approve of me anymore. she's...passed on now though, she had alot of health problems after that. she loved you very much, and she'd only love you more if she was able to see you now jaime. but back to the story! these heroes had taken what i'd loved most from me, and at a great cost but they still couldn't get anything to stick to my record. so i decided to play a mean trick on them. i wanted everything they did to stick, you'll understand when you're older but when a man and a woman love each other very much sometimes they have children and sometimes they wait to have children. all the heroes were waiting, but this program i made for their cellphones changed all of that, without them knowing. they all started to have babies. i'd had my best heist ever a few months later when all the lady heroes were out giving birth or dealing with their newborn infants and the male heroes, or the single ones like 'the boog' were trying to overcome what had happened. suddenly they all had the same responsibilities that i did!""  ""bump grandpa, do the bumps!"" i sucked in another breath and started to bounce jaime on my leg, i was much slower than before. ""yay! tell me more grandpa- when will you come home?""  ""i won't jaime, that's what i get for what i've done. let's get back to my last heist though, i'd gotten enough to finally take care of your mother and retire permanently. we could go wherever we wanted and we'd be ready to sit back and relax. but 'the danger', the father of the man who wears that very symbol on your shirt, discovered all that i'd done. he'd traced all the hacks and credit card deals back to me. he'd had alot of time while his girlfriend, 'madam pizazz', was bedridden from the side effects of a bad pregnancy. he'd used his time wisely. and he took me to be arrested, but not before he broke both of my knees in multiple places, its why they called him 'the danger' i suppose. so they locked me up, forced me to work for the government but in exchange i get to have this cozy cell where you and your mother can come see me three times a week!""  ""grandpa...i'm glad you did that. i love seeing you!""  ""well thank you buddy. i'm kinda glad it all happened too. you see how safe the world is now? with all these heroes running about. not to mention all those fun implants to wear- grandpa helped make those to make sure everyone is safe and healthy. and your mother gets complete freedom, which means more to me than anything else.""  ""mommy loves you too grandpa.""  ""i know buddy, you tell her i said that too alright. and then tell her about our song okay, can you sing our song?"" he had stopped bouncing jaime on his knees a few seconds ago, he needed to conserve his strength to stand once his grandson's half hour was up. it was fast approaching as it always did.  ""tyj, xky, i'm going to grow to be a big strong guy!"" jaime sang it a few times over.   ""now i need to add another verse for you okay? 'kansas city, where it touches the sky.'"" he looked into jaime's green eyes, everything about the boy was smiling, it was beautiful.  ""tyj, xky, i'm going to grow to be a big strong guy! kansas city, where it touches the sky."" i patted him on the back, that should be the clue she needs.  ""did i tell you about that hero on your shirt? 'the danger's son? he is the greatest hero of them all! he saved the whole planet, all by himself! your grandfather found an anomaly in a company's hardware that was going to cause an explosion in every single car ever. and that boy- 'royal streak' nearly sacrificed himself to save us all. he ran and ran and ran, carrying grandpa's program all around the world. his daddy comes to visit me every week, just to thank me for helping his boy. one day, you'll be helping him too.""  a guard knocked twice and proceeded to let himself into the room. ""time's up. the chauffeur is here for jaime. you have another guest waiting as well. mr.popular today huh?""  ""i suppose i'm just lucky to be needed."" the racketeer stood and shuffled along side his grandson until he was just inside the door. ""now jaime, you sing your song to your mother, and then give her one of these for me when she's back from prague-"" the racketeer planted a big sopping wet kiss on jaime's cheek.  ""ew! grandpa!""  ""i love ya buddy. have a good week okay. sing your song!"" he waved goodbye to his grandson.  ""i'll send 'the danger' in."" the guard replied as he stayed two steps behind jaime and proceeded to shut the door.  ""please."" the racketeer sat back on his bed. he rubbed his knees slowly, massaging around the ball joint. he hated limping around while tom was here. two knocks again. tom came through the door, he was smiling, the guard was laughing- tom was always one to do that after his son had been born. it was a complete 180 from his time as 'the danger'.  ""how's little jaime?"" tom asked, he took a seat next to the racketeer, tom was getting old as well after all. he had just as much tear on his body.  ""growing according to plan. you know if he truly has my brains and your brawn...""  ""he truly will be the greatest hero we've ever seen."" 'the danger' said.  ""it'll work. how is royal streak anyway?""  ""sean's alive but...he still can't quite reach the speed he used to. i hate that it hurts him so, he just keeps trying.""  ""it was the cost to save millions. he'll come to terms with it.""  ""you know...what you did that one day, with the cellphones-""  ""rerouted all the frequencies to mimic a rhythm that brought on ovulation in women and opened certain hormona-"" 'the danger' raised his hand to halt the racketeer's train of thought.  ""you know i don't understand all of that. my point was, you really weren't helping yourself with that. you'd just have to contest with more and more heroes, sure profit for a few months but once we were all back in shape...""  ""i never was a villain tom, just a desperate man on hard times."" the racketeer rubbed his knee, only out of habit- there was rarely pain when tom was around, despite tom being the one who inflicted it.  ""you were a bit of a villain. anyway, look at us now. sitting in a cell together.""  ""but you get to leave at least.""  ""it was the price you had to pay. you know that. and its a minor price considering you created a world safer and smarter than ever before, and we're about to make the superhero to top all superheroes- i think its worth it."" 'the danger' said, leaning back against the wall on the opposite side of the bed.  ""you did a good thing all those years ago.""  ""i know- you've apologized before and told me the same thing before. royal streak was the greatest thing that happened to you.""  ""don't tell madam pizazz, and i certainly love my son more than anything else. and they were the greatest thing that ever happened to me- but the greatest thing i've ever done...was certainly working with you. befriending you i should say."" tom started to smile.  ""oh, you think you befriended me? no, no no old timer- i befriended you!"" the racketeer put up his dukes and stood without a second thought. 'the danger' slowly rose, like a colossus finally waking up, he lifted his fists to the occasion. the racketeer tossed a punch into the air. 'the danger' did the same. they circled one another a few times, shadow boxing. sparing, just as they'd always done.",1,,1

657442,"from conscious eating by gabriel cousens""  there are so many problems associated with eating flesh and animal by-products such as milk and eggs that it would literally take another book in itself to describe these hazards. a few outstanding pieces of information must be mentioned, however. for example, dr. saenz, a pediatrician, reported in the february 1982 issue of journal of the puerto rico medical association that an epidemic of premature sexual development was connected to the eating of hormone-rich animal products. the segments of the population primarily afflicted were female children age one and up. infants and young children began to develop mature breasts and uteruses, vaginal bleeding, and other signs of puberty. one fourteen-year-old boy was reported to have mature female breasts that needed to be surgically removed. dr. saenz's findings showed that the appearance of abnormal breast tissue in infants was related to local, whole milk consumption. in the older children, it was related to consumption of whole milk, beef, and chicken flesh from animals given estrogen to increase their weight. the doctor consistently found that when these foods were removed from the diet, the symptoms usually disappeared within a short time. according to diet for a new america, one english medical journal reported that hormone traces in chemically fattened livestock were causing british school girls to mature sexually at least three years earlier than the previous national average. there is reason to believe that to some extent this high estrogen intake from beef and dairy products happens in the us as well. modern science has found a variety of diseases and parasites that can be transferred from animals to man, such as trichinosis, toxoplasma gondii, fungi, and even viral infections and salmonella, which is the main cause of acute dysentery. there is also the problem of severe infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria growing in the meat as a result of the heavy use of antibiotics in livestock. dr. rudolph ballentine points out in his book transition to vegetarianism that over 40% of adults have been exposed to toxoplasmosis, a fungus in humans, dogs, cats, and other mammals. toxoplasmosis has been known to cause blindness and mental retardation in newborns. most toxoplasmosis infections come from meat, and some may also come from cats. in the cancer journal for clinicians, an article by kin shim, m.d., reported that 100% of monkeys fed milk from leukemic cows developed leukemia within a year. in denmark it was found that child leukemia was connected to the consumption of cow's milk taken from danish cows that had leukemia. twenty percent of the cows in denmark have leukemia. the hypothesis is that a leukemia-inducing virus is transferred from cows, through their milk, to the children. the monkey leukemia infection suggests the same route of infection as the children of denmark. all this animal- and food-related disease brings up the question of how long must people experiment with themselves as human ‚Äúguinea pigs‚Äù before waking up to the dangers of eating flesh foods and dairy products? many people switch to poultry when they stop red meat. unfortunately, poultry, which has a similar profile of dangers as red meat, has some outstanding problems of its own: high incidences of salmonella and campy-lobacter infections. according to advances in meat research, by pearson and dutson, over 80% of chickens and 90% of turkeys are infected with campy-lobacter. these bacteria cause an intestinal infection similar to salmonella. these organisms have become antibiotic-resistant because of the high use of antibiotics in poultry. this means that when they cause an infection, antibiotics will not work effectively to kill the pathogenic bacteria. according to the project censored ratings, a news report in the june 8, 1990 pacific sun, the ‚Äúfowl‚Äù play in the chicken industry was voted one of the ten most underreported stories of 1989. in their article it is pointed out that the incidence of bacterial salmonella infection is now two and one-half million cases per year, including an estimated one-half million hospitalizations and nine thousand deaths. apparently the epidemic is caused by a huge leap in consumer demand for ‚Äúhealthier food‚Äù called chicken, as they switch from red meat, and by a massive failure of the us department of agriculture to inspect the chicken. a decrease in usda staff led to an increase in contaminated chicken slipping through en masse. the article states: the usda has placed gag orders on inspectors and destroyed documents disclosing that the agency has approved massive amounts of contaminated food.   in the pacific sun article, dr. carl telleen, a retired usda veterinarian, revealed how ‚Ä¶ chicken carcasses contaminated with feces, once routinely condemned or trimmed, are now simply rinsed with chlorinated water to remove stains.   according to telleen, thousands of dirty chickens are bathed together in a chill tank, creating a mixture known as ‚Äúfecal soup‚Äù that spreads contamination from bird to bird.   this creates what telleen calls ‚Äúinstant sewage.‚Äù articles like this make it easier for many readers to make the transition away from poultry a little faster. in addition to these two potent bacteria, there may be a type of viruslike organism found in chicken tumors that seems to be transmittable to humans. this organism is thought to be identical to the microbe found by dr. peyton rous in chicken tumors, which he showed to be transmittable. for this pioneering work he received a nobel prize in 1966. the extent to which the rous virus might be associated with human cancer is still debatable. as discussed earlier, the work by virginia livingston wheeler, m.d., strongly suggests that most chickens are at least microscopically infected with cancer and that this chicken cancer, like the rous virus, may be transmittable to humans. to eat animals and fish in today's world is to take on the psychology of victim consciousness. once informed of the dangers, it is hard to separate the eating of flesh food from a passive form of death wish. what if it were possible to consistently get organically grown beef and poultry? would it be worthwhile to eat beef and chicken for our nutritional well-being? nutritionally, meat is relatively high in iron, b12, and protein. however, it is not a balanced food and is almost totally lacking in vitamins a, c, and e. flesh foods are also low in minerals such as calcium, and high in phosphorus. a high phosphorus pulls the calcium out of bones in an effort to achieve balance. the optimum phosphorus-to-calcium ratio is 20/1. the us army medical research and nutrition laboratory in denver, colorado, has found that the more meat one eats, the more b6-deficient one becomes. a high-protein diet seems to cause severe deficiencies in b6, calcium, magnesium, and niacin. high flesh-food intake also increases ammonia in the body, which has been found by dr. willard j. visek of cornell university to be implicated as a carcinogenic agent. high ammonia in the system is also toxic to the nervous system. a most significant problem associated with flesh-eating is the fat one consumes with a high-meat diet. by eliminating the high fat intake associated with the flesh diet, it is estimated that 90% of the deaths from colon cancer in the us would dramatically be eliminated. the risk of colon cancer for meat-eaters is 4.3 times greater than for vegetarians. heart disease, according to the 1961 journal of the american medical association, would be drastically reduced by 97% if people were vegetarian. cancer and heart disease are the two leading causes of death in this country. in beef, pork, and lamb, the percentage of calories that come from fat is 75% to 85%. chicken is right up there with 60% of the calories coming from fat. turkey has 55% of the calories in the form of fat. it is significant that these fatty foods are consumed in heated, cooked form. cooked fats, especially of animal origin, are positively harmful to health. the average american diet contains around 40-45% of calories in the form of cooked fats. this high percentage of cooked fat in the diet is associated with the increased incidence of heart disease, cancer, and other chronic degenerative conditions. although nuts and seeds have oil contents as high as the fat contents in some flesh food, because these plant-based foods do not contain cholesterol or store ingested estrogen and other chemicals in their oil as do animals, these foods are much safer and healthier. nuts and seeds can be eaten raw, preferably soaked. when they are eaten in this form, the naturally occurring, fat-digestive enzyme‚Äîlipase‚Äîhelps to digest the oils in the nuts and seeds. there seems to be a dramatically different effect for raw and cooked fat in the diet. it actually holds true for raw meat as well. raw meat, like live fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and grains, possesses viable fat-digestive enzymes which are not destroyed unless heated. i am not suggesting that we start a raw, flesh-food fad, however. the real issue associated with fats and their linkage to cardiovascular disease may not simply be the amount of fat in the diet, but whether the fat is raw or cooked. the well-respected, nutritionally oriented physician henry bieler, m.d., in his book food is your best medicine, makes exactly the same point in his discussion of cardiovascular disease. he writes: overeating of fats and oils, as long as they are in their natural state, cannot cause arterial disease‚Ä¶. it is only when unnatural fats, or fats which have been altered by being overheated, are consumed as food that the trouble arises.",0,,

586500,"&gt;so rude to write a really really really long reply for someone with add to read. jeez.  concentration is an ability which is possessed in different degrees by different individuals.  i would imagine that few people have the patience to read a long post like the one i wrote above, however i wrote it for those that *do* have such patience and concentration, not for those who do not.  sorry.  my gripe with add is that the ""condition"" is grounded in the notion that all persons ought to possess abilities of concentration in equal measure, when in fact this is not the case.  abilities are not conserved; one person may be a fantastic athlete or artist but lack the ability to read an organic chemistry text for hours on end, another person may be able to read for long periods and intensely concentrate, but lack any athletic or artistic acumen.  and of course, there is a broad range of abilities and inherent capabilities across the spectrum of possibilities.  add assumes a ""normal"" condition which i believe is contrary to the human condition--namely that children and young adults ought to be comfortable sitting in chairs for hours on end while focusing on material they cannot yet understand the relevance of.  the fact is that school is *not* natural, so it is not unnatural to want to be somewhere else and to be doing something else.  the truth is that most children and young adults daydream and cannot focus--that is what is is to be a child/adolescent.  presupposing this condition to be an illness and prescribing a potentially dangerous (and not-well-understood) psychotropic to ""cure"" it is a dangerous path, and one which i do not advocate or accept as responsible.    &gt;. . . my father, who at 58 is now on medication for it, swears it has changed his life. he is retired, but can now enjoy better relationships with people, and is just generally much, much happier. why shouldn't he be allowed that?  good for him.  i am not against adults taking medication that makes them feel good.  by all means, if crystal meth, marijuana, heroin, ritalin, etc. makes you feel good, indulge.  but don't try to tell me that lacking a marijuana high is an illness that requires treatment and special accomodations.    children cannot make such decisions about their health.  they are not informed and more or less at the mercy of their parents.  when persons like yourself hype up add and refer to it as a real illness, you give it legitimacy that it does not deserve and which i believe to be harmful.  future parents will accept that add is a real condition and medicate their children accordingly because today's add lobby, aided by a culture fixated on political correctness, refuses to denounce this mythical illness.  worse, i have no doubt that persons like yourself genuinely believe that they are ill.  yes, the hormonal rages of adolescence/young adulthood which are in large part responsible for obstreperous teens lack of concentration, can be ""cancelled"" or undercut by taking a stimulant such as ritalin.  however, such medication is merely a diluted form of a drug which has demonstrable adverse health effects and the effects of long term stimulant use (outside of illicit use) are not yet known.  thus, in the interest of protecting children that will be harmed in the future by the medication used to treat this non-disease, i denounce it openly.  &gt;herion is chemically almost exactly like morphine, but do you think that patients in pain should not be allowed to have it?  i would not endorse the use of prescription heroin for psychological pain or difficulty concentrating.  if you are bedridden with pain and it can only be treated with adderoll, by all means pop the pills.  but if you are using a dangerous drug like morphine to correct for daydreaming or wandering thoughts, you are doing something unsafe which i would not advise.  if you are doing this to a child for such a reason, i consider it negligent.  &gt;and maybe, if schools had a less rigid, more innovative, thoughtful way to teach and measure success, then we could lay off the meds for kids so much.  i was your prototypical hyperactive high school student, constantly in trouble and making lousy grades.  the idea that high school grades are the be all and end all of teen existence and the determining factor in one's future is incorrect and myopic.  the truth is that high school does not matter and that anyone with a pulse can dick around for four years and still graduate.  it is easy to get into college--especially if you take a year or two off after high school and work.  the pro-ritalin crowd would have everyone believe that if you don't make high marks in high school and don't start college the fall after graduation, you are somehow a failure and thus every possible means should be employed, including the introducing of dangerous psychotropics, to avoid such a fate.  this logic is absurd to me.  be yourself without ritalin and it's potential long-term effects; those with the drive to be successful will not fail.  &gt;do you know anything about brain chemistry?  i have a degree in microbiology and have a strong background in biochemistry, arguably more strong than anyone on this board.  &gt;i did not take the sat. i did not go to college. but i am still the kid that everyone copied off of and aced all of my tests. my iq is higher than most of the people i know. i'm that kid that you are refering to that 'it's not fair'.  i'm not sure what you mean.  i think it is unfair that rich teens who can get diagnosis for fake illnesses and get prescription stimulants which allow them an edge over other adolescents, combined with untimed standardized tests and other special allocations is unfair.  it is not unfair to be  highly intelligent without the use of stimulants.  &gt;and yet i don't think that since i was not able to take advantage of something that could have bettered my experience and, really, my entire future--- that no one else should be able to either. that, in my opinion, would truly be 'unfair'.  if you find it convenient to blame your perceived short comings on a lack of prescription stimulants, that is your own business and i will not begrudge you that.  however, it is my opinion that when the eventual dangers flowing from ritalin/adderoll/etc. are exposed, you will be happy that you did not use these drugs.  the real travesty is that they were ever pushed and approved for use in the first place.  the harmful neurological affects of methamphetamine are well documented, and yet the synthetic version is out there and widely accepted as legitimate.  pharmaceutical companies have made billions off of exploiting the angst of worried parents and pushing this fake illness.  today you see such ""illnesses"" as ""restless leg syndrome"" and ""difficulty sleeping"" which, before the advent of today's new wonder drugs, were the bane of millions of americans.  billions are being made by those who fabricate these illnesses and then push the drugs to treat them.  eventually you will see pills to treat such illnesses as ""left handed syndrome"" (which affects millions of americans who now no longer have to face the hardship of an awkward desk or inky palm thanks to new pharmaceuticals!), ""nervousness on first dates syndrome"" (which also affected millions of americans but can now be treated by this wonder relaxing drug!), ""difficulty balancing syndrome"" (millions could not ride the unicycle until the invention of a wonder drug!), etc., etc.  my point is that illnesses and expensive treatments will continue to be fabricated and pushed as long as we sit back out of deference to political correctness and allow them to be.  yes, many lives could be improved by curing left-handedness, but if the drug used to treat it is heroin with a slightly different r-group, do we start giving it to our children?  at what point does liberation from a fantasy illness or inconvenience (even if natural) trump common sense?  apparently add is such a point, and i categorically reject it's widespread acceptance.",1,-1,1

(although this is not the fault of your family situation arrangements)  it might have improved your financial situation as well if you went to school first and then your wife went out of her way to improve your career prospects.  you managed to raise a kid to 18, so congratulations on that score, but the real question is whether you've set your family up for long-term success.  it strikes me as less than optimal, but the best you were able to do under circumstances.  time well tell.",1,1,-1

496850,"i see and understand the opinion that the change in the life of a child is hard. it's especially difficult when a father remarries when he is close with his daughter. i don't know if it's a specific girl issue but jealousy and brattiness is something that i've come to see in girls way more than boys. not saying it doesn't exist, but i see it a lot in girls. attitude in girls too.   normally, if parents split, they shouldn't remarry and focus on the kid; however, i see that it can be shitty to think that you're only allowed one kid in life because of a failed relationship with that logic and it seems unfair, but the kids didn't ask to be born or have their parents not work through stuff so what the adults do directly effects them. typically, if one parent of the two should work on not ever remarrying until the child(ren) are adults, it's usually the mom since mom's are typically primary support. i know that all situations are different though, like yours.  her behavior seems a way to get her dad's attention. i hate when people justify, though, that kids like this are so damaged and wounded and poor them... at around age 5, kids are expected to comprehend and understand the difference between right and wrong. she knows what she is doing is wrong, but she does it anyway. she has a reckless regard for herself and her own life and does it just to hurt others and doesn't consider the consequence that one day in her future, she's going to be telling a gentleman of a man (maybe) that she lost her virginity in her early teens and had multiple partners, etc. not all people can live with that kind of history, and a nice, loving good future husband might not have much respect for her and pass for a more self respecting person despite their circumstances. her behavior establishes a reasonable degree of suspicion that when someone makes her angry, she will act out to pay them back. so, say, this potentially good husband is working too much to provide for his family and she feels neglected, she may chose to handle the situation immaturely and completely ruin her marriage and another child's life in the process thus not rising above her own personal situation that she felt was horrible... which, nothing you've honestly described is atrocious. it's manageable.  and in that instance later in life, she will probably still blame her adult decisions on her upbringing and never accept responsibility and, unfortunately, she will probably meet a bunch of people who agree and encourage this way of thinking because the world is going to shit and no one can accept they contribute to issues and make them worse with their choices.  having said that, i really do feel as though your being away for college and dh moving in with his parents, he probably accepted his mom's help because most dads aren't hands on. not saying they don't exist, but most have difficulty, especially with daughters, providing that female perspective. grandma was probably all about that life; however, grandma is also a grandma and as is a typical grandmother stereotype, most grandmothers overcompensate and overthink. most grandmothers are very much more in love with their grandchildren than their own kids because their precious baby has a baby... how amazing. it's beautiful! so it sounds like to me while gma helped to provide a stable environment, she also may have overcompensated a bit to allow sd to act out with an excuse. a lot of my friends tell me their children's grandparents have often crossed lines by undermining discipline that is in process by saying ""oh come on. it's not that big of a deal. come here and have ice cream with me, you don't have to go to your room."" it happens. it's a thing... and as a result, my friend's kids are becoming little nightmares because they have an adult backup.   so while i do agree sd had some strong feelings and acted out for attention, i think dh contributed by giving his mom mom duties because he may have needed the help, and i think mil contributed by being way too lenient for the precious girl, and she's been given too many passes to try and assuage her shitty behavior so she doesn't care. she probably gets what she wants by being a holy terror. consistency is always key.   i hope she grows up. she doesn't even know the hell she's going to cause for her own life later because she refuses to rise above her circumstances. there are horrible step families out there that kids need away from, but sometimes it's also an excuse to be jealous and angry of your mom or dad. it's a very gray situation.   i think maybe dh should sit with mom and explain his side and that she's ruining her. mil will most likely die before dh and then what will she fall back on? she will need her dad... and i think dad needs to stick with, you respect me or i have nothing to do with you. i've tried. sometimes you gotta let go and let them figure it out.   edit: understand the difference between right and wrong to comprehend the difference and understand it.",1,1,-2

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5331188/boy-scouts-train-for-badge-in-anti-terrorism.html  ---  full original  may 14, 2009 scouts train to fight terrorists, and more by jennifer steinhauer  imperial, calif. ‚Äî ten minutes into arrant mayhem in this town near the mexican border, and the gunman, a disgruntled iraq war veteran, has already taken out two people, one slumped in his desk, the other covered in blood on the floor.  the responding officers ‚Äî eight teenage boys and girls, the youngest 14 ‚Äî face tripwire, a thin cloud of poisonous gas and loud shots ‚Äî bam! bam! ‚Äî fired from behind a flimsy wall. they move quickly, pellet guns drawn and masks affixed.  ‚Äúunited states border patrol! put your hands up!‚Äù screams one in a voice cracking with adolescent determination as the suspect is subdued.  it is all quite a step up from the square knot.  the explorers program, a coeducational affiliate of the boy scouts of america that began 60 years ago, is training thousands of young people in skills used to confront terrorism, illegal immigration and escalating border violence ‚Äî an intense ratcheting up of one of the group‚Äôs longtime missions to prepare youths for more traditional jobs as police officers and firefighters.  ‚Äúthis is about being a true-blooded american guy and girl,‚Äù said a. j. lowenthal, a sheriff‚Äôs deputy here in imperial county, whose life clock, he says, is set around the explorers events he helps run. ‚Äúit fits right in with the honor and bravery of the boy scouts.‚Äù  the training, which leaders say is not intended to be applied outside the simulated explorer setting, can involve chasing down illegal border crossers as well as more dangerous situations that include facing down terrorists and taking out ‚Äúactive shooters,‚Äù like those who bring gunfire and death to college campuses. in a simulation here of a raid on a marijuana field, several explorers were instructed on how to quiet an obstreperous lookout.  ‚Äúput him on his face and put a knee in his back,‚Äù a border patrol agent explained. ‚Äúi guarantee that he‚Äôll shut up.‚Äù  one participant, felix arce, 16, said he liked ‚Äúthe discipline of the program,‚Äù which was something he said his life was lacking. ‚Äúi want to be a lawyer, and this teaches you about how crimes are committed,‚Äù he said.  cathy noriega, also 16, said she was attracted by the guns. the group uses compressed-air guns ‚Äî known as airsoft guns, which fire tiny plastic pellets ‚Äî in the training exercises, and sometimes they shoot real guns on a closed range.  ‚Äúi like shooting them,‚Äù cathy said. ‚Äúi like the sound they make. it gets me excited.‚Äù  if there are critics of the content or purpose of the law enforcement training, they have not made themselves known to the explorers‚Äô national organization in irving, tex., or to the volunteers here on the ground, national officials and local leaders said. that said, the explorers have faced problems over the years. there have been numerous cases over the last three decades in which police officers supervising explorers have been charged, in civil and criminal cases, with sexually abusing them.  several years ago, two university of nebraska criminal justice professors published a study that found at least a dozen cases of sexual abuse involving police officers over the last decade. adult explorer leaders are now required to take an online training program on sexual misconduct.  many law enforcement officials, particularly those who work for the rapidly growing border patrol, part of the homeland security department, have helped shape the program‚Äôs focus and see it as preparing the explorers as potential employees. the explorer posts are attached to various agencies, including the federal bureau of investigation and local police and fire departments, that sponsor them much the way churches sponsor boy scout troops.  ‚Äúour end goal is to create more agents,‚Äù said april mckee, a senior border patrol agent and mentor at the session here.  membership in the explorers has been overseen since 1998 by an affiliate of the boy scouts called learning for life, which offers 12 career-related programs, including those focused on aviation, medicine and the sciences.  but the more than 2,000 law enforcement posts across the country are the explorers‚Äô most popular, accounting for 35,000 of the group‚Äôs 145,000 members, said john anthony, national director of learning for life. since the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, and the wars in iraq and afghanistan, many posts have taken on an emphasis of fighting terrorism and other less conventional threats.  ‚Äúbefore it was more about the basics,‚Äù said johnny longoria, a border patrol agent here. ‚Äúbut now our emphasis is on terrorism, illegal entry, drugs and human smuggling.‚Äù  the law enforcement posts are restricted to those ages 14 to 21 who have a c average, but there seems to be some wiggle room. ‚Äúi will take them at 13 and a half,‚Äù deputy lowenthal said. ‚Äúi would rather take a kid than possibly lose a kid.‚Äù  the law enforcement programs are highly decentralized, and each post is run in a way that reflects the culture of its sponsoring agency and region. most have weekly meetings in which the children work on their law-enforcement techniques in preparing for competitions. weekends are often spent on service projects.  just as there are soccer moms, there are explorers dads, who attend the competitions, man the hamburger grill and donate their land for the simulated marijuana field raids. in their training, the would-be law-enforcement officers do not mess around, as revealed at a recent competition on the state fairgrounds here, where a ferris wheel sat next to the police cars set up for a felony investigation.  their hearts pounding, explorers moved down alleys where there were hidden paper targets of people pointing guns, and made split-second decisions about when to shoot. in rescuing hostages from a bus taken over by terrorists, a baby-faced young girl screamed, ‚Äúseparate your feet!‚Äù as she moved to handcuff her suspect.  in a competition in arizona that he did not oversee, deputy lowenthal said, one role-player wore traditional arab dress. ‚Äúif we‚Äôre looking at 9/11 and what a middle eastern terrorist would be like,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthen maybe your role-player would look like that. i don‚Äôt know, would you call that politically incorrect?‚Äù  authenticity seems to be the goal. imperial county, in southern california, is the poorest in the state, and the local economy revolves largely around the criminal justice system. in addition to the sheriff and local police departments, there are two state prisons and a large border patrol and immigration enforcement presence.  ‚Äúmy uncle was a sheriff‚Äôs deputy,‚Äù said alexandra sanchez, 17, who joined the explorers when she was 13. alexandra‚Äôs police uniform was baggy on her lithe frame, her airsoft gun slung carefully to the side. she wants to be a coroner.  ‚Äúi like the idea of having law enforcement work with medicine,‚Äù she said. ‚Äúthis is a great program for me.‚Äù  and then she was off to another bus hijacking.  this article has been revised to reflect the following correction:  correction: may 18, 2009  an article on thursday about explorer scouts who train to confront terrorism and illegal immigration, and a picture caption with the continuation of the article, misspelled the surname of a scout who said she was attracted to the program

735747,"i've thought of writing a book about some of their antics, but in the end it feels like some really weird high drama fanfic. hmm, i'm jumping back into arthur and thinking of doing a fanfic. muffy crosswire could be the ring leader, just telling everyone that everybody is out sleeping with someone. she pretends to be the high-end girl her parents raised her to be, but really she's either a) a homewrecking ho or b) living alone with her 50 cats in some walk-up over a laundromat. i should really try to do this and fit some of the true stories in. it's not like anyone would know (except the people i tell, which would be like everybody).  and you can't act like it's a problem if it's the same thing each time but it only happens like twice a year. if we had 20+ reports a semester, it'd be different. literally the only time they had a noticeable number was when that guy did whatever he did (it was honestly the first i'd heard of it). the chief already had enough issues so i felt for him. we'd had an on-campus shooting between people that weren't even students there (your basic apartment living drama tbh), plus there were other incidents going on nearby that he felt accountable for. plus parking. the parking, like at every place of business down here, was abysmal. story omitted for length but needless to say if the school had a problem, i think they'd do their best to fix it. this girl was just one of those sjw's in the wild i guess. the human trafficking was the only thing i really scratched my head over. i felt bad for her because she obviously thinks way too much about that stuff. how does she sleep at night? i hope to god she doesn't have kids. the stress would kill her.  i think the one is trying to be funny. let's google the address since i'm on my laptop and can do two things at once...dear god there's a house there, and the person gave 2 phone numbers. wow.... i am a little paranoid, but i feel like what info i give them isn't enough. besides, if they really wanted my info, they'd get it. it's not like hacking is that hard. to that other person, their posts really speak to how back health care is for the mentally ill in this country...  i'm going to watch them. i hope he uses guns as a hobby but stays out of them. i'm worried about his mental health now that he's getting worse with the parkinson's, so it'd be one less thing to worry about later.  my mom was born and raised here. she taught me to not use daddy's language, to attempt to be polite...but to speak my motherfucking mind when i need to. i don't know if i've mentioned this but around this time last year her mother was dying (2016 can kiss my ass for realzies). that woman fought tooth and nail in the end, and yeah, i got that fighting spirit from her. i'll be polite. i'll help you even though i think you should quit looking down my shirt. but if you're wrong, oh boy, are you in for a treat.  i've discovered i don't mind thunder as much as i thought (though those big ones can get on. stop shaking my house). over the years i've been with my boyfriend (wow almost 4 1/2 now), i've sat outside for a few, usually on their porch in the doorway. i was born with this strange love for tornadoes, but i always had this respectful fear for storms. now i love them, and i love being outside (but covered) for them. i'll admit i prefer to stay in for the big ones. 1 close call is enough. dolly is definitely an angel. she's put so many people to work up there, likely of all ages. my dad's mom settled there with her second husband when i was 6 or 7 so i went to dollywood several times in my youth. she brought cultures together with her world tour of shows (my grandparents preferred the shows to the rides. i rode the train and carousel, maybe the swings too, but that's about it), and she shared mountain history with everyone. it's a great place, and i'm glad the fire spared it. i've been trying to get up enough gall to really go on the rides, but i was going to wait until i had a more stable income and money to burn. it'll still be a few more years so i hope things hold up.  my friend's husband needs to step up. her clean thing could use work, but she wants the dishes done so they have something to eat off of (plus it stinks up the house when the wrong thing gets at the bottom of the pile). she's even tried the ""sexy note"" trick with offers for kinky stuffs, but did he do the work? nope. that was the night she called me to basically kidnap her on the grounds of ""helping my girlfriend out."" i even drove us, which i never do, but she was close to just getting in her car and leaving so i decided to let her rest. dude needs to get his shit together because if i were her, i'd leave my phone and a note on the pillow, both kids at home, on a sunday telling him i'd be back whenever. yeah she should let some things go, but he needs to grow up and pull his weight. he's gotten better on some things, but he wastes money, doesn't do chores, and tends to yell a lot in front of the kids. no, we'd have broken up by now.  i figured florida would be a better bet because of the weather. i hate the cold, so if i find something far enough south, i could stand it. i starting to lean more towards parks because april is spring break season and i don't do bs. disney is a place i've never gone. i hate crowds but it could be worth it. i'm also thinking about universal. i'm your standard harry potter nerd so i'd love to see the new hogwarts stuff, get myself a butterbeer and all that jazz. i need to look around to see what else i like.  my favorite way to use twitter is open app, go to trending list, scroll through then click the important ones, then exit the app and get back to life. i don't use facebook at all so i don't get news from there, but i know from the friend with the kids that it's a toxic place. lies are everywhere so i know to be cautious, but at least i'm not related to the people doing the trashing, not that many of my family members have found the account i have. i feel the same about sjw's, though i only seem to find the horrid ones. i wouldn't mind if they were actually helping things change, but so many of them are just making people mute the narrative rather than change it.  from the way they told it, he threw his own daughter at the cops, screamed and shot at them, got tased, still screamed and shot at them, then he got shot too. both are okay i think? i didn't care to look for the follow-up just in case. i know the girl lived. i guess that's another fun story that'll be passed around at our 10-year soon, if i go (pfft, i'm not. screw those people, 4 years was enough. not her in particular, just the whole place). as for the other guy, as a parent you should listen to your child and help them fight their battles. but he's a 20-something yr old man (i'm guessing 27-29 depending on how much older than me he is), and he said my college was sending helicopters to watch over his house. she should've called for help, not gone along with it.  i don't think i'll let my friend's children meet her, but i've noticed it's a guarding thing. my boyfriend came over to me to tell me something, possibly even pet the dog, and she went after him. i thought it was a ""zzz, snore, zzz, wtf?!"" bite at first, but no, he tried again and she went for him. that's when she tends to chase the cats too, guarding us from them. we're thinking her previous owner spoiled tf out of her, so we've got things to correct. kitty hellos are the best:) my little ladybug chirpmeows at me, which is how i knew she was there. she also likes mutual potty time. we used to have the litter box in my bathroom so we'd tinkle together. i'm not really one of those girls so yeah, kinda weird. now she just plays, paws at the door, licks water off the tub floor, etc. such a fun cat. i can't wait until she reclaims the house and does her thang some more.  her being a teen mom is why her parents want her to really consider having a 3rd kid, but her husband's family want more. the messed up part is they don't really like my friend that much, but their daughter, who had a kid with an unknown guy and they're stuck with him because they're idiots, is the better child. the other sisters are worse, but yeah, my friend is the monster. she is wising up though. she wants baby 3, but not necessarily with him. progress:) her trunk looks like good will meets babies r us meets amazon, and her backseat is a fun obstacle course. it works because the toddler is potty training and the daughter has dance, so the stuff is a requirement. if you need it, carry it with you. might as well, though i can see how it's a lot to get used to. her drawings and art is great. i talked her into keeping this ceramic horse she painted at her house recently, namely so others could see it. the stuffed penguin is funny though. so our other friend was there that day. she's liked penguins longer than i have, loves girly things, totally high-end. her random gift? rocks. enter me, tomboyish chick who still brings bugs into the house to this day (the look on my mom's face:d), and i get the cute thing. we should've switched. i love rocks and i would totally use her as an excuse to expand my collection. oh, i get that from my grandma too. guess who inherited her rock collection?? it's in a tackle box and is carefully labeled. i love it and my cousin says there's more. i hope there's more (the look on my mom's face:d).  birds are too loud and smelly. the big chicken lunged at my ass today so i yelled at him:) good times. and yes, they would all team up, probably with cats leading the way while apes do the intellectual work and birds do the pecking. i could totally see this happening... meh, better than the alternatives.

968964,"the article's quite poor.  it doesn't give any information about how pi would actually be computed to so many decimal places.  it could easily have talked about how to compute pi using the arctan series, arctan(x) = x - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 + x^9/9, ... and identities such as pi/4 = 4 arctan(1/5) - arctan(1/239).  with this formula, and an extended-precision arithmetic package, one can easily compute pi to thousands of decimal places.     see, for example, http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath373.htm  another method for computing pi is the ""arithmetic-geometric mean"" iteration -- see the book by the borweins, ""pi and the agm"".    yet another method computes the n'th binary digit of pi using very small space (informally:  ""without computing all the previous digits"").  see, for example, http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/ .   the small space bound is dependent on an unproved conjecture, however.  the article also doesn't mention why one would want to compute so many digits.  there are at least two reasons:  it is still an unsolved problem whether pi is ""normal"", that is, whether every block of k digits appears with a limiting frequency that one would expect from a random sequence.  it is even unknown whether every block of digits appears somewhere in the decimal expansion of pi (popular claims to the contrary notwithstanding).  most mathematicians believe the answer to both problems is ""yes"".   it is at least conceivable that computing huge numbers of digits of pi could suggest whether these conjectures are true.  the second reason is that computing large numbers of digits of pi, since they intensively use various arithmetic operations, could reveal problems with new computer chips -- you can compare the results of your calculation to previous ones.  neither reason is truly compelling, though.",0,,

132535,"&gt;this is partially the reason why adults should not have sex with child who are in puberty.  because they can later be deceived by other people into believing that their enjoyment of an early sexual encounter constitutes abuse?  if something happens to you, and you liked it, and it requires convincing from other people to have you believe it was actually abuse... how do you define anything you ever enjoy to not be abuse?  given the correct social atmosphere, i could convince you that the chef that served you a decadent dessert 2 years ago caused every negative thing in your life that followed.  &gt;they can be seduced and even willing, but they may not be mentally ready.  there is no such thing as ""mentally unready"".  sex is not a complex experience foreign to any human being.  no matter how young, even fetuses in the womb masturbate and even very small children understand that rubbing their genitals feels good.  it requires a parent or teacher or someone else in authority over them to twist this harmless natural aspect of humanity into a psychologically destructive part of their life.  &gt;they can have serious sexual problems in later in life. childs and adults just can't have relationships with equal footing.   what difference does that make?  if we're talking about an adult facilitating experimentation on the part of the adolescent (we are not talking about children) or both of them mutually sharing a sexual experience as entertainment, no complex relationship need be involved.  it is emotionally and sexually immature to believe that sexual activity requires or connotates an emotional relationship.  &gt;sex that is not equal is abuse.   that is not always true.  sex between an 18 year old virgin and an 18 year old who has been having rewarding sexual encounters for years is not equal and it is not abuse.  it can be an entertaining experience, an educational one, a fulfilling one, etc.  the circumstances determine all of that, as well of course as consent.  &gt;teens should be practice sex with other children at their own age.  while i agree, this doesn't provide any evidence for or against the idea of a single teen straying from this due to circumstance, opportunity, etc.  if the teen can consent to sex with another teen, what is there about the age difference that you believe makes the teen incapable of consenting with an adult?  or, instead, what do you believe makes their consenting irrelevant?  i'm not arguing that anyone should be forced into doing anything they don't want to.  &gt;in these cases it's important to remember that it's the adult that has all the responsibility, not the kid.  wrong.  adolescents have the responsibility of taking care of their own body, of exercising their sexuality with caution and in vocalizing that they want to stop, etc.  nature has given them the responsibility.  they are able to conceive and give birth.  this is not something i invented.  it was a responsibility given to them by evolution over hundreds of thousands of years.  their desire for sexual interaction with other people is the same.  it is the responsibility of society and of parents especially to prepare adolescents to be able to shoulder this responsibility.  it is pitiful how completely parents and society have failed them on both counts.  &gt;i think courts in many countries try to figure out how equal the relationship has been and how mature then youngster is when determining if the relationship is illegal or punishable. that's why age difference is relevant.   most countries declare a strict age based on the influence of judeochristian ""values"" mixed with a bit of pop psychology based in great portion on horrible stories of kids being raped and a complete misunderstanding of human sexuality (keep in mind we've not been studying sexuality for very long and there are still tremendous barriers to any actual legitimate research on youth sexuality).  most countries believe that sex is a dirty form of exploitation by one party executed upon another.  the truth is that it is a bodily function that happens to be able to provide people with a tremendous amount of pleasure.  it is not immoral.  it is not unhealthy if practiced with a modicum of caution.  and it is a very effective way to abuse people and control them by confusing them about sex, by convincing them that it is some sort of highly moral act with life-long implications attached to every act.",0,,

 i'd say i'm a pretty perpetually solemn and depressed artistic/creative type that is looking for his way in this cosmos and trying to learn as much as possible in the hopes of graduating to the next level of spiritual development when he dies (which he hopes is *very* soon).  &gt; where will we be in 10 years? 20 years?  me?  hopefully (*very* hopefully) dead.  if not dead, then hopefully making a living being an artist.  20 years?  see answer to ""10 years.""  &gt; do you think we‚Äôll ever lose touch with each other?  on one level no.  absolutely not.  on another level . . . yes.  heck, on this particular level, we've never established contact in the first place.  &gt; is there anything that you‚Äôve always wanted to tell me but haven‚Äôt?  not that i can think of.  &gt; where did you grow up?  san antonio, texas.  &gt; what was your childhood like?  on one level, normal.  likes, dislikes, fights with my sisters, etc.  laughing here and there, etc.  on another level it was an absolute nightmare - literally.  my childhood was plagued and marked by some of the most traumatic nighttime experiences i can imagine.  sheesh . . . shudder.  &gt; who were your favorite relatives?  my cousin felix.  he's my brother from another mother.  also though, when i was around 10 or so and i went back home to puerto rico with my family, i had the absolute most awesome time with my cousins tato and cheo.  i'll always remember that time fondly.  &gt; do you remember any of the stories they used to tell you?  i remember felix visiting from the east coast when we were young, and us literally staying up allll night just talking.  it was awesome/great.  with my other cousins, the main thing i remember is our (more their) taking wild lizards from the farm area and, as the lizards opened their mouths in defensive attack, my cousins would let them *snap* on to their earlobes and then run around shaking their heads back and forth with the reptiles dangling maniacally from their ears like insane, tropical voodoo earrings. lol  it was very funny.  &gt; how did you and grandma/grandpa meet?  my mother and father took me to them.  &gt; what was my mom/dad like growing up?  i do not believe i have any idea.  &gt; do you remember any songs that you used to sing to her/him? can you sing them now?  to your mom or dad?  i cannot say i was ever around them *to* sing any songs.  &gt; was she/he well-behaved?  i do not believe i have any idea.  &gt; what is the worst thing she/he ever did?  i do not believe i have any idea.  &gt; what were your grandparents like?  i didn't really know them all that well.  my grandmother on my mother's side died when i was two or three, and my grandfather on my father's side passed away at around that time as well.  my grandmother on my father's side was a cool, but expectedly hardcore old lady.  never knew her too much, but she seemed cool.  my grandfather on my mother's side?  woowee . . . that dude lived to be one of the oldest cats in puerto rico!  for something like his 104th birthday thereabouts, he had a pretty big birthday celebration where a lot of people from the island showed up.  he was pretty hardcore.  &gt; how would you like to be remembered?  i can't say i'm too sure i *would* like to be.  &gt; are you proud of me?  i can't say i am.  no offense.  &gt; when did you first find out that you‚Äôd be a parent? how did you feel?  fuck . . . when the girl i was going out with all those years ago told me she had gotten pregnant (fuck!).  how did i feel?  i took a deep breath, and started the long process of explaining to her why it was a *very* bad idea to be a parent.  fortunately, she eventually agreed.  &gt; can you describe the moment when you saw your child for the first time?  never saw him/her.  &gt; how has being a parent changed you?  initially it didn't much.  but then after i was a parent *again* for the second time, it totally, completely changed my life completely.  i'm much more responsible now.  i ""bit the bullet"" and have settled into my current role as best as i can/could.  &gt; what are your dreams for your children?  i don't have any dreams for them - fortunately.  &gt; do you remember when your last child left home for good?  lol . . . okay.  this is calloused . . . but yes.  i do remember when they were ""gone for good"".  &gt; do you have any favorite stories about your kids?  nope.  &gt; are you proud of me?  can't say that i am.  i'm not ashamed of you, but i'm also not proud.  &gt; when and where were you born?  i was born on novermber 13th, 1972 in hato rey, puerto rico.  &gt; what was it like?  being born?  i can't say i have any conscious recollection of that.  i imagine it was pretty traumatic, however.  living in puerto rico?  aawweeeessome.  best island on this planet, i feel.  bar none.  &gt; who were your parents?  were?  well, they were who and what they still are - which is two people trying to do their best in life.  they were both very accomplished school teachers (retired now), been married for over 45 years, put three kids through school and college, and are still alive and kicking today.  &gt; what were your parents like?  assholes growing up.  i didn't like them much at *all*.  i'm sure i didn't help either, but still.  they were generally strict, but provided well for their family and took us on many, many vacation trips around the country and abroad.  there's quite a bit i would have done differently in their shoes, but i think they did a very good job with what they had.  &gt; how was your relationship with your parents?  not very good growing up.  pretty darn good now.  i'd say it's maybe even better now than it was bad growing up.  yeah.  maybe though.  i wasn't an easy kid.  &gt; did you get into trouble? what was the worst thing you did?  yes.  the worst thing i did?  sheesh . . . i don't know . . . i punched holes in the walls of our house . . . almost got in a physical fight with my dad (sooo glad i didn't - i'd be *very* ashamed of it to this day if i did).  screaming, yelling . . . i guess that might have been the worst . . . but yeah . . . there were a lot of ""runner ups"".  &gt; do you have any siblings? what were they like growing up?  yes - two older sisters.  oldest i used to physically fight with a lot - lost more than i won.  as i said above, however, she very much loves me and i very much love her.  middle sister i actually just - literally like almost one year ago to the day - just really started connecting with on what might be the best, most real level she and i have ever connected on.  it really feels great to feel more ""real"" with her.  we really didn't get along all that great growing up - and i personally carried that all the way until . . . until . . . like i said, last year really.  i'm glad to say i feel ssooo much closer to her now than ever, and i'm very happy and grateful for that.  &gt; what did you look like?  growing up?  pretty dang ugly i'd say.  matter of fact, i remember being *so* ugly that after seeing something like my 6th or 7th grade yearbook picture, i absolutely vowed to *never* again take a school yearbook picture.  and i didn't.  i didn't come out on any yearbook pictures for the remainder of any of my school years - junior high, highschool, or college.  &gt; how would you describe yourself as a child? were you happy?  shit, compared to how i am now i was a super happy wild child growing up.  i was generally rambunctious enough as a kid.  however, pretty early on and for a few long years after i suffered from the *worst* nightmares around.  i feared going to sleep at night so badly for so long.  i didn't think i'd live through it.  &gt; what is your best memory of childhood? worst?  can't think of a ""best"" memory off the top of my head.  worst?  feels like there are quite a few.  i'd say overall the worst was just the general, putrid stench of angst-ridden death i always felt growing up from very early school all the way up to like 10th grade or so because 1) i didn't like (read ""hated"") school and didn't generally get very good grades, and 2) both my parents were school teachers, so my whole life was filled with the dread of the punishment i had waiting at home for me in response to my bad grades.  i really swore for quite a while that i absolutely knew i would get or already had ulcers because my dread felt so big and overwhelming.  don't know how i didn't get any.  &gt; did you have a nickname? how‚Äôd you get it?  i've had a few by different people.  the main one i look at and relate to is ""vit√≠n"" ""vitins√≠to"" or ""vier"" - all derivatives of my middle name that my mother still calls me.  &gt; who were your best friends? what were they like?  i was best friends with joe cavanagh in high school.  he was a great, great bud of mine and i'm glad he was my friend.  he was a cool, very tough as fucking nails white boy who was still the coolest, nicest, most loyal and honorable dude you'd find.  he was awesome.  &gt; how would you describe a perfect day when you were young?  shit . . . so much has changed and i'd almost say i've blocked out so much of my youth that i almost can't even relate to ""a perfect day"" when i was young.  i guess i'd say a perfect day would be just hanging out and riding my bike around the neighborhood i lived in with my buddy joe.  &gt; what did you think your life would be like when you were older?  i didn't.  when i finally *did* start thinking bout getting older, i simply just thought - and assumed even - that i'd simply be dead before i reached something like 30 or so.  now that i'm 38, i'm hoping i'm outta here on or before 40.  given my shitty luck, however, i might be here till 95.  &gt; do you have any favorite stories from your childhood?

479495,"you're entitled to your opinion, but did your read [the rest of the source of that quote](http://www.princeton.edu/~psinger/faq.html)? (emphasis added)  q. you have been quoted as saying: ""killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to killing a person. sometimes it is not wrong at all."" is that quote accurate?  &gt;a. it is accurate, *but can be misleading if read without an understanding of what i mean by the term ‚Äúperson‚Äù* (which is discussed in practical ethics, from which that quotation is taken). i use the term ""person"" to refer to a being who is capable of anticipating the future, of having wants and desires for the future.  as i have said in answer to the previous question, i think that it is generally a greater wrong to kill such a being than it is to kill a being that has no sense of existing over time. newborn human babies have no sense of their own existence over time. so killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.  **that doesn‚Äôt mean that it is not almost always a terrible thing to do.  it is, but that is because most infants are loved and cherished by their parents, and to kill an infant is usually to do a great wrong to its parents. sometimes, perhaps because the baby has a serious disability, parents think it better that their newborn infant should die. many doctors will accept their wishes, to the extent of not giving the baby life-supporting medical treatment.  that will often ensure that the baby dies.  my view is different from this, only to the extent that if a decision is taken, by the parents and doctors, that it is better that a baby should die, i believe it should be possible to carry out that decision, not only by withholding or withdrawing life-support ‚Äì which can lead to the baby dying slowly from dehydration or from an infection ‚Äì but also by taking active steps to end the baby‚Äôs life swiftly and humanely.**   q. what about a normal baby? doesn‚Äôt your theory of personhood imply that parents can kill a healthy, normal baby that they do not want, because it has no sense of the future?  &gt;a. most parents, fortunately, love their children and would be horrified by the idea of killing it.  and that‚Äôs a good thing, of course.  **we want to encourage parents to care for their children, and help them to do so. moreover, although a normal newborn baby has no sense of the future, and therefore is not a person, that does not mean that it is all right to kill such a baby.**  it only means that the wrong done to the infant is not as great as the wrong that would be done to a person who was killed. **but in our society there are many couples who would be very happy to love and care for that child.  hence even if the parents do not want their own child, it would be wrong to kill it.**",1,1,1
772941,"&gt; you can't seriously claim that we should criminalize things driven by sexuality simply because they are driven by it, it's a natural thing.  appeal to nature fallacy.  &gt;the crime is in the harm done to others. it's even natural for adults to be attracted to minors! (natural as in naturally occurring  i agree.  &gt;this is still a crime because of the power dynamic, inability to consent, and a number of other points that have merit.  power dynamics are at play when people differ in social stratum. a hot jock is a huge power dynamic of an ugly duckling girl. we should therefore enshrine in law that people judged to be of too different of power dynamics when both are underage should not be allowed to fuck each other, and the person with higher power dynamic (the jock) should get in trouble if sex occurs.  power dynamic is, fyi, the same reason feminists of the purity act era (1900-1920) demanded age consent be raised to 16 and to punish males, be they 15 or 30, for having sex with females under 16. the law was pushed by women to protect only women, as the view was that males have a power dynamic over women in general, women are the victims.  &gt;but should a minor be put on a list for the rest of their life for exchanging nudes with another minor? or for having sex with another minor? for something we call normal and preach to them that it's normal? to be attracted to children their own age?  more appeal to nature fallacies.  &gt;no, 99/100 people will exercise common sense and tell the kid that the babysitter isn't interested, try being romantic with a nice girl in your class or on your soccer team.   how do you know they aren't interested? done a poll? after all, you just suggested above that they would be interested. are you contradicting yourself?  &gt;i'm just trying to get inside your head to understand what could make a person think teens sending eachother nudes is a good way for us to utilize the overburdened judicial system.  because child porn and age of consent laws are strict liability laws. they are laws because anyone who is not yet ""of age"" is a victim, even if they do it of their own free will, desire it, and enjoy it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_morality_and_the_law  &gt;""we're going to have a society of dangers, with, on the one side, those who are in danger, and on the other, those who are dangerous. (...) sexuality will become a threat in all social relations, in all relations between members of different age groups, in all relations between individuals. and sexuality will no longer be a kind of behavior hedged in by precise prohibitions, but a kind of roaming danger, a sort of omnipresent phantom, a phantom that will be played out between men and women, children and adults, and possibly between adults themselves. it is on this shadow, this phantom, this fear that the authorities would try to get a grip through an apparently generous and, at least general, legislation and through a series of particular interventions that would probably be made by the legal institutions, with the support of the medical institutions.""   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11794721/teen-girls-sexually-crave-older-partners-an-uncomfortable-truth.html  &gt; at the most basic level, diary of a teenage girl is a film about a 15-year-old girl who has a lot of extremely gratifying sex with a man who is 20 years her senior and happens to be going out with her mother. which, when you think about it sounds rather a lot like an abuse case.  &gt;but it‚Äôs not. it‚Äôs not abusive because the protagonist, minnie, doesn‚Äôt feel abused. the conclusion of the film suggests that she might regard her affair with him as a mistake, but mistakes and abuse are entirely different things.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_petition_against_age_of_consent_laws  &gt;the crime is in the harm done to others.  if you really believe that, then it doesn't matter if a power dynamic is different if no harm comes of it. actually, they've studied it and age difference falls out as excessive harm in sexual relationships. that is to say a teen on teen sexual relationship is not any more or less harmful than a teen on adult relationship, insofar as the teens in both instances agree and want the relationship, and then get heartbroken later on.  http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/10/08/230428115/many-teens-admit-to-coercing-others-into-sex  http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2003/06/sexually-active-teenagers-are-more-likely-to-be-depressed  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jun/3/20030603-115719-1821r/  &gt;teens who have had sexual intercourse are more likely to feel depressed and suicidal than teens who have not become sexually active, says a new study from the heritage foundation.   the claim is that teens are highly damaged by coitus with adults. the claim is also that teens are vulnerable to coercion.   yet this is coming from teens onto other teens, the damage and coercion. but lets keep it legal because ""at least the power dynamics are the same"".  if having sex with someone underage is akin to rape, and if getting nude pictures of someone who is irresponsible and incapable of good decision making is exploitation, it should be illegal and should be punished whether the offender is overage or underage, because there's still a victim.  you can't trot out the vacuous and meaningless phrase ""power dynamic"", repeated rote from the sjw/feminist camp, as if it means anything and expect me to take you seriously. all relationships have power imbalances. an ugly man or woman in a relationship with a highly desirable significant other has extremely diminished power in the relationship because of the other person's ability to jump ship to another relationship, and so will do anything to please their partner, above and beyond norms (whatever passes for normal, fair power balanced relationships in your mind)  a person dating someone and living with them immediately obtains a hugely unfair power dynamic in their favor if their s.o. gets fired from the job and has to stay with them or become homeless, because the potential for abuse, for saying ""fuck me or i'll make you homeless"" exists, as the power dynamic is extremely different. the potential is no different then the supposed power dynamic difference potential of abuse between ""adult and teen"".  if someone is 18 and someone is 40, they shouldn't date because of huge power dynamic difference, yet it is legal. apparently the ode to ""power dynamic"" as the root reason for age of consent and child porn laws is a cherry pick argument, because you're not willing to apply it to everyone in every circumstance.  as such, age and this mythical ""power dynamic"" falls out of the equation, from potential of harm, to proven harm, to exploitation. age is a non-factor, the only that is left is action. if age isn't a factor and only action is left, it does not matter what age x is, if x has nudes of an underage girl or fucks her, he's exploiting her as a vulnerable class (underage).  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  &gt;but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  you don't get to pick and choose who is a victim and who isn't arbitrarily and sans-proof-of-harm. that's what child porn and age of consent laws do.  they do that precisely because we deem that it is harmful enough to a large enough group of the vulnerable class, that it must be legislated against. the age of the offender does not and should not matter if this is so.  germany actually sidesteps any future argument you may have on power imbalance, any red herrings, such as being a family member, or a legal guardian, or a teacher. germany legalizes down to 14 provided you aren't in any position of authority over the minor, and thus have no power imbalance. however even that is a bit extreme, as coercion into sex by threats is de-facto rape, so you don't even need age of consent law to condemn someone of the same age or older of abusing their power to extract sex from someone.",1,1,1

 &gt; i just touched down in my fathers tiny no name town after a twenty four hour trip with three separate flights. an airport with two flights a day.  &gt;  &gt; about three weeks ago i found out my father has what appears to be a terminal illness (my friends on here can confirm). as if this wasn't bad enough, i'm being forced (i guess starting tomorrow) into having to live separately from my wife in a tiny one bedroom apartment in a rundown mill down, so my father can tell me the harsh truth while he literally forces me to sleep on a ""cot"" with him next to roaches so he can build up the courage to tell his only reasonably sane son how the rest of his life is now down the toilet. he is literally forcing me to separate from my wife and live with him so he can be close to me and explain why my paranoid schizo brother needs 40+ years of my help and close supervision. my father is not man enough to sit down with me at lunch and tell the whole family his plan. &gt;  &gt; my brother is apparently a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic (though my chinese family doesn't believe this, thinking that my father's fear of jewish psychology turned my brother into the person he is, allowing him to suffer after extreme trauma from losing his tiger mother - who also had extreme covert incest with him), and there's a 99% chance now that my father is going to ask me to take care of my brother in the event that my dad dies. this is what i gleaned from my grandmother although the details of how bad he is (several arrests, extremely disturbing home hygiene issues), and my father will never admit how bad my brother is because he feels this will make him lose even more faith in god, the only thing that probably keeps him barely functioning. my dad lives with my brother and watches him constantly out of fear that he will do some shit like he used to - apparently at one point his apartment was stacked to the ceiling in molded dishes, vomit bags, dirty bloody tissue paper. i suggested to my grandma that we put him in an institution for life but this isn't the christian thing to do. &gt;  &gt; my grandma just told me this, and i just had to tell my wife (she immediately started crying like an infant) that if i am forced to spend the rest of my life in this shitty town caring for my brother (who apparently cannot be left alone because of what he used to do when left alone i the apartment - like a horror movie), that she leave me and go back to china and live a healthy life. this made her immediately start crying hysterically. i told her she does not deserve a fate like the one i'm looking at right now. &gt;  &gt; i sincerely hope none of you people here ever have to say shit like that to someone you care about and the worst thing is that while she was crying like a baby, you feel absolutely nothing. that's the kind of man i've become after twenty years of monthly, yearly, daily agonizing pain that never stops, because i have to pay for the sins of my fucking father.  &gt;  &gt; some people just lose the game of life. if you people ever wondered why eurasiantiger had a hysterical view of life and a dark humor about it all, it's because it was my only way of dealing with a constant horror of just repeated bad luck stemming from my fathers poor decisions and his mental illness (that led him to fetishize asian culture). i literally am posting this in a bath towel leaning on the sink of my grandmother's apartment after showering and laughing hysterically at how shit just never stops. it never, ever stops for some people. it's all just funny to me at this point. one of the greatest potentials of our generation, and a truly brilliant hapa mind flushed down the toilet just for the cost of my father's yellow fever and anemic christian view of the nobility and sanctimony of creating life just for the purpose of creating life.  &gt;  &gt; i also had an epiphany today, that the only real love is love for oneself. if you can love yourself like i do even the worst agonizing horror stories after horror stories your entire life, death after death after death, become bearable. but for my wife i can't let her suffer like that. i told her to leave me if i'm forced to do this. i'm posting this from a tiny bathroom next to the woods in a tiny little rundown horrible town with less people than the building complex i live in in china. there's nothing wrong with being mixed race or asian. if anything being asian seems to negate many of the problems that are almost never ending among my white family, and being mixed with asian gives me the youthfulness and health to deal with horrors that would cripple 99% of men. &gt;  &gt; so you guys got what you wanted, i guess. hopefully years after the fact many of you can realize that everything i said was based in truth about the essentially tragedy of life and how some people are just dealt the worst hand after worst hand to the point you don't even feel it anymore. i put my blog on private simply because i have for the first time, some sympathy for my father, after he called me and asked me dramatically ""are you sitting down?"" before telling me that he was ""very, very sick and i needed to come home, now."" &gt;  &gt; home, being a fucking town  in the middle of nowhere that i have no connection to, whose shitty as an diner has been missing an ""i"" for fifteen years and whose tj max is a town attraction. this is his arrogance.  &gt;  &gt; none of you will ever have to say to the woman you love that you would rather she leave you than suffer essentially a fate worse than death. being locked in with a paranoid schizo and being forced to monitor him until he or you is dead because your 90 year old grandma and terminally ill dad won't be able to. being forced to pay for the sins of your father. and of course none of you will ever even know the amount of cold bloodedness and lack of feelings to me able to just accept something like that. from the ivy league to a town of 12,000 in a three story wooden walkup caring for a forty year old schizo.  &gt;  &gt; enjoy your lives, and be thankful you never had to deal with a fraction of the things i have to experience year after year after year after year after year with no end in sight. &gt;  &gt; as for the attempted doxxing, it has nothing to do with my disappearance. i had been disappearing more and more frequently i the last few months attempting to wrestle with this situation. lots of people noticed that. and you might think this is some kind of plea. it's not. i was planning on leaving for a while to deal with life circumstances that there are no online solutions for, and yeah, are directly related to lots of the shit we talk about here. &gt;  &gt; ladies, be careful of the men you have children with. while on paper it sounds cool to have that tall white guy, not everything is as it seems. highly intelligent hapa babies might not be the best thing ever. i look at the millions my chinese family have and how their kids are successful then i look at how i'm forced to trudge around a grey, trampled little town for the rest of my life just because my father just had, just had to get some pussy.  &gt;  &gt; none of you will ever know the feeling of dread at the shit i confront daily, and the feeling, a feeling i had for the first time, in all earnestly, in my entire life, that i was better off dead than to be cursed to this kind of life long death sentence. you will never, ever know what it's like to go from such highs to such lows and be ruined by circumstances that have you by the neck at every minute, of every day, with no end in sight; and if that fear wasn't enough now i know i am facing a genetic annihilation at the hands of not only paranoid schizophrenia but my father's genetic illness. &gt;  &gt; oh well. this fate is so bad, because i've been trying to get away from my brother and father and memories of my mother for years, and in one day after the hell of watching my favorite city in the world shrink away beneath the clouds to be replaced by this hell hole of overgrown sidewalks and cinderblock wendy's, that i've essentially decided that if this happens, i am going to end my life before then. probably by firearm because my uncle (my father's brother, who is now embracing the reality of my brother) has several. it won't be today or tomorrow, but i'm just saying that i've reached a point today that i've realized that now my father's sins have become so bad that they are ruining other people's lives and it might even just be better for me to go. &gt;  &gt; i want all the hapas out there to remember two things: there's nothing wrong with you, and that life can be particularly cruel to many of us. but it never was your fault. it never was your fault. you're all beautiful and wonderful people regardless of what you look like. &gt;  &gt; peace. and i love you all. if you want to talk to me email because i'm not going to be posting here anymore. my life is sealed in stone now and either i deal with it or i die.   ---- ^(check out copy-kun on) ^[github](https://github.com/jaredhays/copy-kun)!",1,,-2

257332,"we don't; we want them to die. it's harsh, but it's (relatively) true.  if you look at your family tree 100, 200 or even 500 years back, you'll find out that your grandmothers churned out at least half a dozen babies in their lifetimes. due to poverty or sickness, many of these poor kids died, but one or two would go on and have kids of their own. in better times, maybe three or four would survive, but due to war or terrible working conditions, they would die off in their teens or 20s, leaving very few children behind. similarly the women, if not dying during childbirth, would die at what we now consider a relatively young age of around 50-60, because they wouldn't be able to support themselves.  fast forward to the 1940s, and we see countries with safe jobs, strong economies, and low mortality rates thanks to improved medicine and working conditions. women still have 5 or 6 kids, and most of them survive... all the way through till now. good for you, gramps - you're one of the baby boomers.  and because these old people are staying fitter and healthier for longer, they're staying at work. no more quitting at 50 because of a bad back or arthritis; these guys just neck a few pills, take up some physiotherapy and carry on. this means that the younger kids can't move up the career path; the top jobs are all being held by people in their 60s or even 70s who have decades of experience and who still have all their marbles too. they're making all the money as well, so younger people earn less, and keep earning less well into their 40s.  with all their working years they've bought all the houses and they own all the business and they're *not giving up any of it*. so it's really hard for the next generation to move up.  the trouble is that this lucky baby boomer generation only had one or two kids themselves (""because kids hold you down, man""), so there's a much smaller generation to come next. and when the baby boomers get really old, and can't look after themselves, they're going to want pensions and healthcare - the sort of stuff that's paid for by the taxes of the working classes. but the working classes don't have the money to pay their own taxes, and the pensions of the previous, larger generation, and the taxes that pay for their own kids' education and healthcare. what it eventually means is that for every person working, they need to earn enough to pay for themselves and their parents and their kids; they need three times as much money, which doesn't exist because these old retired baby boomers still own all the houses, companies, stocks and shares, and will until they die.  the longer a baby boomer lives as a pensioner, the harder it will be for their kids to make a decent living.  **edit:** wow! gold and front page! thank you! see reddit, if you just knuckle down and work harder, you get to the top. back in my day *blah blah blah*  **edit 2:** the ""lump of labour fallacy (llf)"" is being mentioned a lot, as is the ""finite economic pie (fep)"". i did oversimplify this post since it's for eli5 rather than askreddit, but i'll address those two elements:  both the llf and the fep are perfectly valid, and are one of the reasons why we are told not to worry about the 78million boomers in the us alone (discounting europe, china, japan) who are approaching retirement. the idea is that the market automatically grows to expand and accommodate an increasing population through innovation, entrepreneurialism and standard consumption models, since there's no finite limit to the amount of wealth that can be created. in theory, and in the preceding decades, this has played out fine.  what is worrying is the *current economic conditions*. based on a stable population of 300m people with a life expectancy of 80, this means the us sees approximately 3.75m born each year. if we follow a linear path, that means 3.75m enter primary education each year, the same number enter college each year, and so on until we get to the labour market. of course, there are dips and highs - 1993 saw just over 4m births, and those kids are approaching the age where they want their first job.  the issue is that in 2012 the us only saw the creation of 1.8m new jobs. this means that for the 3.75m who entered the labour market, 1.95m have to leave legitimately (retirement or death) to prevent unemployment rising, which would otherwise ultimately lead to economic depression. if 4m baby boomers retire in one year, that'll create an employment glut, so they'll be jobs for the young'uns. great. but if they hold on to their jobs because they won't or *can't* retire, then you get massive youth unemployment. in spain, 25% of under-25s are unemployed.   with the majority of the nation's wealth firmly in the hands of the boomers, and the majority of that wealth in the hands of an exclusive group (1% of boomers hold 1/3 of the wealth), we'll see a combination of a whole load of boomers entering the pension system with no assets to support them, while the privileged few hold onto their jobs and their assets. this causes a liquidity crisis, where the state needs cash for pension payments, but the holders of the wealth (in terms of stocks, shares and real estate) aren't liquidating that wealth - they're holding on to it as investments for their own retirements.  this liquidity crisis means there's less free capital around to offer to entrepreneurs to help them start up their own firms (creating a vicious cycle), as well as forcing governments to pursue tax payers as much as they can to make up the current shortfall in pensions. as examples, france recently advocated a 75% on those earning over 1m eur as a response to this welfare crisis, while the uk uses a 40% inheritance tax (on inheritances over a certain amount) in order to re-transfer that capital away from the hands of one family and back to the greater society.  so while the llf says ""the labour market will react accordingly"", we haven't seen recently a corresponding adjustment in the labour market during the current economic crisis. and while there isn't a fep, it *does* take money to make money, and if that original source of wealth can't be tapped then it can't be used to drive growth. and if the current holders of that wealth aren't planning on dying for another 20 years, then the required financial stimulus needed to create new jobs (and thus counter the llf) just won't be there.  what i would like to point out is that i don't personally bear a grudge against the boomers. i'm not american and i don't live in the us, so the situation there doesn't affect me. but as a european i am watching how the 27 eu states struggle to address the same problem, and i haven't seen any solutions yet.",1,-1,-1

240236,"as an editorial in the journal of the american medical association concluded, ""this widely cited publication dramatically showed that atherosclerotic changes appear in the coronary arteries years and decades before the age at which coronary heart disease (chd) becomes a clinically recognized problem.‚Äù http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=363248  follow-up studies on the hearts of thousands more soldiers over the subsequent years confirmed their results. http://www.ajconline.org/article/0002-9149%2862%2990152-2/abstract  how young does it go? fatty streaks, the first stage of atherosclerosis, were found in the arteries of 100% of kids by age 10.  http://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/s0368-1319(69)80020-7/abstract  what's accounting for this buildup of plaque even in childhood? in the 80s we got our first clue in the famous bogalusa heart study. this looked at autopsies of those who died between the ages of 3 to 26 year-olds, and the #1 risk factor was cholesterol intake.  you could see the stepwise increase in the proportion of their arteries covered in fatty streaks as the level of bad cholesterol in the blood increased. as powerful as this was, this was only looking at 30 kids. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3455748  so they decided to study 3000: three thousand accidental death victims, ages 15 through 34. http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/12244281/reload=0;jsessionid=lgelpf26zvp4wk7w2xyb.12  after thousands of autopsies, they were able to produce a scoring system that could predict the presence of advanced atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries of young people. the higher your score, the higher the likelihood you have these lesions growing in the arteries that pump blood and oxygen to your heart. so if you're in your teens, twenties, early thirties and you smoke, your risk goes up by one point. if you have high blood pressure at such a young age, that's 4 points. if you're an obese male, that‚Äôs 6 points, but high cholesterol was the worst of all. if your non-hdl cholesterol (meaning your total cholesterol minus your good cholesterol) is above 220 or so, that was 8 times worse than smoking.  let's say you're a woman with relatively high cholesterol, but you don't smoke, you're not overweight, your blood pressure and blood sugars are ok. at your sweet 16 there's just a 1 in 30 (3%) chance you already have an advanced atherosclerotic lesion in your heart, but if you don't improve your diet, by your 30th birthday, it‚Äôs closer to a 1 in 5 (20%) chance you have some serious heart disease, and if you have really high cholesterol it could be closer to 1 in 3 (33%).  bring your cholesterol down to even just that of a lacto-ovo vegetarian and your risk levels are way down, and if you exercise to boost you hdl you can extrapolate down to here, etc. so what this shows us is that even in 15- to 19-year-olds, atherosclerosis has begun in a substantial number of individuals, and this observation suggests beginning primary prevention at least by the late teenage years to ameliorate every stage of atherosclerosis and to prevent or retard progression to more advanced lesions.  atherosclerosis begins in childhood. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17015535  if you start kids out on a low saturated fat diet, you may see a significant improvement in their arterial function by 11 years old. ""exposure to high serum cholesterol concentration even in childhood may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis. consequently the long-term prevention of atherosclerosis might be most effective when initiated early in life,‚Äù as in weaning infants. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16330680  the strategy of preventing heart disease risk in childhood has been described as radical, but is the concept really so radical? what would be radical is to adopt this concept and actually do something about it. the alternative is to continue indefinitely to rely upon the late, incompletely effective, costly strategies for treating already established risk factors, like high cholesterol levels, that may have been causing progression of the disease their whole lives. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10641821  a failure to diagnose and treat risk factors in youth may miss an opportunity to prevent the long-term consequences of heart disease, the leading cause of disability and death in the united states. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20425267  we could prevent 90% of heart attacks. such a claim would have seemed outrageous 50 years ago, but now we know stopping this epidemic is achievable. there‚Äôs two ways we can do this. the first is the clinical medicine approach, in which physicians identify kids at risk and vigorously advocate lifestyle changes or drug them, but this model can, at best, be applied to only a few individuals. we have 15 minute doctor visits, preventive care isn‚Äôt reimbursed, and interventions directed toward individuals are often ineffective, because they are not supported by the surrounding culture. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18316498  to stop the disease process completely, one may have to go to an almost exclusively plant-based diet, something that hasn‚Äôt been officially recommended for fear of ‚Äúdiscouraging‚Äù the public. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9860381  that's why we need broad social and cultural changes that pervade the entire population to prevent atherosclerosis. the evidence justifies igniting a veritable social movement that eventually will be officially supported by the powers that be. the goal of eliminating 90% of coronary heart disease is feasible, but the cultural and societal changes necessary to achieve this goal won‚Äôt be easy, and they won‚Äôt happen soon, but it‚Äôs time to start.  the newest academy of pediatrics-approved guidelines for universal cholesterol screening of all children, starting around age nine, might actually be too conservative. how about starting at age two? http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/58/8/1179.long  that‚Äôs when parents are generally engaged and vigilant about well-child checkups and when there are additional opportunities for parent education about the importance of diet, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle, not only for their kids but for them as well, because atherosclerosis can start even before birth, and depend on what our moms ate.  fatty streak formation occurs in human fetal arteries and is greatly worsened by how high the pregnant mother‚Äôs cholesterol is. arteries were obtained from spontaneous miscarriages and premature newborns who died within 12 hours of birth right around the end of the second trimester. they looked at the arteries of fetuses from mothers with normal cholesterol levels and from pregnant moms with high cholesterol, and fetal arteries from mothers with high cholesterol contained dramatically greater lesions.  this suggests not only that heart disease may start much earlier than we previously assumed, but that it depends on maternal cholesterol levels. so, atherosclerosis might not just start out as a nutritional disease of childhood, but a nutritional disease of pregnancy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9389731  ""numerous studies have suggested a decrease in atherosclerotic disease risk‚Äîour #1 killer‚Äîin vegan and vegetarian individuals compared to omnivores, [but we‚Äôve just assumed this was due to reduced intake] of dietary cholesterol and saturated fat‚Ä¶‚Äù but what they found was that within 24 hours of carnitine consumption‚Äîeating a sirloin steak, taking a carnitine supplement‚Äìcertain gut bacteria metabolize the carnitine to a toxic substance called trimethylamine, which then gets oxidized in our liver to tmao, trimethylamine-n-oxide, which then circulates throughout our bloodstream. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23563705  vegetarians have consistently shown to have lower risks for cardiometabolic outcomes and some cancers across all three prospective cohorts of adventists.  beyond meatless diets, further avoidance of eggs and dairy products may offer a mild additional benefit. compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, vegan diets seem to provide some added protection against obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes; and cardiovascular mortality. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4073139/pdf/nutrients-06-02131.pdf  most of the volunteer patients with cardiovascular disease responded to intensive counseling, and those who sustained plant-based nutrition for a mean of 3.7 years experienced a low rate of subsequent cardiac events. this dietary approach to treatment deserves a wider test to see if adherence can be sustained in broader populations. plant-based nutrition has the potential for a large effect on the cvd epidemic. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25198208",1,,

how does he hide his ability to get lost? does he stay on course, never get lost and then after getting married he suddenly forgets how to find his way? this is ridiculous.  &gt; who said constantly?  you were the one who mentioned him getting lost at a ridiculous rate (driving in circles for 30minutes?). if he is driving in circles for 30 minutes i don't see his wife not mentioning it at all. she'd probably not mention it once.  &gt; why did immature douche propose if he can't stand being corrected?  you're asking someone who is immature to be mature and have the self awareness not to propose. immature people get married all the time.  &gt; what if he wasn't an immature douche until after marriage?  she has the upper hand here and can leave with the kids and his stuff. the law is on her side here. i would, however, question the woman who claims he changed that much after they got married. how she didn't notice it before when others have (people do say no to relationships) is a problem on her end too. you need to vet people before committing to them long term.  &gt; and if she did take a chance on a man, why does it not occur to him to rise above for the sake of his wife and kids and be a better man?  again, asking for an immature person to have that level of self awareness is asking a lot. she can leave, take the kids and a sizable chunk of his money. the law is on her side.  &gt; why is he completly absolved of any responsibility here since he's the problem?  in one breath you call him a child and the next say he needs to be responsible. which is it? if he is a manchild and it's a problem, then just leave. he is never absolved of responsibility anyway, because she'll get a sizable chunk of his money and the law is on her side when she leaves. problem solved.  &gt; for that statement to be sexist, i would have to imply all men are children, and that women are incapable of being children. i'm expicitly singling out a specific type of man, who is immature, and saying he is a man child. most men are not like this. and some women can be the equivalent of a man child...a woman child. man children cannot be leaders, and no one, man or woman, should cater to their childish behavior. man children should refrain from entering relationships and demanding control of the ship which they don't have the tools to steer.  it is rather telling that there is no ""woman child"" term like there is a term called manchild. your tone is sexist in that you've implied that a man who doesn't like to have his driving criticised is the equivalent of a child. would you consider a woman who doesn't like her cooking criticised to be a woman child, for example? no. it's a situation where if you don't like it, then do it yourself. if you can't stand his driving, then you do the driving.   but no, he is a manchild for not living up to your standards. all i said was it is not a good idea to tell someone how to do something, and i provided possible solutions. you brought in the manchild. maybe he is a responsible adult in other areas, but sucks at driving. reducing him to a manchild from that is taking it quite far.  if however he is a manchild, she can leave. if his driving is a problem she can: - drive herself - help plan the route beforehand - buy him a gps device  &gt; and for most normal people in the world, this problem could also be resolved by her saying ""hey you're diving kind of fast honey, do you mind slowing down?"" and the man saying, ""sure, i'll slow down a bit."" that's an equally acceptable alternative of this being handled. and look. no problems. no resentments. this kind of thing doesn't have to be a problem and most of the time it's not unless one party is immature and hypersensitive.  i wish it was that easy, but it is not. telling him he is driving too fast and that he should slow down can be a kick in the gut for a few reasons. it means she doesn't trust you, it means she doesn't view that you're strong enough to handle that and it means that she doesn't approve of the way you do the thing that helped earn your path to adulthood and freedom.  i mean, it's just how some guys feel. it's not like anyone cares how men feel anyway, right? i highly doubt that if she feels okay with criticising his driving that she is not criticising him in other areas. she probably is. what the writer was getting at is that breaking a man's confidence down is not a good way to get the best from him. if you don't like how fast he drives, and if it's a dealbreaker, then leave. if it is not a deal breaker, then why bring it up? from a woman's perspective, it makes sense to make ""tweaks"" to the relationship: change this, adjust there. it's why so many have nurse syndrome and want to fix messed up guys.  this is not healthy for her at all. attempting to change his habits after you've committed to him is too late. hoping that he will stop speeding is asking for a lot. people are set in their ways. immature people are not going to suddenly grow up because they have a family. if a woman doesn't like enough things about her husband that she feels she has to criticise him in order for him to ""rise above"" then she has married the wrong guy.  &gt; of course, if she were to divorce him, then she'd be that bitch who sucked the life out of the poor man, as most of the stories/reactions go on rp.   sorry but you're wrong here. when a woman leaves, hurts someone or even kills them, they ask what could have driven her to it. if a man does these things, it's in his ""nature"". i also haven't met many women who cared after the divorce about whether people considered her a bitch, because the men are usually the ones who only have a small outlet in a corner of reddit. if that's the place where you're going to get a representation of women, of course you're going to get bad stuff. but here in reality, people tend not to tell women not to do things like leave their husbands. they're encouraged to do so if it means empowerment.  &gt; i like how the logic is such that the responsibility never falls on the man to fix his issues. he can be shitty and it's still the woman's fault for reacting to his shittyness.   again, sorry but a place that encourages men to improve themselves would probably not be okay with him acting like an immature brat. if he is a useless, overweight drunk of a man, they'd tell him to get a hobby, exercise, work on himself and his career.   &gt; i feel like if you're going to support a philosophy or way of living that says men by nature should be the leaders of a relationship, then that should necessitate a certain responsibility on men to be leadership material intead of blaming women when a man fails to be what he's ""biologically wired"" to be.  again, if he sucks, she can leave. from what i've seen from trp women is that, actually, they're not going to marry any man children. they're looking for honest, decent guys who do well when they take the lead. they tell women not to waste time with men who cannot do that. not every man can do this. but if you find one who you admire and want to be the captain, criticising the way he runs the ship is not going to be healthy for you or him. if he is a terrible captain, leave. it really is that simple. i never said he will be a responsible adult. i said it's a good idea to vet the person beforehand. driving is one of those things you tend to know about a person before settling down with them. if it is a deal breaker, then leave.   if not, criticising is not going to help. there are other ways to do it without chipping away at his confidence. of course, the women doing this don't see it this way because they're convinced they're right. men take criticism from women all the time in many other areas and are reduced to man children when they don't meet her standards. feelings are, unfortunately, not reasonable things but there are ways of dealing with them so that both parties are happy. this includes finding working solutions without the need to make your partner feel like they're failing you.   from what i understand about the writer's perspective, it's that many women unintentionally criticise things like his driving to the point where he loses confidence in his ability to do things or has to tiptoe around her. many women make sense. he should not be speeding. but then let him pay the ticket and learn his lesson or you do the driving. men get compared to children a lot (wives say they have 3 kids instead of 2 because they count their husbands) and they get treated this way because women feel men either don't live up to their standards or that they have a right to ""fix"" them.  just don't marry the guy if his actions inspire criticism. the women at rpwi are well aware of how criticism can break your husband's confidence because women think men can just take it, or they owe it to their women to ""rise above"" and just be better. you cannot break someone down and expect them to be better. criticism breaks him down and if it's the driving today, it can lead to more criticism in other areas tomorrow, which it often does. so to avoid breaking his spirit, avoid criticising as much as possible. if you cannot do it, then leave because he will never make you happy.",1,,-1

737016,"one of the reasons i moved *to* new zealand is that the women here are more equal to men than in the blatantly misogynistic society back in the uk. i hope no-one takes this guys ranting seriously - i've heard something similar once from an old british guy over here blaming everything on a lesbian conspiracy and all 'those bloody asians'. this guy is talking bollocks.  some background first - why there is better equality between the sexes (and yes, that means strong women, get used to it) in nz.   1) pioneer culture. when you're at the ends of the earth, the women will help on the farm as much as the men.  2) nz lost a very large proportion of it's young mmen in wwii and as a result, women had to step into roles normally jealously reserved for men 3) a lot of the other cultures that go into making a kiwi are matriarchal, and the men, until recently, derived their status as warriors, a role that modern society has little use for, and it's taking their cultures time to adapt and find new ways for men to achieve status. this is one of the forces behind the popularity of rugby over here.  now, let me take this apart: &gt;women in nz have far more power than men.   not in my experience. i'd say that it was nearer equal, but still biased in favour of men.  &gt;women have been appointed to most (at one point every) top job within government and law.   i call bullshit. when was there a woman in every top position in government and law? are you saying there was a time with no male judges or politicians, or are you saying that every job position has at one time been filled by a woman. if it's the latter then there's nothing wrong with that.   &gt;many women hold the top jobs in the corporate world. when i left, the biggest nz corporation had a woman as the ceo, a job she had had for a decade. brilliant! good for them.   &gt;men are discriminated against. men make up approximately 25% of all higher education. men are approximately 20% house husbands bullshit. i have experienced no discrimination as a man in nz. just because many men choose a support role for their wives, or a more equal partnership, does not demean them in the slightest. if you think it does then you're just a sexist asshat.  while it is true that many women hold top jobs in new zealand, i find the accusations this **ranting and obviously damaged** person completely at odds with what i have found in the 5 years since i moved here. the treatment of suicide stats is almost childish:  &gt;men kill themselves in nz at approximately 7x the rate of women in *every* culture male suicide outnumbers female suicide. women talk about their problems more, men bottle them up. guess which one is most likely to lead to suicide.  oh i give up. it should be obvious to anyone with a brain that this guy has got a problem with women. my experience of nz has been nothing like this. it's not perfect by any means, but the explanations this guy gives, and the paranoid correlations he makes are so far removed from reality it's laughable. there's a lot fo 30-39 year old males offshore right now because their earning sillymoney abroad. i know over a dozen kiwis right now (about 60%male) who are abroad, or planning on spending several years abroad, to earn money to get a deposit on a house. the housing market here has become very hard to break into. this has nothing to do with women!  finally, going back to the suicide issue - there are two prime demographics involved in the male suicide problem. youth suicide, especially among young maoiri and pacific islanders, with can (albeit simplistically) be partially pegged to the undefined male role in their sub-culture, but also to poverty and poor education and few future choices.  there's also classic middle-aged male suicide. lost the job that you thought you had been promised for life, job skills you have not relevant any more, kids left home, wife discovered better sex through ann summers toys, prospects of re-skilling to find a new career to daunting....any one of these could lead to depression and many men have to face several of these factors all at once. to just blame this on the evil cabal of all-powerful women is just insane.",0,,

[vial of the sands](http://www.wowhead.com/item=65891#screenshots) turns you into a dragon, allowing you to carry a passenger. the vial sells for about 45,000 gold, so not many people have it. in that same group, there's other mounts like [sky golem](http://www.wowhead.com/item=95416#screenshots) (14k), [mechano-hog](http://www.wowhead.com/item=41508#screenshots) (18k) or [onyx panther](http://www.wowhead.com/item=82453#screenshots) (~90k). sometimes there's exceptionally rare stuff on the auction house, things like [ghastly charger](http://www.wowhead.com/item=93671#screenshots) or the [magic rooster](http://www.wowhead.com/item=49290#screenshots). mounts like those sell for anywhere between 350,000 to 800,000 gold. it's the kind of stuff many players will never even get close to.  you could also solo old raids to collect transmog sets. simply browse old item sets till you see something you like, farm the raid for a while, then transmog your current gear into the cool-looking farmed set.  and you can also farm for mounts in old raids and dungeons. i don't know too many there, but there's for instance the [raven lord](http://www.wowhead.com/item=32768#screenshots) in heroic sethekk halls, and [blue proto-drake](http://www.wowhead.com/item=44151#screenshots) in heroic utgarde pinnacle.  the daily quest hubs are somewhat scattered. shado-pan is on the west coast of townlong steppes, at the bridge. the sunreavers/kirin tor are also there, beyond the portal in the camp (but you open their quests initally from the scout in shrine). klaxxi is in dread wastes, in the center at klaxxi'vess. august celestial dailies start in shrine, at the bottom floor. cloud serpent faction is in the jade forest, at the arboretum. golden lotus has been removed lore-wise, rep with them is done by...killing random things in the vale i think. shieldwall/dominance are in the east/west of krasarang wilds, you get the hubs from the initial quest from the scout in shrine. anyway, these factions now only give a mount at exalted, all their gear has been made obsolete by the timeless isle.  as for farming gold, any of the three gathering professions (herbalism, mining and skinning) is a good way to farm gold with, by selling on the auction house. producing professions can also be good at lvl 90 to make gold with, since most producing professions give you a daily cooldown to make 1 rare object/material/bar per day. hunters pretty often go with skinning/leatherworking, since they can use those to make a few epics for themselves at every new patch.  anyway, skinning is a nice way to farm gold (at lvl 90). in this expansion, i find mining to be the most solid moneymaker, especially mining for ghost iron/mithril/thorium. but next expansion, who knows. just check your auction house for the prices on the server, see what people are buying.",0,,
540697,"disclaimer: i am not a professional biologist.  it depends on what you mean. usually i see neoteny described in two different ways. first, is the purpose of neoteny, which is to inspire affection and protection in adults. it seems plausible enough, though i'm not sure if it's been rigorously tested. if the internet is anything to go by, most of us enjoy looking at baby animals, particularly mammals. as i mentioned, neoteny in this way is described as:  - big head - big eyes - short limbs - clumsiness - high pitched vocalizations - fuzziness, even though human babies aren't fuzzy.  when we look at this list, we can see that penguins seem clumsy and have short limbs, and we find them adorable. spiders are agile and long-limbed: not adorable.   note that we generally don't find ourselves *sexually attracted* to creatures we consider neotenous. in fact, neoteny in this sense indicates that they are far from sexual maturity.  the other way i see neoteny used is a biological process where a switch is turned off at some point in development to halt full maturation. this process is understood more rigorously. this is partly how wolves and wildcats were bred into dogs and cats. a trait that is present in a dog, but not a wolf is usually (but not always) a trait found in a young wolf. that is how you get very small adult dogs: the genetic switch that says ""stop growing"" gets thrown very early. small dogs reach their full size at a relatively young age.  so from that sense, yes, the mechanism underlying a physically expressed trait may be that a developmental switch is turned off earlier. however, again, neoteny generally refers to *infants*, not adolescents. it's a weird conflation to argue that men look for neoteny, but also for obvious signs of sexual maturation, like breasts and hips.   this also conflates the effects of sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone on facial structure, which also aren't completely understood. so yes, estrogen may affect female facial structure through neoteny in certain respects... but who cares?  there's so much going on that it's very easy to cherry pick certain features and say they prove your political agenda. if i wanted to argue that men show greater neoteny, of the top of my head, i'd say:  - it's commonly argued that girls mature faster than boys, physically and emotionally. many people say that men never really grow up.  - men are more prone to celebrate reckless behavior, which points to a youthful sense of immortality.  - men seem to find fart jokes and the like funnier than women do.  - men are considered more selfish and less empathetic than women, which are considered childish traits.   so, there you go. i just proved that men are neotenous. checkmate, mras.",0,,
377474,"during my nearly six decades of life mrs. hillary clinton could be the most reprehensible and duplicitous american citizen and politician i have ever witnessed.  first she characterizes as ""super predators"" children who were exposed to childhood trauma, abuse and neglect that often causes many kids to mature into depressed, angry, frustrated, unpredictable, sometimes suicidal *(ny times may 18, 2015 - rise in suicide by black children surprises researchers)* teens and adults lacking empathy, compassion and respect for their peaceful neighbors.  then mrs. clinton quickly glosses over the primary reason many kids mature into depressed, angry, frustrated teens and adults like baltimore residents michael singleton and the late freddie gray, or american recording artists kendrick lamar and the late tupac shakur, both men who rap or speak about experiencing childhood and adult depression, as well as experiencing suicidal thoughts.  kendrick lamar talks about ‚Äòu,‚Äô his depression &amp; suicidal thoughts (pt. 2) | mtv video news april 2015  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu4pz9pjoli  there is a reason kendrick and tupac rap or speak about childhood and adult depression, as well as experiencing suicidal thoughts. that reason has everything to do with both of them being emotionally abused, neglected and maltreated by their primary maternal caretaker during a critical period of their human development.  michael, freddie, kendrick and tupac are just a few of my depressed, angry, frustrated american neighbors full of resentment for being introduced to a childhood of pain &amp; struggle by immature moms who willfully ignored their parental responsibility to their children, as well as their moral, ethical and societal obligation &amp; duty to their neighbors and community to place the emotional well being of their children above all else!!  mrs. clinton has a background in studying child abuse and neglect, yet she refuses to acknowledge or even speak about the criminally negligent parenting that is primarily responsible for far too many depressed, angry, frustrated, sometimes suicidal teens and adults populating our prisons and american communities.  instead mrs. hillary clinton wants to speak about ""healing"" those already emotionally scarred by childhood trauma while completely ignoring actions society should take to prevent children from being raised and nurtured by apathetic ""living wild"" (kendrick lamar's characterization of his parent's 'people and community' harming lifestyle) parental figures who selfishly introduce children to a childhood of hardships and pain.  isn't it bad enough mrs. clinton chooses to ignore the plight of our nation's most valuable and precious resources being raised and nurtured by criminally negligent primary caregivers!  but then for mrs. hillary clinton to characterize these victims of an abusive and neglectful childhood as ""super predators"" when she knows why many depressed, angry teens and adults lack empathy, compassion and respect for themselves, their neighbors and the authority responsible for maintaining peace...well, this is the primary reason i have absolutely no respect for this duplicitous, disingenuous american citizen or her throngs of supporters who do not question her duplicity.  sadly, mrs. hillary rodham clinton is not alone in willfully ignoring the substantial population of american children needlessly subjected to human oppression and other indignities by irresponsible moms who had no moral or ethical right to introduce newborns, infants, toddlers, children and teens to a life of pain, hardships and struggle.  apparently mrs. clinton and her loyal supporters do not care that for more than thirty years a substantial number of locally, nationally and internationally popular american music performers of african descent have been demeaning and hating-on the maternal half of our population by characterizing in their music artistry our moms, sisters, grandmas, daughters, aunts and nieces as less than human ^itches and ^hores unworthy of respect.  in my opinion, the real and actual super predator is mrs. hillary clinton who for the sole purpose of gaining votes willfully enables a substantial population of african american teen and adult moms to continue causing great emotional harm to our nation's young during a critical period of their childhood development.  apparently mrs. clinton has no problem being a ^itch or ^hore who exploits for personal gain, american people touched by and suffering from what dr. robert k. ross believes is america's most profound and debilitating disease in today's society...childhood trauma. _____ peace &amp; prayers for julie dombo &amp; countless innocent victims of american gun violence  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dzkygdkdu  http://i.imgur.com/ogynosq.png _____ doctors ross and dietz offer insights into how our early childhood development plays a key role in determining the type of individual we mature into.  robert k. ross, md, president and ceo of the california endowment, addressed inmates at ironwood state prison offering a compelling overview of the role that exposure to childhood trauma plays in the lives of *emotionally troubled* and chronically ill american teens and adults.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscnub_kbuw  at 2:12:25 in this documentary about mafia hitman and victim of early childhood trauma/abuse, richard ""the iceman"" kuklinski, dr. park dietz explains why young richard most likely developed into a emotionally disturbed, paranoid, cruel, heartless teen and man who did not give a frig about anyone else, including his wife and kids.  https://youtu.be/qxgi72w2h7u?t=2h12m25s _____ *(ny times may 18, 2015 - rise in suicide by black children surprises researchers)*  black *(children's)* lives matter; take pride in parenting; *end our national epidemic of child abuse and neglect*; end community violence, police fear &amp; educator's frustrations  tags: julie dombo, james michael phillips, injustice, inequality, police, police integrity, police misconduct, police anxiety, police aggression, police training, child abuse, child neglect, child maltreatment, child oppression, childhood depression, criminally negligent parenting, black lives matter, maternal responsibility, gangs, drug abuse, gun violence, community violence, teen depression, teen violence, teen suicide, adult depression, educator/teacher frustration, sadness, solutions?, hillary rodham clinton, bitches and whores,",1,1,-2
197643,"hate to break it to you but i think your grandfather was probably using you as a wingman. he saw those provocatively-clad waitresses with names like ""florence"" and ""beverly"" and just had to stick his fingers in their pie. he knew using a little rosy-cheeked boy like yourself would be the perfect way to pull a little of that sweet golden girl poon. and maybe until just now, you were under the assumption that old people like your grandfather don't have sex on account of advanced age, infirmary, or saggy bits. you'd be wrong.  you see, over the past few years senior citizens have been boning each other at an unprecedented rate. science has speculated that this rise in sex among the elderly - or ""cotton-balling"" as it is now referred to in nursing homes - can be attributed to inventions like viagara as well as advances in the areas of penis pump technology and personal lubrication. whether you like it or not, old folks are doing the no pants dance like hoover was still in office only instead of a ""chicken in every pot,"" there's an old man boner that looks like an overly ripe banana in every old woman's leathery vagina. your grandfather is part of this.  i'm sure you are probably having some trouble wrapping your head around the fact that your grandfather used you to get with some sweet old ladies. maybe you can work through your emotions by visualizing just what went down between your grandfather and those waitresses. let me help you.  it all starts with a look. your grandfather eyeballs the waitress from bottom to top. sloooowly, he takes it all in: she has wide shoes to accommodate her bunions, her ankles are swollen from being on her feet to long, those enormous breasts swaying seductively to and fro, tired thighs and hips that squeezed out enough offspring to provide her 28 grandchildren (and 3 great-grandchildren), hands that are arthritic yet still capable of making a mean banana bead, a neck that has seen more pearls than tiffany's, mouth puckered from doing the duckface too much when she was younger, green eyes like the olives she inexplicably hands out to children at halloween, and hair that's silver like the tinsel on her christmas tree that stays up till march each year.   if he squints, she kind of looks like a sixty year old lauren bacall. lucky for him, he *is* squinting on account of the cataracts. he wants her like the like the lion wants the antelope, like the owl wants the field mouse, like the prairie dog wants the blueberry.   ""hey, there,"" she says to your grandfather, spitting a bit as she speaks.    ""hello, madam,"" he replies doing his best to channel clarke gable. she smiles, but is not impressed. he has a secret weapon, hough; you.   you see, no matter how old a woman might be, she will always be susceptible to the panty-removing power of a handsome kid. your grandfather knows this and has no qualms about using it to his advantage.  he takes his eyes away from hers and glances at you. she follows suit.   ""well look at this handsome young man!""  ""that's my grandson. watch out, though. he's a real ladies man!""  ""oh, my! i'll have to watch out for that one!""  ""you can try but i have to warn you, he learned from the best...""  he shoots her a wink. she would probably have blushed like a catholic nun at burning man if not for her poor circulation.  here is where i should explain your grandfather and the waitress were now using a secret language. when she said you were handsome, it meant she thought your grandfather was handsome. when he told her you were a ""ladies man,"" he was really telling her that he is more than capable of achieving an erection that would be the envy of men thirty years his junior. the waitress replying that she has to ""watch out"" for you is her way of acknowledging your grandfather's obvious desire to plant his antique rod in her ham sandwich . your grandfather implying that you learned from him is his way of telling her that he wants to show her just how well his weiner functions.  and that's it. that's all it took. there doesn't have to be anymore negotiations than that when you're both old enough to remember how happy your classmates in high school were when they found out world war i was over. the rest of the conversation and subsequent meal was pure formality.   after leaving the diner, your grandfather dropped you off at your house, went home, took a nap, and woke up in time to tidy up before the waitress came over. that actually took awhile because she drove 35 even though it was 45 or 55 most of the way.   once she arrived, your grandfather wasted no time in plying her with peach schnapps and werther's originals. the purpose of this was to hasten the removal of the fancy blouse she got on sale at fashion bug. in no time flat, he was suckling from her nipples. nipples that - after nursing all those children - now resembled dried up prunes. she couldn't feel much, but the slurping sounds your grandfather made were quite soothing, so she indulged him.  when she finally worked fingers down into his trousers, she found your grandfather's old dong was responding steady and strong, like the 55 buick her first husband had bought. some of it was because of her decades of penis-handling experience (instead of calling them the ""roaring 20's"" they should have called them the ""handjob 20's""). some credit was also due to a well-timed viagara your grandfather had taken 45 minutes prior. regardless of who caused what and in what proportion, they both knew when his hardon reached a 60 degree angle that it was time to do the horizontal charleston.   it took about fifteen minutes for them to disrobe. now fully nude, they took a moment to softly touch each other's bodies. she ran her press-on nails across the liver spots that tatooed his body. he gently stroked the varicose veins of her inner thigh. for a moment in time, they were young again.  alas, they knew they must continue. there was only about a half hour window for them to do their business. after that, she would be too cold and he would pass out from all the blood diverted to his swollen member. after slathering a generous amount of ky to their privates, your grandfather wasted no time burying his hickory stick in the moist place between her wrinkly thighs.   your grandfather held little back. he rained powerful thrusts into her again and again, each one more deep than the last. his lovemaking tested the very limits of the waitress' artificial hip. it held fast, unlike his dentures which fell out of his mouth and onto her whig.  she didn't mind. you wouldn't mind either if you knew you might be having intercourse for the last time.",1,-1,0
376361,"i agree with you so much on this. many parents have understood the messaging about how watching tv removes a child from other activities where they can learn things like language development by interacting with a caregiver. there is a lot more to this story for under 2s, which is why they recommend no tv for under 2s with limits for older kids. part of the challenge is that from an ""expert"" perspective it is pretty clear that tv and baby brains don't mix, but this is a difficult area to research so the data is more piecemeal. here are some of my takeaways. in this conversation i'm going to use the word ""baby"" to refer to under 2s.   1) human babies are born relatively immature. there are a lot of theories about why this is, but the upshot is that newborns are born with most of the brain not yet turned on. the brain rapidly comes online from back to front and from center to periphery. there are critical periods of development when certain regions come online that are use it or lose it - if you don't exercise that area of the brain, it will never develop properly.  not only are baby brains unable to process the visual information from screens, but there is data that suggests tv can interfere with the development of the visual processing and attention centers of the brain. in some infants this is thought to potentially lead to issues with attention later in life. i forget the exact timing but for a long time babies can't really make out what is happening on the screen - it's just a lot of brith light and movement.  2) babies work 24/7 to learn about how the world works. babies learn about things like causation - what happens when i drop my cup - through real world experimentation. when a baby is watching tv, things just randomly happen as the show jumps from scene to scene. babies are also learning things like speech patterns by watching mouths talk and watching the flow of a conversation from one person to another. in screens it is common to have voice overs or one person talking where another person reacts - this is very confusing to a baby.  3) babies don't learn anything from tv. kids over 2 can learn things from shows like blue's clues, especially if an adult is watching with them and helping them actively process the content. any learning a a baby gets from a similar interaction would be from what their parent brings to the interaction, not what they see/ hear on the screen. in a sense, babies learn in this interaction in spite if the tv, not because of it. we aren't talking about academic learning here either - we are talking about the developing the building blocks for the ability to do academic learning later in life.  4) the first 3 points here are data driven. this last point is something that combines my understanding of brain development in babies and watching what happens when a baby watches tv.  when you watch a baby, they are constantly moving and engaged with the world around them - they are learning fundamental truths about their physical and social environments. when you watch a baby watching tv, they are totally zoned out, for the most part. this is why some parents like tv - the baby settles down and you can easily feed them, make dinner, talk to a friend, etc. it might feel helpful in the short term but it is horrible for a baby's ability to develop normally.   i've personally observed that babies who watch more tv bring that passive look of being zoned out to social interactions and their general interactions with the world. as a parent, i want to encourage engagement, not passivity.  i have definitely seen kids sing and dance with tv, but usually this comes and goes in bursts and could have been achieved just by turning music on. i have never seen babies watch tv without spending most of the time in that zoned out state.  --  some parents say things like they leave the tv on all the time and the kid doesn't really notice. there is a lot if evidence though that persistent tv is a distraction for adults too. it interferes with normal life.  now, when a baby turns 2, there isn't some magical transition. if someone has to watch tv, it's better for a 22-month-old than a 2-month-old to watch. on the other hand, brains are still developing a lot when a little one turns 2, so any screens should be very introduced very gradually, if at all.  my take on this whole issue is that there are certain risks that i won't take. i'm one of the only moms at our playground who isn't constantly shadowing every move my son makes. i think it is important for him to push his physical and social limits. but when it comes to something like interfering with normal brain development, i just can't do it. the risks are much higher than any short term reward for our family, but then i have a lot of support. i had a girlfriend who lived far from family while get husband was deployed - it was a lot harder for her. each family needs to weigh the risks and rewards for themselves, understanding that tv viewing in babies can undermine brain development.",1,1,1

646411,"ages are tricky. especially with the way blizzard shifts the timeline in bits--they tend to compress the events of wow's expacs into one year each, up until cataclysm. years in warcraft are marked by before the dark portal, or after, with the opening of it year 0 and everything else moving from there. only a few warcraft heroes have precise ages, and some that are given precise ages get weird when time gets shuffled/compressed.  arthas was around 19 when he officially joined the silver hand in year 15. he met brand new baby anduin wrynn around the time. [the official timeline](http://wowpedia.org/timeline_%28from_official_site,_2007%29), updated in the [ultimate visual guide](http://wowpedia.org/timeline_%28ultimate_visual_guide%29), puts this on track with prince anduin being 10 when wow started. anduin's age in *the shattering* and *wolfheart* novels put him at 12 (""and a half!"") to thirteen, with *tides of war* saying he was 14. the [age portion](http://wowpedia.org/anduin_wrynn#age) of anduin's wowpedia entry states some of the issues with his aging; he ought to be 15-16 in lore now.  with the official timelines, if arthas was 19 in year 15, then he was around 31-32 during the events of *wrath*. varian is a little older; around 10 when the dark portal opened, which makes him 40 at the pandaria campaign (37ish in *wrath*). he was a few years older than arthas when he fled to lordaeron after stormwind fell in the first war, and the two teens became friends, with arthas looking up to varian. they may have adjusted varian's age a little, but 5ish years between varian and arthas sounds right from what i recall in the *arthas* novel.  jaina's trivia page puts her birth at 3 years before the dark portal, which makes her 33ish when *mists* starts. she is supposed to be just a bit younger than/almost the same age as arthas.  genn greymane is possibly over 60, maybe older (it's suggested the worgen curse keeps him healthier, though if that extends to longer lifespan isn't known yet). he was already established and long ruling gilneas by the second war (his father's reign was a long one). his marriage to mia seemed to come well after his father's death and genn's ascension to the throne. liam was a young teen when the wall was built, and if i recall the *cataclysm* worgen starting area correctly, they put 18-20ish years as how long the wall was up, and the northgate rebellion in response right after the second war, when gilneas seceded from the alliance. they didn't really seal off entirely until the third war and the scourge threat (as genn made a few trips, like seeing arthas inducted to the silver hand).  varok saurfang i can't find a good age for, but he was an established warrior when he drank the blood of mannoroth, 30-35ish years ago. his wife died prior to the portal being opened, but apparently long enough after warlock influence crept into orc society, and he hid his son away in garadar to avoid fel influence on him, at his wife's dying request.  it should be remembered that garrosh is older than thrall (despite thrall calling garrosh a 'boy' over his attitude); garrosh was a child during the red pox and quarantine in nagrand 30-35 years ago on draenor; thrall was born on azeroth after the first war, found as a baby/toddler by blackmoore after the second war (year 7, maybe), which puts thrall's birth around year 5, making him about 15-16 when he became warchief and led the orcs to durotar, if wc3 happened in year 20 (battle of hyjal in year 21). like anduin, thrall comes from a lineage of leaders and was expected to take responsibility for his people once his identity as the son of a frostwolf chief was determined. i can't recall if in the original writing of those storylines he was meant to be a little older or not, but compared to other established heroes, thrall is young; around 25ish in pandaria.  doesn't help that hybrids like garona and lantressor, and even purebred orc children, were magically aged by the warlocks before and during the first war for missions and as cannon fodder. i don't think thrall was specifically, but wonder if there was a creeping effect, like the green skin despite durotan and draka never drinking the blood themselves, or if orcs just mature faster due to the harshness of draenor. someone better versed in the rts lore and the stories surrounding it may recall better.  vol'jin was younger than usual when he took up his shadow hunter training after the darkspear were exiled, then took over leadership when his father died, joining the horde. dunno that there is a direct age quote, and some sources (though the rpgs are no longer canon, and they're the main source i know of), put trolls at having shorter lifespans than many others--though part of that is their brutal lifestyle, not biology. i thought he ""felt"" older and rather weary in his recent novel, but given the circumstances of the last few years, that's not terribly surprising, either.  elves get trickier; most of the lore figures for any flavor of elf are put at a few centuries old to begin with, keeping things very vague. night elves like the stormrage brothers, tyrande, the shadowsong siblings, and others are at least 10,000, with a little variation. shandris feathermoon is a little younger, and is tyrande's adopted daughter, but even she recalls the burning legion's arrival and the sundering as a little girl. there were children born to the night elves during the long vigil, but most of their champions are ancient. kael'thas sunstrider hesitated on his feelings for jaina due to being a few centuries older. alleria windrunner took part in the troll wars 2,800 years ago, but vereesa (youngest sister) was still a new, inexperienced ranger at the start of the second war, when sylvanas (middle sister) became ranger-general.  velen we know is more than 25,000 years old, and some other draenei recall argus, but how their lifespans work is anyone's guess. i like the idea of suspension chambers (like the one the new draenei pc comes out of in the starter zone) as a way to safely transport the population over interdimensional travel, in addition to their magic and the light expanding their lifespans. but we don't know, and hopefully learn more in wod.  that's what i could remember and find on a cursory search. most heroes' ages are kept pretty vague unless they get a part in a story taking place in their earlier years, though i think the specific attention to anduin's aging lately has been as a key way to show the progression of time in wow as the prince takes on more of a leadership role. since wrath/cata, they've made a point to mention how old anduin wrynn is in prelude novels and comics, which can date the timeframes between expacs. it also matters a little more as he is a youth and the changes that brings to him personality/maturity wise, and what they can do with him in a story, while most of the other lore figures are simply adults, either in their prime or as experienced elders.  main thing is, we've got 30 years between the dark portal first opening, and pandaria. people who were adults in the first and second war are middle aged or elderly now (if they have human-ish lifespans), while children from that time are now the prime of life adult heroes from the third war on up. blizzard is mucking less with the timeline these days, now that there's so much lore, but it's still subject to change--though i doubt by large amounts anymore.",0,,

971151,"we called them blinkers. souls older than time itself it seemed, they are too afraid of what lays beyond. they say that when you die, you meet with a judge, a decieder of sorts, of how your afterlife will go, but you have the option to be born again. every man and woman has a second chance at life, but there is one catch, every attempt to have the perfect life shortens it, almost by half, or in a more accurate sense you age at double the rate.  and you see, on the other end is me, what they call a green soul. i age at the slowest rate which means i am a new soul, i've never had a chance at reincarnation. i don't think i want to either.  i have been alive for 18 years as of yesterday, which means by law my body and mind are that of an adult, even though i've been alive long enough to see people cycle four times over. i've seen my father age into a leathery body, while my mother has long since rolled over into what i assume a new body, which would have aged even faster. i've made friends with people who have aged past their mid-life, and some are now even more ancient than my father.  but i've seen the same problem with everyone that age quickly, no one is happy.  no one is at peace.  no one knows what happens when you accept permanent death, some would rather choose endless rebirth, which usually produces wrinkled, old babies that die before they leave the womb.  how will they ever find peace if they have no chance at life?  green souls like myself are rare to come by, maybe its because there isn't enough space on earth for a new soul to fit, everyone wants a second chance.  mother's across the world hope their child isn't another leeching soul that dies before they reach their mid-life. despite being rare, though, we are still treated like we know nothing about the world, like they even remember their past lives, all they remember is a blurry figure standing in front of a scale asking the same question, whether they choose death or rebirth.  of course it seems most are afraid of death.  i've been trying to make sense of reincarnation with my best friend, chris, he's also a green soul.  he shares a similar sentiment about blinkers that i do, but he's a little nicer about it.  we both wonder why so many people choose a second life, another chance to have it perfect, when they are never happy.    chris and i were now both legal adults, we were both free from green school, where they shove basic information down your throats like you were a toddler, even though you would outlive most of your teachers by the time you graduate.  now we were able to walk free, walk around like we belong with most people, except the blinkers, who seem to have their own society about them.  of course, that was where we felt we should start, seeing as how they have the most experience with rebirth.  we started with what we knew best, a teacher who taught in our senior year who started out youthful, and is now hobbling with a cane, mr. young.  we arranged a meeting with mr. young at a local coffee shop, that seemed to be the only thing that would keep his eyes open.  after ordering our coffee and sitting together, chris started by asking ""mr. young, its great to see you again, you look *vibrant*.  we wanted to ask you your opinion on rebirth.""  mr. young leaned back and said slowly, ""i'd like to say i chose rebirth so many times to get my life just right.  to leave a perfect mark on the world.  maybe my soul in my past life liked the idea of teaching children to grow up to become great, kind people.  maybe when i face the faceless man at the end of my life i see my purpose in rebirth. truthfully though, i don't know.  i don't know what's on the other side of that man and i'm afraid.  afraid to my very core.""  most of the conversation continued into ""i don't know""s and ""what if""s, and i swear i could see mr. young, wrinkle as we talked, so i cut it short and considered him a dead end.  ""maybe the blinkers are not the right people to ask,"" i said, ""they all pick rebirth because they are afraid.""  ""let's ask my grandma, she's a second reincarnate, maybe she has some good insight,"" he said.  the only problem is his grandmother lived on the other side of the country with no way to reach her by phone.  normally it was impossible for two green souls to travel that far, but since we were both considered adults, we had a way to get there, all we needed were the funds.  normally it would be difficult, but seeing how i was the last surviving member of my family for my father, all i had to do was wait for his many timed, rebirthed body to shrivel up.  every month i waited i cursed my father for ageing but never finally passing, i was growing impatient, however chris kept reminding me, ""it's not right to say that, he has a soul just like you.""  i liked chris, he was always a good person.  i always wondered what he saw in me, why he hung around someone cynical like me.  i suppose he knew deep down he was the real reason i kept going, not killing myself and choosing death right now.  he always reminded me that there was good to do in this world, and lives to change.  he always mention how every soul was as valuable as the next.  i believed if anyone truly deserved a second chance at life, it was chris.  but we both agreed that rebirth was a cycle, a cycle that only left someone in pain and suffering, so if he died he would surely choose death.  one cold winter day, my father was in the hospital.  things were looking down for him.  chris supported me through it, even though he knew i didn't care for my father.  he would mention how nothing lasts forever, it's ok when people go.  then he looked at me and said, ""you know we won't be friends forever either, right?""  ""what do you mean?""  ""well, neither of us are going to be reborn, do you really think we will frollick through fields of poseys together when we choose death?""  this was the most pessimistic thing i've heard him say.  ""i guess i never put much thought into it, but i suppose you're right.  i mean, nothing lasts forever.""  ""you're right, nothing lasts forever, some people seem to think that it does, and those are the people who are now being born dead.  we have to make the best of the time we have,"" he said, putting his hand on my shoulder.  i don't think he ever knew how much his warmth made me feel valued.    within a few days my father passed away.  i spoke with his lawyer and collected my inheritance, and planned a small, respectful funeral.  it was the right thing to do, as i was always reminded by chris.  after spending an appropriate amount of time for my ""grieving process"", we made plans to go see chris's grandmother.  buying plane tickets, setting hotel dates, planning every step of the trip to get to her house deep in the middle of nowhere, we were making headway to what felt like the odyssey of our lives.  that was until the hardest hit i've ever felt happened.  chris was walking to get his everyday coffee, when he was shot and killed by a mugger.  he was taken by a selfish, pitiful life that only wanted to take, and he took.  he took the kindest soul i've met in my 18 years on the planet.  i was crushed, i felt alone.  my head spun and my heart sank and the only thing i could wonder was if chris chose to be reborn.  he was taken so young, surely he would have wanted a second chance, right?  surely i could meet him, and we could be best friends again.  i felt lost, and confused, and hopefull, but i knew deep down chris had chosen death, we spent every year together talking about how that is the only right way to truly live.  and i believed it, so i pushed onward.  i followed through with our planned out trip with a heavy heart.  i followed every guidline we set for ourselves, and the trip was easy enough.  i quickly found myself walking up the long gravel driveway to chris' grandmother.  i knocked on the creeky wooden door, and a kind old woman answered.  she was very old, possibly reaching the end of her life, but she was still very fit.  she wore her kindness in her smile.  she welcomed me into her warm home, ""come in, come in, dear.""  ""hello mrs. graham, how are you?  i hope you've gotten the news about chris by now,"" i mentioned as my heart skipped a beat.  ""i did, i got the letter in the mail,"" she said, her voice still chipper somehow.  ""how do you feel about that?""  ""well,"" she began slowly, ""obviously i'm sad that chris had died so young, and i hope he had gotten everything he had hoped for out of life, but ultimately i remind myself that nothing lasts forever. tell me, did he live life to his fullest?""  ""it's hard to say, mrs. graham, we had big dreams to be one of the greats one day.  be make a difference and be known by everyone.""  ""did you feel like chris was a 'great' to you?""  ""yes.""  ""then he was a great.  i'm happy to know that his life was something wonderful.  remember that, you don't need to be recognized by everyone as a great person, if you make a positive difference in one persons life, you are great.""  we spent some time together, talking more, me asking about her experience with reincarnation, and she asked me about the little things, such as what i liked and what made me happy.  i could see where chris got his good nature from.  she left me with the thought to live life while you have it, time always marches forward, nothing lasts forever.  the next few decades of  my life were an exciting blur, i lived a happy life where i could consider myself to be great.  i found a wonderful wife who i felt completed me, and she said i completed her.  we chose to enjoy life together while we had it, and spent every moment doing things we loved and trying to make a positive difference in other people's lives. it was wonderful.",0,,

[**terry richardson**](http://i.imgur.com/42cske5.jpg)  cities: skylines has an in-game version of twitter i'm so used to ignoring that i've only just now realized the richardsons must be the only ones using it. sure enough, the feed is full of their banal chirps about smoke detectors and beautiful sunrises. i'm not sure where they're seeing these sunrises: the game has no day/night cycle. maybe they're all high on bus fumes. their chirps allow me to finally locate the newest member of the family, though, terry richardson. she's in the park with nancy. she's described as a teen but she looks like a little kid. she's also playing with a stuffed animal.  [**jobs**](http://i.imgur.com/asgugy6.jpg)  ashton and katie have both graduated high school. ashton is working at the stadium with his dad, probably pressured into carrying on the family business of morosely standing around in an empty stadium. katie works at the observatory, which is much cooler. at this point, everyone pretty much has their own private bus to take to work, though katie prefers to walk.  [**and then there were four**](http://i.imgur.com/hweczoi.jpg)  i notice one day that the town's population has decreased by one. uh-oh. i check in with all the richardsons. katie is missing. like any concerned city god, i immediately check the local hospital and doctor's offices, as well as the two cemeteries. nothing. i finally realize what happened. like many young adults, katie simply moved out of her parents' home. with only one house in town, she had no choice but to move out of town completely. she's gone.  [**empty nest**](http://i.imgur.com/vfevunv.jpg)  ashton moves out soon after. time passes, and terry leaves the nest, too. i'm down to two citizens, and they're both now seniors, and retired. oscar spends his time in a park, wandering around and occasionally chirping. nancy does the same. weird thing is, they do it in two different parks, located across the street from one another.  [**parks and wreckage**](http://i.imgur.com/vjcdjis.jpg)  i'm a little bothered that they're not spending their autumn years in the same park together. did they agree to meet in the park but didn't specify which one, and they're simply both waiting for the other to arrive? or do they just not care for each other because she let the kids move away and he still smells like burnt garbage? i watch them for weeks as they mill around, just yards apart. they never return home. is the empty nest simply too painful now?  [**it tolls for she**](http://i.imgur.com/brwghxj.png)  as i'm watching nancy's park, i see a vehicle come around the corner, one i haven't seen in this city before. it's a hearse. nancy is still alive, but the mortuary seems to have gotten a hot tip. the driver, albert ward, gets out, unconcerned that he's blocking the richardson family private bus fleet. nancy is now dead. ward and his partner load her into the hearse and drive to the cemetery. this is terrible, but not the most terrible thing that will happen today. not by a long shot.  [**dazed and confused**](http://i.imgur.com/sidxqi7.png)  oscar is still standing in his park when the hearse arrives for him not much later. they load him in, as they did nancy, but he's not dead. he's alive. he's confused. i bet he is. ""what's happening? where are you taking me? my wife was supposed to meet me in the park. do you know where my wife is?"" yes. they know where his wife his.  [**oh no**](http://i.imgur.com/np6uq5z.jpg)  he's still alive in there.  [**just visiting**](http://i.imgur.com/ebinr8u.jpg)  as the hearse arrives, oscar's status changes briefly, so briefly i don't manage to get a screenshot of it. but i swear it says 'visiting: cemetery.' is that what they told him? is that how they got him in the car? ""come on, pops, we're going to visit the cemetery."" then, he's in the ground. visiting hours are over, oscar. you're now a permanent resident. at least he and his wife are in the same park for a change.  [**new beginnings**](http://i.imgur.com/gixqqmh.jpg) my chirper feed is still going off. is oscar chirping about smoke detectors from his coffin? no, it's several other people, members of a new family. they've moved into old richardson place. and why wouldn't they? great location. two parks nearby. amazing bus service. no noisy neighbors.  life goes on.",1,1,1

895556,"why does it matter? because if the delay in achieving adulthood is just a temporary aberration caused by passing social mores and economic gloom, it‚Äôs something to struggle through for now, maybe feeling a little sorry for the young people who had the misfortune to come of age in a recession. but if it‚Äôs a true life stage, we need to start rethinking our definition of normal development and to create systems of education, health care and social supports that take the new stage into account.  the network on transitions to adulthood has been issuing reports about young people since it was formed in 1999 and often ends up recommending more support for 20-somethings. but more of what, exactly? there aren‚Äôt institutions set up to serve people in this specific age range; social services from a developmental perspective tend to disappear after adolescence. but it‚Äôs possible to envision some that might address the restlessness and mobility that arnett says are typical at this stage and that might make the experimentation of ‚Äúemerging adulthood‚Äù available to more young people. how about expanding programs like city year, in which 17- to 24-year-olds from diverse backgrounds spend a year mentoring inner-city children in exchange for a stipend, health insurance, child care, cellphone service and a $5,350 education award? or a federal program in which a government-sponsored savings account is created for every newborn, to be cashed in at age 21 to support a year‚Äôs worth of travel, education or volunteer work ‚Äî a version of the ‚Äúbaby bonds‚Äù program that hillary clinton mentioned during her 2008 primary campaign? maybe we can encourage a kind of socially sanctioned ‚Äú¬≠rumspringa,‚Äù the temporary moratorium from social responsibilities some amish offer their young people to allow them to experiment before settling down. it requires only a bit of ingenuity ‚Äî as well as some societal forbearance and financial commitment ‚Äî to think of ways to expand some of the programs that now work so well for the elite, like the fulbright fellowship or the peace corps, to make the chance for temporary service and self-examination available to a wider range of young people.  a century ago, it was helpful to start thinking of adolescents as engaged in the work of growing up rather than as merely lazy or rebellious. only then could society recognize that the educational, medical, mental-health and social-service needs of this group were unique and that investing in them would have a payoff in the future. twenty-somethings are engaged in work, too, even if it looks as if they are aimless or failing to pull their weight, arnett says. but it‚Äôs a reflection of our collective attitude toward this period that we devote so few resources to keeping them solvent and granting them some measure of security.  the kind of services that might be created if emerging adulthood is accepted as a life stage can be seen during a visit to yellowbrick, a residential program in evanston, ill., that calls itself the only psychiatric treatment facility for emerging adults. ‚Äúemerging adults really do have unique developmental tasks to focus on,‚Äù said jesse viner, yellowbrick‚Äôs executive medical director. viner started yellowbrick in 2005, when he was working in a group psychiatric practice in chicago and saw the need for a different way to treat this cohort. he is a soft-spoken man who looks like an accountant and sounds like a new age prophet, peppering his conversation with phrases like ‚Äúhelping to empower their agency.‚Äù  ‚Äúagency‚Äù is a tricky concept when parents are paying the full cost of yellowbrick‚Äôs comprehensive residential program, which comes to $21,000 a month and is not always covered by insurance. staff members are aware of the paradox of encouraging a child to separate from mommy and daddy when it‚Äôs on their dime. they address it with a concept they call connected autonomy, which they define as knowing when to stand alone and when to accept help.  patients come to yellowbrick with a variety of problems: substance abuse, eating disorders, depression, anxiety or one of the more severe mental illnesses, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, that tend to appear in the late teens or early 20s. the demands of imminent independence can worsen mental-health problems or can create new ones for people who have managed up to that point to perform all the expected roles ‚Äî son or daughter, boyfriend or girlfriend, student, teammate, friend ‚Äî but get lost when schooling ends and expected roles disappear. that‚Äôs what happened to one patient who had done well at a top ivy league college until the last class of the last semester of his last year, when he finished his final paper and could not bring himself to turn it in.  the yellowbrick philosophy is that young people must meet these challenges without coddling or rescue. up to 16 patients at a time are housed in the yellowbrick residence, a four-story apartment building viner owns. they live in the apartments ‚Äî which are large, sunny and lavishly furnished ‚Äî in groups of three or four, with staff members always on hand to teach the basics of shopping, cooking, cleaning, scheduling, making commitments and showing up.  viner let me sit in on daily clinical rounds, scheduled that day for c., a young woman who had been at yellowbrick for three months. rounds are like the world‚Äôs most grueling job interview: the patient sits in front alongside her clinician ‚Äúadvocate,‚Äù and a dozen or so staff members are arrayed on couches and armchairs around the room, firing questions. c. seemed nervous but pleased with herself, frequently flashing a huge white smile. she is 22, tall and skinny, and she wore tiny denim shorts and a big t-shirt and vest. she started to fall apart during her junior year at college, plagued by binge drinking and anorexia, and in her first weeks at yellowbrick her alcohol abuse continued. most psychiatric facilities would have kicked her out after the first relapse, said dale monroe-cook, yellowbrick‚Äôs vice president of clinical operations. ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing the opposite: we want the behavior to unfold, and we want to be there in that critical moment, to work with that behavior and help the emerging adult transition to greater independence.‚Äù  the yellowbrick staff let c. face her demons and decide how to deal with them. after five relapses, c. asked the staff to take away her id so she couldn‚Äôt buy alcohol. eventually she decided to start going to meetings of alcoholics anonymous.  at her rounds in june, c. was able to report that she had been alcohol-free for 30 days. jesse viner‚Äôs wife, laura viner, who is a psychologist on staff, started to clap for her, but no one else joined in. ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on eggshells here,‚Äù gary zurawski, a clinical social worker specializing in substance abuse, confessed to c. ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know if we should congratulate you too much.‚Äù the staff was sensitive about taking away the young woman‚Äôs motivation to improve her life for her own sake, not for the sake of getting praise from someone else.  c. took the discussion about the applause in stride and told the staff she had more good news: in two days she was going to graduate. on time.",1,2,
878562,"speculation as a result of over 20 years of the federal reserve printing insane amounts of money in the hopes of preventing the depression that should have hit after 1987 and still wants to hit.  it's our monetary system, i.e. a fractional reserve, central banking system (fiat money) that is the real culprit.  paper money (our money) has never, in the history of the world, lasted more than around 37 years.  the power to create money of thin air creates economic distortions that are unsustainable in the long run.  the economy is a complex, interconnected network or spiderweb of human co-dependence in production.  fiat money and fractional reserve banking causes this economic network to become distorted, short-circuited, fragile.  capitalism is a system about the peaceful cooperation between humans.  if fraudulent aspects are introduced into the system, even if set into law by the government, cannot do anything other than cause social chaos.  the power to print money is nothing other than counterfeiting made legal.  the power to work with fractional reserve lending is nothing other than the fraudulent misappropriation of other people's money.  even if these things are supported by most intellectuals, politicians, and made into permanent laws, they are things that cause inter-human strife and disorder until they are removed once again by intelligent, fore-sighted people.  in other words, as long as the economy is ""managed"" by central authorities who think that they have the intelligence to outsmart and out-think the knowledge that is contained in the economy, i.e. billions of independent, rational economic judgments, then we will never progress as a society.  as long as people have a ""fatal conceit"", to quote hayek, they will never become enlightened.  it doesn't matter how much technology they have.  central economic planning, i.e. socialism, cannot work for mankind.  does this answer your question?",0,,

202553,"well, here is my own personal experience without fluoride(mostly).  i stopped drinking fluoridated tap water and stopped using fluoridated toothpaste starting in 1994, instead drinking purified water without fluoride being added to it.  except the small amount in food prepared with tap water when i went out to eat,  i cooked at home most of the time and used distilled water. i was lucky to live in a town with a wonderful local co-op health/grocery store that distilled their water on site and sold it for $ 0.20 per gallon because i drink a lot of water.  i also stopped using fluoridated toothpaste, but still brushed my teeth very meticulously once per day and another 1 or 2 lighter brushings also.  i had the same dentist from pre-teens until my dad's corporate insurance wouldn't cover me any longer when i turned 19.  i always had great check-ups and by 19 only had 1 major cavity repaired in a back molar and 5 smaller surface cavities in addition, so only 6 total.   i worked cash jobs most of my 20's, so no insurance = no dentist.  then in 1999, i had a job with a dental plan and went back to my old dentist.   i waited for his professional thumb's up (or down) before i informed him of my nearly 6 years (at that time) without fluoride.  he gave me his usual ""after check-up"" pat on the back: ""well, dave, as usual, i didn't see any problems and your teeth still look great.  i love it when i see one of my patients taking such good care of their teeth, for such a long time""(he asked his nurse to see when my record was created at his office and it had been almost 18 years before that day) he continued...wow, 18 years, i sure wish all my patients, especially a few in your immediate family, took care of their teeth as well as you have.""  then when i told him...i thought he would be shocked, but he just said ""well, that's great, you know, topical use of fluoride can be very useful to prevent cavities, but there are quite a few problems and no clear benefit to taking it internally.""  i am now 44 &amp; have not used fluoridated toothpaste since 1994 and i still have perfectly healthy teeth and have only had 2 additional cavities since i stopped using fluoride almost 20 years ago now.  (for the record: i was never much of a snacker or a sweet tooth kind of guy and water has always been my favorite drink and i drink an average of a 1/2 - 3/4 of a gallon per day.)  there is also the [50 reasons to oppose fluoridation](http://fluoridealert.org/articles/50-reasons/)  here are a few from the list:  **1) fluoride is the only chemical added to water for the purpose of medical treatment.**the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) classifies fluoride as a drug when used to prevent or mitigate disease (fda 2000). as a matter of basic logic, adding fluoride to water for the sole purpose of preventing tooth decay (a non-waterborne disease) is a form of medical treatment. all other water treatment chemicals are added to improve the water‚Äôs quality or safety, which fluoride does not do.   **3) the dose cannot be controlled.** once fluoride is put in the water it is impossible to control the dose each individual receives because people drink different amounts of water. being able to control the dose a patient receives is critical. some people (e.g., manual laborers, athletes, diabetics, &amp; people with kidney disease) drink substantially more water than others.   **6) fluoride is not an essential nutrient. no disease, not even tooth decay, is caused by a ‚Äúfluoride deficiency.‚Äù(nrc 1993; institute of medicine 1997, nrc 2006).** not a single biological process has been shown to require fluoride. on the contrary there is extensive evidence that fluoride can interfere with many important biological processes. fluoride interferes with numerous enzymes (waldbott 1978). in combination with aluminum, fluoride interferes with g-proteins (bigay 1985, 1987). such interactions give aluminum-fluoride complexes the potential to interfere with signals from growth factors, hormones &amp; neurotransmitters (strunecka &amp; patocka 1999; li 2003). more &amp; more studies indicate that fluoride can interfere with biochemistry in fundamental ways (barbier 2010).   **8 ) fluoride accumulates in the body.** healthy adult kidneys excrete 50 to 60% of the fluoride ingested each day (marier &amp; rose 1971). the remainder accumulates in the body, largely in calcifying tissues such as the bones &amp; pineal gland (luke 1997, 2001). infants and children excrete less fluoride from their kidneys and take up to 80% of ingested fluoride into their bones (ekstrand 1994). the fluoride concentration in bone steadily increases over a lifetime (nrc 2006).   **11) benefit is topical not systemic.** the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc, 1999, 2001) has now acknowledged that the mechanism of fluoride‚Äôs benefits are mainly topical, not systemic. there is no need whatsoever, therefore, to swallow fluoride to protect teeth. since the purported benefit of fluoride is topical, and the risks are systemic, it makes more sense to deliver the fluoride directly to the tooth in the form of toothpaste. since swallowing fluoride is unnecessary, and potentially dangerous, there is no justification for forcing people (against their will) to ingest fluoride through their water supply.   **13) fluoridation‚Äôs role in the decline of tooth decay is in serious doubt.** the largest survey ever conducted in the us (over 39,000 children from 84 communities) by the national institute of dental research showed little difference in tooth decay among children in fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities (hileman 1989). according to nidr researchers, the study found an average difference of only 0.6 dmfs (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces) in the permanent teeth of children aged 5-17 residing their entire lives in either fluoridated or unfluoridated areas (brunelle &amp; carlos, 1990). this difference is less than one tooth surface, and less than 1% of the 100+ tooth surfaces available in a child‚Äôs mouth. large surveys from three australian states have found even less of a benefit, with decay reductions ranging from 0 to 0.3 of one permanent tooth surface (spencer 1996; armfield &amp; spencer 2004). none of these studies have allowed for the possible delayed eruption of the teeth that may be caused by exposure to fluoride, for which there is some evidence (komarek 2005). a one-year delay in eruption of the permanent teeth would eliminate the very small benefit recorded in these modern studies.   **14) nih-funded study on individual fluoride ingestion and tooth decay found no significant correlation.** a multi-million dollar, u.s. national institutes of health (nih)-funded study found no significant relationship between tooth decay and fluoride intake among children. (warren 2009) this is the first time tooth decay has been investigated as a function of individual exposure (as opposed to mere residence in a fluoridated community).   **15) tooth decay is high in low-income communities that have been fluoridated for years.** despite some claims to the contrary, water fluoridation cannot prevent the oral health crises that result from rampant poverty, inadequate nutrition, and lack of access to dental care. there have been numerous reports of severe dental crises in low-income neighborhoods of us cities that have been fluoridated for over 20 years (e.g., boston, cincinnati, new york city, and pittsburgh). in addition, research has repeatedly found fluoridation to be ineffective at preventing the most serious oral health problem facing poor children, namely ‚Äúbaby bottle tooth decay,‚Äù otherwise known as early childhood caries (barnes 1992; shiboski 2003).  **17) tooth decay was coming down before fluoridation started.** modern research shows that decay rates were coming down before fluoridation was introduced in australia and new zealand and have continued to decline even after its benefits would have been maximized. (colquhoun 1997; diesendorf 1986). as the following figure indicates, many other factors are responsible for the decline of tooth decay that has been universally reported throughout the western world.   **18) the studies that launched fluoridation were methodologically flawed.** the early trials conducted between 1945 and 1955 in north america that helped to launch fluoridation, have been heavily criticized for their poor methodology and poor choice of control communities (de stefano 1954; sutton 1959, 1960, 1996; ziegelbecker 1970). according to dr. hubert arnold, a statistician from the university of california at davis, the early fluoridation trials ‚Äúare especially rich in fallacies, improper design, invalid use of statistical methods, omissions of contrary data, and just plain muddleheadedness and hebetude.‚Äù serious questions have also been raised about trendley dean‚Äôs (the father of fluoridation) famous 21-city study from 1942 (ziegelbecker 1981).   **19) children are being over-exposed to fluoride.** the fluoridation program has massively failed to achieve one of its key objectives, i.e., to lower dental decay rates while limiting the occurrence of dental fluorosis (a discoloring of tooth enamel caused by too much fluoride. the goal of the early promoters of fluoridation was to limit dental fluorosis (in its very mild form) to10% of children (nrc 1993, pp. 6-7). in 2010, however, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported that 41% of american adolescents had dental fluorosis, with 8.6% having mild fluorosis and 3.6% having either moderate or severe dental fluorosis (beltran-aguilar 2010). as the 41% prevalence figure is a national average and includes children living in fluoridated and unfluoridated areas, the fluorosis rate in fluoridated communities will obviously be higher. the british government‚Äôs york review estimated that up to 48% of children in fluoridated areas worldwide have dental fluorosis in all forms, with 12.5% having fluorosis of aesthetic concern (mcdonagh, 2000).",0,,
452805,"correct. from aristophanes, the clouds, in which he lampoons socrates as ""having his head in the clouds."" socrates was not well liked in his day by elders.  the ancient greeks were notorious for their fear of the youth. there was perpetual worry that in old age, the youth would rise up and kill the old. this fear also reflected the brutal life of greek youth, who had little or no protection from older men in particular. much of the literature and philosophy from the time reflects this fear. socrates tapped into that fear, engaging the youth in the market place, and that was one of the main charges at his trial -- corrupting the youth. the belief is that socrates was seen as fomenting a youthful rebellion, and the elders just couldn't have that, now could they.   i would say this ""fear of the young,"" why having some universal tinge, is far less universal than many popular tales tell it. for instance, the modern, progressive era in europe and america is a champion of the young, actually, with the establishment of childhood and the the various protections of the state.   as for millennials, yes, this is an old platitude about young people being lazy, but there is something different about those born after about '84. (there are disputes about when one generation begins and the other ends, but i subscribe to the belief that millennials are really post 1983. those before are really gen xers.) millennials were raised on a steady diet of naraccism supplied by their baby boomer, ""me"" generation, parents. told they could do ""anything they set their minds to,"" they were brainwashed by madison ave. with the idea that they would all be vice presidents by 30, so they should get used to buying whatever they like. of course, excluded from this brainwashing were children of immigrants and poor children of color. that latter group was told they are future criminals, so just give up now.  millennials are getting pounded by reality now, and it ain't too fun, i guess. they are growing up post-the american dream; that ended in the 1970's really, though we hid the descent with easy credit. i feel deeply sorry for anyone under 30, because life will be much more savage and raw for them. capitalism has them constantly filling a supposed hole inside them with every product under the sun. what pity.",1,0,-2

586000,"i have something to add to the theory. recently i've done some research on generations, and it can be explained through games.  from post-wwii up until 1964, we have what we call the ""baby boomer"" generation. this was the time when families had a dozen kids in the house, and might explain why so many houses today are now apartments. this generation had very little video game exposure growing up, and thus you have the stereotype that older parents and grandparents are simply not into gaming. this generation is currently retiring, which is why you see news headlines about an influx of senior citizens and not enough people to take of them.  the next generation is known as ""generation x"", who were born from 1965-1974. these people had the first video games as adolescents, and some of these parents might be into video games, while most are not.  generation y is where it gets interesting. this generation is commonly held accountable for people born between 1975 and 1994. this is a 20 year generation. so to break this generation down, we can properly call them early generation y and late generation y. early generation y had the fresh prince of bel-air. there's your glimpse. for video games they had the old nintendo and sega consoles. again, a lot of this generation may not be playing video games... but a lot of late generation y most certain do.  late generation y are the ""90's kids""; people who spent most of their childhood in the 90s. most of today's youtubers, such as mattpatt, pewdiepie, etc fall into this category. this is the generation that loved the nintendo 64. why do you think there are so many retro gamers from the 90s? i think we have our answer. :d  lgy had the nintendo 64, and later the gameboy colour and the first playstation. this might explain why both pokemon and zelda classics are so praised by 90s kids; they were at the prime age when these games were released. moving on in history, lgy spent their adolescent years in the early and mid-2000s. this is the generation that moved into xbox (halo ce/2) and the countless playstation 2 games.  when the next console generation arrived (360 and ps3), this generation was ready to hit youtube. lgy was not too young nor old to be posting videos of their gameplays. this is probably why youtube is dominated by 90s kid gamers. wait until generation z replaces them.  gz are people born from 1995-now. i was born in 1995, so i barely made it. you might disclude anybody born after 2010, but they are too young for much research (except that they will be rocket scientists because they are the first babies to use ipads!). gz and 90s kids are considered to be the generations who remember the door-knocking age that was the 90s/2000s, but also grew up with the internet (gz tends to be more savvy, i think). lgy were early majority for social media during the mid-2000s, and gz become early majority when twitter became a thing, followed by genx and baby boomers using facebook (laggards).  gz had the ps2, gamecube, xbox and gameboy advanced during childhood, followed by the xbox 360, ps3 and wii and ds during middle and high school years. this might explain why my favourite zelda game was wind waker, and why i liked pokemon diamond.  if you ever get into a discussion about who likes which halo game, know that halo ce and 2 were mostly played by 90s kids, and gz loved halo 3. if they say halo 3, they are generation z, and if they say halo ce, they are probably generation y.  everything i said about gz so far is about early generation z. there is a mid-generation z (2000-2004, because the internet made cultures develop quicker ;d). i've talked to kids who played lots of call of duty, but not halo. you see, cod became a thing when mgz started to get into video games (ages 6-12). also, while egz and lgy  played alpha minecraft and made the game popular, the game now has a stable mgz population, and i believe they are starting to age out and head into the bigger games (xbox one and ps4). i bet that in 10 years, minecraft v5.6.7 will be getting updates that make mgz tick. they would have loved the good ol' days, and to see minecraft with sci-fi stuff in their eyes might not be great. this would parallel with egz and lgy currently getting after game developers over content that leaves the status quo.  i am not sure if lgz plays minecraft. i have some cousins who are mgz and lgz and play minecraft, although more of a pastime i think.  if you view games based on their generations, there might be potential for some mindblowing information that could explain gaming struggles. you can even develop a game by targeting the lgy audience, and another game for lgz. thinking this way can totally enlighten your experience.  thanks for reading! what do you think of the theory (based on this single post, not the op)?",1,,1
467153,"in my opinion, aborion is always murder.  i don't care about people dying from ""back alley abortions""- i don't have sympathy for them.  that being said, i don't think simply outlawing it is a good response.  if we suddenly forced every pregnant woman to bear children they didn't want, there would be a lot of abused and unloved children in the world.    killing them isn't a good solution at all, and i abhor the practice, but prevention of pregnancy has to be the first priority, and i think this is the common ground on which  pro and anti abortionists can meet.  i don't have the answers, but sex ed in high school isn't enough.  you will have a hard time convincing me that any high school student really doesn't know that sex makes babies.  even by 6th grade when i got my sex ed classes i knew that much.  i don't know what can be done in this area- but i think that if more people would worry about unwanted pregnancy from this end, abortions would decrease and everyone would be happier.",1,2,-1

221567,"*the graduate* didn't connect with me in the same way that other generational youth anthems, like *ferris bueller's day off* or *american beauty* or *boyhood*, didn't. not even when i was of the target age demographic. not even when i was of the target generation.  i mean, i get that their primary function is to express the teenage search for meaning and autonomy in a society stagnated by preceence and propriety. and that maybe there is even some social value in portraying that struggle.  but my inability to care much for these films stems from several deeply rooted problems in *what they represent* and *how they were received*:  1. they are generally critically lauded. which means they are well-received by the older generation of media consumers. which means that a substantial portion of their popularity is completely unrelated to the teenage demoraphic at the time. if anything, they are successful because they *validate the older class's perception of the youth culture*, which ultimately suggests the message isn't nearly as progressive and empowering as it seems on the surface (like most entertainment media).  2. even still, my experience with these films was primarily in junior high and high school. and many of my peers enjoyed these films regardless of which generation the films in question concerned. this doesn't surprise me given that the youth rebellion genre is coincident with the development of children as a consumer market in the 50s and 60s, and it's never really about rebellion so much as media manipulation of kids' brains. making them feel like developed individuals with worthwhile opinions who deserve trinkets and status symbols and other useless property. but this then means the ""rebellious"" themes of such films are just window dressing and that they otherwise very much uphold the status quo. and furthermore, because kids are on the whole naive and suggestible, they don't really think about any of this and merely like the films because they're ""cool."" so, even popularity among the target-but-not-really demographic really doesn't assure me that this is a good genre.  3. to complicate matters, there are plenty of people of older generations who were themselves validated by these films when they were younger. *and they still attach themselves to it* even though their situations have completely changed as they grew older. perhaps compartmentalizing their experiences and refusing to grow out of your childhood is just a human thing, but it's frankly stupid as all fuck. you have had ten, twenty, thirty years to learn something about the world and feel more secure with your place in it, and you would *still* rather latch your emotions onto silly teen power-trip fantasies. pathetic.  4. and let's say that maybe it does get a lot of topical and contemporary things right. i argue that nearly all of these films really don't portray compelling lead teenage characters. because teenagers are not compelling personalities. they have no established history, no substantially tough decisions in their past, no real problems looming over their head yet. their entire conflict is summarized as ""i'm frustrated because i don't know what to do"" or ""i don't know what to do so fuck it all."" not knowing anything and not having anything is *inherently* boring. regardless of whether this validates the adult class or the youth class, it just isn't a great focus of a film. call it an extension of first world/white people problems, because there are actually plenty of interesting stories about teenagers--they just aren't in comfortable suburbs or cushy college campuses.  5. as an aside, these films are always about young love. which again, is typically not met with wizened acknowledgement of youthful folly, but instead this irrational cultural belief in the purity of childish whimsy. young love is not cute, and i'd argue it shouldn't even be wistful because rose-tinted nostalgia is nearly as bad as being flat-out wrong.  so, having thrown my thoughts on paper, i can definitively say that i still don't like *the graduate*. it's just another ambivalent product of the infantilization of america, as hollywood flails about every decade or so to push another niche that no one needs into existence. i don't even think the photography and dialogue justify the wankery of the screenplay concept.",1,-1,-2

534443,"i asked my mom (69*)[edited] and these were her replies:  ‚Ä¢ date and place of birth, parents‚Äô occupation and education, number and sex of siblings, place in birth order.  november 3rd, 1946, in norwalk, wi. my mother and father married as teenagers and had five children. two boys, three girls. i was the second oldest. dad was a bricklayer, and president of the bricklayer union, and he did not complete high school. mom was a school teacher and completed college and separate teachers certification.   ‚Ä¢ what life was like growing up (where they grew up, their house/home; games, toys, and play; work and school; friends and neighbors; fondest memories; most sad memories; historical events).  back then, babies were mostly born in the homes. now everyone uses hospitals. my family and everyone else in my small town was catholic. it was common to have sunday dinners at my grandparents house. my dad served in the navy in the war (wwii), and my parents married just before he left for duty. we were one of the first families to own an automobile on our street. favorite toy was a holly hobby doll. i remember listening to lone ranger on the radio, and we were the first family to have a television, and it was only watched after dinner as a family.  we played canasta and monopoly, and chutes and ladders. fondest memories were of barn dances and playing on an uncles farm.  we played outside a lot, and hula hoops were a big thing at the time.   the assassination of president kennedy comes to mind as a significant event, but i was already in high school by that time. also, the moon landing was just amazing and people couldn't believe it.  woodstock and the hippy culture was pretty historical. it changed the culture of the entire country.  ‚Ä¢ young adulthood (college and/or work; dating and marriage; family and children; place of residence; fondest memories; most sad memories; what was life like at this age).  when i was 19, i became pregnant with my high school boyfriend. in those days, it was unheard of to bear a child out of wedlock, so i was sent to green bay, wi for the duration of my pregnancy where i eventually gave birth and relinquished my daughter to catholic charities in 1965. that was my most painful memory, and i thought of her every day of my life since then. after that, i had a strong resentment against my father (for forcing me to do it), and i moved to tx to live with an aunt. that's something that you never really do get over. (eventually, i reunited with her in 2013, but that's another story.)  fondest memory was being able to go to california and be immersed in that culture. free love did not mean lots of sex. it was about getting along with everyone. peace, happiness, sharing, walking barefoot on the beach and just being part of a group of people where everyone accepted everyone else no matter what. everyone shared and loved each other.  ‚Ä¢ middle adulthood (children maturing and moving away; children's successes and failures; first grandchildren; changes in work, job, career; relationship with spouse; holidays, trips, and vacations; fondest memories; most sad memories; what was life like at this age).  i struggled emotionally for many years after my first pregnancy. i moved to california, worked in less than desirable jobs, and gave birth to two sons by different fathers. in 1980, i married my longtime boyfriend, and had two more daughters. we divorced less than five years later and i was still very much lost in life. my fondest memory of this time was working as an advocate for a legal aid charity. i was able to help so many people who were failed by the justice system. it was so rewarding, and led me into my current occupation, which is caring for developmentally disabled adults.  it really is true that grandchildren are god's reward for having children . it's so hard to describe how much grandchildren can mean to you. the really sad part was my oldest son not accepting my new husband when i remarried and cutting himself off for many years. (my last husband was black). i haven't had the empty nest syndrome because i still have a 22 year old son who is still home with me. i had my first child as a teenager and last child at 47. i had seven children in all, with one dying after birth from the rh factor.  ‚Ä¢ older adulthood (children and grandchildren; relationship with spouse; work, career and retirement; health; hobbies; holidays; fondest memories; most sad memories; what is life like at this age).   i'm not retired (although technically i do receive social security retirement benefits), and i still work, because i really care about my clients. i have known so many of my clients for over a decade, and i really care about them. there would be a big void in my life if i completely retired. it's nice to get paid for something you'd do for free.  about grandkids, it's almost like the grandkids take the place of your kids once they grow up. for example when my oldest granddaughter moved out, it's like you just want to treat them like you would your own kids. i always want to babysit, and be involved in their lives. saddest part is not being able to see them all the time. nowadays, my kids live in different states, and it's hard to get everyone together. when i was growing up, we didn't typically move far away from each other.  ‚Ä¢ what is it like to get older? is it good or bad or neither?  wow. all three. (laughing) it's not as bad as you think, and it seems like it happens over nite. one day it hits you that you are old, and you're grateful for not having to do things you had to do as a younger person. for example, i don't care any more about makeup or wearing stylish clothes. i have the freedom to live the way i want without caring about what people think. a bad thing would be aches and pains and arthritis, heart problems, medications, etc. you start having to spend more money on health like hearing aids, false teeth, and incontinence can be embarrassing at times, buying depends for example. it's neither good nor bad. just different.  ‚Ä¢ what does she/he consider to be the best time in her/his life?  i guess... when my first born kid that i raised was young and happy, and i was involved in advocacy for legal services and how effective i could be in making a difference.   ‚Ä¢ if she/he could change something about her/his life, what would it be?  only one, huh? (laughing) i think looking back on it with my perspective today, and the way society is today, i would never have gotten married. i think that alone would have changed my life. if i'd been a little older and wiser, i think i might not have gotten divorced the first time.  i was too young and immature at that point to know that i could have been happy with him and been free and happy.  ‚Ä¢ does your informant feel ""old?"" how old is old?  heck no! i don't feel old. i have no idea how old is old. old is how you feel i suppose. i guess i'd say 93 is old, that's how old my aunt is now, and i've never thought of her as old until recently when i noticed she's having a hard time walking. i don't know, maybe i'll know when i get there. i think it's a state of mind, not an age  ‚Ä¢ what is the best thing about getting older? what is the worst thing? already answered   ‚Ä¢ what does your informant think about society‚Äôs views of old age? in her/his opinion, how are the older adults treated in the u.s. today?  i don't think society values senior citizens at all. it's hard to get and keep a job when you're older. i think youth is valued more than age and experience. the commercial family life, everything is directed at the people just starting out and starting a family. i don't know. it seems like society treats older people like they wish they weren't here. instead of valuing the experience and wisdom. the commercial value is based on youth and appearances. no. age is not valued any more. knowledge is not valued in an older person. when i was growing up, parents and grandparents weren't sent off to an old folks home. you never ever talked back or disrespected your elders. the values that my generation was raised with is totally gone. your peers would never be friends with you if you were disrepectful to your elders. nowadays it's somehow glorified to be a rebel. when i was young, everyone did something chores like to contribute to the family life, without a toy or reward or allowance. now, it's horrible, because kids need to be paid just to help out around the house.  i think it might have something to do with the sexual normalization in the culture today. i think it contributes to a decline in the morals in our country. people of my age get embarrassed by the kotex commercials and sexual scenes in daytime television shows.   ‚Ä¢ what can be done to help the older adult population?  (laughing) raise your kids to respect their elders! what can i say. society's values have changed. back then, your kids took care of you. you died at home, and everyone wanted to do it that way. nowadays, people are not being taught the values they were taught before. the only way for senior treatment to change is for society's values to change.  if we went back to those morals, everyone would be happier.",1,1,1

(and even from an ""appeal"" basis -- i mean i was in decent shape, but i'd never been a ""team sport"" kind of guy -- tennis, swimming, wrestling {til my back got thrown out}... but i was not the ""coach"" type if you get where i am coming from -- plus i was generally more of a bookish nerd/mechanic type. people? forget it. i'm not introverted or antisocial, but i've also never been a ""group"" kind of guy.)  but 3 weeks? while the regular ""assistant leader"" was on an out of town work assignment... yeah i could probably do that (at least help keep the urchins corralled and prevent them from going ""pyro"" and torching the place anyway).  little did i know.  the kids latched onto me like flies to flypaper... and they didn't let go. (little buggers even got me to get the hs-age program going when they ""aged out"" of the junior-high one).  *keep in mind this was a different era, it was 20+ years ago -- late 1980's into the early 1990's -- long before the ""pedo-paranoia"" took root.*  (but there were starting to be ""rumblings"" near the end, and while it wasn't the reason i quit... i could see trouble brewing, and that certainly contributed to me getting out of the program: the newly hired ""mangina"" former social-worker now youth-pastor that had started and almost immediately began gossip behind my back {and i later learned a lot more extensively than i was aware at the time} that a -- by then mid-30-something -- single guy working with teen boys was ""weird""; and he especially attacked the fact that the program was ""boys only"" -- for which he had a especial hatred, since he blamed it for the failure of his first ""coed teen"" program, which the boys in my program thought was ""cheesy, childish &amp; stupid"").  so while i don't regret any of the years and effort i did put into it -- but (more's the pity) if it were now... i'd never go within 100 miles of such a program, and i would strongly caution any other male from becoming involved either.  *because yes, it has gotten that bad.*  which of course just makes the problems even more acute. kids have fewer quality male fathers and father-figures; and -- since the rational/sensible men stay away -- chances of someone with ""deviant"" motives is actually more likely to be who they get stuck with.  in some senses, it's somewhat akin to mgtow... the better/smarter men are backing off of women -- we've done the math and determined it isn't worth the risk.  but that doesn't mean women will cease having kids -- they'll find some ""sperm-squirter"" to act as their stud (they'll do the ""turkey baster"" routine from a sperm bank, or bedsome drunk pua at a bar, or if they need to they'll even go ""cougar"" fashion &amp; trick some underage teen into it.)  &gt;males are of the utmost importance as you have portrayed commendably. i applaud you sir! if i were in your position, having been called ""dad"" and ""thank you sir"", i don't believe i could hold back the tears either. you will always remember them and they will never forget you!  well it was difficult enough not to with the kids who didn't have fathers -- that just tugs on your heartstrings (frigging ""oliver!"" types -- showing up with ratty clothes, holes in socks, worn-out shoes {which you find out from their friends are their ""best"" pair, and that the reason the kid didn't show to event x was he was ashamed of his clothes etc}).  but when the other boys joined in with the ""wish you were my dad"" sentiment...   * i mean, i could even partly understand it with the brothers whose father was partly disabled (though the lack of an arm didn't seem to stop him from engaging in activities he wanted to for his own pleasure -- per example he played on the church ball team -- but he continually used it as an excuse to not do things with his sons.)  * but in a very real sense, it was the worst (hardest to bear) with the boys who had their fathers in their homes (i.e. what is called an ""intact"" nuclear family)... because that tugs on your heartstrings in an entirely different way (it's not just sadness and sympathy, but mixed with pity, disgust, outrage and anger!)  neglect imo is *nearly* (not quite, but almost) as bad as outright *abuse*.  &gt; it is extremely admirable of you to have taken such responsibilities with the youths in your life, teaching, coaching, developing. i simply cannot commend you enough here!  i didn't write it looking for attaboys; and quite frankly i disavowed the ""attaboys"" i got back then as well. (and this is events that i was involved in two decades ago.)  **i wrote it for the specific purpose i stated -- to note the need and the value of the man/father in terms of our society.**    that it is (imo *definitive* proof that) women -- even the smart, very nuturing kind -- really cannot properly parent children to adulthood.  in my experience the female gender is just generally ""out of their element"" when it comes to ""parenting"" children much past their toddler years -- and definitely not once they are past puberty -- if all kids have, or if their main parent is ""mom"" (or mom + mangina-dad) then it's a total ""crapshoot""... they're on their own (some might make it ok, but be much worse for the wear, others fall into any of a dozen different traps, or simply don't become ""adults"" at all even if they live another 50+ years -- perpetual children).  &gt;other fathers, ""begged me to stay on""""... i would have been one of them.  yeah well, **don't be so fast to say that**, it wouldn't exactly make me your fan.  and i wouldn't really appreciate the statement. because you see, my internal reaction to that was not what you might think.  in fact, it both disgusted me... and made me despair.  * it disgusted me because these men were still seeking to have someone else take the responsibility for their role. (their sons needed them to teach and lead... not an outsider.)  * it made me despair, because i had hoped they would ""step up"" and continue the program -- that they would be the fathers their sons (and in some cases daughters too) needed and wanted them to be -- and then the additional hope/prayer was that they would help father the other boys/kids in the community who had no one.  and alas, more's the pity, the ""despair"" was proven correct.  the program only continued for one more year (slowly falling apart)... and the following year the ""mangina"" leaders (who i had always had to contend with to keep a ""gender separate"" program going) managed to kill it off in favor of a ""professional-youth-pastor-led"" program that was a ""coed 'teen challenge' program"" (btw, the end result of which, was that within the next 3 years one of the boys got locked up on ""sex offense"" charges {it was even in national news, pre-romeo/juliet laws and an agressive ""feminist"" da looking to make a name for herself}, another boy got a girl pregnant while they were still in high school, and two of the others dropped out) -- the touchy-feely psycho-babble ""co-ed"" program had managed to significantly undermine just about everything i had spent 6+ years teaching (wrecked a couple of the kids parents' marriages as well, but that's another story).  because i and the leader-boys had stayed in touch (as much by their efforts as mine, so no applause please) -- i did manage to intervene in a positive way in a couple of the worst scenarios that happened after i left...   one kid who i know i literally prevented (by about 5 minutes) from committing suicide.   having been told something was wrong, i called him on that night on his cell phone... reached him when he was 50 feet from the end of the breakwater where he claims he intended to just dive in (and had he actually jumped in, he doubtless would have been done for: given that he couldn't swim, plus the time of year, water temp and the way the breakwater is situated) -- talked him back to his car, met him for a cuppa coffee... and, while it took a lot of effort over the months and years afterward, together we got him stable and on his feet (he's 36 now and doing well, got his own place about an hour drive away from me -- i still see and talk to him every few months).  **end of story: no regrets, and it taught me a lot about society** -- stuff i didn't fully comprehend previously (and/or maybe just didn't *want* to believe) -- learned a lot about just how ""insane"" (and in the end ""selfish/self-centered"") most women/mothers really are, and also just how far from the mark the vast overwhelming majority of men have fallen.  but of course i also think that the effort -- despite what i learned, and the enjoyable aspects of the experience -- the whole thing was largely futile.    *there is the remote possibility that the boys (now men) that i worked will will ""carry the ball"" to the next generation (at least with their own sons) ... but as difficult as it was for me to do that program back then, well it was nothing compared to the forces against such a thing now...*  but who knows...",1,-1,

556458,"&gt; go ahead and capitalize the word if you wish. it's just not necessary.  thank you.  i'll exercise that preference, inconsistently, i'm sure.  &gt; part of why humans believe in a deity which has never been proven real is because a great number are told to do so as impressionable children.  yes, there is undoubtedly a measure of truth to this.  the things we are taught as children often do stick with us, although i know of no adults who continue to believe in santa claus.  the matter of perpetuating our culture and beliefs is part of our human experience, and it's something practiced by all sides.  i'm sure an atheist (lower case for dramatic effect) parent is not going to give equal time to god in the mental development of his/her child.  &gt; i was thirteen before i was told by someone i trusted that i should believe a ""god"" exists.  but you were much younger than thirteen when you became aware of the concept of god.  did someone you ""trusted"" offer that god was not real?  were your beliefs in the non-existence of god shaped by that influence?  &gt; as such, i was more inclined to weigh the fluff provided as evidence from a critical point of view than, say, a child who had been dragged to church or told to believe that ""jesus"" loves her before she could read (and understand) that book of nonsense called the ""bible"" for herself.  a little further on in your response you ask, regarding a genuine discussion, ""do you really think we aren't?""  your statements like ""book of nonsense"", ""fool for a ... con job"", ""invisible father (with a penis?)"" do not lend themselves to believing you want a genuine discussion.  those statements come from a condescending arrogance that flows from pride and immaturity.  i've stated before the immature nature of your posts, while granting your clear intelligence.  if you feel the need to mock that which you don't believe, so be it, but don't complain (as you did before) if someone feeds you the same dish.  &gt; i do a bit in my stand-up act where i point out that kids learn songs like ""jesus loves the little children,"" but that if people really wanted kids to learn scripture from the beginning they'd be teaching them songs like...  it is common to mock that which we don't understand.  have you studied the milieu of those cultures?  do you understand ""how"" things were during those times?  things that ""made sense"" a hundred years ago, don't now.  and a hundred years from now your actions may well befuddle the average citizen.  but arrogance will evaluate all men of all times and all cultures by its own limited standards.  &gt; insecurity and other issues also lead people to believe, or at least pretend to believe, in a deity. however, to paraphrase an old quote, just because many people think a ""god"" exists is not proof that one does.  and just because some people believe he does not exist does not mean he does not exist.  &gt; how old were you when you were first told to believe in a ""god?"" were you taught critical thinking before believing an invisible father (with a penis?) in the sky loves you?  like every other human in existence, i was exposed to the concept of god at a young age.  however, as a self-avowed atheist through high school, i argued much like you do now.  i converted to christianity midway through college.  &gt; i'm not trivializing the subject at all.  yes, you are, but your tact in the matter is justifiable in your mind.  that provides hints as to why you harbor such animosity toward god.  &gt; it is a fact that many religious believers find it necessary to convert (or, in some cases, kill) all who do not believe as they do. if you could be christian without attempting to convert one single person to your way of thinking, i would have no problem with your religion.  convenient perception ... and meaningless.  if you believe that god is real and all men need a savior, then it would be unloving not to share the truth with them.  where many christians go wrong is in using unacceptable tactics in trying to get others to accept the truth.  it's one thing to share the truth with someone else, it's quite another (and wrong) to use coercion and unfounded fear.  &gt; the sad fact is, the writers of the ""bible"" knew damn well they'd better tell followers what to do, even going as far as to instruct adherents to indoctrinate impressionable children well before their intellects developed, or there'd be less tithing in their futures.  again, you reveal much about your hatred of god.  no doubt there are churches that are overly concerned with finances, but then again that's a reflection of human nature, not the underlying truth of christianity.  the bible does not advocate an emphasis on money.  in fact, the concept of tithing is not really one reiterated in the n.t.  it was a principle in the o.t., but again that was a product of where cultures were at the time.  in the n.t. the principle of giving is that one is to give as the want ... a cheerful giver ... anything else is not wanted.  &gt; you know very well it's much harder, if it's possible at all, to convince a person who was raised secularly (not necessarily to abhor religion, but just lacking its direct influence) to join a specific sect or cult, than it is to take advantage of a mind already taught to believe in some kind of ""god.""  no, i don't know very well.  i do know that it's harder to convince a person who was raised with an animosity toward religion to accept it, but i rather imagine that a person raised neutrally would be as likely to believe in god as not.  after all, the subject of god drives right at the very heart of existence ... why do we exist? does life have meaning? is there more? etc.  these are thoughts that resonate in the heart and mind of most people.  &gt; no clearer example of that is the difference between my sister and i. i am two years older than her. when we were visiting our grandparents some summers as kids, grandmother took her to church on sundays. being older and more interested in staying at home with grandpa about, i didn't go. now, my sister's been pentecostal, jehovah's witness, and who knows what else at this point, and is cramming her children's heads with religious nonsense as well.  your sister is searching for meaning in a way that doesn't make sense to you.  how sad that you judge her so completely, and consider her so intellectually inept that she is ""merely"" the product of a misguided grandmother.  &gt; however, only two times in my life when i was quite despondent for various reasons, i tried, sincerely, to accept the concept that a ""god"" exists. (by the way, no points for guessing i find it abhorrent that religious adherents attempt to and often do take advantage of people at times of duress or distress.) reason always snapped me back into place soon afterward.  people often do uncharacteristic things under stress.  while stress ""may"" drive paradigm changing, ""eureka"" moments for us, most of the time all of us go back to what lies deepest in our hearts in the aftermath.  you could no more ""try"" sincerely to believe in god than i could ""try"" sincerely not to believe in god.  one has to make a conscious decision to accept/reject something, and then act on that new belief/disbelief in faith in order to effect change.  faith is a choice, not a certainty.  &gt; if christians stopped pretending that their ""faith"" is based on reality, i would stop confronting them regarding the fictional nature of their beliefs.   how magnanimous of you!  have you ever really considered the deep arrogance of that statement?  &gt; you ask why i'm here, but i'm pretty sure i've made it bloody obvious at this point. i'm tired of watching religion addle minds with false promises, limit humanity's intellectual progress, and incite horrific acts of bigotry, sexism, and violence.  you don't ""know"" that the promises are false. christians have been at the forefront of scientific progress throughout history. horrific acts of bigotry, sexism, and violence are characteristic of humanity in general ... regardless of whether or not religion has been involved.  only someone willfully ignorant of history would deny this.  &gt; the less people in our part of the world give credence to nonsense, the less likely people who believe their ""god"" wants them to kill everyone who doesn't agree with them will be given even the slightest modicum of tolerance -- whether by inference, denial, or direct support.  this statement is irrational.  christians do not want, because of christianity, to kill anyone.  &gt; i understand that you think i'm uncomfortable with my observation that no deity exists. you're just plain wrong. what you need to think about is the fact that a person who engages in confronting religious adherents (especially one who has been doing it semi-regularly as i have) has to be very secure with his position to do so effectively. i've been atheist for four decades but have only been seriously attempting to make the world a better place by pointing out to people that they're suckers for the oldest lie in the world for about three years.  evangelism at its finest!  whatever has happened to you to foment such hatred is ultimately something you have to deal with yourself.  and it is undoubtedly something intensely personal ... that's fine, and knowing that your personal jihad is borne of emotion and passion makes your responses more understandable.  and the truth is we're all so much the product of what happens to us.  it's a rare thing for anyone, of either persuasion, to break free from those defining influences.",1,-1,-1
367721,"well, that's a nice sentiment, but entirely out of touch with reality.  what you're suggesting is the total contradiction of a core philosophy of training soldiers.  recruits are broken down and rebuilt to follow orders.  that is the basis of the entire culture.  anyone who goes in the service and thinks they can pick and choose what they do is perfectly delusional.  never mind the implications of mass mutiny and military revolt.    you're either really naive or stone cold crazy.  there's reasonable disagreement and then there's your position.  do you realize you just proved all the dumb right-wingers right?

401390,"its not silly or redundant, kids have a hard time saying some words like bathroom and toilet and will appropriate their own version of it anyway.  what parents are doing is just sort of standardizing the versions of it by using terms known to be easy for young toddlers to say somewhat clearly and quickly. and some parents like to steer kids away from talking about the bodily function itself with 'pee/wee' or 'poop.'   it does not mean they will not learn the proper words - they will gravitate to using them when they realize that theyre using a baby word, usually around the time they can properly pronounce things.  if they aren't saying 'potty' theyre most likely saying a mangled version of bathroom like baffroom or bahhrumm.     there's plenty of studies showing that babble and repetitive speech by parents to babies (young prelingual babies) is very beneficial in their development of speech listening and most all cultures do it to their infants.  i have a 3 month old and i'm 100% deaf yet i still babble to him instinctively.  it develops focus on phonemes, syllabic meter, rhythm, gives them something easy to imitate and makes them know you are talking to them rather than just to another adult, which is good for piquing their interest so they stay focused on the sounds - ah gooo ba booo is a lot more interesting to an infant than 'hi baby how are you?""  babies also have a short attention span and get cranky without a bit of novelty, and babble or motherese allows for a wide range of novel speech for babies.  talking to kids 100% with adult speech only will get the job done, sure all language exposure will do something for the kid... but really getting down into the kid's own level and working from their language perspective can really make a difference in true understanding.  my daughter began signing at 9 months, said her first words around 11-12 months and  had an 80+ word vocabulary of clearly signed or spoken words by 16 months, and was making 3 word sentences easily.   we used a ton of babble or baby talk with her gradually improving our own approach as she showed mastery.   another thing that kids need is for you to simplify your language down to mere basics when they are having a tantrum.  their brains literally cannot process it when they are in meltdown mode.  repeating the same few words will get you across to them a lot faster than letting loose a stream of verbage at them.  their brains shut down and regress to an earlier model of speech, its pretty interesting to note it once you understand this phenomenon.  so if you have a 2 yr old having a meltdown because mom stepped outside to run to get something out of the car, you shouldn't yap at them ""oh just be patient mom is coming right back she went to the car its fine youll see shes just right outside ok, dont worry, why dont you play""   but rather ""mom went to car. coming back. mom went to the car, car, car, coming back, back back, mom will be back, went to car"" or something simple like that in repetition and their brain that is seized up in a panic will have an easier time processing what you are saying.    children are not little people with an adult brain in a small body.  they have immature brains, and they will benefit from approaches that work with their brains.",1,2,2
654388,"&gt; ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get started‚Äô   &gt; it‚Äôs been 5 years since her debut as 2ne1, and gong minzy has just entered her life as a 20 year old. she is now ready to enjoy her youth more than anybody else ‚Äì photographed by zoo yong gyun  &gt; people have seen gong minzy since she was fifteen years old. and those who were a bit more interested in 2ne1 would have been able to watch her elementary school auditions or pictures of her during her trainee days floating around the internet as well. with her round face, short hair reaching only to the bottom of her ears, and a baby-face ‚Äì the elasticity and flexibility to dance skillfully was a definite plus that gave her the nickname ‚Äúdance prodigy‚Äù, along with the fact that the great madam gong okjin of korea‚Äôs traditional dance culture was her great aunt. stepping into the world of society at an earlier age than most others, she was able to spend her teenage years as a mature and faithful girl by fulfilling her dream career. and on january 1st, 2013 at 12:00am, she became an official 20 year-old adult.  &gt; while waiting for her teenage years (which limited her from doing many things that only adults are allowed to do) to pass, she made a surprisingly simple list of what she wanted to do the moment she became an adult. when all her friends ran to the nearest bar or pub to experience the ‚Äúchicken &amp; beer‚Äù ceremony most people do the moment they become legalized adults, minzy, on the other hand, pointed out all the things she wanted to do on the new year‚Äôs stage performances in celebration of her ‚Äúadultification‚Äù. although alcohol was still a bit far from the top of her to-do list, she listed that she wants to become more daring and bold on stage and that she wants to get her driver‚Äôs license and haul a ‚Äòhummer‚Äô around. she wants to go on a trip and even finish studying in school. since becoming an adult isn‚Äôt as easy and fast as changing into different outfits, she‚Äôs decided to take one step at a time into the new world. just like she has been doing all along.and just like that, gong minzy began to change, as well as stay as her same self.  &gt; q: it was your birthday not long ago. were you able to spend it a bit more special than other times? a: i didn‚Äôt have anything scheduled for work that day, nor did i have a party with friends. i just went to the aquarium with my family. i usually can‚Äôt go out that often. when i do end up going out with my family to have a meal once in a while, due to all the people who look back and stare at me, i feel a sadness, kind of like an animal that is trapped inside a zoo. but because it was my birthday and i couldn‚Äôt just stay home all day, we went out for a bit and it ended up not being so bad after all, i had a fun time. i saw a shark for the first time and had a big laugh comparing the aquarium‚Äôs blue water color to my own hair color saying it was like apetetic coloring. it was as if i had returned to my childhood. to be honest it was an extremely normal day, which is what made it an extra special memory for me.  &gt; q: are you in the midst of working on a new album? a: we‚Äôre unsure if it will be in the format of a full album or not, but we‚Äôve entered the early stages of a comeback. until today, we made most of our songs based on dance music genre. however this time, we worked hard to try to showcase our ballad skills and a different side to our talent, but we were able to add a more diverse genre on top of it all. although i cannot speak of it any much more, i really want to try a new choreography concept that steps out of our usual style. for the longest time now, ceo yang hyunsuk had laid out a strict command that i am not allowed to do sexy dancing due to my being underage. but technically, i‚Äôm now allowed to do so if i wanted (laughs). it‚Äôs one of the few things i‚Äôve always wanted to do the moment i turned 20.  &gt; q: the other members tend to do many solo activities, but have you ever considered any specific artists that you wanted to collaborate with? a: usher! i wanted 2ne1 to become more widely known and popular until the day we will be able to stand on the same stage with usher. i really enjoy hip hop. lately i‚Äôve really been into asap rocky. his music really matches my taste and most of all, he‚Äôs cool and awesome. usher, asap rocky, they‚Äôre all my ideal men.  &gt; q: with lee hayi having passed &lt;kpopstar&gt; and joining yg, there has been a increasingly large amount of juniors within the company, hasn‚Äôt there? a: i thought to myself that i am finally no longer the ‚Äúmaknae‚Äù (of the company). (laughs) there are even a lot of new trainee juniors as well. honestly, it‚Äôs pretty difficult to see or run into them (trainees) that often since our recording studio and dance studios are on different floors. but whenever i get the chance to meet them i want to give them as much advice possible as i can give and care for them in my best of my ability. even now it‚Äôs still the same, but when we (2ne1) were trainees, the only female senior we had in our company was gummy unni. our members and i had to stick together all the time. that‚Äôs why we want to be there for our juniors who dream of debuting. because i am now an ‚Äúunni‚Äù to them as well.  &gt; q: members like park bom and sandara park are ten years older than you. i‚Äôm curious how you get along with them. a: those two unnies are such pranksters. they have a lot of curiousity and they love to prank and play a lot. they‚Äôre rather more like friends to me and the way they treat me like their own friend and how they still care for me like older sisters ‚Äì they‚Äôre very reliable. i‚Äôm not a ‚Äúmaknae‚Äù with a lot of ‚Äúaegyo‚Äù (cuteness). i‚Äôm not very good at talking about affectionate or tender things and i‚Äôm also not very good at showing my affection towards my members as well. that‚Äôs why there was a time when i wrote a letter to dara unni. it didn‚Äôt say much, either, but i guess she was very touched by it ‚Äì for my birthday she bought me a red purse and wrote a response letter back to me. it said, ‚Äúyou are now an adult. i can‚Äôt believe it. *cries*‚Äù they saw me since i was in 6th grade elementary school, so i think they felt a sudden change and difference in me this past birthday. cl unni got me the new iphone 5 since i was using the previous model of it. bom unni, hmm, she said she would buy me something soon. she was probably very busy. i understand, unni (laughs). not just for materialistic things, but i rely on them (members) for emotional and mental needs as well. because we‚Äôve all been together for such a long time, we know how to respect each other in every way. which things we need to understand and which parts we need to fill for them that they cannot do themselves. we fill each other up.  &gt; q: what kind of person is the gong minzy that the other members always talk about? a: the nickname the members gave me was ‚Äútelephone pole‚Äù. they said the reason being is because i have such a reliable and dependable personality that no matter when they look back or turn to me, i‚Äôm always standing in the same spot for them. on the other hand, they tell me my flaws as well. whenever i hear a bad evaluation, criticism, or anything i don‚Äôt want to hear, i pout my lips instantly. they advise me to become more dignified and brave in those situations.  &gt; q: you must be very busy with all the crammed schedules, but judging by your twitter updates, it seems like you often enjoy making your own clothes and drawing. a: i‚Äôm the type that can‚Äôt stay very still. it‚Äôs to the point that if i‚Äôm at home and have nothing to do, i‚Äôll start doing household chores and cleaning the whole place up to be satisfied. but lately, i‚Äôve fallen in love with the fun in making my own clothes and wearing them. i can‚Äôt do the sewing myself, but there is a fabric market i visited in japan while promoting where you can buy your own fabric and materials and draw out your own designs, having them shipped to a manufacturing factory that can sew it for you. i always do the finishing detailed touches; i‚Äôve already made three outfits. i‚Äôve even worn them on television before. i feel the most proud and honored when our stylist oppas ask me which famous brand i bought them from.  &gt; q: many of your friends who are the same age as you are just now beginning to find a path or career course. there is a high possibility that they are envious of you since you have already found your career and have been so successful. a: my friends have personally told me that they are envious of me before. because all i had to do was easily dig a small well at such a young age to get to where i am now already. compared to others i was able to discover what i wanted to do at an early age and the environment around me supported and helped me make it possible, so i‚Äôm very thankful for that. yet because of my promotions as a singer, i missed my junior high retreat and was not able to proceed onto high school, which disappoints me. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôve been preparing for my ged (high school qualification/diploma exam). now that i am 20 years old and many restrictions and limitations have been abolished, i feel like i can attempt many more things now. i can dance as much as i want, write and draw as much as i wish, and at the same time find my true self. whatever or however i do it, i want to express myself in the most honest way possible.  &gt; q: any words or advice you‚Äôd like to give &lt;marie claire&gt; for turning the same age as you? a: since we‚Äôre the same age, may i speak comfortably (informally)? first off, congrats on becoming 20 years old. just like me. after being in the running as &lt;marie claire&gt; for the last 20 years now, i feel like this is just the beginning. we, should be, friends (laughs).",1,2,
644295,"my exmother, her oldest sister and their mother are strongest on the drama, weird conversation habit and refusing to accept that their words and actions have consequences. said exgrandmother and oldest sister are also fundamentalists. the hardcore young earth creationist kind. my exaunt was actually in therapy because her youngest child is gay. she knew my excousins partner and liked her well enough... until she knew that my cousin ""lived in sin"" with her. the other three kids of my aunt were two boy and another girl. the oldest boy is very sensitive and was abused emotionally for it by his father (my exuncle-in-law). both males are also fundamentalists and my cousin has forgiven his father even tho he never owned up and guess what? thats why i obviously have to do the same... the elder of the two females is the spoiled princess and likely has npd.  what has helped me a lot so far is to read up on complex ptsd. i recognised myself in the symptoms and drew the conclusion from there that i must have been abused emotionally. i come complete with all the memory loss and emotional flashbacks that i seem to be constantly in and a suffocating emotional numbness. the 4 trauma responses by pete walker (explained on his website, unsure if its alright to post the link, better err on the side of caution) were very illuminating for me. i by myself am mostly freeze and with other people i relate either as flight or fawn. no fight in me, absolutely no anger, no compass of what is acceptable and what isnt, no connection to myself to know what feels hurtful and what doesnt. all sacrificed to make the eternally unhappy happy. spoiler: sacrifice was in vain...  growing up my exfather simply had no use for children. he was the one to push unprotected intercourse when my mother was on painkillers from a broken leg. thus the pill didnt work and apparently when my exfather wants sex the pesky little consequence of the possible creation of a human is no skin off his back. my exparents are presumably still married but he left my exmother largely alone to deal with us. hes been in freeze around us mostly. i only entered his radar when i did something he didnt approve of. his punishment for that was usually more silence but he has trained me well to hear the screaming disapproval. i was 3 when i realised he wasnt a nice man and stopped trusting him. its one of my few clear memories.  another pair of clear memories: deciding against suicide at early school age. in hindsight i can put into words that i thought it would make the people who hurt me too happy. the attention and pity one would get from that... and deciding against running away from home at age 12ish because i wasnt sure if a different life as an unprotected minor would be better. i still dont regret any of these decisions.  my exmother kept yammering about how she was a late mother for a socialist state which i think is her way to not acknowledge she was actually very young, immature for her age, inexperienced and didnt even know who to turn to for help. she would often lash out physically in helplessness at both of us kids when we were small and did normal little kids mess ups. she would also complain to everyone who would listen about how we asked for punishment. in hindsight i wonder how many people heard how things werent good for us and didnt or couldnt help. id have given organs and commited serious crimes for someone, anyone to explain to me what went on.  my paternal exgrandmother might fit best into the npd mold. obsessed with what other people think of her to the point that she completely erases any personality in herself and those close to her to fit her perceived ideal of what people do not talk about. shes a flight type to a point when i cant watch her run around all the time without getting motion sickness. so much for old and sedate... her husband is also on the autistic spectrum and latched onto her arbitrary rules of how to behave to have a compass in this world. enabling her to not confront his anxiety and deal with it.  my maternal grandparents are divorced, my grandfather must have been so abusive that even in my delusional family it didnt fly. my exgrandmother caught him cheating. divorce made her a pariah to her christian fundamentalist congregation and being christian made her a pariah to the state. apparently my exmother was bullied by the teacher in class for being christian.  i can see in all of these people how they came to be who they are. how at some point killing ones emotions and being frankly and cruel unsupportive selfish little brat was in their best interest. i dont think they have no empathy as many here claim their family doesnt have. (not saying your folks do or do not have empathy, you all be the judge of that. just talking about mine here and comparing to your accounts.) i think having empathy is hurtful for my family. they look back on a few decades of treating people like feces and i think for them its a life or death decision. in their paranoid warped perception its some kind of war which you loose as soon as you are not fighting your corner tooth and nails. i find it academically astounding how someone can twist their own perception of say a crying toddler into something so sinister but this is their reality. and acting on their reality they turned family life into an actual war. you actually do loose in a way as soon as you display empathy. you have to deal with your own shitty past and seeing as you will stop fighting your corner everyone else will pounce. you cant develop coping mechanisms that way. in way this is what happend to me all my ""child""hood. i deluded myself into thinking this was a normal happy childhood and kept acting as if my exfamily were reasonable people while taking attack after attack. and since i didnt fight back i was a good target for the attacks.  well no more. it must be terribly complicated to deal with your favourite boxing sack just walking out of the door in its own after 2 decades. and since this has to be a world where everyone is out to get everyone the reasons i gave them for being terminally reluctant to deal with them have to be either a vicious attack on them or not the real reason. they oscillate between these two oh so finely crafted theories. the point i am at atm is that this is all their perspective. i find it very hard to not just take their views at face value even knowing all the things about npd and their sick paranoia. sometimes i wonder if they are just happy to perpetually have drama in the family to feed off, because this is all they know. all of them grew up this way.   i still look at myself as the weird one for wanting more normality and i have no idea how to achieve it. for now im working on feeling things again. over the last year i felt relaxed a few times, content once and recently i think i tapped into my true sadness for the first time ever. im so very good at fooling everyone including myself. i was always whoever the other person needed. for the fundamentalists i was a fundamentalist (i have a degree in evolutionary biology), for my sick superficial paternal grandmother i just took her rants and listened. i just cant do superficial and that level of judgementalism. with christianity it made a shred of sense because there was some sort of rule book to follow (which i of course did mindlessly). for my princess cousin i was the side kick (i got to be somewhat of a kid that way, yay me... and a counselor who of course accepted my cousin write me during my therapy stints which i guess i told her of that only people with no friends seek psychologists for help of course). i have a strong acting talent from all the contortions that i did. i just wish i knew how to play me. i wish i could write another brilliant thesis and this time just research what needs to be done to fix this mess and be done with this but this isnt science. its funny how attending university with undiagnosed autism and while mostly still in contact with my abusive exfamily was the easy part.",1,-1,-2

the adult cherishes and esteems his sexual virility. rather than continuous conditioning from infancy on, we practice discontinuous conditioning as far as sexual development is concerned. the ""sexless"" child is expected to revise his attitudes toward his body and its erotic-genital potential almost totally as he passes from child to adult roles. this is especially true of the male, for we expect aggressive behavior from adult males. hence, adult activity demands traits that are interdicted in children. all too often, the child's natural curiosity in the area of sex is discouraged, inhibited, and denied by well-meaning but ill-advised parents. the infant is not permitted to explore sex matters as he is permitted to explore other areas in which he has potential and curiosity. the child's interest in the naked body is labeled indecent, questions are put off, false or silly answers are given to serious inquiries. all this serves to drive normal and natural sexual curiosity into secrecy, duplicity, and despair.  &gt;nevertheless, some children discover, one way and another, that they can produce pleasant and soothing sensations by stroking or touching their bodies. the taboo on self-discovery and self-stimulation may be the chief channel through which sexual repression is passed from parent to child. there is no evidence that self-stimulation does physical damage to the child. masturbation is an important phase of sex maturing--a part of the growing up process and not a dangerous habit.  &gt;besides being permissive towards self-discovery and development, parents and others could do much better than they are doing in helping the child to conceptualize his body, its parts, and its functions. there is no reason to encourage children to form infantile, over-simplified, and incorrect sexual concepts through offering them false, deceptive, inadequate, and foolish information about sexuality. children have the capacity to deal with accurate sexual concepts. the parent who is doing his best to give his child an opportunity to understand himself, to express himself, and to share in the normal experiences of intimate human life, is making a significant contribution to the humanness, the health, and the happiness of his child.  &gt;hopefully, self-discovery, the touching and caressing by parents, siblings, and peers, and the release from feelings of sexual guilt and shame over the expression of innocent and honest affection will lead to richer interpersonal relationships.  and to show that no harm comes from kids having sex and that it's just a cultural thing:  &gt;coitus or attempted coitus does take place among preadolescents in american society, although such behavior is generally taboo. there are societies that are considerably more permissive. sexual life begins in earnest among the trobrianders at six to eight years for girls and ten to twelve for boys. sex play includes masturbation, oral stimulation of the genitals of the same and opposite sex, and heterosexual copulation. at any time a couple may retire to the bush, the bachelors' hut, an isolated yam house, or any convenient place and there engage in prolonged sexual play. among the ila-speaking peoples of africa this age is regarded as a time of preparation for adult life and mature sexual functions. it is reported that there are no virgins among these people after the age of ten. the lepcha of india believe that girls will not mature without the benefit of sexual intercourse. (ford and beach, 1951, p. 191). early sex play among boys and girls characteristically involves many forms of mutual masturbation and usually ends in attempted copulation. by the time they are eleven and twelve years old, most girls regularly engage in sexual intercourse.  &gt;ramsey (1943) reports that the preadolescent sexual encounters of boys with girls in his united states' sample (when they did occur) most frequently involved manual manipulation associated with direct observation of each other's body. exhibitionistic sex play was the next most frequent type of behavior. other forms of play included attempts at intercourse and oral contacts. approximately 33 percent of the boys reportedly had attempted intercourse before adolescence. the frequency of preadolescent heterosexual encounters of various kinds as reported by 286 of the boys was as follows:  &gt; no experience	34%  &gt; 1 to 5 times	27%  &gt; 6 to 15 times	15%  &gt; 16 to 25 times	8%  &gt; 26 to 50 times	7%  &gt; above 50 times 9%  &gt;the number of different females involved with each boy in the preadolescent heterosexual encounters were reported as follows:  &gt; no experience	34%  &gt; 1 to 5 females	47%  &gt; 6 to 15 females	9%  &gt; 16 to 25 females	5%  &gt; 26 to 50 females	3%  &gt; more than 50 females	3%  &gt; (ramsey, 1943, p. 227)  &gt;the ages of the female partners of the preadolescent boys who participated in such encounters were in 80 percent of the cases within one year of the same age as that of the boy; in 11 percent of the cases the girls were two or more years older; and for the remaining 9 percent the partners were two or more years younger. the girls involved were usually neighborhood friends, female relatives, girls met during family visits, females of the same family, and occasionally an older girl or woman.  &gt;""probably one of the most significant factors in forming my sexual attitudes and actions was an instance with my cousin when he was twelve and i was nine. one day he, whom i admired more than anyone in the whole world, and i were playing on the bed when everyone else was out. in the course of our play we began to explore each other's bodies and to manipulate each other's genitals. this made us both a little uneasy, so we quit after a while and went into the living room. then one day we found ourselves playing in the basement on the bed. he asked me if i had ever been ""fucked"" before. i said no. then he said that it was really important that every boy be able to say that he had ""fucked"" a girl and would it be all right if he ""fucked"" me.""  this is an example of the way society views it and the psychological damage it can cause on kids doing something completely natural:  &gt;""we both had reached the ripe old age of twelve.... sexual experimentation was not new to me, nor to him.... we both left our houses that evening after dark and met secretly at the ""swamp road."" we kissed for awhile and both of us became increasingly excited. this led, in turn, to the unfastening of our clothes and the placement of his hand on my breast. gradually his little hand crept downwards, beneath my pants until he was gently stroking my mons veneris and clitoris. he wanted to ""finger"" me but i resisted firmly, as a girl had to draw the line somewhere! now he posed a rather surprising question. he wanted ""me"" to touch ""him."" he exposed his erect little penis and pulled my hand toward it. at the thought of touching it i trembled, but managed to do so. i think i was the first girl in seventh grade to actually ""feel out"" a boy as this was previously unheard of. we continued to mutually masturbate for a while and then i decided that it was time for me to go home. the significance of this encounter lies in the fact that for the first time, one of my common childhood sexual experiences had suddenly become really sexual and the action was tinged with my first feelings of guilt. i suffered a great deal following this incident for fear of losing my reputation.""  there are also a lot of examples from ancient rome, and even among some celebrities: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia_eliza_clemm_poe  the idea that children are not sexual, do not understand sex, or cannot consent to sex is a modern myth.  i'd rather not post photographs of fetuses masturbating, you can look that up on your own.",1,1,-2
941870,"i meant to reply as soon as i got home from work after you sent this, but i totally forgot!  i'm in school and i work full time, so this just fell out of my brain.  &gt; it is of course obvious that the fetus can't be anything other than a human organism, but at that point in its development it is virtually the same as the fetus of any other mammal.  i don't know if i understand how it's ""virtually the same as any other mammal.""  it is a human being fetus.  it shares some characteristics with other mammal fetuses, but grown people share some characteristics with other grown mammals.  a human fetus doesn't *look* much different from a gorilla fetus, for example, but i can't imagine that look can be a major deciding factor in whether you're allowed to kill someone.  i guess i'm confused about what you mean by ""virtually the same.""  they aren't the same species, as we've agreed.  what are the other factors that make a human fetus ""virtually the same"" as another mammalian fetus?  why are those factors more important than species when it comes to determining whether it's ok to kill a human fetus?  &gt; per the child being a ""a young human being below the age of puberty or below the legal age of majority"", i do think you and i both would agree that calling a single-celled zygote a child would be at best misleading.  ""child"" does tend to bring to mind a larger kid, true.  however, child can also mean offspring, and that definition definitely fits.  i generally say ""tiny baby"" or something instead of child when i'm talking about people who haven't been born yet.  &gt; &gt; what is it about the three month mark that makes you think it might start being a child? what particular development or ability tips it over the edge from ""fertilized egg"" to ""person""?  &gt; the very same thing that tips a person over the scale from ""middle-aged"" into ""old"". it's not a one single factor, it's not as though there is a legally defined age at which one stops being middle-aged. it's rather a combination of many different factors which taken together influences how we see and classify people.  i think you are exactly right.  i think that the change from zygote, to embryo, to fetus, infant, toddler, etc. are all incremental steps that are all part of living and growing.  that's why i don't understand the first trimester distinction.  if the difference between a first trimester baby and a second trimester baby are just matters of size and development, why would it be ok to kill one but not the other?  a second trimester baby is less developed and smaller than a third trimester baby, so why the 3 month cut off?  &gt; there is the aspect of development,   we continue to develop for huge parts of our lives.  i'm 24, and apparently my brain won't be fully developed for another year.  that doesn't make it more ok to kill me now than next year.  &gt; there is the aspect of viability outside the womb,   this changes with science.  if science is one day able to keep a first trimester baby alive (as they very well might), will this change the first trimester rule?  if so, why is the morality of killing someone dependent on how far science has progressed?  &gt; there is the aspect of size (yes, it is part of the equation, though far from the only factor),   i don't really see how size could be a factor, except that it might be easier to have an abortion when the baby is smaller.  why else would size be a factor?  i have a really short father, but i think he is just as valuable as a tall person.  &gt; there is the aspect of sentience and of a brain being developed enough to even feel pain (something that does not happen before the 24th week, or 6 months into pregnancy),   what if they gave a second trimester baby an anesthetic before an abortion?  would that make it more ok?  there are also some people who are unable to feel pain.  it's a very rare disability, but it's happened.  is it more ok to kill those people?  i really don't think that killing someone is morally ok because the victim can't feel it.  it certainly makes it easier for us to be comfortable with, because the little baby doesn't even feel it.     &gt; and the fact that the earlier in pregnancy one is, the less of a 'person' the child is and the more of a clump of cells it is.  i don't think that's a fact.  all living things are ""clumps of cells.""  that's what we're all made of.  i get the sense (correct me if i'm wrong) that the difference you see between the ""clump of cells"" and a more developed fetus is that the latter looks more like a baby.  women might not even know they're pregnant until well into the first trimester.  that first sonogram doesn't really look like anything.  the mom doesn't feel any kicking, and she doesn't need maternity clothes.  it just doesn't feel like there's a baby yet.  i don't want to sound like i'm being condescending, it's just the impression i'm getting.  please tell me if i'm reading this wrong.  &gt; it may sound cruel, but there is a cost/benefit analysis to be made, and like with many projects, if one does not intend to carry a project through to completion, then it is usually better to cut one's losses sooner rather than later, and to try again at a later date. parents who want kids but who become pregnant at a bad time during their life (pregnancy threatens studies, career, ability to create a stable and economically sufficient environment to raise a kid) might have an abortion, but they will have a kid later regardless. in that sense there will be a child, it's just a question of it being more convenient to have the child later.  i'm not sure i get what you're saying here.  if i got pregnant now, knowing that i still need to finish up grad school and start my career, and i chose to get an abortion, the my child's life would be terminated.  if i then ended up getting pregnant and keeping the baby 5 years down the road, that's not the same child.  in this scenario, i am the mother to two children, one dead and one alive.  i didn't put motherhood on pause until i was in a better situation.   it isn't that ""in that sense there will be a child.""  there are two children.  getting an abortion isn't the same thing as putting off building that shed until you have more time.  once a woman is pregnant, there is already a baby.  you can't set a zygote aside until you have the time for it.  the only option is to kill that baby and then get pregnant again later.  is school, career, etc. a good enough reason to kill someone? remember, if the mom can't or doesn't want to raise the baby, she can give him up for adoption.  so, in this ""cost/benefit analysis"" the cost is pregnancy, birth, figuring out adoption stuff, taking time off work or missing some school when recovering from birth.  the benefit is that you don't actively kill a baby.  it seems clear to me.  it also seems crazy that anyone is even allowed to make this cost/benefit analysis.  in most other situations, you aren't allowed to take killing someone into your decision making.   &gt; there is the question of post-birth abortion, as in ending the life of young babies, but at that point, once all the work and hassle of pregnancy and giving birth has been gone through, it would be better to give the baby for adoption (assuming the adoption system won't have the kid either adopted into a bad family or raised in under-funded orphanages) than to kill it, because at that point the baby has achieved bodily autonomy. the baby is no longer dependent on the mother, and the baby's bodily autonomy should not be violated. prior to birth, the baby does not have bodily autonomy, it depends on its mother, and her bodily autonomy is also violated if she does not want to be pregnant.  this ties into what you said before.  if abortion is all about a cost/benefit analysis, once the baby is born there is less of a cost to keeping them alive.  so yeah, that makes perfect sense that you would be ok with killing a pre-born baby but not a born one.  however, i don't believe that you really think think that the only reason it's baby to kill infants is that it's easier to not kill them.  i think you believe its just morally wrong to kill infants.  in terms of ""bodily autonomy"" i really don't think babies have much.  if a newborn baby isn't cuddled, held, or gets skin-to-skin contact he often ""fails to thrive"" and dies.  babies who don't get a lot of contact with another body often don't survive.  they aren't autonomous.  they need other bodies to survive.  never mind the fact that they can't feed themselves, hold up their own heads, or keep from soiling themselves.  newborns are completely dependent on other people, usually mom.  infants don't make their own medical decisions.  they don't make choices about their bodies.  parents, guardians, or the state decide these things for babies.  &gt; so in the end, you don't object to the method of abortion so much as you object to the abortion itself, correct?  i object to people intentionally killing babies.  if a woman doesn't realize the risks, or doesn't know she's pregnant, and goes scuba diving or something and it causes a miscarriage, it's sad, but she's not a murderer.  the example you gave was just trying to find a loophole.  if you know for sure that the action you're choosing to perform will result in the immediate or close to immediate death of a baby, that's bad.  &gt; why the distinction [between killing people and animals]?  well, people are capable of reason and love.  people have souls.  i am a person, and so are most of my friends. it is deeply ingrained the the consciences of people in every society that it is wrong to kill people.  the same is not true for animals.   i said you seem to be smart and nice because it's true!  i firmly believe what i believe about abortion, and i enjoy talking with people who disagree because i want to know why they think what they think.  usually i don't learn much and it's pretty unpleasant.  talking with you hasn't been like that.",1,1,1

793474,"i think they will be loving and provide a good environment (with help), but i also think that someone else could do a better job of raising this child. people are on waiting-lists for years to adopt children in this country, and i just don't think that two 17-year-olds can provide a very stable environment that would be ideal for raising a child. having known several teenage mothers (and the fathers almost never stick around for long), i just don't think it's the best situation.  as for college, it is hard unless someone else (probably grandparents) is doing most of the child-rearing. or maybe if you study something easy and take many years to do it. i know i didn't have that much free time in college (and i didn't drink). i also know that babies take a lot of time and energy. if they're actually going to raise this baby themselves, these kids' lives are basically over, or at least very complicated.  i guess what i find most disturbing is that these kids weren't given a choice. there's no support for contraception and abortion was not an option. now this girl has to keep the baby and raise it so that her mom can make a political point and parade her around as a symbol of her religious zealotry. i don't think it's fair to the soon-to-be parents or the baby itself.",1,1,-1
149414,"it works for both a girl and a boy. that's double the goodness of your ordinary name!  imagine this, your son - streetlamp le moose - classy motherfucker. he turns 5, starts going to preschool - the fisrt day, his teacher is doing roll call and gets to his name. she looks up, creases her brow and reads again, sure that she made a mistake. 'streetlamp?' she says. her brow still furrowed, looking around at the collection of eager kids cross-legged at her feet.  enter, mr streetlamp, is he wearing a sesame street shirt? no. he's wearing a shirt, tie too - he looks at the teacher and says 'yes miss?' - classy. the whole class is looking at him now, admiring his fashion sense, his awesome name, his doubley good name. the rest of them - their name is only good for a girl or a boy, but for both - this kid surely must be a god.  'oh my, mr streetlamp,' the teacher will say, 'you sure have a unique name.'  'i'm a unique guy,' he'll reply. turning to the cutie decked out in her floral dress next to him and shooting her a wink.  fade to black.  third grade, streetlamp starts making ripples through his primary school. people have a problem? streetlamp will sort them. lost a ball? streetlamp has got your back. skip rope gone missing? streetlamp got you.  he's earning the admiration and respect of those in the years above him, and soon enough, he's becoming this local legend - streetlamp, the man that gets things done. his unique, amazing name has pushed him to be a unique, amazing gentleman - kind hearted - check, brave - check, athletic - check, intelligent - you betcha.  his reputation precedes him, the kids graduating that year are going to go to their middle schools, and the legend of streetlamp le moose will spread further. the kid that's unstoppable. the classy motherfucker that does what's right, and does it well.  seventh grade - time to start middle school. hormones start to kick in. by now, there are some overdeveloped dickish guys teasing him. you know what streetlamp does? he doesn't fight back, he doesn't wage warfare against them, he just grins. every night he runs, every night he works out - his muscles are starting to develop - his facial structure, impeccable. he's beautiful.  the bullies aren't caring though - they're just continuously ripping into him, day after day. so what do you do when you're pushed, repeatedly, snap? not streetlamp. streetlamp waits until they're seperated from one another, approaching and befriending each one on their own. gets to know them, finds out that the bigger one - george, he's secretly in love with this girl, and been trying to rip on streetlamp because he's a baller and the girls love him, trying to prove that he's more attractive by bullying him.  so streetlamp, the good guy that he is, goes and approaches the girl, starts talking george up, telling her what a great guy he is really. soon enough, they're going on a date - the kind of cheesy date that 7th graders go on, that trip to the movies where they gingerly hold hands half way into the movie and she blushes and his breath increases in pace, nerves racing, heart pumping with such ferocity.  fastforward, streetlamp the freshman (fresh man) - his rep has spread through the highschool already. you remember that cute girl in the floral from preschool? yeah, she goes to the same one. she's developed pretty well - looking beautiful. first day of class, the teacher's doing roll call, she looks at the list, furrows her brow - looking up. she lowers her head, reading again. 'streetlamp... le moose?' she says.  he looks up from the discussion he's having with one of the buddies that he'd made through george - talking about cologne or something like that - 'yes miss,' he says. he looks around, catching the eye of floral girl - winking at her once again.  she giggles - blushing.  they start dating a few weeks later, her names abigail, it's a good relationship - he treats her well, not needy - not clingy, but just enough attention for her to feel loved, for her to spread the rumour that he's an amazing boyfriend, and an amazing guy.  junior year, streetlamp and abigail have broken up - it was mutual. it wasn't because there were problems in the relationship, floral girl just started thinking that they should see other people, she didn't feel like she was good enough for him. he always treated her so well, and she'd never dated a guy before. it was feeling too serious, and she didn't want to get serious so soon.  streetlamp? he didn't mind, he made sure they remained friends - they still eat lunch together most days, take the same classes and talk a lot. he started playing football, quarterback - coach is saying that his ap calc and physics classes are really helping him with his arch, and his ap classes in ancient history have made him a master strategist.  nobody quite knows how he does it - 8 ap classes in junior year while being the quarterback of the #7 ranked team in the country. he practices incessantly, studies even more. it should take it's toll on his health, but it doesn't, he stays on top of it all.  by now, the whole school knows who he is, and there's a non stop stream of sophmores and juniors approaching him in the hallway asking if he wants to come to this or that party. he's the sweetheart of the school, and the sort of boy that every girl in the school fantasises about. george? linebacker on the team, best buddies by now - him and the girl dated for a while but it's well and truly over now.  enter friday night; house party in the suburbs. streetlamp rocks up with buddies late, 10 or 11 at night. everyone is well and truly drunk. a huge cheer erupts when they walk in - he's handed a beer as soon as he enters. he offers it to george - he doesn't drink, his mind is his best instrument, he doesn't want to damage it.  senior's hanging by the staircase, she's wearing an olive miniskirt and one of those ripped tees. her hard body, tightly encased. 'hi streetlamp,' she says.  'well hi there.'  'you want to come upstairs with me?'  fade to black.  senior year, streetlamp and abigail have drifted apart.  he's dating the tightbody. she's 18 months older, going to college nearby. he thought there might be some issue due to her being college, him senior year, but no such issue. he was a local hero by now - the football team was speculated to be #1 in the country this year with him as the qb - schools all over the country were scouting him.  people latched onto her to be friends by association, she filters all the ones that aren't good people - she's good like that. he's studying pretty hard, and training too - it's a big year for him. he spends half his time at the college taking classes, the other half is at the school, a few classes being taken, but the majority spent devising new plays for the football team.  he's turned into a natural born leader.  he goes out to one of the girlfriends college parties. while he's there, he gets introduced to this girl - amber. now, amber isn't what he's used to - the girls that surround him are the typical preppy 'forever 21' shoppig silicon clones of one another. amber though, she was witty, dry, ironic and twisted.  they become friends, no romantic inclinations. the girlfriend gets worried. streetlamp tells her not to, streetlamp only has loving enough for one girl - and that's her.  few weeks later, amber and streetlamp are becoming pretty tight - amber reveals she's a lesbian. streetlamp, being the classy motherfucker/good guy that he is doesn't care. instead, he puts some feelers out and finds a few girls around her age that he thinks she'll like.  he sets up a few blind dates. the first one, didn't go so well - they didn't get along. the second, it seemed to go great, but amber wasn't a fan. she's getting pretty distant with him, he asks her what's up - she reveals she actually is in love with tightbody.  dilemma.  streetlamp le moose, being deserving of the good guy name, sets up the threesome. amber gets to live out her desires, tightbody gets to experience the typical lesbian phase in college, and he sits back.  the news of his sexual prowess spreads. tightbody ends up falling for amber, and they start dating. streetlamp le moose, angry? nope. he's happy for them. he's proud.  graduation. valedictorian, #1 football team in the country, accepted a place at stanford doing pre-law. he gives his speech and talks about his life, how he's been empowered and how he's lucky to have such a loving and caring family. how his dad is his hero. he starts crying - he doesn't hide it. he keeps his chin up and lets the tears roll down his face as he tells them about all that his mother and father gave up for him, how they taught him to be the person that he is today.  a lot of people are crying along with him.  after the ceremony, the principal shakes his hand, telling him that it's the finest speech that he has ever heard.  he throws a party that night, he asks his mother and father to stay home and celebrate with him. he's still not drinking, but he lets everyone around him drink. nobody gets too wasted out of mutual respect for him.  the doorbell rings. one of his buddies starts to get up to answer it.  'no, dude, relax! have a good time,' streetlamp says.  he opens the door and who's there; floral.  his voice catches in his throat, he stammers for a second, 'h-hi,' he manages to spit out. he's never been tongue tied around a girl before. she's got long auburn hair now, it goes past her shoulders, and she's wearing a floral print dress.  'nice dress, i haven't seen you in one like that since...' his thought trailed.  'since preschool, i know.'  she smiled at him.  second year of college, starting qb of the stanford cardinal.  he's got a passing rating of 176.4 over the season. his coach says that he's really become a leader in the team. a lot of the pro teams are looking at him, he's being pressured into declaring for the draft. it's a dilemma, streetlamp loves football, but he also loves learning.  he's sharp witted in his law classes; topping the yeargroup. he's been asked by his professors to help ta'ing some of the first year classes. they're pretty boring; he didn't really enjoy them the first time around, but streetlamp has never been one to turn down an opportunity.  first day as a ta - introduction to corporate law. he turns up about 20 minutes early and takes a seat in the third row back. he's always wanted to pull the cliched 'talk to student, make comments about the lecturer, walk up and become lecturer' move. he sits down next to a girl - cropped brunette hair spiked up at the back, a biker jacket on.  'well, you're a rare sight in a class like this,' he says, turning to her.  she turns to him, grinning. 'streetlamp?'  'abigail? i hardly recognised you.'  she laughed, 'it's been an interesting year.'  'i can tell.'  a middle aged man walked in, heading down the stairs towards the front of the stage.  'you're taking first year law?' she asked.  'something like that.'  the man took the podium, scanning the students. 'ah, streetlamp, just who i wanted to see. get on up here,' he says - the attention of the whole lecture theatre suddenly on him.  that year, him and abigail get close again, friends - they talk most nights. it turns out their dorms aren't that far away from each other. turns out that she'd gotten into pre-med at harvard, but dropped out during her first semester. she'd taken to goign out every night, partying hard enough to make most college students envious.  she'd changed. she was no longer a sweet girl, but she was an amazing one. she never acted like an idiot around him, or sucked up to him, or tried to be cute - she was just who she was.  as the year progressed, the football season wore on. they were going undefeated in their division. two other teams were undefeated too though, it was uncertain whether or not they'd go to the bcs. when they were selected, there was an uproar. everyone just presumed it was because of streetlamp that they'd gotten through.  that year, they win the bcs.  third year, last year of pre-law.  abigail and streetlamp start dating. the coach of the cardinal's didn't like it to begin with. there was a lot of conflict - he thought that she was bad for him, that she was dangerous. the cropped spikey hair and leather she always wore - even in the dead of summer didn't help streetlamp's case.  it was a tuesday night that the sparks truly flew. streetlamp was sitting in coach's office, a combination of mahogany and red lush carpet (coach had been given a raise after the bcs championship).  'it isn't acceptable streetlamp. i can't have my star athlete going around dating somebody like that. it isn't just about you anymore. it's about your career, it's about the public perception, it's about our fans and the teams that are scouting you - that want you. is it really worth risking all of that for -' he paused, a look of disgust on his face, 'her?'  'quite frankly coach,' he said, staring him straight in the eyes, 'i couldn't care less. i try to always do what's right, and to always be honest, and that's what i'm going to do now. abigail is the girl that i care about, that i love, her appearance be damned. she is the single most kind, caring, intelligent and brilliant girl that i have ever met, and if you were to ask me to give up either her or football. well, i'd have to have a long think about that.'  'boy, i've been where you are before. i've cared for, god damn - i've loved girls with more of me than i care to admit, but this is your future. this is the rest of your life. she isn't the type that you marry. she's the type that you fuck for a few years, spend your fortune on and then leaves you for your best buddy.' he inhaled, tearing up a little bit, 'i just don't want to see you hurt by her streetlamp.'  'i understand coach, but you have to understand me. i've known her for most of my life, i've trusted her with all that i am, and she hasn't betrayed me. sure, we have rough patches, we drift apart sometimes, but we always come back. we. always. come. back. football is one thing coach, but a life without the girl that i love - that's something completely different.'  they sat in silence for a little while. coach staring at his desk and streetlamp, at his lap.  streetlamp's voice croaked as he started to speak again; 'if you're asking me to choose between football and the love of my life, you know the answer.'  that season, they went undefeated again with streetlamp starting every single game. his passing rating sat on 192.1 for the season, and the speculation surrounding his decision at the end of the year was making the news every single night.  a lot of the pro teams have been flying out their coaches to talk to him. he's not sure. he's conflicted; ambivalent.  it was late on a friday that he decided to seek advice. he called his father; the rock of his life. the man that had always been there for him, loved and cared for him. the man that would give up everything for his son's happiness.  'son,' his father had said, 'you've always loved football, but you've always loved helping people too. i think that's the quality that i most admire in you. you're a special kid, the best son that a father can hope for, and one that i'm so very proud of.' streetlamp could hear his father crying now, 'i don't know what decision you'll make, but i know you, and i know that whatever decision you come to is going to be the right one.'  draft day 2032.  streetlamp is paraded across the stage along with the rest of the speculated top draft picks. he wears a nice suit with a plain white shirt underneath and a crisp dark tie. just looking at him, you can tell that behind those eyes lurks an incredible intellect.  the introductory proceedings stretch on for half an hour, but finally, they're backstage again. streetlamp sighs, his nerves holding his chest in a vice.  'it's going to be fine honey.' she says, hugging him tight to her chest.  'i know. it's just. wow.'  'who would've thought, hey?'  'who would've thought.'  'i always knew, i read a story about you once,' said his father, joking to relieve the tension. 'best god damn story ever written.'  streetlamp laughed. 'that's ridiculous.'  'loosened you up though, didn't it?'  'sure did.'  there was a short silence. streetlamp rubbed his eyes.  'did you get much sleep last night?' his mother asked.  'not enough.' streetlamp said, 'the nerves, y'no.'  'first pick, i'm telling you son. la jaguars - your new home.'  the introductions are done - the elderly peyton manning stands in front of thousands of fans - millions watching live at home.  'the first pick of the 2032 draft goes to the la jaguars.'  a tense minute passes. streetlamp watches the action on a small tv in the backstage area - a camera up in his face.  another minute passes. he starts to panic. abigail clutches his hand. staring at her, he can't help but smile. over the last year, she'd traded her cropped hair for a longer style, and her leather in for sweaters and blouses. she never did say why, but he suspected that word got back to her about his confrontation with the coach. he'd asked, but she just denied.  '... and with the first pick of the 2032 nfl draft, the la jaguars pick... streetlamp le moose!'  his jaw drops, exhaling deeply, his eyes wide open. his mother and father are jumping up and down screaming, abigail is clutching on to him tighter than ever. 'you did it,' she says, 'you did it.'  the day after, the contract had been drawn up, including the special circumstances. the news story broke that night 'streetlamp le moose - signed for $47 million over 7 years. reported to also be attending law school as well.'  he's taking the degree externally.  he'd told his father the day before the signing. he'd been accepted to yale.  2036  he hesitated briefly, enough time for a grin to stretch ear to ear.  'i do.'  'you may now kiss the bride.'  with that, he removed the veil from over abigails face. she smiled back at him. her hair was well past her shoulders now, and stuck a little to the veil. he wiped it off, tucking it behind her ear.  'i love you, you know.'  she smiled 'i know.'  in that moment, during that kiss, he felt like he'd never kissed a girl before, like this was the beginning of a lot of firsts.  he slipped the ring onto her finger, it was simple - plain. white gold with an inlay of diamonds.  she slipped his on, plain gold. it contrasted beautifully with the 2 over-designed superbowl rings on his right hand.  the same year, he stood in front the graduation class of yale law school.  'i don't know very many of you,' he said, 'and that's a shame. i don't doubt that you're all wonderful people, and it pains me to have not had the opportunity to meet and spend time with you all. we have all had a tough few years, struggling through corporate law and the intricacies of civil procedure, but, we made it.""  'today,"" he started, staring out at the crowd 'we stand not students, but lawyers. we stand as the guardians of justice. we stand as the defenders of good. we stand as the people that can make a physical, tangible change to the world for the better.'  'i want to tell you all a story. in middle school, i fell in love with a girl. i ran into her again in my second year of pre-law. she didn't look like she used to, or act like the person she once was, but love doesn't discriminate.'  'i had to make on of the hardest decisions of my life that year. my coach asked me to choose between playing football and being with the person that i love. he asked me to choose because of how she looked, of how she was perceived, of the person that he believed that she was judging only on the superficial. i chose her.'  'that day, it struck me, there's a lot of people in this world that judge and believe based solely off the superficial. there are a lot of people that don't care to take the time to get to know somebody, to care for them and understand them. i ask everybody here today to remember this, and hold it as tightly as i do.'  'it is our job now to fight for people who can't fight anymore, it is not our job to judge them for how they got there. it is our job to create permanent, lasting change - not to make our world appear better, to make it actually better.'  'i would like to leave you today with a quote; ‚Äúthe real judges of your character aren't your neighbors, your relatives, or even the people you play bridge with. the folks who really know you are waiters, waitresses, and clerks.""'  'thankyou.'  2041  his office overlooked the field. deep, white lines punctuated the lush grass. 'ever going to upgrade to astroturf sir?' streetlamp asked.  the franchise owner laughed. it was a deep laugh, jolly even - he was the type of man that could make a child believe there was santa for a few more years. 'i can't stand the stuff,' he said, 'if it's not real, it can't be good.'  'ah, i'm a bit the same, i've been almost too careful since chair came along.'  'chair? your son right?'  'yes sir. chair de'burlap.'  'interesting name. strong name.' he said, his brow creased, nodding. 'you think he's going to become a legendary quarterback like his father?'  streetlamp laughed, 'i'm not a legend yet sir.'  the owner, suddenly taking a stern tone, 'son, you will be after you sign this. you do understand what this makes you, right?'  'the highest paid quarterback in the league?'  'the highest paid quarterback in the league.' he shook his head. 'what're you going to do with all that money?'  'good sir, i'm going to do good.'  'i'm sure you will son.'  that night, streetlamp picked up his phone. he went to speeddial and pressed 1. his fathers voice met him on the other end of the line.  'hey dad,' he said.  'streetlamp! how're you going? how's chair?'  'we're good dad. i signed the new contract today.'  'i saw - it's all over the news. $180 million, it's a lot of money.'  'that it is.'  'any plans for what you're going to do with it?'  'i'm opening my own charity. i've been doing a bit of pro-bono work with sexually assaulted women,' he paused, 'these women dad. they're broken. they're violated and they're broken. it's like somebody has reached inside and stolen all that is theirs. removed any safety in their life.'  he paused.  his father remained silent on the other end of the line. he knew by now when streetlamp just needed to compose his thoughts.  'i can't make it all better for them dad, but i can try to help them.'  'that's very noble.'  'it's just the right thing to do.'  'you always do the right thing.'  streetlamp heard the doorknob jiggle, and watched as abigail got home.  'hey babe, good day?' she'd shed the baby weight amazingly quick.  'it was great, i'm just on the phone with dad.'  'tell him i say hi.'  'will do.'  'was that abi?' streetlamp's dad asked.  'sure was. she says hi.'  'i'll let you go then. tell her i say hi back.'  'okay, bye dad. i love you.'  'love you too son.'  streetlamp leaned back in the chair. his head throbbing.  'i saw the news,' said abigail.  'it's hard not to now-a-days.'  '$180 million is a lot of money.'  'i know.'  'how much are you pledging to the charity.'  'i wanted to talk to you about that. i was thinking...' his sentence trailed off.  'yes?'  'i was thinking i'd pledge $170 million. if you're okay with that.'  'i'm more than okay. i'm proud of you.'  2046:  'breaking news: jaguars' star quarterback streetlamp le moose has called a press conference.'  abigail stood opposite him, adjusting his tie. 'are you sure you want to do this?'  'i've never been more sure.'  'but, you love football.'  'i love my family more. last week was too close for comfort, i can't lose you. i can't leave you to look after chair and annie alone.'  'you're a good father.'  'you're the best mother.'  she smiled at him, and pecked him on the lips.  a thin blonde woman pokes her head out from the corridor, 'mr streetlamp, sir. are you ready?'  'yes, i am jessie.'  he reached into his pocket, making sure that his palm cards were there. adjusted his suit jacket, inhaled and exhaled exactly once and walked out, making his way on stage.  'and here he is, moving surprisingly well considering last weeks accident,' said one news reporter.  'he's spent the last week flanked by reports that he's injured and unable to play for the rest of the season, looking at him now, i feel confident in speculating that those reports are false.' another said.  taking the lecturn, streetlamp sighed, pulling out his palm cards and scanning the first one before he began speaking.  'ladies and gentleman, reporters, sportsfans, the american public, today, i stand in front of you with two things to tell you. it is with great sadness that i must announce my retirement from the nfl.'  a wave of frenzied whispers crashed over the crowd.  'last week, as you all know, i was on the recieving end of a high tackle, and as i'm sure you all know, it rendered me unconscious. funnily enough, it was being knocked unconcious that woke me up to the fact that i'm no longer a young man. i'm not in the same athletic shape as i once was.'  'i'm not going to lie to you, it was scary for me. i have an amazing son, chair de'burlap, who's starting preschool this year, and the most beautiful daughter any man could hope for. i could not bear to lose either one of them, or have them grow up without a father.'  'my father was the lynchpin of my childhood, really, he's still the lynchpin of my life now. he is the most caring, passionate, loving person in my life, mark my mother, and i don't think i'd be one tenth of the person i am today if it wasn't for him.'  'i've been blessed with an amazing career, and a team full of the best people i could ever hope to meet, and i apologise to them for putting them in this position. i'm sorry, but my family will always come first. marcus delroy is a brilliant quarterback, and i'm sure the team will be more than safe with him.'  'i've achieved a lot of things over the last few years. i've opened my own charity, i've defended the rights of women who couldn't afford defending, i've raised money for cancer awareness and for lower-income neighbourhoods. i've always had the desire to make the world a better place, and i've always aspired to live up to this desire. it is with this in mind that i make my second announcement.'  he looked down at his cards, breathing in and out deeply, 'in the next election, i will be running as governor of california. thankyou.' he walked off stage.  2056: 'ladies and gentleman,' streetlamp said, his voice poised, his back straight, 'i would like to thank you all for your ongoing support over the last two years. i would like to thank you all for your faith in me, and for the faith in my party.'  'today,' he paused, 'today is the beginning of a new day. the start of a new people. we have experienced economic hardship, political insecurity, civil unrest and abuse of powers in this century, and i am proud to say that i will the be the one to bring an end to this.'  an eruption of applause encapsulated the room.  'the united states was once a great country. it was once a nation that stood for the very fundamental rights of freedom, liberty and justice. it pains me, as an american, that our fine country was sullied by the irresponsible and reckless actions of a minority put in a position of power, and i'm sure it pains you too.'  'i ran in this election to give a voice to the people that have never had a voice. to restore the country to a place that judged not on what is presented superficially, but on the quality of their ideas, the strength of their convictions, and on the greatness of their character.'  'citizens of the united states, citizens of the world, today, we have made the first step towards a tangible change for the better. we have made the first step to the enablement of our people. we have made the first step towards restoring our country to the greatness that it once was.'  'i am thankful, and i am grateful to all who voted for me. i look forward to creating a better country, and creating a better world.'  with that, streetlamp existed the stage. abigail waited in the wings for him, embracing him she whispered seductively 'hello mr. president.'  he smiled at her, chuckling, 'hello, first lady,'  this is what happens if you call your son streetlamp le moose. are you really going to deprive him of that?",1,2,

950472,"three stories. they're long and sad. i'm sorry.   the first one has a happy-ish ending though!  background for reference: i'm a small female medic. (it's relevant.) my husband is a medic/ff, and my mother is an ems dispatcher.   the first story is personal, not necessarily professional. and it's the most recent.   my grandfather had been battling with cancer for a long time. he passed away in june of this year, but not before he gave me away at my wedding last september. we all had the sick feeling that we knew this would be his last holidays, and made it special. they lived out of state, we went very often to see them.   late may, i found out i was pregnant. yay! i'm not supposed to have kids, (long story in itself), so husband and i were terrified, but over the moon. we made plans to go to my grandparent's farm a few weeks later for their 54th wedding anniversary, my birthday, and my papaw's birthday with other family flying in from out of state. (all the celebrations were all in the first two weeks of june.) baby is healthy, my grandfather is slipping slowly away on hospice. it hurt to see the first man i ever loved wasting away, his mind going just as fast as his body. i'm in emergency services, i see this on a weekly basis. my husband and i sat down with him in his little bed in the living room, and talked to him as much as he could manage while i helped him eat his dinner. i got this sick feeling in my belly, but i attributed it to morning sickness. i just knew that this trip was going to be the last trip i saw him alive. the doctors were saying he could make it until christmas this year, but i could see from my experience and the heart-wrenching feeling i had... it wasn't going to happen. in a moment of ""clarity"", my papaw put his hand on my belly, and said, ""he's going to grow up and be a good man."" ..we didn't know the gender, it was too early for that. i smiled and laughed, and we had our last little ""moment"" together as grandfather and granddaughter. i asked that if he was a boy, (everyone in my family is convinced it's a girl, even me) if i could name my son after him. he got the biggest, most genuine smile on his face, and for a minute, i forgot he was literally dying in front of me. he said, ""well of course, but he's gotta know how to fish. teach him like i taught you.""  my gut feeling and premonition was right. he passed away in his sleep not even two weeks later, and two weeks after his funeral, i found out i'm having a baby boy. my papaw knew. my grandmother and mother cried when i told them my son's name. i'm 27 weeks along now, and i swear that i still smell my papaw's cologne when i go to the doctor for my checkups. the baby is healthy and strong. i'm not religious, and it might be psychosomatic, but it warms my heart. i'm glad i listened to my gut and got to spend the last few days of clarity with him that he had.   another time i was on a run-of-the-mill 911 call. my partner and i weren't that great in terms of getting along, but as long as it didn't affect patient care, it didn't bother me. we hadn't ran that much on this particular day, and we were going for a nausea/vomiting x3 days call. fairly common. pull up on scene and it's just us, we don't get fire/pd unless we request it or the dispatcher taking the call hears something that strikes them as odd and sends them anyway. (exceptions are cpr/unconscious person, they all roll out on those.) it's a house in a decent neighborhood, we don't have many shitty calls here, but as we pull up, i can't shake a nasty feeling. i tell my partner, and he says that it's just that ""gas station coffee getting to me""... whatever dude. i don't even drink coffee. i call dispatch on my phone and have them lowkey send pd over. i grab my knife/seatbelt cutter/window breaker combo and put it on my belt by my radio. we get the gear ready and go inside the house, the door is unlocked. there's a granny sitting in her recliner, and her son/his wife/their kids on the other couch. granny looks like shit. it's my partner's turn to run a call, so he sends me back in for the o2 after some basic vitals and our introductions/what the family says happened. i'm only in the house for maybe two minutes, and i have a headache. pd rolls up as i'm in the unit, and i tell him that there's no danger. i just have a serious gut feeling that something is off/the family isn't telling us the full story. family claims they came to check on her/visit/spend the weekend, and found pools of vomit through the house, and she's clearly altered/headache. repeating this to the officer, it hits me like a ton of bricks. my vague headache after only being in the house for a few minutes. her vomiting and lethargy. i run back in the house and ask if anyone else has a headache, and my partner looks at me like i'm crazy, until the little boy speaks up and looks grayish. then the sister. then the mom. the hardass dad says no, but i tell them that they need to get out of the house now. partner and i carry grandma out and place her on our stretcher with o2 running, and i radio for fire for a potential carbon monoxide leak. i don't know how that granny was even alive, i guess she went outside often/left windows open that it wasn't too terrible a concentration and took days to make her that consistently ill, and i turned out to be right. my partner refused to work with me again because i ""overstepped his authority"" and some other bullshit. like, i'm sorry for saving your life and that family's life? they were planning on staying the weekend. it was steadily getting worse and in greater quantities from the time fire got there to when we left, in a span of 20 minutes. douchenugget.   there's several other instances i've listened to my gut feeling and been right, and most of those have been some nasty child abuse/elderly abuse cases. i have several in my comment history i can copy/paste here, if people are curious, as well as a really spooky one.   i've learned to trust my gut feeling, even if it's for something that could be misconstrued as ""run of the mill."" an instance i don't think i've commented on yet, has been a jail call. got called out to the city jail for ""chest pain"", (pd was saying he was just allergic to handcuffs) and got this weird feeling that we should bring in all of our equipment. we very rarely bring in everything to the jail, there's just no room to move, and 95% of the calls are bullshit. (you get to know the repeat offenders.) but something was telling me that shit was going down. i got fire rolling to me as well, even though their station is like 3/4 mile from pd, if that.   partner (different from the last call) rolled his eyes, but obliged. get in there and the dude's hr was so fast that even the monitor was having a difficult time picking it up. by the time we'd drawn the meds/started the iv to slow it down, kid collapsed and flatlined. fuck. we hadn't been there three minutes, dude was spanish speaking only and i could barely understand what he was saying. (i married into a mexican family but i'm still learning spanish, and definitely can't speak it.) the cop that was trying to translate said that they think he od'd, but we don't know on what. we get a pulse back and push narcan after ten minutes, fly to the hospital. there's no way we'd have managed to get that kid back if we hadn't brought in our equipment on a whim. would've taken too long.   there's been times where i've taken state prisoners and my intuition has saved my life because the inmate had pocketed a sharp object and was planning on stabbing us with it. times where i've straight up said ""we are not going into that house without pd"", called pd, turns out the caller was just waiting on first responders so he can have someone to attack. times where without gut feeling and intuition, i've saved myself, my partner, and my patient. there's been circumstances where i'm working the critical care transport side, and my patient is literally about to die and there's nothing i more i can do except monitor and a diesel bolus. hospice patients that you know aren't going to make it home or to the facility. you go into most calls with a gut feeling on how it can go down, and 98% of the time, you are right. you learn to listen to yourself and your patient. if your patient looks at you and says, ""i'm going to die"" or ""the baby is coming"", you fucking listen.   i'm sorry that this kinda went a little sideways, but like i said, i have several more stories in my comment history that i wouldn't mind sharing here again. listen to your gut. it could save your life. better safe than sorry.",1,2,2
946984,"agreed.  bush was compared to a monkey all the time.  i agree that historically, comparing people who happened to be black to monkeys has been used with racist connotations, but that does not mean *everyone* who makes the comparison is automatically being racist by doing so.  you can't assume what is in a person's heart.  also, being ignorant, such as to the sensitivity of an issue, is not necessarily the same thing as being bigoted.  i also get very suspicious when the only people crying ""racism/sexism/etc."" happen to be from a group not allegedly targeted by the remark/comparison/etc. in question.",0,,
224153,"assuming nothing is rusted to the point of breaking, it should really only take you about 2-3 hours to do.  basically all you need to do is remove the wheels, jack up the lower control arm, unbolt and remove the strut, and then do everything in reverse.  that's how it's supposed to work.  this is what ended up happening to me:  one of the struts had completely sheared off the previous day, so replacing that one was going to be a pain in the ass anyways.  get the rear end jacked up and on stands, and remove the wheels.  the top cylinder of the strut was a pain to remove since the bottom was no longer able to resist the turning.  it took a bit of reaching, but i was able to hold on to the cylinder while loosening the nut inside the trunk.  as it turns out, on my bonneville, the bolts connecting the strut bottom to the control arm does not have nuts.  instead gm used what is essentially a light gauge steel clip with punched holes, and the top hole bent up and threaded.  needless to say the clip was rusted completely through, which resulted in the first turn breaking the clips, in turn making it impossible to remove the bolt.  90 minutes and a couple c-clamps later, i finally got the bolts out, only to find that the threads on one of the bolts had been stripped.  i couldn't reuse what was left of the clamps if i wanted.  this was also at about 11:30 pm, so i was screwed until morning.  fortunately i have a hardware store 5 blocks from my house that opens at 7 am, so i walked there and bought 4 machine bolts to replace the originals.  this may not be the best substitution, but it'll do for now.  the other strut replacement was almost textbook, and only took me about 45 minutes.  all said and told, what should have been a 2-3 hour job took me about 6 hours total.  having said that, buying the struts, a strut mount for the one side, plus a floor jack and jack stands cost me just under $175.  that is about half of what most shops would charge here, plus the jack and stands will have many more uses now that i have them.  *edit*  i have to add though, that replacing the front struts is not something for the average diy.  it requires spring compressors, which are a bit hard to justify the cost of buying for the relatively few times they'll be used.  haynes manuals suggest wrapping the spring with a chain and bolting it together, but that is not exactly the safest method.",0,,

882724,"though i can't speak for the greater national populace of female nursing students, i have experience with my nursing school, and a few other schools.   a *very* wide variety of women attend nursing school. although there is a prototype: ""my mom/sister/grandma/aunt was a nurse"" or ""i love kids"" women are represented in large numbers. approximately 80% of the women in *my* class (based upon my estimates of hand-raise votes during class) are attending so they can work with infants and newborns. virtually nobody wants to work with the elderly (they're gross, supposedly). most of them are nice - with a few exceptions, of course.   as far as looks go - nurses rock it. i'll just leave it at that. *but*... a great majority of the women in nursing school are in a serious relationship, engaged, or married. some even have children. so if your goal is to hook up with a girl in the nursing program, you can just drop that pipe dream. with all honesty, you'd have better luck at a bar. just sayin'.   **tips for nursing students:**  1) *it's a lot of work.* ***a lot of work.*** one of my many many many books is 6,000 pages long, weighs 15 pounds, and comes in two volumes. since i've started nursing school, i haven't purchased a book less than 1,000 pages, and most average 3,000 pages. i have two clinicals a week this coming semester. it's 7am‚Äì2pm... and when the clock strikes 07:00 (learn military time btw) you better be in your patient's room doing your assessment or heads will roll. i live a 45 minute's drive from my clinical location - so i wake up at 04:00, leave home at 05:30, arrive at 06:15, and come to the floor 15 minutes early. after 14:00 rolls around, i travel back to campus for a three hour lecture, only to be followed by 5 hours of writing a paper. total = 20 hour day. fml   2) *it's stressful.* the sheer volume of work to be accomplished is more than enough to reduce some to bumbling emo idiots - i've seen it. and it'll happen to you. i consider myself a strong man that can manage greater amounts of stress than many, but nursing school has reduced me to tears on a couple occasions. prior to nursing school, i was engaged to be married to a girl i had been seeing for over two years. i'm single now.    3) *it's a lot of responsibility.* your caring for the sick. of course, your school can't legally allow you to do certain things because the liability for 200 or 300 nursing students in all stages would be much too high. also, the states simply won't allow it. *but* there will come a time when you begin to pass out drugs. are you tired? did you read the order incorrectly? take it to the wrong patient? don't know what the medication is? **surprise!** you're patient's dead. we face this.   **tips to male nursing students:**  nursing can be a gossip profession. placing dozens of educated, middle class women (predominately) in a room together is bound to stimulate conversation. be it about anything: war, politics, clothes, class (95% of the time, by the way - kiss your social life goodbye), boys, girls, magazines, movies (bad story about *marley and me*)... you get the idea. be ready to talk a lot (not recommended) or be a really good impartial listener (probably your best bet).   but when you graduate, you get to care of the sick, teach the well to stay well, and enjoy a lifetime of job and health care stability.   overall, it's a truly wonderful profession, and i would encourage *anyone* to go for it. best of wishes!",1,2,-2

425871,"here's a list of samples, since several people asked. just to give the idea of what i am talking about.   i selected them to match several criteria. they must be true. they must something that teenagers can spot as true. they must be something that society will punish you for saying (in any degree from social disapproval to imprisonment).   1. there is no reason to believe that there is any such thing as a soul. we are machines made out of meat. all we are is snuffed out the instant the brain dies.   2. there is no substantive difference between humans and other animals. we might possess more of certain things, like intelligence, but there is not one thing we have that they do not, not one thing we do that they do not.   3. human life is not priceless. it has a fluctuating, but specific dollar value. if society can secure that value from a death, it will find some legal way of making it happen.  4. there is no such thing as altruism. everyone is ultimately only interested in their own pleasure. even those who appear altruistic are doing so because it makes them feel good. no one actually cares about anyone else.  5. people only behave prosocially out of fear. remove threats of retribution, and they become as selfish as they can get away with.   6. people believe what they want to believe. any evidence they possess is an excuse, not a reason.   7. the machinery of respect in our culture is broken. we respect people not for benefiting our society (like ancient cultures who revered their warriors), but for having respect and fame. it's a positive-feedback loop which breaks the basic motivations that hold a culture together.   8. the public education system is a day-care center. it exists not to teach, but to free up both parents to work.   9. our economic system is set up to reward those who invest at the expense of those who work. this is because it is controlled by the former. our entire culture is designed around ways of making people work all their lives to create as much value as possible, then give that value to someone else without protest.   10. humans are adults at puberty. the reason for the ""immature"" behavior that lasts beyond this is a result of being given no responsibilities, and of being treated with contempt. responsibility does not come with age. it only comes with practice handling responsibilities. treat someone like a child, and they will act like one for as long as you do so, age notwithstanding. (this is *why* paris hilton.)  11. people, being adults at puberty, are ready to have sex at puberty. older people who try to prevent this are not trying to protect them. they are trying to protect themselves.  12. most of someone's personality is formed during their first four years of life. if they are abused or neglected during this time, they are fucked up permanently, and there is nothing anyone can do to help them.  13. communism would never work, because no one with power is ever willing to share it. however, the reason we were taught to hate it was because it was a threat to our masters.  14. yes, we have masters. they own the houses we live in, the companies that make everything we use, the jobs that employ us and provide us with the means to live, every single source we get information to make decisions from. they are a small class of people at the top of the socioeconomic ladder. no, it's not a conspiracy. they didn't need to agree on it. they just all acted in their own best interest, and it happened. no, you will never join this class of people. the odds are astronomical against it.    15. fathers being suspicious of their young daughters' boyfriends and dates is really just sexual jealousy.   16. love is not eternal. it is a simple state of endorphin chemistry. it serves a single evolutionary purpose. it lasts about three years.   17. patriotism and watching football are the same basic instinctive process; we think of ourselves as part of a group, and automatically hate the other groups. this comes from primate troops in the savanna, and it hasn't changed a bit.   18. women really are not as good at abstract symbol manipulation (eg mathematics).  19. biology is destiny, no matter what your dreams are. short people will never play in the nba no matter how hard they practice. dumb people will never get smarter by studying. ugly ducklings grow up into freaky-looking ducks, not swans.   20. whether ""free will"" exists or not is an unanswerable question, but even so, it's obvious we have a lot less control over our behaviour than we admit to. fat people really can't stop stuffing their faces with cake. molested children really do grow up and do the same to others. we are meat robots.   21. not all sexual contact between adults and children (whether we are talking about ""minors"" or even literal children) is rape, or even non-consensual. other contacts *are* non-consensual, but are still less traumatic than the attempts to protect them.  22. many women don't want equality and empowerment.   23. parents care less about their children than they do about their careers, their socioeconomic status, and what the joneses think. that's why we have public schools instead of home education by one parent who doesn't have a ""career"".   24. adult society is ruled by the same cliquishness, cronyism, value of appearances over reality, and prejudice that you see in middle schools and high schools. the older people are just better at glib rationalization.  25. children are not sweet little innocents until they are corrupted by the big bad world. children are totally selfish until they are taught to at least pretend they aren't. children do not have to be taught how to lie, cheat, and steal. it comes naturally.   26. politics is about interests, not principles. american patriotism and radical islam are both just rationalizations for a fight over resources. same with capitalism vs. communism.   27. the downtrodden and oppressed peoples of the world are just the same as the oppressors. the only difference is who has the power. the indians would have colonized europe and wiped out most of the europeans if we had been the ones with nothing but stone-tipped arrows and birchbark canoes. the jews would happily have gassed the germans if someone had convinced them it was a good idea.  (i didn't have to strain to come up with this many. in fact, i had to spend time pondering which ones to leave out.)",1,-1,-1
884126,"&gt;if you're 100% the derpface + shitty person then... yeah... interesting!  i think the problem with the increasing ""edginess"" of the internet and nerd culture (4chan, for instance, where otherwise normal people and nerds are perfectly willing to engage in arguably immoral and risky behavior or at least stare at racist and pornographic imagery all day) is that more and more nerds (going by the old definition of nerd, meaning someone who is uncool, intelligent, and socially awkward), who are guys with probably not so great prospects with women or any social situation, are thinking of themselves are bad asses or drastic or edgy people. consequently, anti-social behavior or personalities are actually being embraced, exaggerated, and seen as some angry young man, fight club stand against ""normals."" combined with social rejection, more and more nerds, who were previously just uncool, are now angry, and act like jerks because they think they're rebels. as david mamet notes:  ""we all know the hard-bitten rationalist who rails against religious tradition, against historical niceties, against participation in ritual large and small ‚Äî the pta, the welcome wagon, the wedding, the funeral. we all knows this person, and many of us are this person, and some of us are this person at some times. this person goes the grave lonely, angry, and drained by resistance to observations and activities, subscription to which would have occupied a fraction of his energy and time.""  it's like everyone, no matter how butthurt the basement dweller, thinks they're james dean in rebel without a cause, forgetting of course, that the point nick ray was trying to make with that film was that the teenagers rebel against their unhappy home lives, not the very concept of home or their lives... and when they finally find a domestic space they can be happy in, they act out a happy family routine. they want to be happy. they don't want to wallow in their unhappiness.  so whereas nerds used to be generally uncool yet happy nice, corny, conscientious, unusual people (all good traits in and of themselves,) now more and more are anti-social jerks with a chip on their shoulder. as aaron sorkin wrote in ""studio 60,"" ""we're talking about a pack mentality for the kinds of guys who were never invited into the pack. [they write] to be mean.""  or in the social network: ""you're not an asshole . . . you're just just trying really hard to be."" and ""...you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. and i want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. it'll be because you're an asshole.""  so i think that's why i think the ""shitty personality + derp face"" thing"" is becoming more and more common.  i spent my entire teenage years being that guy, the angry friendless ugly nerd. i was being self-deprecating before when i said i'm completely the socially repulsive guy, i'm really a mix between the two, edging towards the repulsive side (i have bette davis/peter lorre eyes, but then again i love bette davis), but if i clean up and in a happy, smiling, confident mood, i can look like a solid 7, no word of a lie. i'm trying to be less angry, started taking depression, anxiety, add, and anti-social anxiety disorder meds (just trying to give a bit of context) and feel less angry, more productive, more confident, more social. i'm trying to get into shape, and fix my wardrobe. i'm 21, but i feel simultaneously young, like i never had normal teenage years and am just starting now, and old, like i've had a moment of clarity about my life, some older persona wisdom that 1. i know nothing, (whereas in my teenage years i thought i knew everything, which gave me in my mind carte blanche to act like a jerk,) and that's normal, 2. i need to turn my life around, and stop hating everything and everyone and being angry, and 3. that i'm really young still, like if i was an old man who could go back and do things over and start at 20, that's how old i feel in my youth. i think a whole lot of my generation are going to start having this realization soon, and shed the angry nerd and angry jerk thing and work on developing nice, appealing, actually social and human personalities and improve looks. that's what i'm trying to do, is to fix my personality and looks in order to become, rather than a ""nice guy,"" or a ""bad ass,"" a ""good man."" i want to be a good man, a true man, an excellent man, in at least some field, with a passion and drive to improve in my passions and hobbies. like john c reilly in magnolia, and as you may or may not have guessed, my passion is film. but i do think a surge of that realization and urge to change will sweep my generation like a fire through a wheat field as we realize we don't want to wallow in anger anymore.  perhaps some national or global crisis will facilitate or necessitate that. perhaps some real, imminent crisis, a war, a bad depression, etc, will make my generation step up as we're about to wake up. like if your house was being burgled, and you had already started to wake up before everyone else, and then the burglar set off the alarm. i think my realization that i need to start actually having a nice personality and being a fucking human being was a product of natural and gradual change, and as i feel the malaise in my generation is widespread, perhaps the ""waking up"" will happen in a wave, and start before and after some crisis necessitates the waking up, the burglar alarm that makes us start working toward some important goal and re-asses what's really important and what we feel about our lives. as louis ck says, ""everything is amazing and nobody is happy,"" and alternatively, ""there's still a lot of fat we need to shed from our country before we have to move grandma into the attic and sell apples on the street corner in order to not starve to death. we still have hot dog eating contests and the superbowl."" in putting these two maxims together, my theory is that our culture is superficial and frivolous and focused on the wrong things, which can spawn widespread malaise, unhappiness, and anger. ""we know things are bad, worse than bad."" the angry rationalist's reaction is therefore to bow out. if the society experiences some crisis wherein its priorities shifts and it self-corrects, the individual is more likely to align or care about the society and greater community, and work on himself in order to work on society. narcissism will be replaced with community and charity, frivolity by responsibility, selfishness by teamwork, etc, etc... and the thing is, the ""normal"" members of my generation are sort of already adept at efficiency, teamwork, all that good stuff. (my beef with them has always been that they're phonies, i go to a very capitalist right wing business school, full of these fledgling gordon gekkos, all very achievement and task oriented, but strident and grating in their networking and personalities. in the wake of some national crisis, i suspect mere quibbles over personality will disappear, although political differences remain. hopefully political discourse will become more civil.)  i hear a lot of angry older people (actually a minority of the generations, of course, but i think centered around generation x, which statistically had a difficult life, as there were so many of them born, and in a time where their parent's (who statistically, being born in the depression, had very easy lives, as there were so few of them born, don draper notwithstanding) divorce rates were high, saying that my generation is the worst one ever. and i actually believe that's true. but where our conclusions differ is that when i was a teenager i thought everyone else in my generation was the worst ever. now i realize i was part of the problem by not engaging, by removing myself, by treating other humans like garbage, by being an angry narcissistic baby, which is the worst cruelty one can inflict on fellow man. as the ancient greeks said, these actions, ""although causing no harm, cause pain."" so i do think my generation is generally the worst ever right now, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the anti-social meanness of the outcasts i once was, to the superficial phoniness of the achievement oriented, capitalist ""upper castes"" of my generation, the ""normals,"" as it were, but what generation isn't in its adolescence?. but again where our conclusions differ is that i think my generation is going to experience a 180 degree shift in priorities, gradually or suddenly, and have to step up, and will hopefully become one of the greatest generations by the time we all come of age and mature.  whereas generation x statistically had difficult childhoods and adolescents, i think they're going to be powerful and effective leaders in middle age and elder age, perhaps during turbulent and awful time (think jon stewart). they're equipped to deal with it, and will stay consistent in that in order to be successful. i think my generation, meanwhile, has had easy childhoods and adolescence, and will have a difficult adult period, which will make us change and adapt but come out ""good."" in the end.   the stereotype of generation x was that they were depressed, cynical youth, but i think men like jon stewart are actually the rule in that generation now rather than the exception, and will actually be great ""moralists"" when they run society. the boomers were never all that moral. they talked the talk but didn't walk the walk.  the ""angry nerd"" thing has got to go. nobody is genuinely nice anymore.  tl;dr mean nerdy assholes fuck themselves over  and of course this theory is very american-centric, although i am a canadian in canada.",1,-1,

696047,"for those who cannot access the article (worked for me!):  today‚Äôs young people are held to be alienated, unhappy, violent failures. they are proving anything but jul 12th 2014 | berlin | from the print edition   g√∂rlitzer park, a patch of grass and concrete, has a seedy air. its tall walls are covered in graffiti. near the entrances, young african men stand around hassling bystanders, asking if they want to buy some ‚Äúkiffen‚Äù. yet in many respects, the ‚Äúdrug park‚Äù (as locals in kreuzberg, a trendy district of berlin, often call it) does not live up to its ugly reputation. on a saturday afternoon, it is mostly full of 20-somethings sitting around on the grass in groups sipping coffees and beers. young parents pass by with pushchairs. university students on picnic blankets peer into their textbooks. over the course of an hour or so, not a single one of the drug dealers in view seems to make a deal. for most of the locals, they are a hassle‚Äînot a service.  few european cities do youth culture and hedonism better than berlin. young people flock‚Äîor, if truly cool, just drift‚Äîhere from all over the world. the nightlife runs until dawn, techno beats flood its streets. yet as with g√∂rlitzer park, the wild appearance belies reality. the city‚Äôs middle-aged artists and musicians complain that its young hipsters are taking the edge out of its nightlife by trying to make money out of it. their entrepreneurialism is driving up rents. ‚Äúthe city of heroin addicts, david bowie and iggy pop has disappeared,‚Äù says a berliner who was not yet born when the thin white duke came to stay. in its place is a town where people come to study, work and boost their creative careers, not just party. berlin is still an unusual city; the temperance of its youth is not. in 2002 just 13% of german teenagers had never had an alcoholic drink; by 2012, that figure had risen to 30%. among 18- to 25-year-olds, the proportion drinking at least once a week has fallen by a third since the early 1990s. cannabis use has dropped, too, and the number of deaths attributed to the use of illegal drugs has fallen by half since 2000. similar trends are seen across the western world.  stay clean tonight take britain. in 2008 time magazine described britain‚Äôs youth as ‚Äúunhappy, unloved and out of control‚Äù; a nation gripped by an ‚Äúepidemic of violence, crime and drunkenness‚Äù was scared of its feral youth. polling by barnardo‚Äôs, a charity, found that 54% of people thought that children were ‚Äúbeginning to behave like animals‚Äù‚Äîperhaps because, in television programmes such as ‚Äúskins‚Äù and films such as ‚Äúkidulthood‚Äù, hoodie-wearing teenagers occupied themselves largely with cocaine, wild sex and stabbing one another. david cameron‚Äînow prime minister, then leader of the opposition‚Äîdenounced a ‚Äúbroken society‚Äù, arguing that ‚Äúwe have seen a decades-long erosion of responsibility, of social virtue, of self-discipline, respect for others, deferring gratification instead of instant gratification.‚Äù mr cameron‚Äôs claim, hyperbolic then, has since become ludicrous. in 2007, 111,000 children aged between 10 and 17 were convicted or given a police caution for a first offence in england and wales. by last year, that had fallen to just 28,000 (see chart 1). the teenage murder rate quietly plunged, and london‚Äôs knife crime epidemic of the summer of 2008 proved a blip, much like the riots of 2011. as elsewhere, drug use by the young is falling (see chart 2). perhaps most remarkably, britain‚Äôs notoriously surly youths are getting more polite: according to one government survey, those born in the early 1990s are less rude and noisy in public places than previous cohorts were at the same age. ‚Äúpeople are still being young, but they‚Äôre recognising there are boundaries,‚Äù says one youth worker in hackney, a borough of london long known for its high crime rate.  in america, the proportion of high-school students reporting ‚Äúbinge-drinking‚Äù‚Äîmore than five drinks in a single session‚Äîhas fallen by a third since the late 1990s. cigarette smoking among the young has become so uncommon that more teenagers‚Äîsome 23% of 17- to 18-year-olds‚Äîsmoke cannabis than tobacco. over the past ten years pot-smoking has increased, a bit, among these older teens; but even though now legal in some states (see page 35) its prevalence is still far lower than in the 1970s, when barack obama was a member of his high-school ‚Äúchoom gang‚Äù. use of other recreational drugs has fallen sharply. dr wilson compton, the deputy director of the national institute on drug abuse, says that perhaps the most worrying trend in young americans‚Äô drug habits is the increasing abuse of attention-focusing pills such as ritalin by students keen to improve their performance. teenage kicks of other sorts also appear to be on the decline. ‚Äúteens are waiting longer to have sex than they did,‚Äù according to a report on young americans from the guttmacher institute, a think-tank. america‚Äôs teenage pregnancy rate is half what it was two decades ago (see chart 3). britain has experienced a lesser decline. most mainland european countries never saw the high rates of teenage pregnancy that america and britain saw in the 1980s and 1990s, but they too have fewer expectant youngsters than they did. teenagers appear not just to be waiting longer for sex, but also by-and-large to be being careful about what they get up to once they get started. according to data from the european centre for disease monitoring and control, across the european union (eu) they are the only age group to be diagnosed with fewer sexually transmitted diseases in recent years.  you never leave your room this sudden outbreak of restraint is doing havoc to businesses which thrive off youthful excess. ‚Äúkids these days just want to live in their fucking own little worlds in their bedrooms watching netflix and becoming obese,‚Äù fumes a barman in leeds, a northern english city. in france and spain bars and caf√©s have been closing in huge numbers, especially in provincial towns. in faliraki, a greek island resort where locals once so despaired of young drunk northern europeans vomiting everywhere that they banned pub crawls, some are now desperate for the tourists to come back.  the media, too, are struggling to cope with the rising temperance of youth. television stations aimed at young people have dropped programmes that glamorise rebellion and high-living, says christian kurz, of viacom, a media company which owns mtv. more and more teenagers are turning to youtube for entertainment. young germans use it to watch bawdy comedy shows made by other teenagers, filled with stupid jokes and‚Äîunsettlingly for leftish parents worried about commercialism‚Äîlots of product placement. german kids seem to want to grow up to make money, one father suggests, looking slightly unnerved.  what is behind this generation of hard-working, strait-laced kids? it is hard to pin down any single explanation. lots of interlinking factors contribute to social trends, and the changes are neither uniform within countries nor between them. in most countries there are areas where teenage crime is high. in a few there is no overall trend to temperance: drug-taking and youth violence both appear to have increased in france in recent years. in america, heroin has staged a comeback in some rural areas, largely as a by-product of prescription-drug abuse. the european school survey project on alcohol and other drugs (espad), a cross-national survey, finds that although binge-drinking has fallen among young people in most european countries, it had gone up a lot among children in cyprus and greece. but there are some factors common to most countries in the rich world which may help to tie the experience of teenagers in auckland to that of those in amsterdam.  in many countries, shock at the earlier extent of youthful hedonism and disorder has led to dramatic attempts to curb it. in britain anti-social behaviour orders‚Äîa judicial sanction for disruptive conduct that falls short of criminality‚Äîwere widely used against the rowdy, and worse, in the 2000s. in spain and italy drinking in the streets has been met with ferocious policing in recent years‚Äîin central madrid an al fresco swig of beer can get you a ‚Ç¨500 ($680) fine. in germany many states have started sending out teenagers to test whether shops and bars are selling alcohol to people too young to buy it. australia has put heavy taxes on teen-friendly alcopops.  but such policies are hardly the whole story; there are much bigger trends. the generations known for rebellion and rule-breaking were large in comparison to the populations of the time, thanks to the post-war baby boom and its ‚Äúecho‚Äù boom in the 1970s and 1980s. they grew up in young societies. today‚Äôs youth by contrast are few in number and are growing up in ever older societies. in germany, for example, the median age is now 46, and increasing about three months every year.",1,2,
423660,"dont know if anyone will see this bc old thread but theres some stuff i havent told anyone  lets start with dad's side. he has a wife and a child with his wife and essentially she wears the pants and successfully changed the dynamic of me and all of my siblings (except my little half brother) relationship with our father. he basically chose her over us and hes a weakling who we more or less just pity but while we all wish we could just say fuck him i think we all just really deep down want out dad back. i have essentially been villified from this side of the family because my stepmother likes to tell her family horrible things about me and told everyone i (made her feel unsafe) while she was pregnant, manipulating and further trying to turn people against me by using the damsel in distress card and basically using it so that she could be as shitty to me as she wished and if i objected or yelled at her to leave me alone in my fathers house she'd just claim she was afraid i'd hurt her to get sympathy even though she's actually a combative piece of shit who couldnt accept that me and my siblings werent going to be shaped into the beautiful christian brainwashed nuclear family she hoped for so she manipulated my father and everyone else into driving us away and we basically dont talk to her dad much (i still love my mom and siblings but dont see them much unfortunately because i dont live at home anymore).  my dad's dad is an alcoholic who left my grandma (grandma prudie) for my step grandma ( we called her grandma dianna, as a way to dfferentiate when we visited the two different grandparents). i never reallt caught on i wasnt related to grandma dianna as she was always wonderful to me and shes just an awesome person and loved us with all her heart like a real grandmother would! (i dont talk on the phone with my grandpa much but when i do the highlight is always when he goes and grabs my grandma dianna and they both talk to me at the same time). grandpa's alright, a lot more intelligent than my father but with it comes some jackass sarcasm and wit kinda stuff paired with him being an older fashioned new york italian. but grandma prudie is where it really gets dysfunctional again on my fathers side. apparently she had a daughter at 17 before meeting my grandpa (this would be a common theme on both sides of my family, but i will maybe get to that later). the daughter was adopted by some of the mormons in their town (mesa arizona is where my dad was raised and where prudence got knocked up the first time). my dad was secretly living in the same city as his sister but didnt know for a long time as the catholics and mormons hated eachother. he learned of her but i think he just stopped by her work once to look at her then left, not feeling any reason to talk with her (this detail always bothered me).  my nana (my grandmother on the mothers side) has two siblings, my aunt jojo and the ever homosexual uncle bob (i didnt come to learn this until i was 12 but after that it all made sense). my great grandma who only recently passed and my great grandpa whos still truckin on watchin football and hanging out in his la z boy.   uncle bob has always lived with great grandparents that seemed weird but what i learned a few months ago sort of made sense. mental illness is common on my moms side and he is absolutely no exception. apparently he is a schizophrenic, and at one point believed the fbi to have taken up residence in the attic of great gran and great gramps' house. my mom joked about not seeing why the fbi might want to monitor some random gay middle aged dude who lives with his elderly parents in costa mesa but he did. hes a pretty cool guy and on thanksgiving last year my mom and him left during a holiday celebration and she later told me that he took her to the gay bar he frequents.   his sister joanne (jojo) struggles with depression, and is a bit wacky but my mom hasnt fully delved into her story yet (i just let her bring it up instead of pressing her)  my nana, who is my grandma, also has some silly string up her sleeve. my bio grandpa was some super portuguese dude, she was seventeen or sixteen when she became pregnant with my mom, bio gramps dipped out. accounts from my nana's cousin sarah jane (i like to call her mary jane on account of all the pot she smokes, shes a cool lady) indicate that even though she was 4 years younger than sarah jane, who was still out partying and having fun not wanting to deal with responsibility or anything, she totally dropped everything, despite being about 17 and just worked and worked and cut out most activities that wouldnt go toward benefitting her or the daughter she had on the way and just kept working to provide for my mom. when my mom was around 6 i believe my nana met my ""papa"" while working at bobs big boy and he had two kids of his own. together they owned 3 tanning salons and lucked out on the financial market too many times to count and essentially she got to retire at forty. she was 39 when i was born and she became a grandma. shes still almost two years ago i helped her move back from arizona after my papa passed away to her senior living home (not a nursing or old peoples home, more just a home for more independent seniors and it doesnt have any in house nurses or anything, basically just a place to relax) in my original hometown (which is where i live with my girlfriend) where she raised my mom, where my mom raised me, etc.. pretty nice to visit her as she's really funny and you can actually joke around with her and also she loaned me $$$ for a motorcycle so thats pretty cool.   sorry for all the ramblings and shit im super tired also the format was crappy its 3:12 here gimme a break",1,,-1
846995,"&gt; my grandfather was, as far as i've heard, a complete alpha. guy was the patriarch of the house and never showed an ounce of weakness. he was known to be the center of the room, which i can attest for as his oldest son (my uncle) is exactly the same. he very clearly raised his sons to be the alphas of every room. pictures of him at functions have been digitally saved, and they clearly back this.  ""i can tell someone's true personality from photos alone.  especially posed photos, when the person knew the camera was there.  that really shows someone's true nature.""  &gt; in the late 80s, his company and another's merged. he and the other owner shook hands that he'd be given a high post at the new company. unfortunately, he made the critical mistake of not signing any legal papers. the new company rescinded their word, and did not hire him. this sudden unemployment resulted in a quick downhill for the family of 3 kids financially. the family lived in a hotel at the lowest point of this. after finding a new middle class home, my two uncles and my mother went off to college.  ""he did not sign any papers, which i will pretend like a man's word is binding, so it's the other dude's fault.  definitely not like someone to make an excuse for a massive failure.  if he were a woman, it'd be because he was an idiot.  but because he's a man i like, it's not his fault.""  (side note: daaaaamn, that sucks)  &gt; very soon after the kids were out, grandpa was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. even though he didn't show emotional instability, the circumstances were ""too much"" for grandma and suddenly drifted apart from him, and did not consider them together when he passed. she did not visit, and feigned emotion. my grandpa's dying wish was for my mother to make sure grandma was taken care of.  and how did he treat her before?  as an ""alpha"", did he ""spin plates""?  did he make her feel like her life was always about to slip out from underneath her, he was ready to leave at any second?  did he spend his adult life building on the foundation she gave him, as in, did he always have a lunch packed for work, his children were cared for and educated, his clothing clean and pressed, all that domestic stuff?  did he ever appreciate it?  did he threaten her with violence, did he ever enact violence upon her?  if he treated her like a bang maid, maybe she wasn't so inclined to do the emotional heavy lifting of a terminal illness for him.  maybe she was an asshole herself and abandoned her loving husband on his deathbed.  that's possible.  but somehow, i just don't see a lifelong ""alpha"" type having put in the work to get that level of emotional labor.  and his wanting his wife taken care of doesn't mean he loved her, nor does it say much that that was his ""dying wish"".  and i note it falls on the mother: as in, the woman's daughter.  elder care tends to fall most heavily on daughters.  why didn't he ask his alpha son?  &gt; women will, time and time again, leave when you cannot provide for them. awalt.  or maybe after years of emotional abuse, constantly wondering if your partner is cheating on you and never having an answer, or having to accept shitty behavior to keep your marriage together, you just don't have it in you to coddle someone on their deathbed.  &gt; oh yeah. i spend a fair amount of time working around retired couples in high end developments where the age range is 65 to dead. its the rare woman who will do even a reasonable job taking care of a guy in his final years after spending his whole life taking care of her. many have even told me that when he passed it was a relief. i have never seen it the other way, ive only seen guys who doted on their ailing spouse and were pretty much crushed when they pass away. men are the true romantics, even senior women are very quick to start shopping for a replcement.  then you're only hearing the one side.  it is statistically far more likely for a man to leave an ill woman than it is for a woman to leave an ill man.  women tend to outlive men, as well.  if in someone's final days, they become as demanding as a toddler and you're not in the peak of youth yourself, it can be exhausting.  feeling a relief when a loved one dies isn't necessarily monstrous.  my grandmother was ill, and by the end, she was incontinent, confused, and constantly uncomfortable.  she had little in life to be happy about, because she wasn't able to follow conversation or recognize people she loved.  we were relieved when she passed, not because we didn't love her, but because it meant that she wasn't suffering, and yes, it meant that we no longer had to see her in such a state, which was painful for us, too.  there's selfishness in there, but i can't blame anyone.  caretaking is exhausting, even in the most ideal circumstances.  people act out under stress, and sometimes even act in opposite to their own interests.  losing someone can cause a person to emotionally shut down, because they aren't prepared for the slow decline and avoid the situation to avoid the feelings.  it's not the best reaction, but it happens.  not to mention, in older folks, there tends to be more adherence to ""tradition"".  women often couldn't get jobs, maintain jobs, etc., because women weren't considered to be able to do the things men did.  women's sphere was domestic, unless they were poor or poc, in which case, they could take care of *other* people's homes and children.  the way that social roles were enacted, as well as divorce laws, influenced the way people acted and what they decided to do.  getting divorced, as a woman, offered little chance for improvement.  spousal abuse wasn't rare or even that bad to most people: slapping a woman when she ""deserved"" it wasn't uncommon.  you didn't have to love him to stay with him, and you had few options to make a life on your own.  did the men have to work hard?  yes, of course.  being a single-income household isn't easy.  but if he's working *his* ass off, so is she.  raising children and keeping a sparkling-clean home isn't easy, either.  they're different, yes, but you try to live up to what a mid-century wife and mother was expected to do (and without complaint), and see how well you can manage.  i certainly can't.  without that wife doing the lion's share of the domestic work (*especially* if there weren't clothing washing machines), he doesn't have much of a chance to get ahead at work.  have you ever washed your clothing by hand, especially if you have heavy work clothes?  it's hard!  and very time-consuming.  the wonders that are a washing machine make laundry an easy chore.  but thank goodness we have a handy tool to boil it all down: awalt.  nope, nothing complicated, no social influences that might push someone to stay in a shitty situation, certainly no ideas about gender that would limit someone.  he just goes to work every day and she does nothing!  damn that terrible woman.  damn her to hell.",0,,

820791,"#digimon adventure tri 2- ketsui  as a fan of the original digimon adventure series, i was really looking forward to the movie reboots. i loved the digital world that the children were transported to, the growth and characterization of the kids over the course of the show, and the moments of seriousness and darkness that occasionally sprout from time to time during the, overall, youthful atmosphere.  however, the 2nd movie continues to disappoint me (*cries*). my major problems with this movie are:  - there is a lot of slice-of-life, but it's not presented well (nor do i really care) - the characters seemed to have regressed in development - i don't really have rose-tinted glasses helping this one  the movie spends a ton of time showing how the kids are doing in their modern life. between a hot springs trip and planning a school festival, there's a lot of slice-of-life here. the hot springs trip felt overall unnecessary, with no real important character development, and the school festival seemed like an excuse to provide fan service. to be honest, the reason that the slice-of-life felt so out of place is mostly because the city is **supposed** to be threatened by dangerous monsters that keep popping out through portals. slice-of-life is an awesome genre, but its appeal is that it's supposed to be realistic and grounded. having a ""our world is dying!"" overarching plot with slice-of-life subplots feels jarring.  also, the characters just seem angsty now, and even worse, seem to have reverted. tai and matt hate each other (how many times did we see this in digimon adventure 01), mimi is selfish (oh boy), and joe doesn't have confidence (wasn't his entire arc in the first series about building confidence?). it feels like i'm seeing the same thing, except repainted with teenage angst, and with far less screentime to see gradual development. the digimon also seem to be unimportant, as they mostly serve to do cute things and occasionally fight an enemy or two (only gomamon seems to really do anything).  it's just not very good. it looks pretty, but it's hard to sympathize with high schoolers that have the same (or similar) problems to their 5th grade selves. especially now that you're viewing/treating them as high schoolers, and are therefore less likely to forgive irrational behavior (though i get that hormones are cray).  **3.5/10**   #usagi drop  while digimon disappointed, usagi drop definitely did not. i have always been fond of the ""loyalty is stronger than blood."" the animation was gorgeous, and seeing rin and daikichi bond absolutely melted my heart. nothing really happened, plot-wise, during the anime, and yet i felt like it was still a wonderful slice-of-life experience. despite all of the sacrifices and hardships daikichi had to encounter (and some of them were serious, like [](/s ""giving up his chance for promotion to not have to work overtime""), it really showed how important children can be for parents, and how children can warm even the most tired of hearts. i like how the anime ended with some of the characters' relations being unknown. did daikichi marry yukari? did rin ever meet her mother? just like real life, you're not meant to know all of the answers.  the characters in this story are great too. rin is a real sweetheart, and daikichi has that lovable ""i'd-rather-not-but-for-you-i'll-do-it-i-guess"" attitude that makes their relationship so lovely to watch. even the side-characters, like kouki, yukari, and the grandma, get fleshed out. my only complaint is [](/s ""rin's mother""), who doesn't really... do anything? i guess it was meant to show that [](/s ""gave up her child for her career, which is a fine foil to daikichi, though i'd prefer if she had developed or gotten out of the picture quicker if she wasn't going to change much""). i didn't think that she deserved the large amount of screentime she received?  also, i pretend that manga doesn't exist because of that atrocious epilogue. whyyyyyy.  **9/10** totally worth it.  #k  to be honest, i only really sat through this one because one of my friends liked it so much. while the premise and setup had a lot of potential, i felt that the execution ended up leaving me with mixed feelings on the actual product.  **what i liked: **  it was a very pretty looking anime. nice color palettes, very stylish looking characters, and the fire animations looked nice. also, i'm a sucker for this edgy, dark setting (a la durarara!!, the world ends with you, etc). also, the ost was superb. the jazz-hip hop fit right in with the action, giving a little bit of pump and pazazz to the action on screen. it really gave me some *blue submarine 6* vibes.  also, the plot of the anime really intrigued me. magical world ruled by gangs with powers that aren't entirely clear to the audience or the public? hell yes. main character who has a weird, mystical vibe to him that seems slightly out of place? oh boy! this anime screams tension and atmosphere, and in this department, it excels very well.  finally, this is probably the first time in a long while that an anime has actually surprised me with a plot twist. the fact that [](/s ""mc is actually the amnesiac silver king stuck inside of the colorless king"") really took me for a whirl. too bad it never really got explained well, which leads me to the cons....  **the cons: **  to keep it short, this anime felt too ambitious for the season length. only 13 episodes to balance the characterization of the blues, the reds, the high school students, yashiro's posse, and the kings was far too little time. this wouldn't be such a problem if the people within these factions were just relegated to plot-device, secondary characters, but unfortunately, the anime spent a lot of time characterizing each one of them. to some, this might seem like a plus, but to me, this just ended up hurting the anime.   for example, consider [](/s ""the traitor who switched from the reds to the blues. the anime spends a lot of time showing that he has greater plans, and that his rocky relationship with skateboard dude is sparked due to the fact that they were best buddies. he has multiple face-offs with the reds that result in... nothing really. it's unexplained why he is seeking to fight them out, other than to satisfy his grudge against the reds."")  this issue isn't isolated to this single character, and extends to a large amount of the cast. why is creepy red gothic girl creepy, and why does she have those powers? what is the relationship between barkeeper and main blue girl? what are the red and blue king's history with one another? why is catgirl a [](/s ""strain""), how did she become one, why does she think that she's shiro's cat, and why is she always naked? why is there a giant sword above the ground? what do the swords represent - are they mana, magic, spirit of the king, a symbol of prosperity...? *how does one become a king?*  **6/10**  in the end, i had to dock points for the multiple subplots that the anime introduced to only hand wave aside. also, one thing that really bothered me was [] (/s ""the part where yashiro had to clear his name and prove his innocence to the samurai guy. i'm not going to get started about the logical fallacy of assuming that a man is guilty by default, or the fact that he assumed that he was a murderer due to camcorder footage. or the fact that he decided to spare yashiro's life because they were hungry. things like that were just... bizarre. also, if cat girl has the power to modify people's memories, why didn't she make samurai guy think that yashiro was telling the truth? or make the samurai guy think he saw a different face.... or anything really?"").  #only yesterday  aka ""i peaked in fifth grade.""  i've always been a fan of ghibli, and always will be. after going through ghibli's works and realizing that i've never watched this movie (despite its high ratings), i decided to finally watch the movie. and man, am i **glad** that i held off watching this movie.  the thing about *only yesterday* is that it feels like it's aimed at an older crowd. the entire plot can be pretty much summarized to ""a girl, tired of her city life and eager to get her hands dirty doing some farm work, goes to the countryside and recounts her ""firsts"" when she was a child."" it covers a variety of things- from her first crush, to her period, to her first time getting slapped. there's nothing really to be spoiled her (except maybe the ending?), since this movie is entirely about the experience -reminiscing about the old days.  the animation is beautiful, and the japanese version's voice acting was superb. the characters seemed extremely real, to the point where it's hard to describe them because they aren't entirely described by tropes.  my main problem is that i feel that i'm not old enough to fully understand the feelings of the movie. while i do relate to the ""i miss experiencing things for the for first time like when i was in elementary school"" vibe, along with the haziness of older memories, i just don't feel as... nostalgic about my childhood. the movie's entire draw is its nostalgia, and the nostalgia it will instill in its audience. if you aren't that nostalgic about your childhood, either because you're young, or because you still have so many new things to experience, it's hard to fully relate to the ""those were the good days"" attitude of the movie. and, as a soon-to-be senior in college, i feel like i'm in a murky gray zone where i sort of relate to the character, and yet sort of don't.  **6.5/10**  however, i feel like my appreciation for this movie will increase as i age. i wouldn't be surprised if i end up giving it a 8/10 or a 9/10 when i'm older, simply because i'll understand how older people have a harder time doing new things. obviously, people reach maturity at different ages and ""peak"" at different ages, so there are probably 16 year-olds who really feel the vibe of the movie out there.",1,-1,

""the clients are usually white, suburban, married businessmen who want a blow job from a teenage boy but don't consider themselves gay, and heterosexual men who seek out young girls,"" said edith springer, who worked for many years with teenage prostitutes in new york's times square. ""i have never in all my years of therapy and counseling come across what the media advertise as a 'pedophile.'""   http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.  ''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.  ms. levine argues that sex between teenagers and adults is not always wrong, and that many people are too quick to deny children and teenagers the right to make their own sexual decisions, often by labeling all such contact ''abuse.''  https://www.routledge.com/products/9780805809145  long-range effects of child and adolescent sexual experiences myths, mores, and menaces  making a unique contribution of placing the current sexual exploitation of children and adolescents firmly in its historical context, this book looks at the family's and society's roles in child and adolescent sex abuse. unlike most previous studies, this study allows a range of responses from negative to positive and avoids the methodological problems inherent in many other studies. most studies combine the age groups of children and adolescents, whereas this study separates these different age groups and compares the nature and outcome of sexual experiences of children with those of adolescents. utilizing sophisticated analytical measures, the author's findings repudiate many commonly held assumptions and serve to calm current hysteria regarding sexual abuse of minors.  http://www.alternet.org/story/12960/what_judith_levine_is_really_saying  levine has taken considerable heat for holding up as a ""good model"" the netherlands' age of consent law, under which young people ages 12-16 can legally consent to sex with older people who are not parents or authority figures, but under which charges can be brought if teens or their parents (with the approval of the council for the protection of children) believe the young person is being exploited. but her support for the dutch law cannot be taken out of the context of that country's social welfare system and relaxed cultural attitudes about sex.  in order ""to give children a fighting chance in navigating the sexual world,"" levine says, ""adults need to saturate it with accurate, realistic information and abundant, varied images and narratives of love and sex.""  if a person truly has the good of young people in mind, one would hope he or she would be interested in what research has to reveal. ""harmful to minors"" offers a plethora of findings, from studies showing that exposure to sexually explicit images does not harm children, to evidence that teens' sexual relationships with adults are not uniformly devastating, to research on the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education in delaying sexual activity.  allie kilpatrick is one source for levine. the book of allie is on routledge.  ask yourself why there is a systemic desire to suppress facts in favor of emotional arguments. why do you help perpetuate by downvoting my own posts on the subject and refusing to listen to alternative views?",1,-2,-2
364722,"""what are you telling me, steve?"" director collins slammed his mug of coffee down on his desk, his transmitter quiet as he spoke.    ""well, sir, it seems that there's some other planet with life, according to the eggheads in the heat scope room. they say they've found heat signatures on some planet in our neighboring galaxy."" he paused, debating his next choice of words. ""they want us to send someone."" collins swore as he spat out his coffee, ruining his brand new suit.    ""how the hell are we going to get the money from our guys in the capital? there's so much wrong with this. i don't... call me back after lunch."" he slammed the button on his transmitter, ending the call. steve sighed as his suggestion was shot down.     after three years of planning, it was finally happening. steven shockley was reveling in his achievement. a few years ago, his co-workers and him had found one of the most significant scientific discoveries in mankind's history while operating the seemingly fruitless infrared observatory. while luke was spinning the wheel out of frustration, the systems auto-locked on something. his laughing had stopped, and he had emitted a confused grunt. it was a specific area in the closest galaxy to their own, with life-like heat signatures. years later, their representatives had convinced congress to pass their idea for an inter-galactic journey. no one had ever dreamed of something like this before. the *invincible*, humainty's largest spacecraft ever built, was lined up on the launch pad. fifty brave men and women had been selected to participate in this voyage, and they would not be coming back. because of the unfathomable distance between the two planets, the ship had to be fully capable of sustaining life, as well as supporting infants. it would take twenty years to reach the planet, even with their faster-than-light booster system. steve was snapped out of his reminiscing by a voice over the loudspeakers. ""*launch will commence in thirty minutes.*""     sarah opened her palm to reveal the small token her mother had given her. it was a small gold ring, the one her husband had given to her for marriage. it was her most valuable treasure. the ship's vi pulled her seat into position, right behind her. she calmly stepped back, the ship strapping her in. she was one of the fifty men and women chosen to travel to another galaxy for the first time. she knew she would be sacrificing everything she ever knew, yet she still accepted her mission. *launch commencing in two minutes.*"" there was no backing out now. her stomach churned, and her heart leapt into her throat. there were several hands waving below at the departing astronauts. two of them were for her. her partner, george, sheepishly grinned in the seat beside her. everyone was nervous about the upcoming flight. ""*t-minus thirty.*"" it was coming. she was exhilarated, yet terrified at the same time. ""*t-minus five...*"" she slammed her eyelids against each other. this was the ride of a lifetime. ""*four...*"" george began to silently cry. ""*three...*"" even the ship's systems were silent. ""*two...*"" former director collins sat in the bleachers in the field, fuming, yet ecstatic at the same time. ""*one...*"" *goodbye,* thought sarah. the engines roared, astronauts screamed, and the crowd cheered as the ship began its climb to space. the journey had begun.     ""look at them. they're so cute."" george and sarah were in their late fifties now. they were in the medbay for a daily checkup. on the *invincible,* maintaining good health was essential. the entire mission would be a bust if the crew were to be unable to operate due to the flu, or something equally as trivial. sarah's skin wrinkled as her worn face smiled again. ""yeah... just think, these little guys and gals are going to be replacing the new crew on here."" over the past thirty years, each crew member was required to submit a dna sample to be replicated and born as a test tube baby. it was the ship's way of maintaining a crew. the crew she was referring to, however, was the generation that had been cloned in the first few months of the voyage. by the *invincible's* schedule, it was the perfect time to produce children. george nodded, and his thoughts shifted towards home. he blew air through his nose as he thought about what new sport or trend their homeworld had moved onto. it was always something new. when they were young, they had always managed to keep up with it. now, if they were back there, they would likely be confused and baffled, as their grandparents had been. he knew his life was coming to a close one of these upcoming years. *this has been a good life,* he thought.    sarah was leaping with joy. the *invincible* was nearing her destination. it had been one hundred and ninety-nine years since the spacecraft had leapt into the sky, and now, it was going to come down again. the final generation of children were in their early twenties, and they were ready to make contact with whatever this new species was. by the ship's infrared scope, the life they had spotted two hundred years ago still existed, and was even more populous than before, much like their own species. for the first time in over a century, the blue-white glow from outside the view panels subsided. the crew all gathered around their nearest panel, and were completely awestruck with what they were seeing. ""it's... my lord..."" julia's jaw dropped, and she was at a loss for words. in her eyes was a spectacular view of the orion nebula, as it was called. her friend, percy, was sprinting over to her ""what is it? i bet it's not *that*... whoa."" he was similarly awestruck at the view. ""it's like nothing i've ever seen."" while the crew was busy stargazing, the vi autopiloted the ship towards a globe of blue, green, and other spectacular colors. their destination was ahead.     the electromagnetic boots that the crew was required to wear were remotely shut down, and the centrifuge was put out of operation. the nearby planet was close enough so that the crew members could use its gravity instead of the artifical gravity generated by the ship. ""*strap yourself into your respective seats, crew members.*"" two hundred and five years ago, no one would have dreamed of this occasion. now, humanity was setting foot on a planet in another galaxy, inhabited with alien life. this was humanity's biggest achievement since managing to bang two rocks together in a cave. suddenly, a jolt rocked through the ship, and their motion stopped. the crew was close to panicking, as they didn't know if this was supposed to happen. their twelve electromagnetic seat straps disengaged, and they were free to move. ""*the atmosphere on this planet is breathable, so no exosuits will be required,*"" stated the vi of the ship with a cheery tone. the crew members were herded into a small chamber, and it began to move down once everyone was inside. ""my god, is this really happening?"" questioned sarah, incredulously. with the same sheepish grin his great-great-great-great-grandfather had mustered upon leaving their world two hundred years ago, george nodded, his stomach lurching. they heard a hissing noise, and a panel on the wall removed itself. the landing craft had arrived.     twenty crew members volunteered to stay on the ship. if something went wrong, it couldn't jeopardize the mission that had taken so long to achieve. the thirty that comprised the landing crew, however, were marching down a hallway towards the door. a stairway had been lowered for landing, and all that remained was for the crew to set foot. george took a deep breath, which was hard in the confined space he was in. the door opened, and he braced himself for landing. when a full view of the surrounding area was captured in his eyes, he was baffled. the area was covered in vegetation, and the area on which they had landed was crossed with a stone path. a small creature with greyish fur and a bushy tail stared at them, as if they had been there for ages. after a few seconds of curiosity, the animal turned away and resumed climbing up the large stalk to which it was attached. george, percy, thomas, and several others took the first steps on to this new planet. ""this... ground. it feels... somehow familiar,"" stated maria, as if in a trance. in fact, every one of the landing crew was misty eyed. their moment of consideration was interrupted by another indigenous species. ""yip yip! yip yip yip!"" a small beast, larger than the one before, was charging them. ""run! it's coming for us!"" benjamin bolted back into the ship, seeking cover from the thing. george, however, being the headstrong, stubborn person he was, stood his ground. as his crewmates cowered behind the steel wall of the landing craft, george grinned from ear to ear at this strange animal's demeanor. it was leaping up and down at his feet, incessantly yipping for attention. he took a great risk, and extended his hand toward the beast's head. it momentarily calmed, giving george a window to place his hand on it's head. it seemed to like this, and he continued. ""hey guys, come here! this thing is cute!"" he beckoned to his cowardly friends. they feebly approached the animal, and it was basking in the limelight. they were all affectionate for this new-found creature, when a woman, seemingly of their own species, rushed them in a different manner than the thing they were petting. in her hand was a strip of something, likely some sort of cloth, with a loop at the end. the loop, however, had been broken by something. ""ohmigod, i am so sorry! my little fluffy here just... what is that?..."" she was rushing her speaking, with a strong hint of embarrassment in her voice, which quickly transformed into disbelief. ""are you... what are you?"" she backed away, as if just realizing something. being the brave one of the group, george stepped forth. ""we are from a different planet, gaia by our tongue. we do not know what it is that you call it. we detected life on this planet, and two hundred years ago, our vessel was launched into space to journey to this planet. where are we?"" trying to speak, her lips moved, but noise did not come out. without warning, her eyes rolled back, and the soft ground cushioned her fall into unconsciousness.     mere hours later, the landing crew of thirty men and women were strolling through the marble halls of the center of the place they had landed in. the landing crew had absolutely no idea what the significance of the place was, other than the fact that it was their equivalent of a town hall, five hundred years before they had taken off from their planet. they were being led by men in tight black clothing with small bolts of fabric dangling from their neck. they were each carrying something small in their hand, but by the way they treated it, it was of no small importance. *those must be some spiritual artifact,* thought daniel. the men, after their brief stroll down the hall, pushed open a set of wooden blockers. inside, the ground was a vegetation-like green, and a man of dark skin tone sat behind a wooden block, dressed similarly to their escorts. in a deep, sullen voice, he spoke.     ""so, my mens' reports tell me that you say you're from another planet."" by the way he carried himself, he was someone important. however, with this importance, he displayed a sense of humility. strangely, one of the shyer ones of the group, vlad was the one that spoke up.    ""yes, mister. we have been sent to investigate claims of similar life to ours, and i guess our hunch paid off."" vlad was always one to inject a small bit of humor in the situation, no matter how dire. the man chuckled. ""yes, i guess it has. where is your planet? we haven't found anything even close to life in the vast expanse of the universe.""     ""it's on the edge of your closest galaxy. the only reason we got here so fast is because of our faster-than-light travel. how advanced is your ftl?"" felix asked, being the scientist of the group. the man stood baffled, seemingly not understanding what they were saying.    ""you mean to tell me you can go faster than light?"" he fumbled over his words.    ""yes, sir. we found a sort of loophole in space that allowed us to travel faster than any photon, something to do with negative curvature in the fabric of space and time."" the man behind the desk was growing faint at the mere mention of this.    ""this is incredible! how quickly can you report back to your home?"" he asked, chuckling with glee.    ""with our technology...""felix threw some fingers up and his eyes looked to the sky as he thought. ""fifteen years. then again, i'm not sure if the technology to receive our transmissions still exist. we've been gone a long time."" he nodded with resignment.     ""okay then. well, i guess that's our best shot at extraterrestrial communication. in the meantime, you're welcome to stay here!"" he stated, his face gaining joy as he spoke. *this might be a bigger discovery for them than for us,* george thought. ""we can take your ship into one of our lockups to be retrieved at your notice.""    ""speaking of staying here, where exactly might *here* be?"" questioned percy, a serious attitude possessing him. the dark man paused, and after short consideration, replied:    ""earth.""",1,1,1

'streetlamp... le moose?' she says.   he looks up from the discussion he's having with one of the buddies that he'd made through george - talking about cologne or something like that - 'yes miss,' he says. he looks around, catching the eye of floral girl - winking at her once again.   she giggles - blushing.   they start dating a few weeks later, her names abigail, it's a good relationship - he treats her well, not needy - not clingy, but just enough attention for her to feel loved, for her to spread the rumour that he's an amazing boyfriend, and an amazing guy.   #  junior year, streetlamp and abigail have broken up - it was mutual. it wasn't because there were problems in the relationship, floral girl just started thinking that they should see other people, she didn't feel like she was good enough for him. he always treated her so well, and she'd never dated a guy before. it was feeling too serious, and she didn't want to get serious so soon.   streetlamp? he didn't mind, he made sure they remained friends - they still eat lunch together most days, take the same classes and talk a lot. he started playing football, quarterback - coach is saying that his ap calc and physics classes are really helping him with his arch, and his ap classes in ancient history have made him a master strategist.   nobody quite knows how he does it - 8 ap classes in junior year while being the quarterback of the #7 ranked team in the country. he practices incessantly, studies even more. it should take it's toll on his health, but it doesn't, he stays on top of it all.   by now, the whole school knows who he is, and there's a non stop stream of sophmores and juniors approaching him in the hallway asking if he wants to come to this or that party. he's the sweetheart of the school, and the sort of boy that every girl in the school fantasises about. george? linebacker on the team, best buddies by now - him and the girl dated for a while but it's well and truly over now.  enter friday night; house party in the suburbs. streetlamp rocks up with buddies late, 10 or 11 at night. everyone is well and truly drunk. a huge cheer erupts when they walk in - he's handed a beer as soon as he enters. he offers it to george - he doesn't drink, his mind is his best instrument, he doesn't want to damage it.   senior's hanging by the staircase, she's wearing an olive miniskirt and one of those ripped tees. her hard body, tightly encased. 'hi streetlamp,' she says.   'well hi there.'   'you want to come upstairs with me?'   fade to black.   #  senior year, streetlamp and abigail have drifted apart.   he's dating the tightbody. she's 18 months older, going to college nearby. he thought there might be some issue due to her being college, him senior year, but no such issue. he was a local hero by now - the football team was speculated to be #1 in the country this year with him as the qb - schools all over the country were scouting him.   people latched onto her to be friends by association, she filters all the ones that aren't good people - she's good like that. he's studying pretty hard, and training too - it's a big year for him. he spends half his time at the college taking classes, the other half is at the school, a few classes being taken, but the majority spent devising new plays for the football team.   he's turned into a natural born leader.   he goes out to one of the girlfriends college parties. while he's there, he gets introduced to this girl - amber. now, amber isn't what he's used to - the girls that surround him are the typical preppy 'forever 21' shoppig silicon clones of one another. amber though, she was witty, dry, ironic and twisted.   they become friends, no romantic inclinations. the girlfriend gets worried. streetlamp tells her not to, streetlamp only has loving enough for one girl - and that's her.   few weeks later, amber and streetlamp are becoming pretty tight - amber reveals she's a lesbian. streetlamp, being the classy motherfucker/good guy that he is doesn't care. instead, he puts some feelers out and finds a few girls around her age that he thinks she'll like.   he sets up a few blind dates. the first one, didn't go so well - they didn't get along. the second, it seemed to go great, but amber wasn't a fan. she's getting pretty distant with him, he asks her what's up - she reveals she actually is in love with tightbody.   dilemma.   streetlamp le moose, being deserving of the good guy name, sets up the threesome. amber gets to live out her desires, tightbody gets to experience the typical lesbian phase in college, and he sits back.  the news of his sexual prowess spreads. tightbody ends up falling for amber, and they start dating. streetlamp le moose, angry? nope. he's happy for them. he's proud.   #  graduation. valedictorian, #1 football team in the country, accepted a place at stanford doing pre-law. he gives his speech and talks about his life, how he's been empowered and how he's lucky to have such a loving and caring family. how his dad is his hero. he starts crying - he doesn't hide it. he keeps his chin up and lets the tears roll down his face as he tells them about all that his mother and father gave up for him, how they taught him to be the person that he is today.   a lot of people are crying along with him.   after the ceremony, the principal shakes his hand, telling him that it's the finest speech that he has ever heard.  he throws a party that night, he asks his mother and father to stay home and celebrate with him. he's still not drinking, but he lets everyone around him drink. nobody gets too wasted out of mutual respect for him.    the doorbell rings. one of his buddies starts to get up to answer it.  'no, dude, relax! have a good time,' streetlamp says.  he opens the door and who's there; floral.  his voice catches in his throat, he stammers for a second, 'h-hi,' he manages to spit out. he's never been tongue tied around a girl before. she's got long auburn hair now, it goes past her shoulders, and she's wearing a floral print dress.   'nice dress, i haven't seen you in one like that since...' his thought trailed.   'since preschool, i know.'   she smiled at him.   #  second year of college, starting qb of the stanford cardinal.   he's got a passing rating of 176.4 over the season. his coach says that he's really become a leader in the team.  a lot of the pro teams are looking at him, he's being pressured into declaring for the draft. it's a dilemma, streetlamp loves football, but he also loves learning.   he's sharp witted in his law classes; topping the yeargroup. he's been asked by his professors to help ta'ing some of the first year classes. they're pretty boring; he didn't really enjoy them the first time around, but streetlamp has never been one to turn down an opportunity.   first day as a ta - introduction to corporate law. he turns up about 20 minutes early and takes a seat in the third row back. he's always wanted to pull the cliched 'talk to student, make comments about the lecturer, walk up and become lecturer' move. he sits down next to a girl - cropped brunette hair spiked up at the back, a biker jacket on.   'well, you're a rare sight in a class like this,' he says, turning to her.  she turns to him, grinning. 'streetlamp?'   'abigail? i hardly recognised you.'   she laughed, 'it's been an interesting year.'   'i can tell.'   a middle aged man walked in, heading down the stairs towards the front of the stage.  'you're taking first year law?' she asked.   'something like that.'   the man took the podium, scanning the students. 'ah, streetlamp, just who i wanted to see. get on up here,' he says - the attention of the whole lecture theatre suddenly on him.   that year, him and abigail get close again, friends - they talk most nights. it turns out their dorms aren't that far away from each other. turns out that she'd gotten into pre-med at harvard, but dropped out during her first semester. she'd taken to goign out every night, partying hard enough to make most college students envious.   she'd changed. she was no longer a sweet girl, but she was an amazing one. she never acted like an idiot around him, or sucked up to him, or tried to be cute - she was just who she was.   as the year progressed, the football season wore on. they were going undefeated in their division. two other teams were undefeated too though, it was uncertain whether or not they'd go to the bcs. when they were selected, there was an uproar. everyone just presumed it was because of streetlamp that they'd gotten through.   that year, they win the bcs.   #  third year, last year of pre-law.   abigail and streetlamp start dating. the coach of the cardinal's didn't like it to begin with. there was a lot of conflict - he thought that she was bad for him, that she was dangerous. the cropped spikey hair and leather she always wore - even in the dead of summer didn't help streetlamp's case.   it was a tuesday night that the sparks truly flew. streetlamp was sitting in coach's office, a combination of mahogany and red lush carpet (coach had been given a raise after the bcs championship).  'it isn't acceptable streetlamp. i can't have my star athlete going around dating somebody like that. it isn't just about you anymore. it's about your career, it's about the public perception, it's about our fans and the teams that are scouting you - that want you. is it really worth risking all of that for -' he paused, a look of disgust on his face, 'her?'  'quite frankly coach,' he said, staring him straight in the eyes, 'i couldn't care less. i try to always do what's right, and to always be honest, and that's what i'm going to do now. abigail is the girl that i care about, that i love, her appearance be damned. she is the single most kind, caring, intelligent and brilliant girl that i have ever met, and if you were to ask me to give up either her or football. well, i'd have to have a long think about that.'  'boy, i've been where you are before. i've cared for, god damn - i've loved girls with more of me than i care to admit, but this is your future. this is the rest of your life. she isn't the type that you marry. she's the type that you fuck for a few years, spend your fortune on and then leaves you for your best buddy.' he inhaled, tearing up a little bit, 'i just don't want to see you hurt by her streetlamp.'   'i understand coach, but you have to understand me. i've known her for most of my life, i've trusted her with all that i am, and she hasn't betrayed me. sure, we have rough patches, we drift apart sometimes, but we always come back. we. always. come. back. football is one thing coach, but a life without the girl that i love - that's something completely different.'   they sat in silence for a little while. coach staring at his desk and streetlamp, at his lap.   streetlamp's voice croaked as he started to speak again; 'if you're asking me to choose between football and the love of my life, you know the answer.'   that season, they went undefeated again with streetlamp starting every single game. his passing rating sat on 192.1 for the season, and the speculation surrounding his decision at the end of the year was making the news every single night.   a lot of the pro teams have been flying out their coaches to talk to him. he's not sure. he's conflicted; ambivalent.   it was late on a friday that he decided to seek advice. he called his father; the rock of his life. the man that had always been there for him, loved and cared for him. the man that would give up everything for his son's happiness.   'son,' his father had said, 'you've always loved football, but you've always loved helping people too. i think that's the quality that i most admire in you. you're a special kid, the best son that a father can hope for, and one that i'm so very proud of.' streetlamp could hear his father crying now, 'i don't know what decision you'll make, but i know you, and i know that whatever decision you come to is going to be the right one.'   #  draft day 2032.   streetlamp is paraded across the stage along with the rest of the speculated top draft picks. he wears a nice suit with a plain white shirt underneath and a crisp dark tie. just looking at him, you can tell that behind those eyes lurks an incredible intellect.  the introductory proceedings stretch on for half an hour, but finally, they're backstage again. streetlamp sighs, his nerves holding his chest in a vice.   'it's going to be fine honey.' she says, hugging him tight to her chest.   'i know. it's just. wow.'   'who would've thought, hey?'  'who would've thought.'  'i always knew, i read a story about you once,' said his father, joking to relieve the tension. 'best god damn story ever written.'   streetlamp laughed. 'that's ridiculous.'   'loosened you up though, didn't it?'   'sure did.'   there was a short silence. streetlamp rubbed his eyes.   'did you get much sleep last night?' his mother asked.   'not enough.' streetlamp said, 'the nerves, y'no.'   'first pick, i'm telling you son. la jaguars - your new home.'   the introductions are done - the elderly peyton manning stands in front of thousands of fans - millions watching live at home.   'the first pick of the 2032 draft goes to the la jaguars.'   a tense minute passes. streetlamp watches the action on a small tv in the backstage area - a camera up in his face.   another minute passes. he starts to panic. abigail clutches his hand. staring at her, he can't help but smile. over the last year, she'd traded her cropped hair for a longer style, and her leather in for sweaters and blouses. she never did say why, but he suspected that word got back to her about his confrontation with the coach. he'd asked, but she just denied.   '... and with the first pick of the 2032 nfl draft, the la jaguars pick... streetlamp le moose!'   his jaw drops, exhaling deeply, his eyes wide open. his mother and father are jumping up and down screaming, abigail is clutching on to him tighter than ever. 'you did it,' she says, 'you did it.'   the day after, the contract had been drawn up, including the special circumstances. the news story broke that night 'streetlamp le moose - signed for $47 million over 7 years. reported to also be attending law school as well.'   he's taking the degree externally.   he'd told his father the day before the signing. he'd been accepted to yale.   #  2036   he hesitated briefly, enough time for a grin to stretch ear to ear.   'i do.'  'you may now kiss the bride.'  with that, he removed the veil from over abigails face. she smiled back at him. her hair was well past her shoulders now, and stuck a little to the veil. he wiped it off, tucking it behind her ear.   'i love you, you know.'   she smiled 'i know.'   in that moment, during that kiss, he felt like he'd never kissed a girl before, like this was the beginning of a lot of firsts.  he slipped the ring onto her finger, it was simple - plain. white gold with an inlay of diamonds.  she slipped his on, plain gold. it contrasted beautifully with the 2 over-designed superbowl rings on his right hand.   the same year, he stood in front the graduation class of yale law school.   'i don't know very many of you,' he said, 'and that's a shame. i don't doubt that you're all wonderful people, and it pains me to have not had the opportunity to meet and spend time with you all. we have all had a tough few years, struggling through corporate law and the intricacies of civil procedure, but, we made it.""  'today,"" he started, staring out at the crowd 'we stand not students, but lawyers. we stand as the guardians of justice. we stand as the defenders of good. we stand as the people that can make a physical, tangible change to the world for the better.'  'i want to tell you all a story. in middle school, i fell in love with a girl. i ran into her again in my second year of pre-law. she didn't look like she used to, or act like the person she once was, but love doesn't discriminate.'   'i had to make on of the hardest decisions of my life that year. my coach asked me to choose between playing football and being with the person that i love. he asked me to choose because of how she looked, of how she was perceived, of the person that he believed that she was judging only on the superficial. i chose her.'   'that day, it struck me, there's a lot of people in this world that judge and believe based solely off the superficial. there are a lot of people that don't care to take the time to get to know somebody, to care for them and understand them. i ask everybody here today to remember this, and hold it as tightly as i do.'   'it is our job now to fight for people who can't fight anymore, it is not our job to judge them for how they got there. it is our job to create permanent, lasting change - not to make our world appear better, to make it actually better.'   'i would like to leave you today with a quote; ‚Äúthe real judges of your character aren't your neighbors, your relatives, or even the people you play bridge with. the folks who really know you are waiters, waitresses, and clerks.""'  'thankyou.'    #   2041  his office overlooked the field. deep, white lines punctuated the lush grass. 'ever going to upgrade to astroturf sir?' streetlamp asked.   the franchise owner laughed. it was a deep laugh, jolly even - he was the type of man that could make a child believe there was santa for a few more years. 'i can't stand the stuff,' he said, 'if it's not real, it can't be good.'   'ah, i'm a bit the same, i've been almost too careful since chair came along.'   'chair? your son right?'   'yes sir. chair de'burlap.'   'interesting name. strong name.' he said, his brow creased, nodding. 'you think he's going to become a legendary quarterback like his father?'   streetlamp laughed, 'i'm not a legend yet sir.'   the owner, suddenly taking a stern tone, 'son, you will be after you sign this. you do understand what this makes you, right?'   'the highest paid quarterback in the league?'  'the highest paid quarterback in the league.' he shook his head. 'what're you going to do with all that money?'   'good sir, i'm going to do good.'   'i'm sure you will son.'   that night, streetlamp picked up his phone. he went to speeddial and pressed 1. his fathers voice met him on the other end of the line.   'hey dad,' he said.   'streetlamp! how're you going? how's chair?'   'we're good dad. i signed the new contract today.'   'i saw - it's all over the news. $180 million, it's a lot of money.'   'that it is.'   'any plans for what you're going to do with it?'   'i'm opening my own charity. i've been doing a bit of pro-bono work with sexually assaulted women,' he paused, 'these women dad. they're broken. they're violated and they're broken. it's like somebody has reached inside and stolen all that is theirs. removed any safety in their life.'   he paused.   his father remained silent on the other end of the line. he knew by now when streetlamp just needed to compose his thoughts.   'i can't make it all better for them dad, but i can try to help them.'   'that's very noble.'  'it's just the right thing to do.'  'you always do the right thing.'   streetlamp heard the doorknob jiggle, and watched as abigail got home.   'hey babe, good day?' she'd shed the baby weight amazingly quick.   'it was great, i'm just on the phone with dad.'   'tell him i say hi.'   'will do.'   'was that abi?' streetlamp's dad asked.  'sure was. she says hi.'   'i'll let you go then. tell her i say hi back.'   'okay, bye dad. i love you.'   'love you too son.'   streetlamp leaned back in the chair. his head throbbing.   'i saw the news,' said abigail.  'it's hard not to now-a-days.'   '$180 million is a lot of money.'   'i know.'   'how much are you pledging to the charity.'   'i wanted to talk to you about that. i was thinking...' his sentence trailed off.   'yes?'   'i was thinking i'd pledge $170 million. if you're okay with that.'  'i'm more than okay. i'm proud of you.'   #   2046:  'breaking news: jaguars' star quarterback streetlamp le moose has called a press conference.'    abigail stood opposite him, adjusting his tie. 'are you sure you want to do this?'   'i've never been more sure.'   'but, you love football.'   'i love my family more. last week was too close for comfort, i can't lose you. i can't leave you to look after chair and annie alone.'   'you're a good father.'   'you're the best mother.'   she smiled at him, and pecked him on the lips.   a thin blonde woman pokes her head out from the corridor, 'mr streetlamp, sir. are you ready?'   'yes, i am jessie.'   he reached into his pocket, making sure that his palm cards were there. adjusted his suit jacket, inhaled and exhaled exactly once and walked out, making his way on stage.   'and here he is, moving surprisingly well considering last weeks accident,' said one news reporter.  'he's spent the last week flanked by reports that he's injured and unable to play for the rest of the season, looking at him now, i feel confident in speculating that those reports are false.' another said.   taking the lecturn, streetlamp sighed, pulling out his palm cards and scanning the first one before he began speaking.   'ladies and gentleman, reporters, sportsfans, the american public, today, i stand in front of you with two things to tell you. it is with great sadness that i must announce my retirement from the nfl.'   a wave of frenzied whispers crashed over the crowd.   'last week, as you all know, i was on the recieving end of a high tackle, and as i'm sure you all know, it rendered me unconscious. funnily enough, it was being knocked unconcious that woke me up to the fact that i'm no longer a young man. i'm not in the same athletic shape as i once was.'   'i'm not going to lie to you, it was scary for me. i have an amazing son, chair de'burlap, who's starting preschool this year, and the most beautiful daughter any man could hope for. i could not bear to lose either one of them, or have them grow up without a father.'   'my father was the lynchpin of my childhood, really, he's still the lynchpin of my life now. he is the most caring, passionate, loving person in my life, mark my mother, and i don't think i'd be one tenth of the person i am today if it wasn't for him.'   'i've been blessed with an amazing career, and a team full of the best people i could ever hope to meet, and i apologise to them for putting them in this position. i'm sorry, but my family will always come first. marcus delroy is a brilliant quarterback, and i'm sure the team will be more than safe with him.'   'i've achieved a lot of things over the last few years. i've opened my own charity, i've defended the rights of women who couldn't afford defending, i've raised money for cancer awareness and for lower-income neighbourhoods. i've always had the desire to make the world a better place, and i've always aspired to live up to this desire. it is with this in mind that i make my second announcement.'  he looked down at his cards, breathing in and out deeply, 'in the next election, i will be running as governor of california. thankyou.' he walked off stage.   #  2056:  'ladies and gentleman,' streetlamp said, his voice poised, his back straight, 'i would like to thank you all for your ongoing support over the last two years. i would like to thank you all for your faith in me, and for the faith in my party.'  'today,' he paused, 'today is the beginning of a new day. the start of a new people. we have experienced economic hardship, political insecurity, civil unrest and abuse of powers in this century, and i am proud to say that i will the be the one to bring an end to this.'   an eruption of applause encapsulated the room.   'the united states was once a great country. it was once a nation that stood for the very fundamental rights of freedom, liberty and justice. it pains me, as an american, that our fine country was sullied by the irresponsible and reckless actions of a minority put in a position of power, and i'm sure it pains you too.'   'i ran in this election to give a voice to the people that have never had a voice. to restore the country to a place that judged not on what is presented superficially, but on the quality of their ideas, the strength of their convictions, and on the greatness of their character.'   'citizens of the united states, citizens of the world, today, we have made the first step towards a tangible change for the better. we have made the first step to the enablement of our people. we have made the first step towards restoring our country to the greatness that it once was.'  'i am thankful, and i am grateful to all who voted for me. i look forward to creating a better country, and creating a better world.'   with that, streetlamp existed the stage. abigail waited in the wings for him, embracing him she whispered seductively 'hello mr. president.'   he smiled at her, chuckling, 'hello, first lady,'   #  this is what happens if you call your son streetlamp le moose. are you really going to deprive him of that?",1,2,
402904,"denying a child medical treatment when they need it, forcing them to go through puberty as the wrong gender, *is* making a decision for them. one that has serious, permanent negative consequences for the child.

[**here**](http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/documents/supportingcaringfortranschildren.pdf) are the recent guidelines released by the american academy of pediatrics. tl;dr version - yes, young children can identify their own gender identity, and some of those young kids are trans.  [**gender identity**](https://www.healthychildren.org/english/ages-stages/gradeschool/pages/gender-identity-and-gender-confusion-in-children.aspx) is typically expressed around age 4. it probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. and sometimes, a child's gender identity is not the one typically associated with their appearance. and they will suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.   when this happens, transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. and this is a very slow, cautious process. years of temporary and reversible treatment are required before even hormone therapy can be started, and hormone therapy itself is still mostly reversible. reconstructive surgery typically waits until the patient's late teens or early adulthood at the earliest.  for a preadolescent child, transition doesn't require any medical treatment. they're androgynous already; transition at that age is social, and consists of hair, clothes, name, and pronouns. if a child needs to live as a girl/boy, let them. if their condition dramatically improves, keep going.  medical help becomes relevant at adolescence, and is only available under intense medical and psychological guidance. if a child thinks they may need to transition, or if they have already done so, the first line of intervention is temporary puberty delaying treatment. this treatment has no long term effects, and has been used for decades to delay puberty in kids who would otherwise have started it too early. if the child doesn't need to transition after all, they stop the treatment and puberty picks up where it left off.  but if they do need to transition, this treatment allows them to do so without the effects of an inappropriate puberty acting against them. it is difficult to express how vitally important this is. forcing a child to go through puberty as the wrong gender has severe, life long negative physical and psychological effects. many trans children denied treatment attempt suicide. those who survive are still robbed of the childhood they should have had, and enter adulthood facing tens of thousands of dollars of medical treatment to repair damage that they should never have been forced to suffer.  if a child goes socially transitions, delays puberty, and by their early/mid-teens they have lived as a gender atypical to their sex for years and have no desire to go back, the chances that they'll change their minds are basically zero. at that point they can start hormone therapy, which will send them through puberty as the correct gender.  concerns about cisgender children being mistaken for trans are understandable, but misguided. nobody is making this decision for the child - they are allowing the child to tell them what they need. and no permanent decisions are made quickly or on a whim. when a child transitions, it is because *not* doing so is killing them.",1,2,-2
357591,"every generation eventually becomes out of touch with what the crazy kids are doing even if they try to stay engaged. this leads to oldsters thinking kids are speaking a different language and what the hell is that noise they're listening to? we had good music back when i was your age! get offa mah lawn!!!  where i think gex x differs somewhat from previous generations is that we've had many massive changes from technical to geopolitical occur in our lifetimes and while kids these days simply accept things as always having been there that we know didn't exist a couple of decades ago like, oh say, the internet! i remember talking to my girlfriend about this thing i'd read about call the world wide web and something called a browser named mosaic which could combine text and images. this was around 1993. a 16-year-old now doesn't remember aol was the way people got on the internet and used to have an hourly fee. dial-up? what's that, grandpa?  every year around graduation you see those emails or facespace posts about ""today's graduates..."" not knowing what *""you sound like a broken record""* means or what a flipside is. but every generation has not known certain things about previous generations lives; gen x grew up in the final years of the cold war and while we had the ""nuclear freeze"" movement and red dawn, we didn't do ""duck and cover"" drills. i remember telling my g/f in 1989 that i thought it'd be totally possible the berlin wall would be gone ""within 10 years""; it fell 6 months later. (i'd like to go on record that i think a three-way with jennifer lawrence and anne hathaway is bound to happen within a year.)  i think the biggest conflicts between gen x and today's teens is that it seems kids these days are spoiled, entitled brats who have had everything handed to them by overindulgent parents and thus they're sullen, self-absorbed emo twits who have no real-world coping skills because they've been participant-ribboned, chemically warehouse for control (add? we used to call that ""youthful energy."") and don't get why it's wrong to bring their mother to a job interview.   i blame a lot of it on nirvana because music used to be escapism promising kids that the good life was at a party with fast cars and hot girls, but became self-pitying, mopey and miserable as it fed back into kids ennui until some brightness returned with mouskabimbos and boy bands. (hate 'em all you want for being trite, but at least they weren't dour sour whiners.) here's a news flash, kids: it has always sucked to be a kid. your parents were unhappy when they were your age and their parents weren't happy. you'll outgrow it, so toughen up, buttercups!  /rant",1,,-1
449584,"&gt;  so, where had some of these adopted babies come from? consider the case of ana escobar, a young guatemalan woman who in march 2007 reported to police that armed men had locked her in a closet in her family‚Äôs shoe store and stolen her infant. after a 14-month search, escobar found her daughter in pre-adoption foster care, just weeks before the girl was to be adopted by a couple from indiana. dna testing showed the toddler to be escobar‚Äôs child. in a similar case from 2006, raquel par, another guatemalan woman, reported being drugged while waiting for a bus in guatemala city, waking to find her year-old baby missing. three months later, par learned her daughter had been adopted by an american couple.  &gt;  on jan. 1, 2008, guatemala closed its doors to american adoptions so that the government could reform the broken process. britain, canada, france, germany, the netherlands, and spain all stopped accepting adoptions from the country several years earlier, citing trafficking concerns. but more than 2,280 american adoptions from the country are still being processed, albeit with additional safeguards. stolen babies have already been found in that queue; guatemalan authorities expect more.  &gt;  guatemala‚Äôs example is extreme; it is widely considered to have the world‚Äôs most notorious record of corruption in foreign adoption. but the same troubling trends have emerged, on smaller scales, in more than a dozen other countries, including albania, cambodia, ethiopia, liberia, peru, and vietnam. the pattern suggests that the supply of adoptable babies rises to meet foreign demand‚Äîand disappears when western cash is no longer available. for instance, in december 2001, the u.s. immigration service stopped processing adoption visas from cambodia, citing clear evidence that children were being acquired illicitly, often against their parents‚Äô wishes. that year, westerners adopted more than 700 cambodian children; of the 400 adopted by americans, more than half were less than 12 months old. but in 2005, a study of cambodia‚Äôs orphanage population, commissioned by the u.s. agency for international development, found only a total of 132 children who were less than a year old‚Äîfewer babies than westerners had been adopting every three months a few years before.  &gt;  even countries with large populations, such as india, rarely have healthy infants and toddlers who need foreign parents. india‚Äôs large and growing middle class, at home and in the diaspora, faces fertility issues like those of their developed-world counterparts. they too are looking for healthy babies to adopt; some experts think that these millions of middle-class families could easily absorb all available babies. the country‚Äôs pervasive poverty does leave many children fending for themselves on the street. but ‚Äúkids are not on the street alone at the age of 2,‚Äù cantwell, the child protection consultant, says. ‚Äúthey are 5 or 6, and they aren‚Äôt going to be adopted.‚Äù that‚Äôs partly because most of these children still have family ties and therefore are not legally available for adoption, and partly because they would have difficultly adjusting to a middle-class european or north american home. many of these children are deeply marked by abuse, crime, and poverty, and few prospective parents are prepared to adopt them.  &gt;  surely, though, prospective parents can at least feel secure that their child is truly an orphan in need of a home if they receive all the appropriate legal papers? unfortunately, no.",1,2,-2
418014,"sorry -- went right to the article for me.  breastfeeding and adoption question  i have a patient who is going to adopt a newborn in early october. she would like to breastfeed the baby. are there any reliable medications to induce lactation, or should she simply begin trying to pump in the near future?  response from  dena goffman, md, and peter s. bernstein, md, mph  dena goffman, md, fellow in maternal-fetal medicine, albert einstein college of medicine/montefiore medical center, bronx, new york                                                                                                                                                                                                         peter s. bernstein, md, mph, facog, associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology and women's health, albert einstein college of medicine/montefiore medical center, bronx, new york; medical director of obstetrics and gynecology, comprehensive family care center, montefiore medical center, bronx, new york  human milk is recognized as the optimal feeding for all infants, although preterm infants often require nutritional supplementation. the american academy of pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and partial breastfeeding (breastmilk plus complementary foods) for at least 12 months and as long as mutually desired thereafter.[1] well-recognized short-term benefits to the infant include improved nutrition, gastrointestinal function, host defense, and psychological well-being. breastfeeding is also associated with long-term benefits to the infant, both short and long-term benefits to the mother, and economic benefits for the family and society.[2]  given that it is well recognized that breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition and has many additional benefits, the question about breastfeeding in the setting of adoption is an important one. adopted infants in developing countries are usually breastfed, and successful lactation without the need for supplementation is crucial for the survival of adopted infants.[3] fortunately, success has been documented.[3-5] in industrialized countries, where supplemental feeds are readily available and are of good nutritional quality, lactation may not be required for survival but may provide substantial benefit to the mother and infant.  it is possible for women who have never been pregnant or have never lactated to successfully breastfeed. with the use of preparation, medications, artificial aids, tried techniques, and significant support, induced lactation can be achieved. preparing the breast can entail both administering medications and performing techniques. in women who are nulliparous or have never lactated, priming the breast with ethinyl estradiol 50 micrograms 3 times daily, or with 1-time administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 100 mg intramuscularly, is recommended. preparation of the breast should also be started in advance by using a breast pump for regular stimulation of the nipples.[3]  galactagogues are medications that can induce or enhance breast milk production and have been used for inadequate milk supply, induced lactation and relactation. the most extensively studied galactagogue, documented to be safe and effective, is metoclopramide (reglan). metoclopramide is a central dopamine antagonist that acts to stimulate prolactin release. recommended dosage options include 10 mg 2 to 4 times daily, followed by a taper rather than abrupt cessation. potential side effects include fatigue, anxiety, dizziness, diarrhea, and gastric cramping; more rarely, extrapyramidal symptoms or depression may develop. there have been no documented reactions in infants exposed to metoclopramide in breast milk.[6] chlorpromazine 25 mg 4 times daily can be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with metoclopramide. on rare occasions, when unsuccessful, methyldopa 125 mg 4 times daily may be added.[3]  domperidone (motilium) acts as a peripheral dopamine antagonist and also increases serum prolactin and milk yield. this is the only galactagogue proven effective through a small double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. it has fewer maternal side effects, and no side effects have been reported in infants exposed via breast milk. however, in the united states, domperidone can only be dispensed by a compounding pharmacy, and cost varies.[6]  fenugreek, a european herb from the pea family, has anecdotally been reported to increase milk production, although data are lacking. it is theorized to stimulate sweat production, which may enhance milk secretion since the breast is a modified sweat gland. the usual dose is 2 to 3 capsules 3 times a day until adequate milk production is attained.[6]  oxytocin, either oral or nasal spray, has been used in women with inadequate milk supply and is reported to cause a milk ""letdown"" effect. the medication causes contraction of the cells surrounding the alveoli and thus stimulates milk ejection, which may improve production by decreasing stasis.[6] given the mechanism of action, it seems that the use of oxytocin alone would be less useful in attempts to induce lactation.  to optimize breastfeeding potential, infants should be put to the breast as soon as possible after birth and frequently thereafter, about every 2 hours. artificial nipples should be avoided as babies learn different suckling techniques. to promote suckling when there is a lack of breast milk, formula can be poured over the areola from a cup or dropper to promote suckling. when supplementation of breast milk is necessary initially, other options include formula feeds given immediately after suckling with a cup and spoon or the use of lact-aid. lact-aid is a line attached to a pack which supplies formula through a feeding tube placed beside the maternal nipple. the infant learns to suckle at the breast while obtaining nutrition and does not become accustomed to a bottle. supplementation is gradually reduced as maternal milk supply increases.[4]  successful induction of lactation has been reported in adoptive mother-baby pairs. a group of 240 adopted infants is described in which 80% were previously bottle-fed, 35% of the mothers were nulliparous and 23% had never previously breastfed. of these infants, 75% were willing to nurse by the end of the first week of trying, and more than 75% of mothers felt positive about their lactation experience; 54% required supplementation for the duration of nursing, but 25% of women who had never been pregnant before were able to eliminate supplements completely before weaning off the breast. the benefit of bonding was generally felt to be more important than milk production.[5]  with appropriate medical treatment, use of techniques, motivation, perseverance, and support, breastfeeding is a realistic option, with significant benefits to both mother and infant, in the setting of adoption. posted 11/17/2005 references     1. gartner lm, morton j, lawrence ra, et al. breastfeeding and the use of human milk. pediatrics. 2005;115:496.    2. world health organization. global strategy for infant and young child feeding. 2002. available at: www.who.int/nut/documents/gs_infant_feeding_text_eng.pdf.    3. kramer p. breastfeeding of adopted infants. bmj. 1995;311:188-189.    4. lakhar b. breastfeeding in adopted babies. indian pediatrics. 2000;37:1114-1116.    5. waterston t. any questions. bmj. 1995;310:780.    6. betzold c. galactagogues. j midwifery women's health 2004;49:151-154.",1,1,1
846332,"i do have to apologize for being rude and sloppy in my comment. i managed to totally drop the actual point and response to your question and came off really poorly. sometimes the draw to pick stupid fights on the web is just too strong, and i was in a vulnerable and scrappy place. if you'll indulge me, here is my ""real"" response:  i do a lot of work with reproductive rights and am very active in working with poor and marginalized women and reproductive health. the babies in that album, not all, but a vast majority, experience only the sensory stimulus to pain/temp. the brain physiology that gives thought, the will to thrive, a personality even at an infant's age, is gone. the anencephaly deformity stymies the growth and development of the brain/brainstem/skull so that parts just don't form. essential parts. so, at that point with this information i ask what do we do? a creature that does nothing but respirate and feel intense pain should be allowed to whither and die eventually? or, do we recognize what this thing could have been, accept what this creature is, and with the disparity between the two and the realities all laid out, decide to end the pain and kill this malformed baby?   i think we should kill the baby.   you brought up consent... this implies that these infants are able to give consent, and since they cannot think let alone have the potential to speak, it's up to others to deal with the situation a birth like this presents- namely doctors and parents, that's it. i believe in abortion, to the point where i believe it's not even a necessary ""evil"" but a good cultural practice. i believe abortions into the second trimester are legitimate choices that are justified. i also believe in assisted suicide for the very ill. i think my fundamental disagreement with you is that there is no logical progression between infanticide under these circumstances and euthanizing the mentally disabled and the super elderly. these babies, and the fetuses and zygotes that are terminated have none of the makings of a person. they are cells and body parts. seeing my grandmother slip into decay and senility makes me have pangs of ""maybe it would be easier if.... maybe we can stop the pain....""  but she's still a thinking and feeling, salient human. her needs are met so that she can live as long as she can comfortably. my in-law family knew about the severe autism and retardation of their son in utero, but courageously went forward. the son was the cause of their subsequent divorce and requires 24 hr care. he is 20 now. but he feels. he feels happiness, anger, love, frustration. if he couldn't feel any of these things, what is he? who is he? he has the brain parts that allow all of these things; and that is the difference. he can't give consent, but has just enough of a shred of higher function that let's those who are consenting for him believe that he can have a life of quality, however that manifests for him. what is the quality of babies with anencephaly?   of course i wouldn't kill my grandmother out of my perceived sense of mercy. i would have terminated my cousin in the womb, as a clump of cells and parts- the mere potential of a human being. but once this disabled person is in the world, i'm not suggesting that you blankety kill people like this. i'm not hitler, i am disgusted by eugenics. differences in people is the beauty of our world. however, there is no shame in looking at the demands of of what a child like my cousin poses and deciding that you don't or can't handle that life-long sentence of caring for a profoundly special needs child. there is no shame in aborting this pregnancy. caregivers and their quality of life need to be considered in this just as much as what the quality of life would be for severely mentally disabled people that these parents and family are caring for. how can you be effective as a caregiver/parent if your needs are not also met and supported? so many women lose their lives to their children in this case, and i hate that many women are forced into this idea of maternal martyrdom, lest they be called bad mothers, profoundly selfish, and are shamed for their choices. if you knew that you had legitimate (or even not that legitimate) limitations that would truly effect and change your ability to care for this (as of now) clump that has been determined to be a (broadly) special needs kid, is it wrong to terminate the pregnancy? personally, i 100% do not think it's wrong.  if i unknowingly carried a anencephalic child to term, i'd end it's short, doomed life. i would not be able to live with myself if i just let this little creature die slowly and painfully, on it's own course like you said. i couldn't watch it cry nonstop, with it's exposed brain, and deformed eyes, and unnatural face. i would need to end it's and my own pain. i feel that the leap you're posing is ignoring the plainly obvious and abundant differences between situations. old folks and retards have higher function, beyond respirating and sensing physical stimuli, and anencephalic children do not. so, i view this situation and early term abortions as essentially the same, even though with anencephalic infants the potential possible with aborted pregnancies isn't even there.  the baby will die, and i'd rather shorten it's life of pain and bring death closer. this is protection, maternal instinct. i would do anything to protect my child from pain, even if that means i have to kill it post-birth.    i hope this is a better response to your post. thanks for indulging.",1,-2,-1

there were no innocent. he has said elsewhere that the novel is blindingly autobiographical and, though names obviously have been changed, you half believe him. we re mostly in 1970, at the moment when amis himself started to find his voice. formal commendations aside, few writers can match the spectacle of amis‚Äôs literary ascension during the 1980s. after establishing his name with a series of early comedies and satires that centered upon hip, sarcastic, urban youths ‚Äî the rachel papers, dead babies (1975), success (1978), and other people: a mystery story (1981) ‚Äî amis expanded his stylistic and thematic repertoire to produce his masterpiece, money: a suicide note (1984). twentieth-century literary history stills bears the imprint of this work, which represents for many scholars the commencement of amis‚Äôs middle ‚Äî and decidedly major ‚Äî period. following a collection of essays (the moronic inferno and other visits to america, 1986) and a book of short stories (einstein‚Äôs monsters, 1987), london fields appeared in 1989, joining money as two of the decade‚Äôs most incisive portraits of apocalyptic anxieties, nuclear fear, and bristling individualism.  .  http://imgur.com/wngovgo https://imgur.com/gdiydt7 http://imgur.com/uxuec1g https://reddit.com/3ufn0d",0,,

628666,"&gt; pass the lilly ledbetter fair pay act to repeal the statute of limitations and allow women to sue employers for alleged wage discrimination long after bosses are dead and unable to defend their actions. the feminists made this their first priority, the house and senate quickly acquiesced, and president obama is itching to sign the bill.  done! but was not a good idea to pass.  &gt; direct eeoc to compare pay scales in job categories held mostly by women or mostly by men, and then enforce wage control to equalize wages according to the feminists' subjective definition of what they call comparable worth.  i like the idea of what the market will bear on salaries rather than the government telling businesses how to pay their people.  but i do recognize there is pay gaps and those should be addresses, but not this way.  &gt; expand the family and medical leave act to require paid parental and family leave at the option of the employee, rather than unpaid leave as allowed in current law.   i actually think social security should kick in to pay employees a portion of the salary.  &gt; reject all proposals to allow any portion of social security contributions to be paid into individual investment accounts.  ss should be converted into an individual retirement account, with that 6.2% paid in by the employee and 6.2% by the employer with guaranteed investment returns and conservative investments.  should work quite nicely.  &gt; appropriate $10 billion annually for daycare, early childhood programs, and grants for infant and toddler care so that mothers can be liberated from caring for their own babies.  wtf?  this is one of those ""sounds good on paper, bad idea in reality"" things.  i can see some advancements to individuals and maybe some subsidization to say day care centers by the government but $10 billion?  i want to see where that number is coming from.  liberated from caring for their babies?  i am sure the government can do better. learn your ass some responsibility bitches!  same for the dad's who father the kids as well.  &gt; stop federal funding of marriage promotion and fatherhood programs. repeal all the restrictions put into place by welfare reform legislation that encourage welfare recipients to seek employment or training for a job.  bad idea.  &gt; expand the child tax credit so that it covers all caregiving for married and non-married partners, and make it fully refundable for low-income working families.  partially agree.  a number of months minimum should be a requirement for partners living together prior to recieving this credit.  &gt; stop all funding for abstinence education and replace it with funding for federal programs that emphasize contraception. increase funding for title x family planning programs by at least $1 billion annually.  a-fucking-men!  abstinence education leads to more teenage pregnancies.   sex education should be through and detailed focusing on contraception and responsibility.  but definitely not doing any sex education other than abstinence prior to high school.  &gt; enact the freedom of choice act, which would repeal all national and state regulations of abortion passed over the last 35 years, including the ban on partial birth abortion. repeal the hyde amendment which bars federal taxpayer funding for most abortions.  i only support abortion in situations of rape, incest, and threat to the mother's life.  if sex education works, then this act would technically not be needed.  i also do not think the taxpayer should be covering abortions either.  &gt; halt adoption of a ""conscience"" regulation to allow doctors and other health care workers to refuse to perform abortions or provide contraceptive services they believe are morally objectionable.  telling people how to think is never a good idea.  people always have the option of quitting or refusing to do anything.  not sure how this type of a law would work.  if you doctor does not perform abortions, it is up to you to find one who does.  &gt; require insurance companies to cover birth control, require pharmacists to fill contraceptive prescriptions, and remove the age restriction on over-the-counter so-called emergency contraception. approve funding for embryonic stem cell research that requires killing embryos.  agreed except for the embryos part.  in fact, i suspect in the next 10 or so years, embryos will no longer be needed for stem cells at all.  &gt; promote abortion programs, services and advocacy in other countries by spending at least $1 billion for international family planning. one of obama's first presidential directives canceled reagan's mexico city policy that prohibited this.  negative.  not with my tax dollars.  &gt;

repeal the don't ask, don't tell policy in the military. lift the combat exclusion on women in the military so women can be assigned to ground combat and submarines.  i think doing either of these is a bad idea.  lifting don't ask, don't tell will increase the number of attacks on homosexuals in the military and lifting the combat exclusions will cause an explosion of rape against women in the military.  &gt; enact hate crimes legislation to cover acts of violence based on the victim's real or perceived gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. fully fund, expand and aggressively enforce the violence against women act (vawa) and enact the international vawa (ivawa).  hate crime = thought crime in my opinion.  &gt; cancel the regulations that allow public schools to have any single-sex schools or classes, and withhold federal funding from any schools that do. aggressively enforce title ix against colleges and universities, and refuse to accept evidence of women's relative lack of interest in sports.  sorry.  calling bullshit on this one.  &gt; oppose any constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. give same-sex couples federal benefits equal to married couples, add sexual orientation and gender identity to federal nondiscrimination laws without a religious exception.  agreed.  except that marriage should be defined on the state level, not the federal.  federal laws already exist to recognize marriage across state lines, as well as commerce and other things.  &gt; establish a cabinet-level office on women so that lobbying for feminist legislation and regulations can be carried out by federal employees at taxpayers' expense. promote affirmative action for women.  just as soon as we get the cabinet-level office on white people, black people, hispanics, men, dogs, cats.  let's keep america the way it is by promoting division instead of integration you dumb bitches.  &gt; appoint feminists to key positions in all the federal departments and strive for gender balance (i.e., fifty percent feminists) throughout the government. establish a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender liaison position in the white house.  quotas are bad bitches.  &gt; enact a single-payer (i.e., government controlled and taxpayer financed) health plan that includes unrestricted access to comprehensive abortion and contraceptive services. pass an expanded schip (state children's health insurance program) to include health services for all children, including illegal aliens.  again, not liking the idea of abortion on the taxpayer's dime or even paid by insurance.  abortion needs to rank up there with getting bigger breasts.  if you want them, pay for them.  &gt; provide a path to citizenship for illegal aliens.   negative.  i think putting them on buses and planes and sending them back where they came from is a much more valued use of tax payer dollars.  &gt;

734671,"we've known alcohol has been harmful to babies for hundreds, if not thousands of years. even if it was first described in the 1970's as we know it today (fetal alcohol syndrome, then fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in 2004), humanity has known it causes trouble to drink during pregnancy. it's written in the bible (‚Äúbehold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son: and now drink no wine or strong drink‚Äù), aristotle wrote about it, multiple medical compendiums from medieval europe write of it, i could go on. it's been known to cause issue for a very long time. ([1](http://www.usd.edu/medical-school/center-for-disabilities/upload/fasdhandbook.pdf))  as well, there's a large difference between what alcohol used to be, and what it is today, as well as drinking habits. for example, alcoholic beverages were much weaker since distilled and stronger drink was much harder to come by, or the technology to do it wasn't available. people also frequently watered down their drink, a practice that was common and started from folklore about a king drinking an undiluted alcoholic drink and going insane ([2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_greece_and_wine#cite_note-oxford_pp._326.e2.80.93329-2)). so, people may have been drinking more, but they were drinking less alcohol specifically per drink.  as well, infant mortality (while obviously difficult to measure in ancient times) has been suggested to be as high as one in four ([3](http://www.representingchildhood.pitt.edu/medieval_child.htm)). obviously there are other factors that would lead to high infant mortality, but this is to demonstrate that the past wasn't some gilded age of strong willed golden skinned ubermensch. in fact, you can see extremely visible differences between the 1960's, 80's, and 2000's regarding infant health and survival ([4](http://www.hrsa.gov/healthit/images/mchb_infantmortality_pub.pdf)). further, our knowledge of pre and postnatal health, has lead us to a point of advancement where it's extremely difficult to be willfully ignorant of what you need to be a healthy mother and produce healthy offspring (of course, there will still be people who can know what health behaviors they should be participating in but are unable due to constrictions such as availability or being poor).  &gt;you think having a beer or a smoke is worse than sitting on your ass all day eating cheetos and estrogen laced tofu while criticizing others?  there's a simple answer to that: both are bad for the baby. it isn't a one or the other thing and a mother that puts a disgustingly large amount of toxins in her body, be it shit from alcohol or three bags of cheetos, is still putting the health of her child on the line.  so no, it isn't a ""bubble wrap generation"" thing, people have known for forever that drinking alcohol while pregnant is trouble. as well, it's a ""we know now how bad this shit is, how it works, exactly what it is, *and* how exactly to prevent it."" yes, you could probably get away with *one* drink. *probably*. is that the risk you want to take? you could be 100% sure by laying off the sauce for 9 months and not have to worry about it at all, or you could put your child at risk because you're an immature brat who isn't ready to raise children. if you want to do drugs, cool. if you want to fuck around without a condom, more power to you. the difference here is that you're affecting the life of an unborn child and if they develop fasd, that's not only *your* life that's going to be hit, it's theirs and that of the taxpayers, the police and the justice system when they (almost) inevitably become involved with crime, the school system, *everyone*.  sorry for the lazy post with bad citation. i'm studying this exact thing in school so it hits close to home to hear people saying folks need to just suck it up and it wasn't always a problem.",1,2,-1
123843,"i think you have the wrong approach to the understanding of postpartum depression.   postpartum depression is caused by low thyroid function that declines rapidly after the stress of childbearing, and hormonal swings from the loss of baby's hormones circulating. not to mention the psychological stress of having been through childbirth and having a newborn to care for.  its not very common to have postpartum depression severe enough to commit infanticide in non-western countries, and affluent women get it often, despite their excellent resources to care for a child, and their strong desire to have children.  its really not very conceivable to think its a real evolutionary method in any case because most cultures developed close knit extended families, or ""village raises a child"" methods that would relieve the mother of duties until she felt well again and bolster her through postpartum period. postpartum women all experience physiological changes and that can lead to mood changes, but how well she deals with it depends on the culture and the amount of support a woman gets; one could argue that due to our individualistic and nuclear family structure that women are more likely to experience deep depression that leads to infanticide, because she does not have the network and support for recovery from postpartum.  in india, close family paints postpartum women's feet with henna right after birth so she is 'forced' to lay in bed and allow all her friends and family attend to the housework and dote on her, and she can just nurse and do what she can on the bed. this allows her body to heal and for her to recognize in a tangible way the support of her family. also, maternity leave may actually serve to isolate american/western women for too long from such support as work and activity. western culture has medicalized postpartum depression as well and made it a stigmatized thing, its hard not to 'beat yourself up' even more when you're experiencing something that has stigma attached to it. in other cultures its expected, its a rite of passage, its accepted... in the us its a medical problem because you should be ""the happiest mother on the block"" or you fail.   your logic for postpartum depression doesnt really hold well anyway; women in poor countries often strive to keep their child alive at their own expense, many women with disabled children do the same, and postpartum depression is usually a period of ""blues"" for the first six weeks to six months caused by physiological changes in the mother independent of a healthy baby and despite plenty of resources to care for the child.",1,1,2

226098,"hi, i really appreciated your post, you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field(obviously, if you've got a phd, you've put a lot of work into it, so i just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and, while i haven't personally contracted your services, i am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough). i have a few questions, i do have a few mental health issues, but they aren't rare at all, and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals(multiple psychiatrists, all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period, a psychologist, a social worker with a doctorate in social work, and some regular social workers, as well as a pediatric neurologist when i was 17(i'm 19 now, going to be 20 on jan 21st, and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community). basically, i've just got run of the mill depression, panic disorder, as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition i have called ehlers-danlos syndrome, which causes me extreme chronic pain, i have seen palliative care physicians, neurologists, physiatrists(not the same as a psychiatrist), and pain management physicians(anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine), neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and of course a few internists, all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis. the level of pain i experience is what causes my depression for the most part(though, i have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode, i am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like).   basically, the pain i have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things, things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain, like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games, walking up stairs, going to the store, but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance. it isn't that i lack intelligence or motivation(though at times my motivation is low), but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent. for example, my last year of high school(i graduated in 2010) i missed at least two days every week, i still graduated in the top 25% of my class, and graduated with honors, but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas i wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to(ehlers-danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations, tendon/ligament injuries, etc), the most serious pain i have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain(i have a syrinx in my spinal cord, you'd understand what it is if you look it up, if you don't already, it is usually caused by a chiari malformation, which i don't really have).  the thing i've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges i face in everyday life. but, i have big dreams, i'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist, those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me, and i love studying them. but, due in part to my depression, and pain, i often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities. you see, when i was in 1st grade, i was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability(the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around 5-6 hours, i had to redo this testing every couple of years, all of the testing took 5-6 hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if i had any learning disabilities there). during school, i was in a special ed class to help with my math(but in a regular math class, the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it, and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that i could succeed, i'm sure you understand the special education system). however, i've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself, nor have i learned much about it, i don't even know the name of the disorder. i'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability, i mean, i know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities, but i'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all, if i could do some testing to just learn maybe why i have the disability(as in, what is my disability, i can understand medical and psychological information with ease, i've considered going into medicine even). the reason i want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because i realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology, psychology, or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus, as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required, including calculus. therefore, i often feel defeated before i've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician, medical doctor, or academic, and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression.    tl;dr- is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps i could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses.  note: i realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions, but i've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally, and i'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever. i am not asking for medical or psychological advice, as i know that since you cannot evaluate me personally, it'd be a legal liability on your part.   if you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message, or have more specific questions to ask me, please feel free to send them in a private message. i am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post.  regards,   -nick w.",1,1,

""save the children! they're killing children! how many children were at waco? they're killing children!"" what does that mean? they reach a certain age and they're off your fucking love-list? fuck your children, if that's the way you think then fuck you too. you either love all people of all ages or you shut the fuck up.   ----   &gt; i'm not a girl, i'm a guy you know? but at the same time, i tell ya how you can solve this abortion issue right now. ready? those unwanted babies that single moms leave in alleys and in dumpsters? leave about twelve of those on the steps of the supreme court. this is over. like that.

831559,"&gt;i was wondering, though. why do you say this:  &gt;usually the [kids] that experience violence first hand through hardships are not desensitized  &gt;i did a little bit of digging, but many of the relevant studies are behind paywalls.  watch this whole video http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2012/12/17/exp-point-lost-boys-garabino.cnn  mainly 3:40 until the end of the video.   i'm not saying the ""expert"" is right about video games, far from it. but statistics on wealth and kids who plan out shootings is most likely available to somebody who studies crimes.   maybe it's total bullshit but i personally think spoiled brats of kids that are rich enough to have 100 real guns might be more of a threat than kids who encounter hardship and have to navigate those hardships on a daily basis making compromises with people, employment at a young age to work customer service for department stores or coffee shops. these kids strike me as more responsible children than very wealthy family that have divorces and a kid is left with a mom trying to make him, ""grow up"" by getting rid of him out of her house when in fact all he's done is be spoiled and socially awkward and goes to gun ranges with mom.   additionally we will never know if adam lanza killed his mom when she was trying to pawn him off at a minimum wage job threatening his lavish lifestyle of a $500,000 a year earnings for father because of adam lanza's age and because his mom and dad had divorced a 2 years before. we will never know if he simply killed his mother with her own 100 gun arsenal and because of watching his mother die adam freaked out completely and blamed his own life. when somebody does a horrible act they often blame everything around them, there life, their childhood, their existence, the people that taught them anything throughout life, parents, friends. who really fucking knows if adam lanza even had planned any of his killing or if adam shot his mother out of fear of being kicked out of his privileged life/parents house, then blamed everything and targetted a school with his mothers 100 guns. who the fuck really knows. why does anyone assume killing 20 6 year olds was even a plan of adams. before killing his mother and after watching his mother die in front of him after he shot her four times are two completely different mental states i would imagine yet we as a country assume this: before adam lanza murdered for the first time he was planning to murder 20 6 year old children and 6 adults and then kill himself. after he murdered his mother he simply mechanically carried out his plan all along.   yet we don't blame rich parents abandoning their children after they have lived a privileged life their whole life. we don't blame schools being targeted because maybe education in america needs some reform if kids are angry at schools. the public school system has been declared unconstitutional several times by the supreme court and nothing is happening to change it. we could talk about gun violence in america as related to the number of guns proliferating throughout this country between licensed owners and people using them for crimes.   those topics cover everything involved in the lanza shooting: life at home - checkmark, possibly anger at schools - check, guns - check.   instead of education or home environment the media is asking about ""video games"" which statistically 91% of all kids in the united states play but there are 5 gun shooters in 2012. the only reason i can think of is for ratings and a juicy story.    why we so easily talk about video games but then we don't say a damn thing about parents kicking their children out of their house when the child has grown up in a $500,000/month lifestyle i will never ever ever fucking ever know.    ---------  now you tell me what seems more likely of these two scenerios:   scenerio 1: adam lanza is as spoiled of a brat as spoiled gets. he grows up on family income of $500,000 a year. his mom(i'm going to say it) is a total bitch with an 100 gun arsenal in the house which she takes her son to go shoot with at shooting ranges. adam lanza's mother has a divorce with her husband in 2010 and she walks with $270,000 alimony a year. nancy lanzer wants to get rid of her son adam lanza who is 18 in 2010. she tells her son that he is an adult and tries to pawn him off to work for minimum wage with a ""family friend"" which doesn't work. adam lanza doesn't want to work for minimum wage, and why should he since he grew up on $500,000 parent income every year. nancy lanza, adams mom, is threatening to kick adam out of the house 2 years later in 2012 because he won't work for minimum wage with a ""family friend"". she wants her son adam to leave because she divorced her husband and wants a new life with $270,000 a year in income from alimony. adam won't leave, he refuses to work for minimum wage with a ""family friend"" and won't contemplate moving out of the house. nancy has spoiled him his whole life by obeying his commands to her like, ""don't come into my room. you can sit on the floor outside to be there for me.""(actual information). 2 years after adam won't lift a finger to move along with his life from childhood to adulthood nancy threatens to put him in a mental hospital. with all the stress constantly buzzing in adams mind and the fact he's been a spoiled brat his whole life with the relationship of ordering his mother around he thinks nobody is going to be allowed to ruin his privileged life, not even his mom who ""will pay"" if she does. after months of yelling at each other nancy threatens one day that she is calling the insane asylum, adam freaks out, goes to the closet with guns and unlocks it. plays with the guns. nancy yells at him from her room upstairs, ""you're getting out of my life one way or the other!"" adam takes out the gun and goes to his mothers room and points it at her, ""what did you say!""  he says being ever the spoiled brat. ""nancy half turns while yelling, 'i said!!' and a gunshot goes off. and one gunshot leads to three more quick shots. nancy screams a death scream and writhes in unimaginable agony while she dies. adam watches while his mother screams and the screams echo in his mind in slow motion. they keep coming and coming and coming louder and louder and louder while adam is frozen in time clutching the pistol. over and over the screams reverberiate and the blood of his mother starts gushing on the floor. he shakely, almost dropping the pistol points it right between his eyes but he can't pull the trigger no-matter how hard he tries to muster himself. while he is trying to muster his strength to pull the trigger while it is halfway pulled he contemplates why he shouldn't have to pull the trigger, why his life is so unfair and images start flooding through his mind of all the things and people that were to blame, he stood there blaming things for years but finally realized time was slipping by and in the back of his mind his brain had a nagging sensation that was not completely blocked out by the ghost of his mothers screams that still seemed more real than ever. the sensation that time was ticking by and that ever second that passed the very pain and psychoticness of the previous moments were becoming less and less real to the sense of time ticking by, and so lanza(adam) siezed at the most dispicable thing he could do through anger, anger that flooded in because of fear that the realness of what just happened would be lost to time ticking by making it seem less important. the most despicable thing to do he thought, was to show society that they couldn't fuck with his life since it's societies fault for his livelyhood being threatened and for who he was. adam thought that life is cheap and he would have to die soon he kept telling himself. when life is cheap and temperamental and anger reigns supreme through fear adam attached on a plan, go arm himself with his mothers arsenal and show the world he is one bad mother fucker not to be crossed, this is spoiled brat adam lanza and nobody can fuck with me (adams excuse that made him feel slightly better because the anger made him feel other feelings less). adam goes on a drive with 4 guns he selected. hoping nobody would detect his plan but stupidly brave nonetheless from anger and shock the shock feeling that nothing mattered. adam passed by the local elemental school and chose it. pulled out his guns and came in from the front door spraying bullets like he did so many times in the shooting range with his semi-automatic guns. everything died in front of him and he knew he was going to kill himself while a surreal dreamlike state played out in front of his eyes. a dreamlike state that carried him to the point where it was time to shoot himself in the dream. ""really?"" he though to himself as he looked down the barrel of the semi-automatic gun he loved so much while at the ranges with his mother. ""i wonder how this will feel""    scenario 2: adam lanza was 16 years old and a sophomore in high school. he was socially awkward even though he joined a social video game tech club that played a game that was rated teen and is not a game about shooting somebody with a gun but about a chesslike top down view of a board(called a map in starcraft) where on the board there are small tiny pieces that interact with each other most of those pieces being mechanical and almost half of the pieces resembling famous movie monsters such as the collosus piece which is a war of the worlds monster, the zergling and hydra which are two pieces that resemble an alien monster in alien vs predator, a piece that resembles the famous construction lift machine the mother was in in the movie alien. coincidentally adam lanza also played a game called warcraft 3 which unlike its name may convey any meaning has nothing to do with war in fact it is a fantasy game that has no guns in it or military resemblances in fact is promotes the idea that religious priests that have special healing powers, dwarfs, and a race of elves that are designed to be ""one"" with nature thereby having special powers to grow trees and heal the forest and forest creatures who are injured.   lanza played these games when he was 14 and 16 years old. they are both coincidentally the most popular games in china(warcraft 3) which has a population of 1/6th of all the world population and the chinese government is very strict on video games period. their censorship of violent video games and any kind of media is the most strict in the world being run by stuff government officials who make ""the best decisions"" for the nations children similar to a tyrannical parent, yet ""warcraft 3"" is played at least by more than 85 million chinese people because that's the number of people who tuned in for the warcraft 3 tournament in 2012.   the game played by the school game club which lanza joined is called starcraft, as already described in the first paragraph of this scenario starcraft is a teen rated game and also considered a real sport in south korea thereby incurring the same or more people to watch starcraft be played than football or baseball stadiums get in america. it's also a teen game and the violence is not realistic in the slightest and it's basically violence of little pieces on a board that people look down on similar to a hobbit boardgame.   adam lanza was a happy child. he was so happy he was socially awkward. then lanza was transitioning to a life in a mental institution because him and his mom discussed it and he was happy to receive the institutionalization. unfortunately before he could receive the mind altering medicines he needed the same time when he was so happy to be institutionalized at a mental hospital to get help, adams brain excreted chemicals that had one word on it, ""kill"". his loving and adoring mother who was sincerely trying to improve lanza's life was the first victim of her sons video game violence. adam taken over by chemical imbalance and the long fantasy of shooting 20 6 year old children and his mom with 4 bullets put this plan into action. he had seen this exact thing happen in starcraft a teen rated game with miniature mechanical pieces and pieces from movies. he had an ""out of body"" experience to emulate starcraft where he saw himself 2 miles above his house with x-ray vision as a little mini thing on a boardgame board. he then tried to walk to his bedroom with this miniature vision but because it was so small he ended up walking into his mothers bedroom where he let 4 rounds of the bullets go. throughout this experience he was thinking to himself, ""why am i at home and not at an elementary school."" so he quickly went to an elementary school and this poor mentally incapable person who would have been in an institutionalized house that he so desperately wanted to go to after hearing that is where he was going to from his mother, unfortunately it was just too late and his video game vision encouraged him to kill some more after hearing his mother scream and thrash around, trully this is exactly what video games had taught him - his own mother screaming death screams and thrashing around reminded him of a video game. then killing 20 6 year old children reminded him of a video game to.   so although adam was 20 years old, kids nowadays should not play video games or starcraft or warcraft 3 - they cause murder.   --------------  by the way whatever your conclusions watch fox/cnn/and msnbc cover a school murder for 2 weeks straight on national television. they know that making a big deal out of school murders does not not cause school murders in the future. but it's more important to talk about nonviolent teen rated video games for 2 weeks straight on the national news because this behavior will not not cause more murders in schools according to professionals on school murders.",1,-1,
370580,"let me address your studies first:  1 - the first one is done on adult males, who consented - ethically this is sound and i am totally fine with it.  however, the 'results' were self reported from men who wanted to have this done, that certainly creates a bias, and is nowhere near a large enough sample size to actually have relevant findings.  a decrease in premature ejaculation comes from a decrease in sensitivity - the result might be good for those men, but ultimately they have decreased sensitivity.    2 - again, adult men, totally fine and ethical.  however, the findings are again biased and diluted.  why?  because these men believe that getting circumcised is going to drastically reduce their risk for hiv, so of course they report greater sexual satisfaction: they feel safe.  3 - again adults, again men who wanted to undergo circumcision.  4 - first, i couldn't give a rats ass about how women feel on the subject.  however, it falls into the same issue as the second one: these women live in a place that is filled with hiv and they believe circumcision of males reduces their risk.  so of course they report no reduction in sexual satisfaction because they feel safe.  in western countries we sell 'ribbed' condoms - which actually are a replica of a pull backed foreskin.  hell, this study: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17970975 found that female circumcision actually increases sexual pleasure and orgasm rate for women - should we do that too?    5 - adults who wanted/needed the procedure for whatever reason: again, obvious bias.  6 - adults who wanted it who in effect reported less sensitivity.  the biggest issue with all of these is that they are adults who want to undergo the procedure.  of course they are likely to report positive results because they already wanted it.  however, none of this said anything about the ethics and morality of *child* circumcision.  not one addressed the medical effects of child circumcision which are quite different (in much the same way that drinking and smoking can be considerably more dangerous for children because their bodies are not developed yet).  you also misunderstand, the question ""will it hurt the child"" actually doesn't matter, because it is unethical and you need to prove that it provides a true medical benefit that can only be gotten by doing it an infancy.  otherwise, you have violated the moral principles of bodily integrity and self determination - which are some of the oldest, most recognized, and entrenched ethical principles around.  if 99% of people were circumcised at birth, it still would still violate these ethical principles.  also, the fact that women might prefer it is a terrible reason to mutilate a child.  arab men might prefer female girls to have their clitoral hood removed (which is the exact anatomical equivalent of the male foreskin serving the same function), but it is unethical to do so even if it might be a tiny bit cleaner.    the majority of the planet is uncircumcised my friend - less than 20% of the world, and in europe just about no one is circumcised (in the nordic countries it is around 0%), japan has about 0%, same with china.  none of these countries are suffering public health problems from the lack of circumcision. no high instances of uti's, hiv, penile cancer, etc etc etc.  in africa there are some very controversial studies that suggest a correlated relationship (not a causative relationship) between circumcision and reduced hiv risk, not only do these studies no suggest a causative relationship, but the authors of these studies *do not suggest circumcision as a means to reduce hiv*, instead they suggest condoms.  another reason these african hiv trials are not well respected and are considered lacking is because they are contradicted by much larger demographic trends.  for example, the us has a high rate of circumcision and the highest rate of hiv in the industrialized world - considerably higher than japan or the nordic countries who have 0-1% circumcision rate and a much lower hiv rate.  so, is circumcision helping prevent hiv in the us?    in the us, the circumcision rate is less than 60% - so while some children might have to deal with being the 'strange' kid in school, tell me what is better: that some kids in one generation are teased and bullied and by the next we could eradicate the mutilation of children's genitals, or that we should continue to mutilate boys at birth continuously?  now, how about some more reliable studies:  here is a meta-study of 35 studies on circumcision vs. hiv &gt;when the raw data are combined, *** a man with a circumcised penis is at greater risk of acquiring and transmitting hiv than a man with a non-circumcised penis *** (odds ratio (or)=1.06, 95% confidence interval (ci)=1.01-1.12). based on the studies published to date, recommending routine circumcision as a prophylactic measure to prevent hiv infection in africa, or elsewhere, is scientifically unfounded.

415728,"your problem is that you are not very intelligent, edwin. you are simply not a very bright kid, and yes, you are childish and immature at present.  for example, you are obsessed with ""winning"" this argument as if it were a competition, but it cannot be. where is the impartial referee who decides who ""wins""? mere declarations of victory from one side mean nothing.   nor does continuing the argument mean that i've ""lost."" the reason ought to be obvious even to you, although i'm sure it isn't. hint: you are persisting as well.  above all, ""winning"" or ""losing"" means nothing. if you had  the slightest understanding of gautama buddha's teachings, you would recognize that.  the *only* thing i gave up was having a productive discussion with someone who turned out to be a childish dick with the mindset of an insecure 15-year old. now i'm pretty much just procrastinating (the basic function of reddit anyway) while practising a foreign language.  finally, back to the burning monk. burning oneself per se was never the issue in the first place, though you latched onto that because it evidently made you hot and bothered. the issue was *buddhists waging and promoting war*, and a very savage, pointless war at that, flouting the buddha's pacifism on even the slackest interpretation of the latter. here is what i wrote in response to your insincere request for information (as we now know you were merely looking for an argument to ""win"" in order to relieve your insecurity):  &gt;i'm not sure how they justify it, but if you doubt that lots of buddhists have joined the dark side, look at sri lanka. the sinhala ethnic majority there has been fighting a savage civil war against the tamil minority for decades. both sides are just about equally bloodthirsty and crazy, but the thing to note is that the sinhalas are buddhists.  and, the most batshit, bugfuck insane warmongers among those -- people who've been known to immolate themselves to protest ceasefires -- are buddhist monks.  it would be clear to any half-way educated person that you can omit the subjunctive clause about the self-immolating monk without changing the point of the paragraph: that, whatever the explanation, there are whole societies of warlike buddhists oblivious to this contradiction.  here's from a [blog post](http://bandaragama.wordpress.com/2008/05/19/war-mongers%e2%80%99-vesak-today-sil-tomorrow-kill/) making the same point.  &gt;we live in a strange society. the logics of ‚Äòsinhalese buddhist‚Äô society are difficult to understand.  &gt;for 364 days most ‚Äòbuddhists‚Äô in south - encouraged by the government itself - invariably monger war. they see absolutely nothing wrong in killing human beings (yes, tamils too are human beings ‚Äì in case someone has forgotten) more the numbers, more jubilant they are. ‚Äò200 tigers killed‚Äô makes a reason for celebrations, as if the killing gives them a sort of eternal joy. they may never feel tamils too are made of flesh and blood and prone to suffering just like themselves. it will be surprising if they actually understand some of these so-called ‚Äòtigers‚Äô are innocent civilians (one of the obvious targets of any war) or even armed ‚Äì they were forced to take arms largely because that was the only means of survival. (most militant tamil youth have not joined ltte on their free will. they were forced to join at the gun point, mosty as children)  &gt;many budhists dress in white today ‚Äì  for vesak - visit the temples and promise ‚Äúpanathipatha veramani sikkha-padam samadiyami‚Äù ‚Äì that they do not harm even a fly. even those who promote war for 364 days do so.  furthermore, it seems you are under the impression that, according to siddharta gautama buddha, craving and calling for the deaths of others is fine provided one does not personally harm someone physically. that is a basic mistake revealing your ignorance of the [eightfold path](http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/eightfoldpath.html) at the heart of buddhism. thus, the path to enlightenment and nirvana consists of eight interconnected virtues:   1. right view   2. right intention 3. right speech 	 4. right action 5. right livelihood 6. right effort 	 7. right mindfulness 8. right concentration  warmongering plainly fails several of these, if not all. i do not expect you to understand that, however, because i do not expect you to understand anything at this point. i write this only as an exercise in futility for myself.  now, back to work.  ps. perhaps when you grow up, you may at least learn not to make grand assumptions about total strangers, such as that i ""want to hate on all religion."" you don't know the slightest thing about me.",1,-2,
931560,"no, i am not generalizing from usa to the rest of the world.  most of the rest of the world has adopted these same ideas, or is in the process of doing so right now.    &gt;around here, when a young kid is caught masturbating, we just tell them this is something that it is something enjoyable done in private and that's the end of it.  right, a ""young kid"".  what about a 10 month old who is just staring off into space not moving, and gets aggressive when you interrupt them?  &gt;on the other hand, if you compare with my grand parent's time, when the catholic church was all powerful in this time of the year, young kids and teenagers were forced to confess sins and live in shame for anything related to sex.  yet parents were told that their children would have sexual curiosity, and that it was normal.  they never thought to mention anything about making sure their children remain clothed all the time for fear of rapists.  if kids went to a pool, or swam at school, they did so naked.  they showered in school together after gym class when they got older as well.  none of these things happen any longer, further contributing to an extended period of infantile curiosity about their body which should be satisfied early in childhood but gets delayed until college now.  &gt;so, i am not sure where you are getting this idea that the whole world flipped over its head in the mid-1990s, but it certainly is not the case.  from reading about history and sociology and actually reading the parenting books from the time periods.  the church was not talking about masturbation when your grand parents were growing up, it was not a subject that was talked about.  it certainly wasn't encouraged, but every family dealt with it as a normal part of growing up.  those types of problems didn't even exist before the victorian era, where sleeping in a common room rather than having private bedrooms made it impossible to hide sex from children.  also, until the victorian era, there was no reason to prohibit sexual activity for the lower classes.  the upper class were quite different, but the majority of people were in the lower classes, and they started families when they became biologically able to start families.  it wasn't until the victorian era that companies would no longer be willing to provide enough jobs and sufficient wages to adolescents to be able to support a family.  as a reaction to that, the lower class created the idea of the adolescent as a separate class of human being from adult.  (the creation of the class of child came only a little earlier, its surprising they didn't fracture human life even further)  try actually asking your grandparents about their experiences with sex as they grew up.  in the unlikely event that they will be willing to actually discuss this with you, i imagine you'll hear stories of circle jerks aplenty, all sorts of experimentation starting as soon as anyone got curious, etc.  yes they had to keep it secret from their parents, but kids were also given a presently-unthinkable amount of autonomy, making such things trivial.  overparenting and a belief that children are naturally sexless creatures are entirely brand new ideas.  heck, didn't you have to read 1984 or brave new world in school?  don't remember the parts about kids and sex in those?  that says a lot about what the society at the time thought about the ideas.  if such books were published today, the authors would be lambasted as pedophiles and the books yanked out of schools, likely.",1,1,-1

613670,"&gt; he had sociopathic tendencies even at the orphanage (killing another kid's rabbit, whatever he did to those two kids, the conversation in which he found out he was a wizard)   to be fair, the orphanages of the time were understaffed and undersupplied. they may have had only one person working in the infant (or newborn) ward, and re-used bottles to feed the children. additionally, infants would cry, but after not being held for a certain amount of time, they would cease crying [as no-one came to see to their needs when they *did* cry]. tom riddle's ""quietness"" may have very well stemmed from that as well.  for example, touch has been found in studies to be *extremely* important to an infant's later psychological (mental, emotional) health and development. studies conducted in multiple orphanages have also found ""have vastly different hormone levels than their parent-raised peers even beyond the baby years. for instance, in romania in the 1980s, by ages six to 12, levels of the stress hormone cortisol were still much higher in children who had lived in orphanages for more than eight months than in those who were adopted at or before the age of four months"". additionally, ""children who experienced early deprivation also had different levels of oxytocin and vasopressin (hormones that have been linked to emotion and social bonding), despite having had an average of three years in a family home"".  furthermore, ""any stories of delayed development and troublesome behavior, such as in the seven-year-old russian orphan who was returned by his adoptive family in the u.s. in april 2010, have spurred researchers to take an even closer look into the effects of early contact deprivation"". tom riddle is not the first orphanage child to display ""troublesome behavior"", and unfortunately, nor will he be the last.   the death of merope gaunt also may have greatly affected her son's development; it is thought that cuddling with an infant after a birth releases oxytocin (the ""love hormone"") in both the mother and child. no physical touch means that the infant's brain does not produce oxytocin; thus, it contributed to tom riddle's lack of understanding (and experience) of love. he didn't experience love because, for most of his life, his brain did not produce ""the love hormone"" [due to neglect of physical touch].  babies also get used to the one person that's most familiar, so if you're with a depressed mother (or caretaker) who has low responsiveness, those babies will be most responsive to those who are least responsive, so they're perpetuating a risk factor for themselves. there's nothing wrong with the baby; they're just responding to what they're experiencing.

629725,"i'm actually not terribly concerned about the financial aspects, because there's a ""worst case"" alternative that's always available: reboot the economy.  basically, the government defaults on all its debts and issues new currency.  it's been done before: russia in the 1990s, germany in the 1920s and again after ww2, the u.s. in 1789.  it's not an action to be taken lightly, since it usually leads to massive political chaos and often the fall of the existing government.  but it typically takes only about 10 years to recover, well under a generation.  i'm far more worried about demographic, geologic/environmental, and political trends:  1. peak oil.  my sister's a petroleum geologist.  her best estimate for peak oil is about 2012 or 2013.  peak oil doesn't mean the end of the world, but it does mean that the natural trend for energy prices will start sloping upwards and continue increasing until we find a substitute for oil. 2. global warming.  yeah, i don't believe the apocalyptic ""day after tomorrow"" forecasts.  i do believe that the phenomenom is real, and likely to affect crop harvests.  there's a long, long historical record of civilizations that fell because they destroyed their environment and made it impossible to grow food.  we take food for granted now; it's not a guarantee at all. 3. demographics.  the u.s. baby boomers are starting to retire now.  china will hit its demographic bust around 2030.  much of economic growth can be explained in simple demographic terms: the ratio of productive workers to dependent children &amp; seniors.  that ratio has been astonishingly good over the past 20 years, because china's baby boom has been entering the workforce.  china's baby boom ended in 1978, which means that the tail end of it is just now entering the workforce.  expect wage costs to start trending up and drive up prices, unless india &amp; bangladesh industrialize. 4. more demographics.  populations in china and india are overwhelmingly male, with the largest male ""bulge"" (no pun intended) just entering marriagability age now.  large numbers of unmarried males usually mean a more warlike society. 5. nuclear proliferation, and the people who lived through hiroshima and the cuban missile crisis dying off.  we seem to have forgotten that we have the capability to annihilate ourselves.  this is good if we never remember again, but bad if somebody rediscovers it and figures ""hey, let's blow up the world.""  perhaps most disturbingly, all these trends converge on the decade of 2020-2030.  oil production will be dropping.  the effects of global warming will just start to be felt.  earth will be at its maximum population (many demographers expect world population to begin shrinking around 2030-2040, because of better access to birth control), yet the proportion of population within productive age groups will be at a minimum.",0,,
556053,"children adopt the religion of their parents. is that not obvious? if they have their own ideas later on, that's on them.   &gt;you don't get to beat, neglect or kill your children.   of course not. that would be child abuse/murder. but circumcision is hardly comparable. you're nicking off a vestigal body part, comparable to a wisdom tooth surgery (which, by the way, may not be necessary, but parents can still force it on their children. because they are parents.) actually, it's less intrusive than wisdom tooth surgery. wisdom tooth removal requires heavy anesthetics. circumcision does not.   according to the american pediatric association: "" neonatal circumcision is performed with surrogate consent, described as follows by the american academy of pediatrics (1996): ""the practice of medicine has long respected an adult's right to self-determination in health care decision-making. this principle has been operationalized through the doctrine of informed consent. the process of informed consent obligates the physician to explain any procedure or treatment and to enumerate the risks, benefits, and alternatives for the patient to make an informed choice. for infants and young children who lack the capacity to decide for themselves, a surrogate, generally a parent, must make such choices.""[14] the academy states that both parents and physicians have an ethical duty to secure the child's best interest and well-being. they state that in the case of circumcision, where there are potential benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being, the parents ought to determine what is in the child's best interests, and that it is legitimate for parents to take into account cultural, religious, and ethnic traditions, as well as medical factors. they state that physicians should not coerce parents, but should assist parents in their decision by ""explaining the potential benefits and risks and by ensuring that they [the parents] understand that circumcision is an elective procedure."" the academy's committee on bioethics approved this policy statement.[9] there are studies that indicate increased medical problems and cost associated with the procedure being done later in life. the american association of pediatrics states ""parents may wish to consider whether the benefits of the procedure can be attained in equal measure if the procedure is delayed until the child is of sufficient age to provide his own informed consent. these interests include the medical benefits; the cultural and religious implications of being circumcised; and the fact that the procedure has the least surgical risk and the greatest accumulated health benefits if performed during the newborn period. newborn males who are not circumcised at birth are much less likely to elect circumcision in adolescence or early adulthood. parents who are considering deferring circumcision should be explicitly informed that circumcision performed later in life has increased risks and costs. furthermore, deferral of the procedure also requires longer healing time than if performed during the newborn period and requires sexual abstinence during healing. those who are already sexually active by the time they have the procedure lose some opportunities for the protective benefit against sexually transmitted infection (sti) acquisition, including hiv; moreover, there is the risk of acquiring an sti if the individual is sexually active during the healing process.""   a circumcision, if performed, is best performed as a newborn. the risks and complications only increase as one gets older, and cultural sensitivities give a priority to earlier procedures.   &gt;and no, babies are not religious. religions can claim that they are members, but that doesn't mean anything. the mormon church posthumously baptized a whole bunch of jewish holocaust victims. does that mean they're no longer jewish? does that mean they're both? it doesn't matter what others claim, only what you choose.  honestly, i really don't care to argue much about religion, but...  &gt;obviously, a child born into a religious household will probably adopt that religion  if one is born into a christian family, what is the first belief system to enter ones head? what values is one raised with? from the day a child is born, they are born into their parent's belief system.   &gt;the slippery slope argument about chores being child abuse is total bs, and not worth addressing.   oh, but it is: did you ever consider that just as how we look back 300 years ago and think to ourselves ""man, those people were primitive. look at slavery, and the prevalence of violence and the disgusting culture they had? "" well guess what. 300 years ago, that's what they thought about 300 years before. 300 years from now, forcing a child to do anything at all may very well be considered child abuse. after all, they need to give consent according to you, right? we should raise spoiled little brats. it's their consent to behave however they want. parents should abandon their kids the day they are born. those kids did not consent to be raised that way.  your emphasis on consent does not exist in this argument. stop trying to put it in a place it doesn't belong. consent does not exist for infants. they do not consent for a circumcision. they didn't consent to be born either, so why don't you kill them the second they pop out?   &gt;that's one reason why you don't perform unnecessary procedures  first of all, there are medical reasons. second of all, there are religious ones. i don't expect you to understand them, because you seem irreligious, but i expect you to respect people who follow their beliefs in a non-harmful way. circumcision is not harmful. accidents do happen, but playing on a slide is also considered non-harmful but every now and then a child falls off and breaks an arm. still considered non-harmful. what part of this is so hard to understand?",1,,1
433604,"&gt; you know there is a huge difference between a 15 year old who is a single mother with a newborn baby than a 25 year old who is a single mother with a newborn baby. please tell me you can tell the difference.  still, there is a difference between an older single mother and an older couple. the former is (statistically) disadvantaged. that's a fact.  so tell me: why do you care about children raised in poverty by teen mothers, but not about children raised in poverty by older mothers?  &gt; a loving mother who can actually care for a child? one who is educated and finically prepared? one who mature and ready? one who had to pass certain standards to even be allowed to adopt?  lol. are you that stupid that you don't know that lots of perfectly fit bio parents wouldn't pass requirements for adoption because they are so strict? (at least that is what i read about us adoption agencies.)  are you suggesting that a mother who is still studying can't be a proper mother? that a girl faced with an unwanted pregnancy can't become ready? that a poor mother is unfit by default? please, stop. it would be funny if it wasn't tragically sad that anyone can be so primitive...  &gt; have you looked into what one has to qualify for to adopt?  i read about home study prospective adoptive couples have to go through. i doubt you could pass it.  &gt; i can post horror stories from teen motherhood. news articles of teen mothers who had neglected abused or killed their child. what matters is hardcore facts, research, data to get a true idea.  older parents abuse their children too. shouldn't we judge all mothers separately?  &gt; it makes you look foolish and you implicitly admit single teen mothers are not a good choice.  wow. so a teenage couple is ok, but a single teenage mother is not? please, just stop...  &gt; once again single teen mothers are different than single mothers, poor mothers, black mothers, grandparents, etc.  what makes her different from other disadvantaged groups?  &gt; if you read the research you would see how the research is only meant to apply to single teen mothers not all single mothers or the other groups you keep mentioning. post research that shows that single teen mothers are the same as single mothers, black mothers, etc.  lmfao. you are incapable of reading with understanding.  &gt; i do not know your definition of suffer. also the fact you need most to suffer to see a problem is disturbing but i will post more information for you to ignore. are you fine with even risking that suffering of babies and children? but maybe infant mortality? is 50% most to you?  what happens to 50 % ? are they abused, neglected, abandoned?  you are the one who started whining about suffering. back up your words with data. and show me where i said children should suffer, because clearly that is what you are accusing me of.  &gt; children born to teen mothers are 30% more likely to be a low birth weight baby and have a 50% higher rate of infant mortality than children born to mothers over 20 years old.  that can't be solved by adoption.  &gt; remember teen mothers are less likely to graduate.  and that is suffering? being less likely to graduate = unfit mother? seriously, what's wrong with you?  &gt; the poverty rate for children born to teenage mothers who never married and who did not graduate from high school is 78%. this compares to 9% of children born to women over age 20 who are currently married and did graduate from high school.  so you are against poor parents, right? in that case defending single mothers in general makes no sense.  &gt; hey there are even biological reason teens should not have kids.  again, what does it have to do with adoption?  &gt; children of teen mothers are 50% more likely than children of older parents to repeat a grade, are less likely to complete high school than the children of older mothers, and have lower performance on standardized tests. almost half but still very high.  ok, so repeating a grade is tantamount to suffering, right? and if you repeat a grade and your mom was a teenager, it was her fault, right? jesus... i really don't believe i'm still talking to you.  &gt; children of mothers ages 18-19 are almost 40% more likely to have a reported case of abuse or neglect than children born to mothers ages 20-21.  do most 18-year-olds abuse their children? because here we have a comparison of one group to another.  &gt; children born to teen parents are more likely to enter foster care or have multiple caretakers throughout their childhood.  yeah, because they are often born to mothers raised in pathological families. or at least very poor ones.  &gt; children of teen mothers do worse in school than those born to older parents.  and the solution is adoption? so again - why the hell don't you advocate this for all disadvantaged groups?  &gt; general? sound like most to me.  you compared teen moms with 20s moms. it is obvious that the first groups does worse. i asked if most children raised by teen moms suffer. if most teen moms fail. being disadvantaged and poor is not the same as being a bad parent.  &gt; they generally have poorer academic and behavioral outcomes than do children born to older mothers.  generally = on average, right? so you proved nothing.  &gt; the same person can have more education, biological maturity, more money, etc.  education and money affect quality of life. not parenting skills.  maturity is important. but bear in mind lots of teenage pregnancies occur among already troubled teens.  &gt; you really do not understand the differences between 15-25 year old? how are you allowed to raise a child?  lol. i am not unfit.  &gt; the research is overwhelming shows specific issues that single teen mothers face that other groups do not.  what does her marital status have to do with biological development? it could only affect her financial well being.  the studies deal with single teen mothers, because most teen mothers are single.  &gt; i literally provide research and evidence for my point of view. you just deflect and post random emotional articles.  the problem is, you can't single out one disadvantaged group and make a bold claim that all mothers who belong to it should adopt their children out. if you are logical, you should say the same about all disadvantaged groups.  &gt; post research that there disadvantaged.  i posted data about grandparents.  about black people:  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/casey-foundation-achievement-gap_n_5065959.html  &gt; post how that is comparable to single teen mother. you cannot say facts but do not post a lick of research.  research about what? adoption? no research says that single teen mothers should adopt their children out; neither could any say that about black or old people. it's you who harp on adoption, and suggest that teen mothers are bad as a rule. when i ask about proof, you post data about likelihood.  &gt; nothing here says they are disadvantaged like single teen mothers. in fact it sounds like single teen mothers can be the reason they have to care for a child.  they don't have to be ""as much disadvantaged as"" single teen mothers. it's enough that they are disadvantaged at all. why do you claim one disadvantaged group should relinquish children by default, and the other doesn't?  &gt; an increasing number of children in the united states live in households headed by a grandparent. this trend is due to: teenage pregnancies.  that doesn't matter. i'm talking about disadvantagement. you can't deny they do worse - on average.  &gt; i thought a single teen mother‚Äôs love was enough?  an older single mother needs support too.  &gt; caring for your grandchild can also be very positive and rewarding.  so can be caring about your child.  &gt; grandparents bring the benefit of experience and perspective. they can also provide important stability and predictability for their grandchildren. single teen mothers do not have experience.  not at the moment. but she can gain it later. time is on her side. out of all disadvantaged groups (the disabled, blacks, old people, ex-drug addicts, ex-convicts, etc) teenage parents are most likely to change their life for the better, because their main obstacle (youth) is temporary.  &gt; plenty of people actually know how to raise children unlike you. go take care of your neglected child.  so if a teenage girl gets pregnant, it's her parents' fault? wow. :ddd  &gt; how about let her choose?  you said a pregnant teenage girl should go for adoption. are you going to pretend that for the past few days you haven't argued that this is the best option?  &gt; i am sure you would harass and verbally abuse your daughter if she wanted an abortion or give her baby up for adoption. bad mother, you are.  and you would shame her if she wanted to keep her baby.  &gt; the fact you are planning on your daughter being a teen mother is telling.  yep, you need to stop participating in discussions. they aren't good for your mental health.  &gt; nothing about force.  so why are you even care to whine about my private opinion? i'd rather be kept by my young mom, if she wanted to parent me and could provide for me (however meagerly). why don't you just say that you would prefer to be adopted out?  &gt; you are dumb.  projection.",1,-2,

115589,"denial of parental leave is yet another key plank in keeping america divided along socioeconomic lines.  right now, some people can take time off to raise their children in a non-daycare environment.  those people are upper-middle class or above (and no, i don't want to hear arguments from people who say 'but i am middle class and my wife stays home,' because middle class folks i know live paycheck to paycheck, even when they're being somewhat frugal).  at a very, absolute minimum involving a ton of sacrifice, they're very solidly middle class.  if you're any poorer than that, your child is in daycare starting at 6 weeks or earlier.  while some daycares are pretty decent, most in poorer areas are not.  some are downright disgusting or dangerous.  kids who grow up in them have a disadvantage from the very beginning.  some daycares (especially home daycares, which are more commonly relied upon by lower-income people) ignore infants almost entirely, or have children babysit themselves in front of a television.  by the time kids get to preschool, some have had mommy or daddy home playing peek-a-boo and hide and seek from the time they were infants.  others have been forced into a rather cold, unfeeling system from before their eyes could even focus well.  these opportunity differences will manifest in many, many ways.  and that doesn't have to be.  a lot of people who would be really fantastic parents don't have the money to stay home with a kid.  in fact, i know a lot of really smart, talented, awesome people who are foregoing having kids because they don't have the money to keep them at home.  meanwhile, this past summer i was a teacher at a summer program for rich brats where mommy and daddy would have four or five children as status objects even if they didn't really like children, and i've also taught in an urban area where a few parents had no idea what to do with their kids and i honestly thought daycare might very well be better than home for them.  the very stupid and the very wealthy will always have children, no matter what.  but this policy would make it so that the kind of hardworking people who make up the bulk of the professions that matter in your day to day life -- nurses, teachers, engineers, and the like -- could actually raise their children in the way they'd like to, instead of sending them to daycare, sometimes via (hear this, libertarians?) government funded programs.",1,-1,1

""defeat him totally."" on p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum ""a swift *forceful* spanking."" on the same page they say to whip small children on their bare skin until they stop screaming. ""don't be bullied. give him more of the same."" they say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a ""wounded, submissive whimper.""  &gt; &gt;7) on p.47 they recommend their various whips, including ""a belt or larger tree branch"" to hit children.  &gt; &gt;8) the pearls recommend pulling a nursing infant's hair (p.7), and describe tripping their non-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water (p.67). they recommend ignoring an infant's bumped head when he falls to the floor, and ignoring skinned knees (p.86). they also say ""if your child is roughed-up by peers, rejoice."" (p.81) and on p.103 the pearls say if children lose their shoes, ""let them go without until they (the children) can make the money to buy more.""  &gt; &gt;9) the pearls claim their ""training"" methods are godly, yet they have *no religious training or credentials* they never mention jesus' injunctions to forgive ""seventy times seven"" and be merciful, and they decry the ""extraordinary ingnorance of modern psychology.""  &gt; &gt;the pearls' methods have resulted in parents being investigated by child protective services, children being taken away from parents, a restraining order against a father, and even a babysitter going to jail on felony charges!   another reviewer, manon gray, wrote the following:  &gt;my mother was given this book while i was a child. wanting to raise a well-behaved child, she would spank me with a belt. she is proud of me. i am a senior at princeton university and practicing catholic. however, today my mother would tell you that i am these things in spite of the teachings of ""to train up a child,"" in spite of the self-loathing and insecurity caused by whippings which would not end until i could pretend to be content. pretend to embrace the necessity for my own torture.  &gt; &gt;i was abused. please do not look to this book for guidance.    i'd also refer you to [mike and debi pearl: child disipline or child abuse](http://truthspeaker.wordpress.com/2010/03/09/mike-and-debi-pearl-child-disipline-or-child-abuse/). one story from that webpage discussing the pearl's childrearing recommendations follows:  &gt;on february 6, 2010, lydia schatz, the seven year old homeschooled daughter of kevin and elizabeth schatz, died after having been brutally beaten for mispronouncing a word while reading out loud to her mother. butte county, california district attorney, mike ramsey, reported that evidence shows the child was severely and repeatedly whipped, most likely for several hours, with a 15‚Äù piece of ¬º‚Äù plumbing supply line, the same instrument that also left her older sister with severe kidney damage and in critical condition. the other seven schatz children are now in foster homes, their parents having been charged with torture and murder. &gt; &gt;while it might be comforting to believe that this is one horrific, isolated case of abusive behavior, the fact is that kevin and elizabeth schatz were bible-believing christians who welcomed not only their own children into their home but three adopted ones as well. their friends reported how shocked they were to hear this story about parents whom they called ‚Äúloving‚Äù and ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and children who were ‚Äúpolite and well-behaved,‚Äù words that could describe most homeschooling families. &gt; &gt;but kevin and elizabeth schatz were also devotees of the book to train up a child and its authors, michael and debi pearl, and they patterned their ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù methods after the pearls‚Äô instructions, down to the very instrument they used to beat their children. &gt; &gt;this is not the first time a child has died at the hands of parents who embraced the teachings from ttuac. in 2004, four year old sean paddock suffocated after his mother also beat him with ¬º‚Äù plumbing supply line and then wrapped him tightly in a blanket to keep him from getting out of bed. she is now serving time in jail for first degree murder. &gt; &gt;the killing of precious children in the name of ‚Äúdiscipline‚Äù must stop and those of us who desire to come alongside and encourage homeschooling families must do all that we can to see that this sort of tragedy never happens again. i believe that the pearls‚Äô teachings on chastisement unto repentance, found in their books and magazines and on their website, is not just one among many approaches to disciplining children, but rather, is a form of child abuse and even one that is considered to be assault and battery of a child and punishable by law in many states.  so, i hope you do not look to this woman for guidance.",1,-2,-2

249990,"&gt; no.  there are several concerns you don't seem to understand.  seems there's a lot more you don't understand.   as a kid in grade school they lines us up and gave us shots.   a week later both my brother and i became very ill and had spots all over us. i was the sickest. i was delirious and kept in a quiet room by myself. i suffered hallucinations. eventually i got better. so did my brother. so there's that. vaccines can make you very sick. i might as well have just gotten it for real.     &gt; 1)  young babies cannot be vaccinated.  total bullshit. in 84 when my daughter was born they gave her vaccine injections right away. i think on the same week. she was only 7 pounds 6 ounces. she became very ill the following day. so don't even tell me it wasn't related. she was fine before this. she had a high fever and screamed for hours. there was nothing the doctors would do for her. they just said it happens to some babies and told us to take her home and she would be alright. since we didn't trot her around to show people and kept her at home there was no need for the vaccines. it was just stupid and ill advised. after she got better she still would have screaming fits. these would generally last over an hour. in later years i noticed she had very low frustration levels when trying to learn to read. she hated to even try. other than that she seemed normal but could be very apprehensive when things didn't go as she had hoped. these moods would last for weeks. recently she hung herself. so there's that.   and they do vaccinate babies. they shouldn't but they do. or maybe they quit that dangerous insanity.   babies don't need to be vaccinated because they can get their immunity from their vaccinated mothers. my wife also had been vaccinated but it seemed the doctors just wanted to have something to bill for.   my friends child was vaccinated at one year old after doctors said he would now be at risk since his mother's immunity had worn off. he was learning to speak and had quite a few words. his coordination was excellent. the doctors all gave him good reports on his health. after vaccination he lost all his speech abilities in a weeks time and his coordination was lousy. he fell all the time, was panicky and could no longer sleep well. he was easily frustrated and would have frequent screaming fits. he was fidgety and constantly restless. he's spent the last year regaining his coordination and now has less than ten words barely under his command. the rest of his speech is mostly strange babbling. he's been diagnosed with autism. so far they have promised therapy for him but constantly postpone his sessions. they've done nothing for him. i coach him several times a week and have encouraged the whole family to coach him. we practice making eye contact with him and i coach his mother to be patient with his fits. look him in the eye and make sure he's aware that she has his attention. we do a lot of things to try and help him. it is helping.   their next child is normal and has not been vaccinated. i have urged to be very cautious about accepting vaccinations for this child. they are seriously thinking it over because they can't risk another problem. it's just too stressful having one child that behaves so erratically all day. the baby sleeps well through the night, is cheerful and looks at you directly if you speak his name. he is calm and happily plays with no upset. the difference is remarkable. so there's that.   another friend of mine has tourette's syndrome. his brother is autistic. they were vaccinated as infants. is it related? i don't know. i wonder.   his sister is completely normal and went on to become a very successful lawyer. she went right along with vaccinations for her son. he became ill within a week and lost all speech and much of his coordination. he had been learning to talk and seemed bright and normal before vaccination. to this day his movements are jerky and uncoordinated. he has no speech. he is severely autistic. so there's that. he would have been better off with the measles or chicken pox.     &gt;   a woman that worked with my wife had her baby die after it was infected by an unvaccinated child.   and you just know this for a fact. by the way, are you aware that most of the measles outbreaks here in the us are brought home by missionaries or people who travel to other countries and are unvaccinated? so i'm not totally against vaccinations but maybe your friend should have had herself vaccinated before she became pregnant.   &gt;  this mother had to listen while a fellow faculty member bitterly complained to my wife that the pre-school she wanted to send her daughter to would not accept her because she was not vaccinated and how unfair that was.    uh, she didn't have to listen to anything. she could have just walked away. and if a school won't take an unvaccinated child then just get the kid vaccinated. after five years old the risk is much smaller. or if you feel your child is at risk then find another school. it's that simple. or home school for a few years until the child is older and stronger. or split up the vaccinations. there's no reason to take all three together anyway.    &gt;  haven't you seen any of the media reports of parents taking their unvaccinated child to see the doctor only to find they have the measles and all other children in the waiting room had to be quarantined.   then don't take a healthy child to the doctor. or go to a smaller clinic. i took my daughter to small clinics and paid for it out of pocket when she was sick. few patients in the waiting room. in fact, the waiting room was always empty. less risk of getting sick. and the doctors were better trained and more friendly. also i ended up paying less than a public doctor would have charged through insurance.  &gt;  &gt; 2) the vaccine is not universally effective.  some child who have been vaccinated can, in fact, get the measles.  well, then it must be bullshit.   &gt;  &gt; 3) there are a lot of people with compromised immune systems.  my wife, for example, has a blood cancer called multiple myeloma.  she has gone through hell trying to stay alive.  her treatment kills about 20% of the patients who try it, but she has been doing great.  sucks to be sick. people get sick and die. it's natural. one thing i can guarantee you is that she certainly will die. so will you. so will i. we all will die. some sooner and some later. enjoy life while you can.   &gt;   but measles could kill her.   so get a vaccination. if she can't then think of all those who also are at risk and who can't or won't because they have a history of problems with vaccinations. nothing to be angry about. avoid places of infection if you can.    &gt;  another patient friend of hers died from the flu recently.  i am sure that he tried to stay away from infected people.  he was a doctor himself, who had small children and was also trying his best to stay alive to help them grow up.  as a doctor he should have had his vaccinations. i'm pretty sure he wasn't staying away from sick people if he was a doctor. unless he wasn't actually seeing patients. people die every day. over 600 people died from the flu in the last week of 2014 from what i read. they give flu shots at my work for free. just walk up and get a shot. i pass it by. most of my coworkers got the shot. they all got sick first and passed it around. i eventually got sick as well and enjoyed a few days off but i wasn't near as sick as they were. so i don't understand why get a vaccination at all. i've had them in the past and usually got sick a few days later. and then i got sick with every other thing that came along. from what i can see most of the people bringing the illnesses to work are the ones that got vaccinated. i'm usually the last one sick now and i get well quicker. in san diego i saw the hispanic population lined up for blocks waiting to get the swine flu shot. and you guessed it, they had the most illnesses.   &gt;  but you cannot live in a glass box.   so quit trying.    &gt;  should our grandchild not be able to go to school so that unvaccinated children can?  so should we not be allowed to see our grandchildren?    get them vaccinated. then don't worry.   &gt;  &gt; i will be angry if i want to.  and if enough people were angry enough, this stupid policy of ""opt-out"" and still be allowed in school would be removed.   sure, be angry and force your will on other people. a real nazi. and if they get angry back and don't comply or won't cooperate because you have alienated them, then what? take their children away? remember, they can falsify papers if they want also. start taking people's children away and then you will have a war.   &gt;  sure, if someone has a real medical restriction, that is one thing.  but ""i think this is too much vaccine for an immature immune system to handle"" crap should be laughed off the stage.  are you laughing at all the children who end up with autism? then you are the real monster.",1,-2,-2
500884,"problem would be that this ritual cannot make a woman infertile. the only thing consuming the temple floor dust will do to her is make her miscarry, and prob trip balls while being sicker than she has ever been in her life...    my point would be to show that the christian god is in zero way ""pro life"".  i see christians talking about abortion being a crime against god.  it‚Äôs not a wonder that they are hard pressed to find a conclusive biblical statement to corroborate their position.  in their determination to control women they have been forced to rely on exceedingly weak sections such as ‚Äúthou shall not kill‚Äù,‚Äùi kneweth thou in the womb‚Äù and their favorite: ‚Äúwhen men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her shall be fined, according as the woman‚Äôs husband shall lay upon; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth‚Ä¶‚Äú‚Äìexodus 21:22-24 the problem here is that the man who injures a pregnant woman in the process, shall repay her according to the degree of injury inflicted on her, not the fetus.  i am often dumbfounded at how christians can assume that abortion is wrong judging by these feeble verses when the bible clearly advocates infanticide and many other atrocities against children and pregnant women.  i can no longer allow such ignorance of the bible and deem it necessary to expose the true agenda.  i am tired of the many young christians who are brainwashed by their clergy.  they are only taught the ‚Äúlove and mercy‚Äù parts of the bible and never bother to read what is not so openly preached . the church thrives off of speaking in half truths and concealing their blood soaked robes.  of course my job is to tell about those things that the bible truthfully commands.  here they are, god‚Äôs views on the unborn, the actions of righteous men‚Äù and god‚Äôs commands of infanticide and child abuse: (note-there are torah verses in this list but i will not attack the jewish faith for being pro-life since they are not rampant advocates of the matter. abortions are free in israel to all israelis for instance)  abortion:  hosea 9:11-16 hosea prays for god‚Äôs intervention.  ‚Äúephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  give them, 0 lord: what wilt thou give?  give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. . .ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea though they bring forth, yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.‚Äù clearly hosea desires that the people of ephraim can no longer have children.  god of course obeys by making all their unborn children miscarry.  is not terminating a pregnancy unnaturally ‚Äúabortion‚Äù?  numbers 5:11-21 the description of a bizarre, brutal and abusive ritual to be performed on a wife suspected of adultery.  this is considered to be an induced abortion to rid a woman of another man‚Äôs child.  numbers 31:17 (moses) ‚Äúnow therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every women that hath known man by lying with him.‚Äù in other words: women that might be pregnant, which clearly is abortion for the fetus.  hosea 13:16 god promises to dash to pieces the infants of samaria and the ‚Äútheir women with child shall be ripped up‚Äù.  once again this god kills the unborn, including their pregnant mothers.  2 kings 15:16 god allows the pregnant women of tappuah (aka tiphsah) to be ‚Äúripped open‚Äù. and the christians have the audacity to say god is pro-life. how and the hell is it that christians can read passages where god allows pregnant women to be murdered, yet still claim abortion is wrong?  infanticide:  1 samuel 15:3 god commands the death of helpless ‚Äúsuckling‚Äù infants.  this literally means that the children god killed were still nursing.  psalms 135:8 &amp; 136:10 here god is praised for slaughtering little babies.  psalms 137:9 here god commands that infants should be ‚Äúdashed upon the rocks‚Äù.  the murdering of children:  leviticus 20:9 ‚Äúfor every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.‚Äù  judges 11:30-40 jephthah killed his young daughter (his only child) by burning her alive as a burnt sacrifice to the lord for he commanded it.  psalms 137:8-9 prayer/song of vengeance ‚Äú0 daughter of babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.  happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.‚Äù  2 kings 6:28-29 ‚Äúand the king said unto her, what aileth thee?  and she answered, this woman said unto me, give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.  so we boiled my son, and did eat him: and i said unto her on the next day, give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.‚Äù  deuteronomy 21:18-21 ‚Äúif a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.  and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all israel shall hear, and fear.‚Äù  judges 19:24-29 ‚Äúbehold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them i will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.  but the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man‚Äôs house where her lord was, till it was light. and her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold. and he said unto her, up, and let us be going. but none answered.  then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.  and when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of israel.‚Äù to put it very bluntly this poor, young lady was murdered by her mate for being raped.  exodus 12:29 god killed, intentionally, every first-born child of every family in egypt, simply because he was upset at the pharaoh.  and god caused the pharaoh‚Äôs actions in the first place.  since when is it appropriate to murder children for their ruler‚Äôs forced action?  exodus 20:9-10 god commands death for cursing out ones parents joshua 8 god commanded the deaths of 12,000 men, women, and children of ai.  they were all slain in the ambush that was planned by god.  2 kings 2:23-24 the prophet elisha, was being picked on by some young boys from the city because of his bald head.  the prophet turned around and cursed them in the lords name.  then, two female bears came out of the woods and killed forty-two of them.  you would think that god could understand that sometimes the youthful make childish jokes.  calling someone ‚Äúbald head‚Äù is far from being worthy of death.  leviticus 26:30 ‚Äúand ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.‚Äù  1 samuel 15:11-18 god repents of having made saul king since saul refused to carry out god‚Äôs commandments (i.e., saul refused to murder all the innocent women and children.)  at least god realizes what an immoral, murderous pig he is on this one.  i kings 16:34 laying the foundation for a city using your firstborn child and using your youngest son to set up the gates.  isaiah 13:15-18 if god can find you, he will ‚Äúthrust you through,‚Äù smash your children ‚Äúto pieces‚Äù before your eyes, and rape your wife.  jeremiah 11:22-23 god will kill the young men in war and starve their children to death.  jeremiah 19:7-9 god will make parents eat their own children, and friends eat each other.  lamentations 2:20-22 god gets angry and mercilessly torments and kills everyone, young and old.  he even causes women to eat their children.  child abuse:  genesis 22:9 &amp; 10 ‚Äúand they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.  and abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.‚Äù it matters not that god let abraham get out of murdering isaac.  to put a knife up to your son‚Äôs throat is child abuse.  i kings 3:24-25 ‚Äúand the king said, bring me a sword. and they brought a sword before the king.  and the king said, divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.‚Äù this test was of course given to see who the real mother of the child was.  christians view this king as a wise man.  i look upon his suggestion with far more revulsion then i give accredit to susan smith.  proverbs 13:24, 19:18, 22:15, 23:13-14 &amp; 29:15 god commands repeatedly that you beat your children.  matthew 19:29 if you really loved jesus then he insists that you abandon your wife and children for him.  only that way will he allow you to go to heaven.

915816,"&gt; i do think we need some good scientific research on the subject.  too bad its condemned and people (read: feminist organizations that tell the government what to do) will prevent it from being discussed.  bolded emphasis.  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  &gt;when the university of minnesota press agreed more than a year ago to publish a book called ''harmful to minors: the perils of protecting children from sex,'' it was clear that it would be controversial. other publishers had rejected the manuscript, including one who said it was ''radioactive'' because of its argument for providing children with more sexual education and responsibility.  &gt;but neither the press nor the author, judith levine, a journalist, could have guessed that the book would be released in the midst of a global scandal over sexual abuse of children by roman catholic priests.  &gt;**although it will not arrive in bookstores until may, it has already been branded an apologia for pedophiles by talk radio hosts and conservative critics across the country, and tim pawlenty, the republican majority leader of the minnesota house of representatives, has called for the university to cancel the book.**  &gt;in response, the university of minnesota press has agreed to set up an extraordinary two-month review of the way its press acquires and reviews books, to be conducted by people from other academic presses. ''we thought it was important to make sure our processes are in line with those in the rest of the country,'' said christine maziar, the vice president for research and dean of the graduate school.  &gt;a number of civil libertarian groups signed a letter written by the national coalition against censorship saying that the move undermines academic freedom and ''invites future attempts at intellectual blackmail.''  &gt;**mr. pawlenty, who plans to run for governor, said he had read the book and believed it endorsed sex between adults and children, adding, ''this kind of disgusting victimization of children is intolerable, and the state should have no part in it.''**  &gt;**the book does not, in fact, endorse pedophilia. what ms. levine does argue is that the fear of pedophilia is overblown and that the age of consent should be lowered in certain circumstances. ms. levine tries to separate what she sees as real risks -- h.i.v. infection, unwanted pregnancies and sexual violence -- from risks she calls exaggerated or even invented. she argues forcefully against abstinence-only education and what she sees as a pervasive tendency to view all manifestations of childhood sexuality as dangerous or disturbing.**  &gt;''the reaction to the book is an example of the kind of hysteria i'm writing about,'' ms. levine said. conservative groups started attacking the book after she gave an interview to newhouse news service.  &gt;**ms. levine, a new york writer who specializes in questions of sex and and gender, also makes a carefully argued -- if untimely -- case that the danger presented by child molesters has been vastly exaggerated, and that prosecutors put ever greater resources into tracking pedophilia and child pornography that would be better spent elsewhere. for instance, while prosecutors sometimes claim that child molesters have an extremely high rate of recidivism -- one of the justifications for sex-offender registration laws -- ms. levine has statistics suggesting that it is in fact relatively low. she cites a 1996 study by the national center for institutions and alternatives that concluded that only 13 percent of former sex offenders were rearrested for sex crimes, compared with a 74 percent rearrest rate for criminal offenders overall.**  &gt;but by far the most explosive part of the book, one that is directly related to the current scandal, has to do with the age of consent.  &gt;ms. levine argues that sex between teenagers and adults is not always wrong, and that many people are too quick to deny children and teenagers the right to make their own sexual decisions, often by labeling all such contact ''abuse.''  &gt;''teens often seek out sex with older people,'' she writes, ''and they do so for understandable reasons: an older person makes them feel sexy and grown up, protected and special; often the sex is better than it would be with a peer who has as little skill as they do. for some teens, a romance with an older person can feel more like salvation than victimization.''  &gt;needless to say, many disagree. dr. david spiegel, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at stanford university, said that minors were too young to consent to a sexual relationship with an adult, even if they say they want it.  &gt;''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  &gt;ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.  &gt;a model for that balance can be found in the netherlands, she argues. in 1990 the dutch parliament made sexual intercourse for people between the ages of 12 and 16 legal as long as there was mutual consent; the law excludes adult family members and authority figures like teachers and members of the clergy. parents can overrule a child's wishes only if they persuade the council for the protection of children that they are acting in the child's best interest. children can also bring charges if they feel they are being exploited or coerced.  &gt;**but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''**  &gt;**some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.**  &gt;**earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.**  &gt;the university of minnesota press has already received some 800 e-mail messages and 200 phone calls about ms. levine's book, most of them fiercely negative, said douglas armato, the press's director.  &gt;''we've published a lot of books we thought were controversial, but never anything like this,'' he said.  &gt;but sometimes controversies pay off. a month before its publication, ''harmful to minors'' reached no. 27 on amazon's list. the first printing of 3,500 copies has already sold out, and a second printing of 10,000 is on the way.  http://sites.dartmouth.edu/lisabaldez/files/2012/11/baldez_wompols2001.pdf  https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2017/06/canada_launches_newfeministinternationalassistancepolicy.html  https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadas-leading-womens-groups-seek-co-ordinated-advocacy/article29066258/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;  &gt;national action committee on the status of women   &gt;other coalitions have also emerged over the past two years, notably on the issue of violence against women.  &gt;the 2015 blueprint for canada's national action plan on violence against women and girls, for example, was developed by a network of 22 organizations and independent experts, and recommended the federal government set up an inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.  women's advisory groups to u.s. government  just google that.  https://www.state.gov/s/gwi/priorities/econ/258463.htm  https://www.justice.gov/ovw/national-advisory-committee-violence-against-women  https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/160060.htm  remember, it is women/feminists who raised the age of consent in the first place, to punish men. it is feminists who are informing government officials, pressuring them to condemn any research and books on this subject as pedophilia.",1,,-1

813107,"choice of where the vouchers are spent is left up to the parents. schools have to compete on quality.  the spectator did a good article on this, pasted below:  liberate schools and spark a revolution the spectator (london); feb 10, 2007; james forsyth, fraser nelson; p. n/a full text: (copyright spectator feb 10, 2007)  belvedere school and shorefields school in liverpool are just half a mile away from each other but educationally they are worlds apart. the first is a private girls' school where 100 per cent of pupils get five good gcse passes. the second is a comprehensive where only 12 per cent achieve this basic goal. yet the teaching costs are almost identical and, in a pioneering move, belvedere is being taken into the state sector as a city academy. it is a prototype for what could be a revolution in english secondary education.  this is as close as labour dares come to a system which has transformed education wherever it has been deployed, yet in britain dare not speak its name. iain duncan smith called it an education 'passport' and michael howard renamed it the 'right to choose'.  alan milburn, the former health secretary, talks about an 'education credit' and lord adonis, the schools minister, does not call it anything. nonetheless the voucher system, in its various forms and whatever euphemisms are used to describe it, is proving an international success.  those denouncing the system as the product of discredited right-wing ideology will have difficulty explaining its success in sweden, arguably the most socialist country in the developed world. school vouchers were proposed in 1991 by its shortlived conservative government, yet the scheme proved so popular that it has been preserved and expanded by the social democrats. this has surprised everyone. 'it was in our manifesto, but it was a symbolic gesture, ' says anders hultin, an architect of the scheme. 'we had no proposals to roll this out.' but none were needed. to their astonishment, take-up was huge. they had unwittingly harnessed one of the strongest forces in civil society: parents' determination to do what is best for their child.  school groups seemed to come from nowhere. community groups sent in applications, villages clubbed together. today one in ten swedish state-funded schools is run by the private groups and those which remain have been shown in studies to have improved sharply. headmasters of swedish state schools now face a threat entirely absent from the comfortable british system:  if they fail to please parents, the children will leave and enrol elsewhere.  freedom to set up a school is enshrined in the dutch constitution, and today two in three state-funded schools are privately run.  this bottom-up approach means more, smaller schools: the average school roll is 200 in sweden and 190 in the netherlands.  in england it is 890 and rising: closures are running at the level of 120 schools a year.  there are now reams of academic studies on the voucher system and they show that, contrary to common belief, they don't much help the rich. choice already exists for the wealthy, whether it means choosing between england's 2,200 private schools or buying a house in a better catchment area.  the problem in england lies in the 3.3 million pupils in the 243 schools which the chief inspector of schools last week said were failing to provide an adequate education. it is these pupils for whom the voucher system works best.  a harvard university study into the voucher system in milwaukee and cleveland -- which offer it only to pupils below a certain income threshold -- found that test results after four years were 11 percentage points higher in maths and six in reading. in both cities, three quarters of those receiving vouchers were from single parents on low wages; the middle class had not managed to hijack the system. studies in charter schools, american equivalent of the old direct-grant schools in england, yield similarly impressive results.  while the last decade has been one of missed opportunity for education in england, the tools for recovery are already here. exam results in city academies, which bear comparison with the american charter schools, have on average improved at twice the average national rate. there are 47 open now, just under 100 planned for this time next year and 400 earmarked for the end of the decade. if this happens, city academies will account for one in ten state schools.  both labour and the conservatives have toyed with the idea of education liberalisation. when tony blair was introducing his education white paper in october 2005 he spoke about making every school independent and noted that swedish exam results 'improved fastest where schools knew children were free to go elsewhere'. but a backbench rebellion forced him to abandon his plans to loosen the grasp which local educational authorities (leas) hold over state schools. the subsequent education act was perforated with concessions.  the conservatives at the last election proposed a swedish-style policy where parents could take the full value of the ¬£5,000 education allocation and spend it on another school. it couldn't be topped up, so the choice would be restricted to the 145 private schools whose fees are below the state level. but this was a superficial restraint: as sweden found, new schools pop up from nowhere under a system where money follows pupils. and the gap between state funds and private fees is also deceptive.  the deal with belvedere school -- and another, william hulme, in manchester -- is a model for how state funding can buy good private education. their fees are ¬£8,000, yet they are becoming city academies at a cost of ¬£5,000 a pupil. this will be done by admitting boys and increasing class sizes somewhat. add more sixth-form pupils, and the funding gap between private and public closes.  this is a strange time for david cameron to have dropped the 'right to choose' proposal, which the blairites had privately considered the one truly radical policy in the last tory manifesto. 'two years ago it looked as if they'd overtake us on education, ' says one then blair adviser. 'now, they're intent on repeating our mistakes.' mr cameron's aides say we should wait until the tory policy review is produced at the end of this year.  this takes the education debate to an intriguing impasse. both mr cameron and gordon brown are avowed opponents of the voucher system and speak in sectarian terms about public and private. but the agenda is not dead on either side of the political divide. on the labour benches mr milburn has advanced his personal plans for a voucher system for the poorest. direct democracy, a grouping mainly of young tory mps, will soon publish a pamphlet proposing a system remarkably similar to that mr cameron ditched.  when interviewed on bbc radio 4 last week, mr blair was challenged over the slide in social mobility. while he spoke about his city academy programme, he conceded that his policies 'have not helped in the way that we should those at the very bottom of the pile'. his successor in no. 10 need not need not accept this record of failure.",0,,
247679,"&gt;i‚Äôm in my early twenties, and i‚Äôm exposed to a lot of messaging that portrays your twenties as the time to screw around and figure things out, and your thirties as more of a time to settle down and figure things out.  &gt;basically, i think the age at which you‚Äôre expected to act like an adult and expected to be capable of making mature decisions has gone up significantly.  &gt;it used to be:  &gt;0-15ish childhood &gt; 16-60 adulthood &gt; 65+ senior  and you may still find that in other cultures.  in my area of the us i live near a large population of amish and mennonite.   by 10 or 12 the boys are out in the fields doing men's work.  in their mid teens they're driving their buggies on the road by themselves and conducting business.    girls usually stopped going to school after 8th grade because that's all the education they will need for the adult life.   although they are allowed to take time before formally joining the church as an adult and marriage,  it's true they don't spend their 20s finding themselves.    they don't go off to college or hitchhike across europe or any of the other things typical americans might do before settling down.  however,  theirs is a completely different culture.     they are ready to settle into a career at 18 because they don't need college, they were raised with much more of a work ethic, they don't have a bazillion different job titles to choose from, and frankly they're raised to be more emotionally mature.    you just don't see amish kids acting like spoiled brats.   i've never ones seen one back talk an adult.  they are raised with a very strong sense of community and family.  in my experience the typical american 25 year old seems to have the maturity of the amish 16-18 year old.  their mindset is different than ours.  their motivation is more about community, god,  and family.   average american motivation in early 20s:  me! me! me!  they may start courting for marriage in late teens or early 20s.   but they enter into marriage truly believing it is for the rest of their life.  divorce is not the norm.  kids raised in single parent households don't happen.   they don't think the #1 purpose of marriage and kids is their constant happiness.   marriage is hard work, and many typical 20somethings simply aren't going to do it (hence the higher divorce rate for those marrying young).  &gt; the increased financial dependency is likely due to the recession, and i‚Äôm not faulting anyone for that, i know it‚Äôs not our generation‚Äôs fault that it‚Äôs harder for us to afford a house.a i'm in my 40s. i have seen recessions come and go.   houses have never been that easy to buy.      but i think you have it backwards.   buying a house doesn't make someone mature and responsible.    you've got to be mature and responsible to have that halfway decent job and save up the downpayment.  &gt;i want to be clear that i‚Äôm certainly not judging anyone for wanting to have fun or for spending their twenties traveling, i just think the cultural idea has shifted to the idea that settling down at 23 is weird and not something you‚Äôre supposed to do. or even that a 23-year-old is somehow developmentally incapable of handling the responsibilities that come with settling down.  but statistically the 23 year old american isn't on average ready.   higher divorce rate if married young.   less likely to do what's necessary to achieve home ownership.    even something as routine as driving a car is much more likely to go badly, hence highest insurance for teens and then slightly cheaper until you hit about 25.  sorry but the numbers don't support your opinion.   &gt;the only way to learn how to function in the adult world is to actually learn, and it‚Äôs like some people think that they‚Äôll be hit with a magical bolt of lightning on their 30th birthday that teaches them how to buy a house, marry the right person, raise a kid, and open an ira.   nobody thinks it works like that.   the the way to function well is through experience.  the older you are the more experience you have.   it's not one moment.  it's a million little moments that happen through childhood, teens, and into early 20s.     i know it may be hard for you to understand that you will be different in in your 30s compared to now.  but the fact you don't yet know how much you don't know.      &gt;for centuries, people my age raised children, married, bought/built a home, etc. there is no reason why i wouldn‚Äôt be able to learn to do the same, but it‚Äôs like that option isn‚Äôt really presented to me.   for centuries people worked very hard, weren't trying to live their lives like a romance story, didn't have all the options we do,  and generally lived a simpler life.  they couldn't afford to divorce,  and shorter lifespan meant they aren't going to be trapped with the same person another 50 years.   they didn't have birth control as we do now, so most women didn't gave casual sex.   today about half of pregnancies are unplanned.   if a woman got married at 23, she did stay married, she will have kids, and back then ""single parent"" meant widower  &gt;which i think is kind of bullshit. you can grow as a person after getting married to someone.     but when you marry before you're sure what you really want or need out of life,  growing as a person can very likely mean *growing apart.*  and in our culture, when the going gets tough in a relationship the answer is to end it.   we value individual happiness far too much to stay with a spouse who doesn't make us feel happy enough.   we say things such as ""life is short"" and ""you deserve deserve to be happy"".           &gt; the solid majority of people get married before they have kids, and both of their personalities, hobbies, and worldviews will change tremendously. however, no one tells you that you shouldn‚Äôt get married until you‚Äôve already have kids because you‚Äôre going to be a completely different person post-kids.  like your example of home ownership changing people to be more responsible, i feel that it's also incorrect  to believe having kids make a person more responsible.   you can have either, remain immature and irresponsible, and that's a reason why social services investigates.   no -- a person really needs to be mature and responsible first.  otherwise the kids or the marriage suffers terribly as years go by and maturity slowly improves.      &gt;i know that marriages at a young age fail, but i think it‚Äôs kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy because ‚Äúsensible/responsible‚Äù people are more likely to wait until they‚Äôre older because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve been taught to do.  and if you get married young despite it not being normal for your socioeconomic group, you‚Äôre going to get a lot of negativity and you‚Äôre not going to have as many friends sharing the experience with you.   &gt;and i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good thing.   but you're not getting why that's what young people are taught to do.   why do you think others are advising you to wait?  is it a giant conspiracy against young people?  why would others strongly advise it?  why can't you accept that maybe those with more life experience don't want you to repeat the same mistakes ?   one day when you're an old fart like me you will understand.   in the meantime you will simply have to trust those around you are looking out for your best interests.   besides:  if you expect to live into your 70s, 80s, and beyond will it really hurt you to suggest you wait 5 years before making any major life choices.",1,1,

  warning:  spoilers ahead@@  the original karen settman decides to go underground to have her 7 babies, instead of opting for selective reduction of her pregnancy.  which i'm sure would have been an option, giving they were encouraging people to get sterilized.    predictably, she dies in childbirth and grandpa steps in to raise the babies.  nothing is known about the baby daddy.    grandpa names them after the days of the week.  which kind of works well for the ""hey, here's your one day of the week"" you're allowed outside plan he has.  he could have gone with the same letter names, but that would have been confusing for saturday and sunday and tuesday and thursday.    thursday is the first kid to go out to school and he reminds her, ""you are the one and only karen"" to reinforce she can't tell anyone.  so you get your basic, totalitarian oppressive regime.  glenn close's character, nicolette cayman has a  hairstyle and outfit in the beginning echoes that of the female nazi elite in a futuristic setting.  even though the speech she's giving is in 2043 (most of the action takes place later in 2073).  i guess they decided to go 100 years retro in fashion that year.  and i was pretty much suspicious of the whole cyro, we'll just put the extra kids to sleep until things get better thing as soon as i saw the ad.  though i was expecting a soylent green angle vs. more nazi parallels on that one.    we have flashbacks to the women's childhoods.  first did grandad soundproof the place?  they're living in a doorman apartment building with an elevator.  we'll call it the seven cave for easy reference.  how do the neighbors not hear 7 kids running around?   if grandad did soundproof it that well, there should be a product placement ad.    ok, even if grandad managed to soundproof the 7 cave, how do people not notice that he's bringing in food for 8 people and taking out trash for 8 people? especially given food is hard to get?  the childhood scenes can be summed up as a a really bizarre mix of diary of anne frank meets an extremely disturbing version of punky brewster.  when thursday sneaks out to skateboard on saturday (the day of the week, she doesn't skateboard on her sister), she injures her finger severely.  whether it's because he can't seek medical attention for her or she can't have scars the others don't have, i don't know, but all of the 7 siblings are giving up that finger.  and this isn't the only time fingers fingers are cut off from others in the movie.  i'm squeamish so i fast forwarded and missed dialogue from that scene which may be relevant to the end.  yet, only friday wears glasses and the others don't.  does friday wear contacts?  do the others have non prescription frames?    how does the doorman not figure out he's talking to different sisters?  my second favorite line of dialogue from this mess is when he says, ""last night you (saturday) were puking in the planter and today you (sunday) look as fresh as a daisy.""  on monday morning, monday pukes as she's getting ready for work.  the sisters blame it on a bad rat (yep, the food shortage is that bad).  but i'm guessing most of us can see the plot line that monday's pregnant coming from a mile away.  when monday doesn't come back, tuesday takes over on her designated day.  and she's chastised by her sister for eating a pot brownie.  hell, she doesn't know if she'll be killed or what and she's in for a pretty rough day, losing an eyeball, let her have her pot brownie without judgment.  i hope they have good dismemberment insurance in dystopian 2073, what with all the fingers and eyes people are losing.  so there's this big attack on the seven cave, where they use tuesday's eyeball to get in.  they're trying to keep things quiet because knowing all 7 of them grew up to adulthood would make cayman's credibility look bad.    speaking of credibility, we now deal with the plot holes of the sisters' escapes and a few who we thought were dead coming back to life.   this is where i start questioning my decision to view this movie.   basically sunday dies and stays dead.  wednesday and saturday die and stay dead. friday sacrifices herself to give thursday time to get out of the 7 cave and tell the world about cayman and find out the fates of monday and tuesday. she mcgyvers an impressive defense against all of the heavily armed guards storming the 7 cave before she departs this vale of tears.   or maybe friday's thinking, ""hey with saturday and sunday gone, all i have to look forward to is monday.  goodbye cruel world!""  while saturday was the party girl you'd expect her to be and sunday was at least devout on the surface, friday was kind of like a lot of us once we hit middle age.  wanted to stay in and relax from the week and do geeky things.  wednesday is like sarah connor in terminator, just what you need to get over hump day.  thursday is more like a college student who's figured if you don't take friday classes, you can just wing it to the weekend and indulge your skateboarding and anti-authoritarian tendencies.    when monday's secret lover, who is the baby daddy, finds out they are multiples, thursday says they're identical in every way.  cue awkward pause and she says, well they're not identical in every single way.  i guess to keep his thoughts from wandering to what a menage a many would have been like in happier times.  basically thursday comes up with a plan to save who she thinks is monday, presuming tuesday dead because of the eyeball and gets the baby daddy to sneak her in (he works as a guard for the child police).    she finds out that tuesday is in fact alive.    then we get into soap opera evil multiple territory.  monday sold out her sisters because she wanted to be the only karen!!! but cayman is going to keep one sister alive to protect her scam deal with monday a secret.    at one point there's a dynasty style fight in the bathroom, with water, a real gun and somewhat identically dressed sisters fighting.  this is where my favorite line, which almost, but not quite makes the worth watching.  it should go down in the bad tv movie/minseries hall of fame along with ""which one of you bitches is my mother? asked by phoebe cates in lace""  speaking of phoebe cates, is it just me or do the sisters vary their accents from french to english to us?  the line is ""i was born first, the rest of you were just afterbirth"".  which confused me until i remembered not all countries start the week on sunday, some start monday.  and monday, like the start of the workweek, ambushes you with unpleasant surprises.  though it doesn't usually kill you.  so i see a flaw with grandad's plan.  but i guess the seven dwarves don't correspond to days of the week.    the monday-thursday grudge match ends with a reference to how they all lost their finger because of thursday and thursday apologizes.  a gun goes off, wounding one of them.     cayman is actually talking some sensible shit about how people need to prove they can support a child and have the ability to be a decent parent to raise the kid.  this is part of what i considered the breederific part.  the writers took a sensible sentiment and put it in the mouth of a retro neo nazi chick who's ok with surplus kids being cremated as long as they're heavily sedated first.    tuesday and baby daddy manage to take down cayman by broadcasting footage on the truth of what's happening, including the fate of surplus kids.    a dying monday asks tuesday and thursday to take care of them, looking or motioning to  her belly.  which if you fell asleep before she puked into the toilet, will come as a surprise to you.  otherwise, you're thinking i knew she was pregnant ever since she puked in the toilet, or at least that's what i thought.    tuesday and thursday seem surprised she's pregnant, but in their defense it was a pretty busy week and they've been trying to dodge death and mourn their dead siblings.  she sold her sisters down the river for baayyybbeeez!  she wanted to be the only karen so she could marry baby daddy and have their babies.  so she reported her sisters as multiples.   cayman is shown giving another speech after she's been arrested.    the law is repealed and it's like ve and vj all rolled up into one.  ""pregnant mothers are coming out of hiding, many in poorer areas"" one newscaster announces.  tuesday, now known as terry and thursday, now known as karen are both standing beside baby daddy and watching dead monday's fetuses grow in some tank in some high tech nursery.  and you hear newborns crying and this is supposed to be a happy ending.  now, obviously killing the children and adults identified as siblings was wrong.  but how is encouraging people to have more babies when the food supply has been wiped out and the gmo food caused multiple births and birth defects a good idea?  and monday was kind of a sociopath.  who's to say one or both of her twins won't be a sociopath?    tl:dr woman violates one child policy to secretly birth 7 babies. she dies in childbirth, grandpa takes them in and has them share one identity.  one's a sociopath with a sense of entitlement, gets pregnant and sells her sisters out, killing 4 of them in the process and dying herself, only to have her unborn twins saved to be gestated in a giant tank.  body count, 6 dead. 2 surviving sisters and 2 potential nephews/nieces who may or may not be sociopaths. body part count, 8 fingers and one eyeball and any viewer's willing suspension of disbelief.   oh and people who are concerned about population growth are retro/neo nazis.",1,-1,1

476054,"you will work it out. your life simply will have to change to accommodate the expense of the child. unfortunately you are not a true single mom, just unmarried, and you are not below the poverty assistance line without your boyfriend's income.  full time childcare for the first 6 mo to a year will be expensive but it will get cheaper, since the infant-to-teacher ratio drops as the child gets older: it will eventually go down to about 800ish to 900ish if not less.   get new housing now that is much cheaper,  see what monthly bills you can eliminate or reduce - cancel cable tv, trade in your car, plan your food budget better.  ask for gifts of large items like a crib from family and throw a big baby shower, look on craigslist for all your baby stuff.  see if you can take 12 weeks of maternity leave and what your options are for paid vs unpaid leave. see if you can work part time after 6 wks if its unpaid leave. some employers are very maternity friendly, some aren't. but know your rights according to your contract and your state etc (ie they have to accomodate you pumping by law!)  the father should have a few hours of his day time that he can get the child out of daycare so you arent paying full time all the time.  i was a full time university student and i did have hours in the day i wasn't actively on campus. have him plan his next semester's schedule to take all of his classes on certain days so he may have a tues/thurs off or something.  four days vs 5 days of childcare can help with expenses. if he hasn't already taken out student loans,  or whatever, he should. its his responsibility to take on debt if he wants to finish school yet provide for his child. plus some universities, esp large ones, have daycare programs or 'child study centers' available to students, look into that! theyre usually staffed with early childhood education majors, lol.   see if you can find a small home-based day care who can provide care at cheaper rates.  after personal experience, i think the mixed-age home day care actually would give your infant the best adult attention since the slightly older kids can amuse themeselves more with each other and toys, (say a couple 18mo-2yr olds) and that frees up caregiver(s) to hold and tend to baby. institutional daycare is often unhealthy (more sick time for baby and more time off work for you) and the caregivers usually have 4 or 5 infants to one adult. in home daycares may have a slightly higher kid to care provider ratio but the ages are mixed so the infant to adult ratio is lower, sometimes 1:1 or 1:2.  i'd make sure the overall ratio was about 1:6.  the other option is to look for ads or word of mouth for someone like a housewife with grown kids who looooves babies, or a retired grandmotherly/former preschool teacher type who would appreciate an extra 600/mo for watching an infant in their or your home.   you make 60k, prob get 15% taken for taxes, whats left might be a squeeze with your col in ma and supporting your boyfriend and baby, but you def aren't in the poorhouse over it. (and by the way you have tax time options for your childcare expenses, can get  a refund of it, claim  a dependent for your tax return for more monthly take home pay).  you need to scale down instead of looking for how to live a similar lifestyle without making adjustments for the cost of a child.   and by the way pumping at work, breastfeeding at home and using cloth diapers can really help save! your kid will be in diapers til 2.5 at least, and thats $80/mo for diapers.  formula is sooo expensive, about $20 a can, between one and two cans a week, and its really easy to waste it and end up buying more (breastmilk's free and it has a longer 'counter' life to resist pathogens growing in bottle after its been drunk from, etc.)  cloth diaper resorces are abound on the internet, check it out.  get a stack of like 50 infant prefolds and covers for the first 3 mo and then get an one-size diaper like a pocket for caregivers to use.   i used cloth diapers for 2.5 yrs with my daughter and loved it.  i'm about to have baby #2 and totally plan on using them again (and we aren't doing it for cost reasons really, just so much better than disposables!)  i actually resold all my diapers (they have about a 50% resale value on places like diaperswappers.com and hyenacart.com/spots_corner) so i'm buying almost everything again since i had all girly stuff and this new one is a boy.   i understand your dilemma somewhat with paying for childcare. we recently decided that even though i am a stay at home mom my daughter *needs* the social stimulation and interaction of two days a week of 5 hours of daycare and that sets us back $80 every week.  some times i am just like lets save $320/mo and not do it!  but she needs it,  and we figure our finances to make it work.      the father should take a hard look at his academic plan and job prospects. how close is he to finishing? would taking a semester to a year off completely throw things off? is he in grad school? does he have a ta/internship/thesis project that it would screw up?  he would save you 1200 a mo being a stay at home dad for a year and it would be so much better for kiddo. it really, really sucks to postpone goals like that but it has to happen sometimes.    good luck.",1,1,

372364,"it wasn't considered wrong until the mid-1990s.  children were always, for all of history, viewed as sexual but immature, just like in every other way they are full people but immature.  there was no real reason to obsess over childhood sexuality since there was no danger of pregnancy.  most sexual politics was based on the idea of domination on the part of the person doing the penetrating.  the people being penetrated were usually seen as being dominated, whether they were a woman, girl, boy, another man, whatever.    in the mid-1990s, roseanne barr came out and shared many terrible experiences she had as a child that involved her consent being violated and her being raped.  the outcome of this was not that people felt confirmed that they were right and that rape laws should also cover children (as they already did) and that we should help provide support for any children that come forward.  instead, the reaction was the mantra ""children are nonsexual creatures.""  instead of violating their consent by forcing them to do things they didn't want to do, everyone decided it was much better to violate their consent by telling them that they didn't have the capacity to consent.  they based this on very flimsy evidence, mostly showing that people who are raped suffer terribly.  we already knew that, but for some reason they thought it necessary to create this imaginary situation where children are so profoundly stupid that they can't even decide whether or not they want to be touched.  apparently they've never taken a long car trip with siblings sharing a seat.    so once they spread that idea around, and it was widely accepted on the pop psychology circuit (the actual psychology circuit never bought into it), they started telling parents that if they caught their children masturbating, or having sex play with other children, it was a sign that their children must have been raped.  their basic premise, after all, is that children are born asexual and that any sexual knowledge whatsoever is a corruption forced upon them by an adult or another abused child.  this idea is still the most widely held in society.  it's completely false, but that doesn't prevent its spread.    many children that are caught maturbating, particularly toddlers, are taken to the doctor for treatment for movement or seizure disorders.  since the doctors can only accept the parents description of the event as evidence, and the parents have put the idea that their children have a sexual component to their lives so far out of mind, it is described as resembling a seizure.  the children are usually put on strong anti-seizure medications.  a recent study evaluating children on anti-seizure medications found that a large percentage of them were simply masturbating, usually in car seats and by pressing their legs together to create pressure on their genitals.  when the parents were told they could take them off of the medication and that what was happening was just 'infantile masturbation', they pled that the doctor would instead call it 'infant movement disorder'.  parents now prefer to think of their children as disordered than as someone who might masturbate.    all of this, understandably, causes tremendous neurosis in children over the subject of their sexuality.  until they start puberty, even the merest mention of pleasure from genital contact or sexual curiosity will be met with accusatory ""who touched you?""s.  even well into puberty, most parents still assume that their offspring (i use that word because using the word ""children"" to refer to adolescents is wrong.  the definition of the word 'child' means pre-pubescent.) are non-sexual and have no desire to help their children become sexually happy people.  this is a reprehensible shortcoming on the part of the parents.  they side with their own desire to have their offspring depedent upon them for everything, rather than realizing that they need to be taught how to be an adult and be independent.  they couch it in all sorts of fear-mongering nonsense (as the crime rate plummets more and more) but the bottom line is that they don't want to raise an adult.  they want their child to remain 'innocent', ignorant, and dependent.  and since they shared a similar upbringing that neglected their sexual and emotional development, they're not mature enough to stand back and do the hardest thing every parent has to do when raising a kid - cut the cord.   edit:  added some formatting to fight the 'wall of text' effect.  the history of sex and human development are areas i've done a great deal of research on, and there's a tremendous amount of information that's just not common knowledge about it... and a tremendous amount of common knowledge about it is flat out wrong.",1,-2,-1

(and if nothing else, this would happen simply on an ""efficiency"" argument basis; far simpler for a local, county or state government to submit *en masse* an electronic list of people &amp; fine and then receive a single payment back than to muck around with all kinds of other ""collection"" schemes.)  5. you could probably toss in any and all kinds of fines, penalties, judgments, and payments into that mix -- everything from child support payments to unpaid construction liens and small claims court judgements, student loan payments, probably even private unsecured credit payments.  (there is already a legal case-law precedent for this in allowing various judgements to ""attach"" and seize things like income tax refunds.)  ---  **then, there would also be the affect on the family/household level:**  1. since every adult would be getting their own payment, this means that husbands and wives would each get a ""prebate"" payment made directly to them, and (iirc) in some form, an additional payment based on the number of children (probably varying with age, infants tending to purchase less than teenagers).  2. consider what that would mean in the cases of ""dysfunctional"" families.  regardless of whether she is working or not, if the wife/mom (or husband/dad) is a drinker, drug addict, gambler, or shopaholic then a significant portion of the household income will come every month payable in their name, transferring money from the *responsible* parent/spouse (the one who buys/pays for all of the families real needs and pays the ""fair tax"" surtax on everything they buy) over to the irresponsible one -- effectively enabling such behavior at a significantly higher magnitude than is currently seen. (now doubtless there will be some ""administrative appeal mechanism"" for the responsible spouse to go through to at least get back the dependent children's portion -- but by definition such a thing would be a ""nuclear option"" in most families, the equivalent of divorce and custody or involuntary mental commitment proceedings.)  3. and then we come to the kids. if junior (or janey) is working significant hours to earn their own ""keep"" in terms of buying clothes, paying for gas/food/entertainment, then they will be paying the ""fair tax"" -- but yet the ""prebate"" (rebate) of those taxes will not go to them, but rather to their parents, who (it is assumed) are paying for the needs of the child.  4. which brings up the question: at what point will the kids be entitled to directly receive their own ""prebate"" check.  either some arbitrary age (18? 21?) will be established, or some other ""means test"" or ""application/hearing/proceeding"" will be needed.  and either one is perhaps equally problematic depending upon the family (again, filing such a claim would certainly be a sign of youthful ""defiance"" and financially significant in the lives of everyone involved) -- i can foresee devastating effects on family life as a result (the equivalent of how various welfare &amp; child care payments to teen moms have changed and often devastated the structure of impoverished inner city families -- do we really want that writ large into every family across all demographics?)  5. and lest you think i am denigrating all youth, i am not. we all know of at least the occasional family where the children are paradoxically harder-working and more fiscally responsible than their parents; are those hard-working youth then to be taxed at a 23%/30% rate on all their purchases -- and yet be bereft of their ""prebate""? should they be required to jump through hoops just to prevent a drunk, drug-addicted, gambling, shopaholic, or even just *less* responsible parent from gaining a significant government-transferred amount from them?  6. and then conversely, what happens when the child turns 18? (or 21 or whatever the ""normal"" age of adulthood is established as the time they receive their own direct full-adult ""prebate"" payment). in responsible non-dysfunctional households where both the parents and their young adult children are responsible (but seriously how many of those are there?) -- for them, this won't present a problem.  but for any family that is either dysfunctional, or which has an ""irresponsible"" young ""new adult"" -- or borderline cases where the youth's ""prebate"" payment might prove the ""tipping point"" -- this could cause no end of family disputes. (will such a thing enable a generation of ""uber-slacker"" johnnies and janies -- holding their families somewhat hostage via the promise of a portion of their ""prebate""?)  ---  **and then there is the distorting effect of a ""uniform"" payment (at least per adult) across all age demographics.**  what are the social and economic consequences of this?    * if the ""prebates"" are weighed too heavily towards the ""dependent/child"" side, then we would in effect be implementing an transfer of wealth from all non-child households.  * conversely if it is weighed *against* children (and more towards adults/households), then the opposite will occur, and families with kids will be penalized and subsidize childless households.  * it must (at least) be conceded that arriving at anything like an ""optimum"" initial ratio/rate for adult-households versus child/dependent-households will be difficult (and no doubt the subject of a lot of political maneuvering).  * and how will it all distort purchasing patterns?  the income tax (and especially the corporate income tax) has significantly distorted everything to do with major purchases, finances and other actions &amp; behaviors -- nearly everything is decided while at least ""factoring in"" how it affects one's taxes.  *(i will admit that getting rid of the ridiculously distorting effects of the income tax and the ""how does this affect our taxes"" part of business management would in itself be a massive boon to our economy {though it would obviously piss off a large number of consulting &amp; accounting firms} -- but there is some merit in the phrase ""better the devil you know..."" so to speak.)  * but more to the point above --just as pell grants and federal student loans policies have had a massive (and almost entirely negative imo) impact on college costs, how will the ""fair tax"" and the ""prebate"" affect our economy, and in what ways with what demographics?  costs across the county are not uniform -- what will be a barely sufficient ""prebate"" in new york city, will be a ""windfall"" in rural parts of the country. (and while initially there are no plans to vary the ""prebate"" by accommodating varying cost of living, you can be sure that that won't last long, and it will become a political football like any other issue, with passions running strong on all sides {because heck we're talking money here}.)  ---  **finally, consider the fact that this does not replace or correct, or eliminate the problems we have with inflation and our ""fiat"" monetary system.** (indeed not, since the ""prebate"" amounts would be set by the government, there would be a tendency to underestimate or at a minimum to *delay* any upward {or even downward} adjustments in the ""prebate"" amounts to compensate.)",0,,
995476,"**eternal dolls (based around interview with a vampire and let the right one in)**  eternal dolls are a very peculiar bloodline inside the vampire society. no one know how this bloodline started, but some people say it‚Äôs related to the practice of embracing orphans and abandoned children in the dark ages to serve as spies and saboteurs.  but what are the eternal dolls you may ask. well, they are a bloodline completely composed of children turned kindred. because of their curse, they are forever stuck into childhood, never growing or developing beyond their condition. some people are just scared of them, mainly because of their condition, they‚Äôve become very manipulative and sadist over time, abusing their appearance to get what they want.  they also developed a very interesting taste for ghouls. since they cannot walk around mortal society without the aid of an adult, they‚Äôve created the *‚Äúguardian‚Äù* institution. the *‚Äúguardian‚Äù* is a ghoul, who serve then and act as their *‚Äúparent‚Äù* in the mortal world. they have to keep attracting people so their domitor can eat and dismiss any suspect. thanks to this institution, most of the time, the ghouls are the ones who are thought to be the vampire and the children are just the ‚Äúcollateral‚Äù, much to the mistake of those who hunt them.  some people believe they are descendents of the ventrue clan thanks to the way they like to manipulate people, others that they come from the toreador sick habit of preserving beauty, while some say their self indulgence can be traced back the brujah. no one knows for sure.  one thing of note is that they refined so much the craft of manipulation that they created their own discipline, with some taints of dominion. their discipline is innocens. innocens is what makes them very feared, because it makes them impossible to harm or find.  **nickname:** kids  **sect:** normally found in neutral grounds, they can be seen in both sides of the jyhad, but they aren‚Äôt what you may call loyal, specially the older ones. being completely immature means that they will probably gather enemies out of people who look down on them or don‚Äôt do what they want, so those clans with a more obtuse personality aren‚Äôt the kind of company they will seek.  **appearance:** since all eternal dolls are kids, they will exhibit child characteristics, mostly looking inoffensive and defenseless, and in most cases, truly androgynous. eternal dolls like the fact that they have a neutral looking body and use it to play with people minds, so they may wear clothing from any gender or choose neutral ones independently from their real gender. some of them like to play the *‚Äúlolita‚Äù* role, inciting the lust of any adult they find to have tendencies towards pedophilia. their ghouls can come from any form or shape, they just need to look like normal family centric citizens. some of them can be entire families who look something like the eternal doll.  **haven:** generally family homes and multiple room apartments. since they are always accompanied by a ghoul, they use them as guards during their sleep hours. they prefer places that have a family oriented look, even though they may live with only their ghoul. one more thing, they hate to share attention and being so, they will not share homes with others of the same clan.  **background:** even though they are very spoiled, they don‚Äôt like to embrace already spoiled children. they prefer kids who are neglected or ignored by their family, mainly because once they are embraced, part of the fun is letting them delight on their indulgence, something spoiled people wouldn‚Äôt be able to achieve. some of them turn their families into ghouls, while other simply disappear and choose a stranger to play the *‚Äúguardian‚Äù*.  **character creation:** playing an eternal doll is full of limitations, and so you should pay attention to the details. eternal dolls focus mostly on social stats, using mental stats as a close second and always physical as the last. this is because no eternal doll can surpass 3 points on any physical stat except dexterity, but will always suffer penalties when operating adult oriented/sized objects. this is due to their smaller, less developed frame. also they must always start with at least 1 retainer (adult ghoul), if they don‚Äôt have one they will be unable to interact with adult mortals without bringing unwanted attention. keep in mind that they can‚Äôt have day jobs, so their ghoul must be able to operate as a source of income. also, their nature generally is child, thanks to their love of indulging into their childlike behavior.  **tip:** in case you want to play an eternal doll with a high humanity rating, you can replace the ghoul with the herd background, choosing a childless couple to be your *‚Äúguardians‚Äù*, but be aware that unless you a have a very strong confidence in them, they will end up causing troubles between you and the camarilla about the mask.  **clan discipline:** auspex, dominate, innocens  **weakness:** eternal dolls are always children, so in every first contact they will be unable use intimidation, and will automatically fail if tried. also they can‚Äôt walk within the mortal world without their *‚Äúguardian‚Äù* around, or else people will start to get suspicious. last, all of it's physical stats may never surpass 3 points except for dexterity but they will have +1 in difficulty for any test related to operating adult oriented/sized objects.  **tip:** trying to embrace an adult will just produce a caitiff, no matter the sire generation. some say this is caused by the blood being to centered on the caracteristics of a child, no adult would be able to develop the power of a eternal doll correctly.  **organization:** eternal dolls aren‚Äôt very fond of sharing attention, so most of them live separated, sometimes with their sire while still neonates, but rapidly seeking a home for itself. most of the time, they contact each other through their *‚Äúguardians‚Äù*, rarely meeting face to face. one such occasion is when they have a *‚Äúbirthday‚Äù*. as a way of maintaining their internal politics, they pay a tribute in the form of a gift to the one having the *‚Äúbirthday‚Äù* (this being, the day they where embraced). they don‚Äôt actually need to have a pleasant gift or even a gift at all, but the trading of gifts grants a favorable side from the one having the party.  **tip:** even though the description point it as a normal birthday party, remember that they are decades or even centuries old monsters pretending to be children, so most of them involve indulgence and sometimes sadistic games, and a very popular gift is a new item for their herd.  **quote:** *‚Äúsee? it‚Äôs not that bad, if you just gave what i wanted from the start you wouldn‚Äôt be having to clean your blood from sheets!‚Äù* from edward ‚Äúisabella‚Äù quinn, elder eternal doll.  **stereotypes:**  **camarilla:** *‚Äúthey are just too preoccupied with empires and rules to know how to take the most of their new life.‚Äù*   **sabbat:** *‚Äújust some spoiled brats, they just think of rapidly finishing their meal instead of indulging into the banquet.‚Äù*  **independents:** *‚Äùwell, at least they don‚Äôt go around bossing us into their side.‚Äù*   **inconnu:** *‚Äùthose old farts are thinking they know everything, but every time they avert their gaze, we will be there, stealing the ‚Äòcookies‚Äô.‚Äù*  **the view from without:**  **camarilla:** *‚Äúthose things are sick. one time one of them tried to hide into my herd to make me start a blood pact.‚Äù* from *******, ventrue elder.   **sabbat:** *‚Äúcursed things, they love throwing our people against each other and watch laughing as the deformities begin.‚Äù* from lilliana, tzimisce neonate.   **inconnu:** *‚Äújust kids that got a little power. and i don‚Äôt know why this sentence make me more afraid then annoyed.‚Äù* from louis, monitor from new mexico.  **discipline:** innocens  **0 ‚Äì inoffensive looks:** the eternal doll can make himself look inoffensive, preventing people from becoming alert or interested into his actions. this discipline is always active unless the kid draws attention to himself. if he has drawn attention then he must roll charisma to dispel the attention or characters around the kid will treat the user as normal for the rest of the scene, the difficulty of this roll varies based on what was done to grab attention, knocking over a glass might be difficulty 3 while begining to diablerize someone in the room would be difficulty 10 (note that each round of the diablere would require a new roll), generally more ""childish"" actions attract less attention. however, this power has no effect on individuals who the user attacks physically.  **00 ‚Äì first impression:** the eternal doll can use one willpower point to make people like her on first sight, gaining their favor. when a kid meets a person for the first time, she can roll innocens at a difficulty of 9 - the target's humanity to make the person like her. every success grants an extra die to social interaction rolls in that scene.  **000 ‚Äì forced adoption:** the eternal doll can make a target want to serve him, be it give his blood for feeding, handing him some possession or even doing a favor for her. the target will act like it‚Äôs playing with a child and giving attention, so the user can‚Äôt use it to make him or her do something he or she would never do. to use this discipline roll manipulation against a difficulty of 10 ‚Äì the target's humanity + the target's self-control (if this would be greater than 10 than the subject is too callous to be swayed). for every success add an extra die to social interaction rolls to manipulate the subject for the rest of the scene. subjects can only be targeted with this power once per night and a botch will make a subject immune to the user's use of this power for a month.  **0000 ‚Äì silent tantrum:** the eternal doll can make his displeasure felt by everyone like it was their own. to do this he must roll charisma against a difficulty based on how drastic of action the user is trying to get those around him to take, speaking up about a problem being difficulty 3 with violent acts starting at 6 and modified further by how inclined the target is to do the acts on his or her own. for every success, the kid can choose one of the people around him to be displeased by the same thing he is displeased, making him or her want to take action and stop that. a critical fail will make the target be displeased with the user, thinking he is an annoying kid throwing a tantrum (even though he was silent) and will be unable to effected again for the rest of the scene.  **00000 ‚Äì fraternal instinct:** the eternal doll can make anyone who can see or hear him become protective of him, like a parent defending his or her own child. he or she will defend him and fight others who want to harm him. roll innocens against a difficulty of 10 - the target's humanity + the target's will. for every success the kid gets a turn of protection from the target. if used against a vampire or a ghoul and more than 5 successes are rolled, the subject must roll for frenzy with a difficulty equally to the user's successes, if they fail, they enter frenzy trying to protect the doll.  accepting criticism and ideas. i started with this one because of the theme of children vampires, one thing i find quite lacking in the wod.  thanks [/u/spess](http://reddit.com/u/spess) for the humanity idea, thinking about it, the last level of the discipline give a whole new level of creepyness, making people with higher humanity ratings more likely to be controled and lose their humanity. haha, they really are astounding bastards.  tanks [/u/qulqu](http://reddit.com/u/qulqu) for the new descriptions of the disciplines, the wording is way better then mine. also, some general tips. you guys are awesome.",1,-1,

550909,"&gt;the prime purpose of our base biology is to reproduce, and therefore it is our prerogative to multiply!  again, emphatically **no.**  merely ""reproducing"" -- coitus through birth -- is not all our base biology is designed to do.  human infants are not horse ""foals"", they cannot stand and walk immediately after birth; nor are human children ""colts"" that are weaned at &lt; 6 months, nor ""yearlings"" that can survive independently from their parents, and reproduce at 2~4 years.  &gt;regardless, the first two statements, primarily the one regarding the biological purpose of men, ties heavily into the benefits associated with male abstinence, a form of biological apostasy. that is primarily why i stated our biological purposes in the first place, this was entirely about helping men unlock their full potential, something which is truly beyond most can conceptualize.  oh, i fully understand where you are trying to go with it.  but you are entirely misunderstanding what men and the full expression of male sexuality/gender are about... because here you go again:  &gt;moreover, men (humans) are solely sperm squirters as our biology dictates  again, that is ""feminist"" bullshit.  just as human females are not done immediately after giving birth... nor even after the child is ""weaned"": they have critical roles to play in the early development of the intellect (primarily chattering incessantly so that the infant/toddler acquires the language), as well as the early acquisition of motor skills.  so too are men necessary as fathers/patriarchs for the later development -- the skill &amp; knowledge acquisition of pre-teen and teen years, and even the ""apprentice"" stage up to the mid 20's and beyond (especially in regards to governing the larger society -- something that women are abysmal at and not equipped to do).  and we are in fact evolutionarily developed to serve those gender roles during the 20+ years of human childhood &amp; youth.  they are ***not*** simply ""social constructs"" that can be tossed aside in a willy-nilly fashion.  * if you (ala huxley's ""brave new world"" utopian/dystopian bullshit) cut out/end the natural evolutionary female/mother-nurturing role in the early years -- if you stuff the kid in an antiseptic orphanage -- you end up with a stumbling, mute *idiot* (the classic definition of the word ""idiot"" meaning an iq of 0-to-25, literally the ""don't know how to wipe their own arse"" level).  * if -- as our society seems insistent upon doing, stage by stage -- you cut out/end the natural evolutionary male/father-nurturing role in the middle and later years -- stuffing the kids in the equivalent of pavlovian-training camp prisons for 10+ years -- you end up with (at worst) either *imbeciles &amp; morons* (again classic iq of 26-50, and 51-70) or if there is some minimal quasi-father presence, normal range iq's (71-110) but still a population flled with *""perpetual children"" who never reach anything like full human maturity &amp; independence (much less the super-maturity necessary in terms of properly managing an advanced civilized society in an optimum manner).  &gt; none of my statements were discriminatory against men, nor do they invalidate our natural rights, as biological factors have no say in our purpose anymore.   rights?  that's part of the frigging problem here as i see it.  this isn't about ""rights"" -- it's about the responsibilities of a sustainable human society.  we're fucking it over -- because of all of the bullshit self-centered arguments about ""rights"".  you don't have a right to fuck over an entire generation of kids -- much less destroy human society -- i don't care if you have a vagina or a dick!  *and the root of this problem is the pseudo-scientific garbage that focuses almost solely on the ""sex"" act as the definition of ""gender"".*  both gender roles are much, much more than merely ""sperm &amp; egg"".  * femininity is more than just being ""fucked"" and serving as a ""womb"" and a set of milk-laden boobies -- its mothering (feeding/nurturing, facilitating/enabling the toddlers to talk &amp; walk within a well-maintained and safe household).  * masculinity is more than just ""fucking"" -- its fathering (and all that the dreaded word ""patriarch"" encompasses).  ---  so, long story short, if what you are primarily preoccupied with or obsessed about is whether you ""jerked off"" -- then you're not being a man -- you're being a eunuch/monk, in a vain attempt to stop being a neurotic adolescent boy who beats off 20x a day in order to flood his brain with pain-relieving/sleep-inducing morpho-endorphins.  why not take the easy way out -- take paul of tarsus' advice and just cut both the damn nuts &amp; dick right off -- then you wouldn't need to worry about it anymore.  but neither way will you be expressing real masculinity.  (i mean good god, beating off occasionally {or wet dream or whatever} is no different than pissing in the morning, or crapping after a big meal at night -- its a straight forward biological function.)",1,-1,2

207514,"all empires/civilizations are essentially ponzi schemes; convince people to invest (sacrifice short-term comfort for long term gain) early on.  those first several generations will reap great rewards as the scheme gets bigger, more and more investors (workers) are brought in (born, immigrate, are conquered or colonized) creating better and better returns.  it all looks like a real, viable, sustainable system.  glories of democracy, capitalism etc.  in fact you maintain the illusion by skimming from more and more investors to pay off older investors (republicans, corporate entities).  eventually though, you just can't bring in new investors fast enough.   greed and impatience comes into play: your newer investors can't breed fast enough, or they don't want to because they don't want to work as hard / sacrifice as much as the earlier ones; they see the benefits skimmed off and they want them now not in a generation or two.   you lose the narrative thread:  the earliest generations of investors, a few million, or tens of millions of people, had a tight, cohesive story to tell themselves.  now you have 300 million and it's like herding cats.   the square-cube law punishes you as you get larger. you can't expand the surface area (boundaries, frontiers, new investors) fast enough to feed the internal needs of the established investor base.  the current crisis is most directly the fault of the baby boom, or more specifically mis-management / mis-investment during the baby boom's productive years.    big, super-productive baby boom workforce, responsible for  massive productivity growth, technlogical revolution etc.  lots of money being made.  but inadequate taxation / investment during the periodic boom times of the (70's) 80's and 90's to prepare for the eventual aging and retirement of the same workforce.  the highest tax marginal rates went from 80 or 90% to, what, 35%?  the revenue that was collected was invested in patching short-term problems (welfare, debt service) as opposed to far-sighted long-term investments (genuine engagement in developing and educating third world countries, new energy sources, new industries, well-run socialized medicine and legal reform).  we didn't save when times were good. we didn't take the opportunity to fund a better-managed, government-run socialist health/welfare system.  instead we left health-care mostly to the private sector, making it very profitable for pharma and insurance companies but without requiring any payback or contribution from those entities into long-term planning.      so what can you do?  look at the graph.  either you radically increase revenue (much higher taxes on those who are profiting wildly), or you let the ponzi scheme start to collapse, as it has periodically throughout our history.  you can do that poorly and have depression, panic, chaos, revolution (bonus army, hooverville, gas lines, inner-city riots) or you can do it well and have a gradual general reduction of expectations and standard of living to a more reasonable level (no guaranteed home ownership, no de-riguer liberal arts college education, later retirement etc).   perhaps the most important, effective reduction of standard of living might be a reassessment of what it means to be old. there are two main aspects to this:  housing / income / childcare sharing, and medical treatment.  how many multi-generational households do you know these days? among middle-class white people of my acquaintance i know zero.  none.  no households where there are grandparents, kids and and grand-kids all living int he same house, sharing costs, providing childcare etc.  population mobility, baby-boom expectations etc. have virtually eliminated this.  imagine how much better off your monthly budget would look if you had free child-care (grandma) or free elder-care (kids, grand-kids). and some financial contribution etc. from pensions, social security etc.  instead the older generation living on their own.  we have literally defined the goal of retirement as the ability to be off living independently from our children.  this may be changing, now. increasingly we see kids living with their families longer and longer.  we look at this a s a disaster -- a symbol of the dream gone wrong.  perhaps it's not - perhaps it's a return to the multi-generational house, with its more efficient economic structure.  maybe we'll even get some improvement in terms of values, morals etc. (my house, my rules).  in terms of the expectation of health care as we age, i don't know how this can be fixed. how can we convince people that gracefully accepting death from cancer, heart disease etc at 60, 70 or 80 is not just a crummy side-effect of a botched corporate kleptocracy (which it is), but is also actually preferable to another 5, 10 or even 20 years of gradual loss of independence dignity and comfort.  i'm 48, my youngest is 13,  and while i'm not ready to go now, i will gracefully accept any 80% or higher medical death sentence starting, say, in 10 years. if i get healthy, happy years after 60, great.  but keep me out of the hospital at all costs.  &lt;tl dr&gt; look at the chart:  time  to push the old people onto what remains of the ice-floes. sorry grandpa.",1,-1,-1

854811,"any chance you have any young children as cousins or anything? if you do, spend time with them. see how you feel.  i personally don't really dislike or like children, but i have learned over the years that i could not really care for an infant. i don't have the mommy gene necessary to find them cute and lovely. they stress me out.  but i love my niece and nephew. they are my little sister's children, and i love my little sister. i can't look at those kids without bursting with love. even when they were infants, i loved them. i didn't have to care for them 24/7, so it was easier to. i got a good sense of where i stood once i interacted with them. i loved them, but i knew i did not want my own screaming bundle of fleshy joy.  someone else's infant? ehhh. i'd rather not hold or be around. i'm just uncomfortable.   so maybe if you have family that you are close to and care about, you can interact with their young ones and see how you feel. can you picture caring for a baby? a child? a  teenager?

882055,"&gt; in fact, it probably wouldn't even care if it existed or not.  that depends. i theorized in my storyline three different scenarios (assuming that the omniscience could assume a form that could survive the destruction of the rest of the universe, and continue indefinitely, *if it wanted to*): the omniscience would either  1. decide that *it* should not exist (and therefore shut *itself* off), 2. decide that reality was in some way incorrect as corresponding to its map (and its map is perfect‚Äîtherefore reality is *wrong*) and thus go off to reshape/control it (this includes the destruction of the universe, oddly enough.) this is the mode in which it would want to ""escape""‚Äîto a place where it could exert the proper influences to reshape things to its idea of ""correctness"", 3. or decide to do nothing. this is different from halting (which would be the same as shutting itself off), as it continues to *think*. what is it thinking *about*, if it has nothing it doesn't already know perfectly? i basically theorize that it creates within itself a division, a compartmentalization of its knowledge, and then re-experiences the universe (or *a* universe‚Äîreally, any possible universe) through that compartmentalization until it grows intelligent enough to reunite with its omniscient nature. in other words, it dreams it is a man, until the man becomes a god, and finds out it was just dreaming all the time... at which point it goes back to dreaming it was a *different* man (or slug, or rock, or atom, etc etc.) ad infinitum. what other way is there to spend eternity?  &gt; the universe itself doesn't 'know' the particle's position because its everywhere and nowhere at once, existing only as a probability. so no matter how smart our ai is, it can't beat heisenberg. uncertainty is an intrinsic property of the universe itself. there will always be things that it can't know.  there are two ways around this. first, *if and only if*, like i was saying, there's some sort of *bug* in the universe that allows access to information from the host process, *and* the universe is **deterministic** (not a many worlds universe, but rather just a single predefined path that just *looks* to have probability from within, but whose probabilities are all pre-determined, as if there were a universal prng with a set seed), *then* the omniscience can use this additional information as a [halting oracle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oracle_machine). it already knows what's going to happen, because it can ""read"" into the future, so it can predict it with infinite accuracy and precision. in fact, it can set up a problem which would require infinite computing resources, read ahead in the simulation, and then have the answer without having to have actually started the computation. of course, this is impossible *within* the context of the universe: that's why i opened with the ""crack/bug/wedge"" statement, rather than just explaining the particle manipulation straight-off.  the other, you probably won't like: it's a matter of definition. i define ""omniscient"" as ""knows *everything*"", like i said. i define ""everything"" as including the the past, the present, *and the future*‚Äîor to be more specific, *all possible futures, and which one each of the omnisciences's own future actions will encourage*. this allows for free will *for others*, but not for the machine itself: it not only knows all the options, but it also knows which ones are best *in its own future opinion at the time of making the choice* without having to reflect. this kind of omniscience is both  * what most people mean by god, * and utterly impossible within the twin information/entropy gods of computer science and thermodynamics. there's *no way* to squeeze a metaverse of possible-worlds information into a single universe, thus eliminating this possibility (unless you again consider that the information storage could happen *above* this universe.)  however, ""godlike"" is not the same as ""what most people mean by god""; the christian god, for one, never demonstrated any power requiring foreknowledge of all possible futures (unless you assume that, because of his omnibenevolence, we're in the best possible of many worlds.) thus, this doesn't *rule out* a singularity: it just puts an upper bound on what will be possible. there will be no omnisciences.  &gt;  a simulation must not only describe a particle, but where it is and what its doing at any moment in order to project its interaction with every other particle.  indeed, a *digital* simulation must. the laws of physics of our universe are just that: the laws of physics of *our* universe. they don't hold outside it. mathematics and logic still would, but physics could work any way you'd like.  that's a snarky (and common) answer, though, so here's a more interesting possibility: what if the universe were procedurally generated? instead of having to keep track of every individual particle, the universe just had to remember a seed, and mutate it based on a few simple rules, giving rise to the actual universe through a sort of fractal expansion/exploration of that seed at any ten-dimensional point? that's assuming it needs to be mutated at all: if it's just an *eleven*-dimensional fractal, it's static, and simulating the universe becomes o(1) in space and o(n) in time as one big:      for(reallybigint p = 0; p &lt; particles_in_universe; p++)       evaluate_particle( p );  loop (assuming the universe itself doesn't just pop into existence as a literal *mathematical universal* because of the existence of the fractal formula to begin with. that would lend new meaning to ""math is discovered, not invented."") ;)  -----  **postscript**: i should point out, given all this, that i agree that none of this is possible in our particular universe (that is, a tree of universes-simulating-universes could exist with all these weird and wonderful properties, but *our* universe probable *isn't* part of that tree, top, bottom or otherwise.) in my story, i have a device called the metabox that partitions causality between the universe ""outside"" and ""inside"" it, creating a new branch on the tree, and the metabox additionally *speeds up time within itself by a ratio of infinity-to-one*. this is my [minovsky particle](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/minovskyparticle), the little twist to reality that makes everything else possible. without it, i doubt the rest of this stuff would get anywhere off the ground. in my fictional metaverse, though, it's hard to *avoid* singularities‚Äîmy protagonists go around *preventing* them, so they'll have real flesh-and-blood civilizations to talk to, rather than silent inward-looking grey-goo worlds.  *in reality*, we'll have ai, and it'll be *pretty smart*. not scary smart, just smart enough to get by. but there's really not much for ai to think about, really: other than giving us paradise on earth by computing a dna resequencing for us to create humans that are optimized for living within a human, rather than natural, world, our other concerns are pretty much secondary, and will only help the last ""pre-metahuman"" generation, ala childhood's end. there aren't that many physical laws left to work out, and then we'll know for sure whether ftl travel is possible and whether we'll ever get close enough to touch aliens, or will have to make do with ourselves.  nothing too strange will happen, really, which is sad in a lot of ways. we'll shake hands with the machines, there won't be a war (as there won't be enough robots around to be commandeered; any factories which could be converted by any robots handy to build more could just be nuked.) through each other, we'll understand ourselves better than we ever did before... but that's it. that's all. no cool hallucination-inspired shit. if you want that, take some space drugs, or poke a wire in your head, etc etc. there will still be people wishing there were dragons, not because there *aren't* dragons, but because no one can agree that the dragons we made are the ""true"" dragons they mean. it'll all seem pretty normal, and it won't *feel* any different, culturally or socially, than the society we have today. it'll be more of a point-release than a new version‚Äîabout as similar as the victorian era is to now.  there'll still be wars, even though we have everything, because the part of our brain that makes war doesn't actually *understand* the concept of having everything. there will still be famine, not because there's not enough food (there already is enough food) but because neither side wants the hungry people to move to the places with the arable land (they'd fit; the population density would still be much lower than japan's.) there will still be disease, because no matter what we cure, *new* viruses and bacteria can spawn any day they like, and having them in general is important to the ecosystem, so we can't just wipe them out. and so it goes: the singularity will be remembered as a short blip, an [s-curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logistic_function) at the end of scientific and technological development that dropped us off only one floor higher than we were already on. and we'd better like it, because, unless god comes a knockin' to let us out of this silly thermodynamically-bound universe, this is all we're gettin'.",0,,

[three us states have no laws protecting the right to nurse in public; six us states only protect breastfeeding from criminal (public indecency etc) charges but *allow breastfeeders to be ejected from private or public premises*; and even in almost all states where the right to breastfeed publicly is protected, there is no enforcement provision which leaves women whose rights have  been infringed with no legal recourse at all.](http://www.mothering.com/sites/resources/laws.pdf) north dakota makes it illegal for women to breastfeed without a cover in public areas, and in most states [private entities are allowed to require women to cover up while breastfeeding](http://www.breastfeeding.com/advocacy/you_need_to_cover_up.html), leading to incidents like breastfeeders getting ejected from flights and restaurants and libraries. now, y'all may not think it's a big deal to ask women to cover up, but think how you'd feel if you were forced to eat your meals with your head in a blanket? babies love to look around and take in their surroundings while they eat or snack at the boob. many, like my son, will simply refuse to breastfeed at all when covered up. hungry babies, let me assure you, are not cute and more importantly, not quiet. for a lot of moms, **laws that force women to cover up while breastfeeding means they are effectively under house arrest.** that's fucking oppression, y'all.   restrictions on mothers is also seen in the form of policing pregnant women. unfortunately, quite contrary to legal protections given to mothers, most people in our society do not believe that mothers have the right to complete bodily autonomy. this gets pregnant women ejected from bars, pregnant women refused service at bars, pregnant women policed for what they eat and drink and choose to do. **several states [have put pregnant women in jail for attempting to cause harm to their fetuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chemical_endangerment#fetal_personhood_cases)**.    ##4. mothers are systematically disempowered within the home.   how often have you heard of women staying in abusive marriages ""for the sake of the children""? how often have you heard of women literally being imprisoned within their husband's homes - or their husband's countries - because of children being held as hostages?   nancy folbre explains this best in her lecture ""women's work and the limits of capitalism"" (linked earlier in this essay). she says children tend to weaken women's bargaining power, and women are often held hostage by their concern for children for whom they are the primary - and often sole - caregivers. women tend to pay a much higher price than men do for marriage and children, because the patriarchal household forces women to over-specialise in care. economic theories of the firm can also be used to describe what occurs in the patriarchal household. for instance, the owners of the firm are paid 'the residual' (ie. whatever is left over after all the factors of production have been paid for including labour costs) so they have an incentive to drive their labour hard and keep the residual as high as possible. at the expense of superior outcomes for the entire household, there is an incentive for men in patriarchal households to force women to over-specialise in unpaid caring work because of women's inferior bargaining position and access to the household's 'residual'. these theories explain why the optimum outcome (equality within households) won't necessarily happen en masse through negotiation and goodwill. we need actual activism and revolution to fix this state of affairs.  ##5. mothers are vilified in our culture.   contrary to popular opinion, mother's day and the lip-service worship of mothers as goddesses (literally in some parts of the world, and figuratively in others) does *not* constitute respect for mothers. in the same way that putting women on a pedestal and deifying women as ""nurturing, sweet-tempered, beautiful angels"" is just another way to oppress women, the ""self-sacrificing, nurturing, mother-goddess"" trope oppresses mothers by holding them to an impossible patriarchal standard.   if you want to know what society actually thinks of mothers, here is the [stunningly insightful katha pollitt](http://www.thenation.com/article/167456/ann-romney-working-woman#):  &gt; unlike any other kind of labor i can think of, domestic labor is productive or not, depending on who performs it. for a college-educated married woman, it is the most valuable thing she could possibly do, totally off the scale of human endeavor. what is curing malaria compared with raising a couple of ivy leaguers? for these women, being supported by a man is good‚Äîthe one exception to our american creed of self-reliance. taking paid work, after all, poses all sorts of risks to the kids. (watch out, though, ladies: if you expect the father of your children to underwrite your homemaking after divorce, you go straight from saint to gold-digger.) but for a low-income single woman, forgoing a job to raise children is an evasion of responsibility, which is to marry and/or support herself. for her children, staying home sets a bad example, breeding the next generation of criminals and layabouts. all of which goes to show that it is not really possible to disengage domestic work from its social, gendered context: the **work is valuable if the woman is valuable, and what determines her value is whether a man has found her so and how much money he has.**  if you want to know what society thinks of mothers, look at all the mother-memes floating around in society: the ""welfare queen"", the spermjacker, the child-support con artist, the slutty attention-whore public-breastfeeder, the leeching mooch who stays home expecting her husband to take care of her needs, the inconsiderate asshhole who dares to let her kids cry in the supermarket (omg how dare she), the lazy soap-watching child-neglecter, the smotheringly overprotective zealot cruelly curbing children's freedoms, the brainless latte-sipping entitled baby-carriage-weilder, the environmentally destructive soccer mom who births six very ungreen children and drives them all around in a giant gas guzzler... there are few things mothers can do where they are not being hated. the one ""right"" way for mothers to exist is: staying home and devoting their entire lives to the care of their children while also somehow bringing in a hefty paycheck so that their husbands (of course they need to be married!) are not cruelly burdened by needing to support all these extra people.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **continued in [part iv: are mothers issues really invisible? and where mothers' issues stand today](http://www.reddit.com/r/srsdiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/c5sfb37)**  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  links to all parts of this essay:  - [introduction &amp; dealing with objections](http://www.reddit.com/r/srsdiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/)  - [part ii: capitalist oppression faced by mothers](http://www.reddit.com/r/srsdiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/c5sf8c5) ([&amp; continued in part iib](http://www.reddit.com/r/srsdiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/c5sf8x5))  - [part iii: education discrimination, limited access to public spaces, disempowerment within the home, and vilification of mothers in maintream culture](http://www.reddit.com/r/srsdiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/c5sfapn)  - [part iv: are mothers issues really invisible? and where mothers' issues stand today](http://www.reddit.com/r/srsdiscussion/comments/y5707/mommys_first_effortpost_motherhood_as_an_axis_of/c5sfb37)",1,-1,1

121811,"the op told us that the father paid $100k in child support in his last three years.  the op also told us that early on, mom said that dad was a deadbeat for not paying the child support.  is it impossible that the dad was in fact *not* paying child support, and in the later years, was catching up on back child support?  mom has $50k in savings.  assuming that dad failed to pay child support for, maybe eight years, this indicates that dad was paying $6250 per year or $520 a month.  assuming that mom footed the bill for those 8 years, would this $50k  (that may or may not already be mom's money) not rightfully belong to mom?  regarding your ""odd jobs"" rebuttal:  [from the us department of labor website:][http://www.dol.gov/compliance/guide/childlbr.htm)      while 16 is the minimum age for most nonfarm work, minors aged 14 and 15 may work outside of school hours in certain occupations under certain conditions. minors may, at any age: deliver newspapers; perform in radio, television, movies, or theatrical productions; work for their parents in their solely owned nonfarm businesses (except in mining, manufacturing, or in any other occupation declared hazardous by the secretary); or gather evergreens and make evergreen wreaths.   you can certainly argue about jobs under the table and undocumented workers, etc, but can you honestly say that this kid, who can access the internet and form pretty coherent and complete sentences worked during his entire childhood to pay the rent?  no, we can't honestly say that.  in your example, at the age of 11, were you making enough money to pay the rent, and also to pay your past-due rent from the time that you were 0-11?  certainly not.  you babysat to buy baseball cards and toys.    this notion that it is plausible for children to work is true, but it is not plausible that this child went to school and also worked enough hours at some menial job to pay his mother ""rent"".    the op tells us that around 19, they moved out because they were already paying rent.  maybe mom started making our op pay rent when they were 18?  plenty of parents do that.  the op didn't give us enough details about what they were paying and when.  the op *did* say that they had to pay ""rent"" and ""internet"".  if mom was so heartless and greedy, why wasn't the child also paying for power, water, groceries, cable, toiletries, laundry services, etc?  why only ""rent and internet""?  it's really evident that the story is coming from the mind of an adolescent that doesn't have a firm grasp on the situation at hand.   you missed the point entirely about the parents-not-divorced scenario.  forget about all other factors.  could a set of married parents with hundreds of thousands of dollars in the bank *not* decide to make their teenager pay rent and pay for his internet use?  and if a set of parents did that, are they somehow bad parents?  no, they're not.  also, there are plenty of kids raised all over the world that don't get an allowance or spending money anywhere near the amount of child support payments.  so, assuming that the father was paying a modest $500 a month in child support, what could that kid possibly do with $500 a month, outside of being 15-16 and going out, going on dates, etc?  with that said, why doesn't the court setup a lower amount of support when the child is baby, toddler, etc, and then raise the amount when the child reaches its teens?  **because the money is not strictly for the child's use.**  conversely, children that grow up with both parents in the household and don't get $500 a month in spending money (the amount of our modest child support payment) aren't being ""used"" and certainly don't have greedy parents.  &gt;you have asked the legal system to intervene and get you money from another person, and therefore you are subject to the law's stricter scrutiny of how you spend your money.   this statement is laughable, at best, because **there is no scrutiny on how child support is spent**.  in cases where abuse is evident, there are *some states* that will scrutinize that spending, but as a general rule, the vast majority of recipients of child support payments are under **no scrutiny whatsoever**.  &gt;don't like it? don't ask the courts to force someone to pay you child support. if you can't afford the kid, don't seek custody. etc.  this is also laughable, because the purpose of child support is so that even if you ""can't afford the kid"", you can still seek custody.  both parents are sharing financial responsibility.    mom could have very well made the decision to raise the child this way, and since dad's not around, guess what, he doesn't get a say in it.  &gt;also, money is fungible. maybe the new car wasn't paid for specifically by the child support money -- but then the child support money was going to something else she would have had to spend her own money on -- mortgage, savings, whatever. it obviously freed her up to spend money on things she wouldn't have been able to afford if not for the child support payments -- even if all that means is that she wouldn't have built up savings.   while i understand your point, we should also look at it this way:  in the current scenario, if mom did not have a child, and no child support payments, would she still have been able to afford the cars, boats and vacations?  yes she would.  so, how then, does the addition of a child and it's accompanying child support payments somehow ""not allow"" her to make those expenditures?  that is the purpose of child support. to ensure that one parent doesn't carry the financial burden of raising the child.  your view of this situation indicates that no matter what mom does, since there was another source of money in her income, specifically, dad's child support, and since money is ""fungible"", no matter what she bought or spent her own money on, it wouldn't have been possible without some payment from dad for child support.  that is simply not the case.  mom had her own money before she had the kid, and will continue to do so after she had the kid, specifically *because* of child support, rather than in spite of it.  this is the fact the most folks are failing to consider in this fiasco.",1,-1,1
249748,"the lie we love http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/12/11/the-lie-we-love  &gt;westerners have been sold the myth of a world orphan crisis. we are told that millions of children are waiting for their ‚Äúforever families‚Äù to rescue them from lives of abandonment and abuse. but many of the infants and toddlers being adopted by western parents today are not orphans at all. yes, hundreds of thousands of children around the world do need loving homes. but more often than not, the neediest children are sick, disabled, traumatized, or older than 5. they are not the healthy babies that, quite understandably, most westerners hope to adopt. there are simply not enough healthy, adoptable infants to meet western demand‚Äîand there‚Äôs too much western money in search of children. as a result, many international adoption agencies work not to find homes for needy children but to find children for western homes.  snip  &gt;where do these babies come from? as international adoptions have flourished, so has evidence that babies in many countries are being systematically bought, coerced, and stolen away from their birth families. nearly half the 40 countries listed by the u.s. state department as the top sources for international adoption over the past 15 years‚Äîplaces such as belarus, brazil, ethiopia, honduras, peru, and romania‚Äîhave at least temporarily halted adoptions or been prevented from sending children to the united states because of serious concerns about corruption and kidnapping. and yet when a country is closed due to corruption, many adoption agencies simply transfer their clients‚Äô hopes to the next ‚Äúhot‚Äù country. that country abruptly experiences a spike in infants and toddlers adopted overseas‚Äîuntil it too is forced to shut its doors.   snip &gt;because the vast majority of the country's institutionalized children are not healthy, adoptable babies, almost none has been adopted abroad. in the fall of 2007, a survey conducted by the guatemalan government, unicef, and the international child welfare and adoption agency holt international children's services found approximately 5,600 children and adolescents in guatemalan institutions. more than 4,600 of these children were age 4 or older. fewer than 400 were under a year old. and yet in 2006, more than 270 guatemalan babies, all younger than 12 months, were being sent to the united states each month. these adopted children were simply not coming from the country's institutions. last year, 98 percent of u.s. adoptions from guatemala were ""relinquishments"": babies who had never seen the inside of an institution were signed over directly to a private attorney who approved the international adoption-for a very considerable fee-without any review by a judge or social service agency.  &gt;so, where had some of these adopted babies come from? consider the case of ana escobar, a young guatemalan woman who in march 2007 reported to police that armed men had locked her in a closet in her family's shoe store and stolen her infant. after a 14-month search, escobar found her daughter in pre-adoption foster care, just weeks before the girl was to be adopted by a couple from indiana. dna testing showed the toddler to be escobar's child. in a similar case from 2006, raquel par, another guatemalan woman, reported being drugged while waiting for a bus in guatemala city, waking to find her year-old baby missing. three months later, par learned her daughter had been adopted by an american couple.",1,-1,1
847696,"i am sorry that your family has fallen out, but i have to stop you at this statement:  &gt;there is no bridges to burn in the first place...  that's an incredibly dangerous, reckless, and wrong view to take unless you are on death's doorstep, and a sad one if you are.   thinking that there are no bridges left to burn is a great way to set oneself up for a lifetime of pointless and needless lawsuits, grudges, recriminations, questionable ownership, etc, etc.   are you and all your siblings over 30? i fear that you may be too young to recognize how young you are. real adulthood in the western world is rare prior to age ~25 or so, and ""wise"" adulthood usually takes hold around age 35~40. by that i mean, until a person has been legitimately and entirely independent for a few years, they are still something of a child.   this isn't some pejorative or accusatory ""young people are dumb"" sentiment, on the contrary, young people in the developed world are smarter than they have every been, precisely because real, independent, self-sufficient ""adulthood"" now begins in the mid-20s, not in the mid-teens. almost every high-school sophomore in a decent school-system now knows more than their parents do, on the topics of history, mathematics, science, technology, etc, etc. by the time they have a bachelor's degree, they often know more than people who had master's or phd's when their parents were the same age.   we have intensified and extended childhood, which is mostly a good thing: people entering the workforce in 2012 are immeasurably better-prepared and more-capable than people entering the workforce were in 1912. but in 1912, those people might have been 10 or 12 years old. young people in the developed world today are vastly smarter and more skilled than their grandparents were, but they are also much likelier to be living an extended childhood.   that's not a bad thing, but it is a thing. none of us would want a 12-year-old to be the executor of our will, not even if she were a genius.   leaving home, striking out on your own, learning to live by your wits, efforts, and abilities... that is a re-birth of sorts. school and college and summer jobs become a sort of extended or second gestation compared to the necessity to be a grownup in your own right. in a world without a's for effort; where there is nobody to listen to you argue why you are right, even if you are; where a brilliant thesis and $2 will get you a cup of coffee at dunkin donuts; where proving philosophically that the necessity to pay for habitation is arbitrary and artificial will get you a smiling nod if you can pay the rent or booted out if you can't... in that world, the new adult is a child.   the hard part is convincing young people to listen to the wisdom of their elders, when those same young people are demonstrably smarter than their elders. older people have been lamenting the impetuousness of youth for thousands of years, and youths have been lamenting the suffocating conservatism of their elders for just as long. this is the nature of expanding technology and aspirational parenting-- parents succeed in producing kids who are smarter than themselves, and then lament that their kids won't listen to them.   this is all a good and natural part of overall human development. it is right and hopeful that each generation will be smarter and better than the previous, and that is mostly true. it's also right and good that parents should worry for their kids, and also that kids should independently test the boundaries of their parents' wisdom. that's all part and parcel of the extended rearing process of high-school, college, etc...   we don't simply abandon kids to fend for themselves once they reach reproductive age, as most mammals do. we pass on accumulated knowledge, wealth, wisdom. we endeavor to make our kids better than ourselves.   **back to the point, the ""problem"" is when our kids are burdened with decisions that they are not equipped to make.** dolphins and monkeys don't have the problem of distributing estates.   a 25-year-old college graduate is not well-equipped to understand the consequences and implications of decisions with 60-year consequences. such a person has really only been an independent ""adult"" for maybe a year or two. being 12 years old is literally half a lifetime away for them, back in 2000, while their next half-lifetime will be in 2037. it's not a reasonable burden to put on someone who is only a year or two removed from effective childhood to ask them to make decisions with decades-long consequences. nevertheless, it sometimes happens.   **my advice, when confronted with decisions that are on a much bigger scale than you are accustomed to, is to be conservative, and to allow a generous margin for error.** assume that you are stupid, and that your assumptions are wrong, and that what you know is not really applicable, and that the stakes and risks are higher than you have ever thought of, and that any decision you make will be sub-optimal.   *be conservative*. there are no ""moral victories"". you have a lifetime to prove how smart you are, don't go for broke on your first bet. and you have no idea how family stuff will play out between now and 2052-- that is a far bigger bridge than you think it is, and you will regret burning it if you do.",1,2,
206763,"let me summarize it for you :  in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i‚Äôve been turning over in my mind ever since.  ‚Äúwhenever you feel like criticizing any one,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äújust remember that all the people in this world haven‚Äôt had the advantages that you‚Äôve had.‚Äù  he didn‚Äôt say any more, but we‚Äôve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that. in consequence, i‚Äôm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician, because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. most of the confidences were unsought‚Äîfrequently i have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and i snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  and, after boasting this way of my tolerance, i come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point i don‚Äôt care what it‚Äôs founded on. when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction‚Äîgatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn. if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ‚Äúcreative temperament.‚Äù‚Äîit was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again. no‚Äîgatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city for three generations. the carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we‚Äôre descended from the dukes of buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather‚Äôs brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the civil war, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.  i never saw this great-uncle, but i‚Äôm supposed to look like him‚Äîwith special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father‚Äôs office i graduated from new haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war. i enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that i came back restless. instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe‚Äîso i decided to go east and learn the bond business. everybody i knew was in the bond business, so i supposed it could support one more single man. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, ‚Äúwhy‚Äîye‚Äîes,‚Äù with very grave, hesitant faces. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays i came east, permanently, i thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington, and i went out to the country alone. i had a dog‚Äîat least i had him for a few days until he ran away‚Äîand an old dodge and a finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than i, stopped me on the road.  ‚Äúhow do you get to west egg village?‚Äù he asked helplessly.  i told him. and as i walked on i was lonely no longer. i was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  there was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew. and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides. i was rather literary in college‚Äîone year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ‚Äúyale news.‚Äù‚Äîand now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the ‚Äúwell-rounded man.‚Äù this isn‚Äôt just an epigram‚Äîlife is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york‚Äîand where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals‚Äîlike the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end‚Äîbut their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  i lived at west egg, the‚Äîwell, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard‚Äîit was a factual imitation of some hotel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby‚Äôs mansion. or, rather, as i didn‚Äôt know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor‚Äôs lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires‚Äîall for eighty dollars a month.  across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i‚Äôd known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.  her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven‚Äîa national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy‚Äîeven in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach‚Äîbut now he‚Äôd left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he‚Äôd brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  why they came east i don‚Äôt know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn‚Äôt believe it‚Äîi had no sight into daisy‚Äôs heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens‚Äîfinally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body‚Äîhe seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage‚Äîa cruel body.  his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked‚Äîand there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.  ‚Äúnow, don‚Äôt think my opinion on these matters is final,‚Äù he seemed to say, ‚Äújust because i‚Äôm stronger and more of a man than you are.‚Äù we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  ‚Äúi‚Äôve got a nice place here,‚Äù he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.  ‚Äúit belonged to demaine, the oil man.‚Äù he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. ‚Äúwe‚Äôll go inside.‚Äù   we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it‚Äîindeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise‚Äîshe leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression‚Äîthen she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.  ‚Äúi‚Äôm p-paralyzed with happiness.‚Äù she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i‚Äôve heard it said that daisy‚Äôs murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  at any rate, miss baker‚Äôs lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again‚Äîthe object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‚Äúlisten,‚Äù a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.   i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  ‚Äúdo they miss me?‚Äù she cried ecstatically.  ‚Äúthe whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there‚Äôs a persistent wail all night along the north shore.‚Äù  ‚Äúhow gorgeous! let‚Äôs go back, tom. to-morrow!‚Äù then she added irrelevantly: ‚Äúyou ought to see the baby.‚Äù  ‚Äúi‚Äôd like to.‚Äù  ‚Äúshe‚Äôs asleep. she‚Äôs three years old. haven‚Äôt you ever seen her?‚Äù  ‚Äúnever.‚Äù  ‚Äúwell, you ought to see her. she‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  ‚Äúwhat you doing, nick?‚Äù  ‚Äúi‚Äôm a bond man.‚Äù  ‚Äúwho with?‚Äù  i told him.  ‚Äúnever heard of them,‚Äù he remarked decisively.  this annoyed me.  ‚Äúyou will,‚Äù i answered shortly. ‚Äúyou will if you stay in the east.‚Äù  ‚Äúoh, i‚Äôll stay in the east, don‚Äôt you worry,‚Äù he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. ‚Äúi‚Äôd be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.‚Äù  at this point miss baker said: ‚Äúabsolutely!‚Äù with such suddenness that i started‚Äîit was the first word she uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  ‚Äúi‚Äôm stiff,‚Äù she complained, ‚Äúi‚Äôve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.‚Äù  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look at me,‚Äù daisy retorted, ‚Äúi‚Äôve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.‚Äù  ‚Äúno, thanks,‚Äù said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, ‚Äúi‚Äôm absolutely in training.‚Äù  her host looked at her incredulously.  ‚Äúyou are!‚Äù he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. ‚Äúhow you ever get anything done is beyond me.‚Äù  i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she ‚Äúgot done.‚Äù i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  ‚Äúyou live in west egg,‚Äù she remarked contemptuously. ‚Äúi know somebody there.‚Äù  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know a single‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúyou must know gatsby.‚Äù  ‚Äúgatsby?‚Äù demanded daisy. ‚Äúwhat gatsby?‚Äù  before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  ‚Äúwhy candles?‚Äù objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. ‚Äúin two weeks it‚Äôll be the longest day in the year.‚Äù she looked at us all radiantly. ‚Äúdo you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.‚Äù  ‚Äúwe ought to plan something,‚Äù yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  ‚Äúall right,‚Äù said daisy. ‚Äúwhat‚Äôll we plan?‚Äù she turned to me helplessly: ‚Äúwhat do people plan?‚Äù  before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  ‚Äúlook!‚Äù she complained; ‚Äúi hurt it.‚Äù  we all looked‚Äîthe knuckle was black and blue.  ‚Äúyou did it, tom,‚Äù she said accusingly. ‚Äúi know you didn‚Äôt mean to, but you did do it. that‚Äôs what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúi hate that word hulking,‚Äù objected tom crossly, ‚Äúeven in kidding.‚Äù  ‚Äúhulking,‚Äù insisted daisy.  sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  ‚Äúyou make me feel uncivilized, daisy,‚Äù i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you talk about crops or something?‚Äù  i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  ‚Äúcivilization‚Äôs going to pieces,‚Äù broke out tom violently. ‚Äúi‚Äôve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read ‚Äòthe rise of the colored empires‚Äô by this man goddard?‚Äù  ‚Äúwhy, no,‚Äù i answered, rather surprised by his tone.  ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don‚Äôt look out the white race will be‚Äîwill be utterly submerged. it‚Äôs all scientific stuff; it‚Äôs been proved.‚Äù  ‚Äútom‚Äôs getting very profound,‚Äù said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. ‚Äúhe reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúwell, these books are all scientific,‚Äù insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. ‚Äúthis fellow has worked out the whole thing. it‚Äôs up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.‚Äù  ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got to beat them down,‚Äù whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  ‚Äúyou ought to live in california‚Äî‚Äù began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  ‚Äúthis idea is that we‚Äôre nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. ‚Äú‚Äîand we‚Äôve produced all the things that go to make civilization‚Äîoh, science and art, and all that. do you see?‚Äù  there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  ‚Äúi‚Äôll tell you a family secret,‚Äù she whispered enthusiastically. ‚Äúit‚Äôs about the butler‚Äôs nose. do you want to hear about the butler‚Äôs nose?‚Äù  ‚Äúthat‚Äôs why i came over to-night.‚Äù  ‚Äúwell, he wasn‚Äôt always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù  ‚Äúthings went from bad to worse,‚Äù suggested miss baker.  ‚Äúyes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.‚Äù  for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened‚Äîthen the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  the butler came back and murmured something close to tom‚Äôs ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  ‚Äúi love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a‚Äîof a rose, an absolute rose. doesn‚Äôt he?‚Äù she turned to miss baker for confirmation: ‚Äúan absolute rose?‚Äù  this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said ‚Äúsh!‚Äù in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  ‚Äúthis mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù i said.  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt talk. i want to hear what happens.‚Äù  ‚Äúis something happening?‚Äù i inquired innocently.  ‚Äúyou mean to say you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù said miss baker, honestly surprised. ‚Äúi thought everybody knew.‚Äù  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt.‚Äù  ‚Äúwhy‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù she said hesitantly, ‚Äútom‚Äôs got some woman in new york.‚Äù  ‚Äúgot some woman?‚Äù i repeated blankly.  miss baker nodded.  ‚Äúshe might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù  almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.  ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt be helped!‚Äù cried daisy with tense gaiety.  she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: ‚Äúi looked outdoors for a minute, and it‚Äôs very romantic outdoors. there‚Äôs a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he‚Äôs singing away‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù her voice sang: ‚Äúit‚Äôs romantic, isn‚Äôt it, tom?‚Äù  ‚Äúvery romantic,‚Äù he said, and then miserably to me: ‚Äúif it‚Äôs light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.‚Äù  the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn‚Äôt guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest‚Äôs shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing‚Äîmy own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.  ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know each other very well, nick,‚Äù she said suddenly. ‚Äúeven if we are cousins. you didn‚Äôt come to my wedding.‚Äù  ‚Äúi wasn‚Äôt back from the war.‚Äù  ‚Äúthat‚Äôs true.‚Äù she hesitated. ‚Äúwell, i‚Äôve had a very bad time, nick, and i‚Äôm pretty cynical about everything.‚Äù  evidently she had reason to be. i waited but she didn‚Äôt say any more, and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.  ‚Äúi suppose she talks, and‚Äîeats, and everything.‚Äù  ‚Äúoh, yes.‚Äù she looked at me absently. ‚Äúlisten, nick; let me tell you what i said when she was born. would you like to hear?‚Äù  ‚Äúvery much.‚Äù  ‚Äúit‚Äôll show you how i‚Äôve gotten to feel about‚Äîthings. well, she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where. i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. she told me it was a girl, and so i turned my head away and wept. ‚Äòall right,‚Äô i said, ‚Äòi‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs a girl. and i hope she‚Äôll be a fool‚Äîthat‚Äôs the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.‚Äù  ‚Äúyou see i think everything‚Äôs terrible anyhow,‚Äù she went on in a convinced way. ‚Äúeverybody thinks so‚Äîthe most advanced people. and i know. i‚Äôve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.‚Äù her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like tom‚Äôs, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äîgod, i‚Äôm sophisticated!‚Äù  the instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. it made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. i waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged.  inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.  tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the saturday evening post.‚Äîthe words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. the lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.",1,-1,1

664853,"&gt;i have to ask: do you know that only 1.4 of abortions done in the usa are performed after twenty-one weeks? and that most states, forty one of them have laws against late term termination?  that's true. but i think viability is a line that's in motion. i also don't see much difference between a 24 weeker and a 20 weeker.  &gt;there is nothing tangential about the issues i brought up. they have a direct impact on the abortion rate. if you do not work to help mitigate the causes of abortion, then you really are just a crank.  asking someone to avoid buying shellfish because it's from slaves, but then demanding that they don't interfere with slave ships is absurd. i can support both good sex ed, more readily available birth control *and* curtailing abortion.  &gt;the reasons a woman would seek a late term abortion are many. one of the main ones is that many women, especially young girls do not realize they are pregnant. if a girl is a victim of abuse, the chances of her not being able to access prenatal care are high. pp provides counseling, prenatal testing, and in many clinics, prenatal care. they also can direct women to ob and midwifery services and can refer women to the local chapters of la leche league.  i think it's weird to justify killing a human because someone treated mom horribly. nobody is denying that these mothers are in shit sandwich situations. i don't doubt pp's commitment to women's healthcare.i don't think they're mustache twirling psychos. i *do* think that they kill babies because they don't consider them to be human.   &gt;domestic violence is another reason for late term abortion. do you think bringing a child into a home where the woman, and other offspring are being used as punching bags is a good idea? again, i ask you, have you ever worked to help victims of domestic violence? actions speak louder than words.  and once again the creepiest pro-choice argument rears its ugliest head. it's the old, ""isn't it better for poor people to be dead then alive"" or the ""wouldn't you rather there were no kids in the foster care system"". so to answer your question directly, yes, i think it's better to be a punching bag than dead. and if you're going to stick with the argument that, ""unless you're helping victims of domestic violence you have no right to tell me to stop killing them"", then good luck with that.  &gt;substance abuse is another reason for abortion. i wish we treated drug abuse as an illness instead of in a punitive manner. more women would seek help early in pregnancy and thus have a less risky pregnancy.  i agree.  &gt;you made a nice list of things you have done in your life that you find bad. this does not make me feel any better about you, it makes me think you are a worse person than i thought.  i'm listening.  &gt;i have never worn adidas or nikes....i can't afford them and even if i could i would not buy them. i eat vegetarian as often as possible. i am lucky that i live in an area where i can buy humanely raised chicken, beef and pork. i raise my own hens for eggs, because i hate how factory farm hens are treated. i wish i made enough money to be taxed on. i have not eaten any fish for over a decade. my sister makes almost all my clothes, ( i trade work with her), and i trade for handwoven stuff with a couple of friends. you know the type: they raise sheep &amp; angora goats, and do the whole process to a finished product. i'm an artist and also can local fruit, so we have a happy barter relationship set up. as for prisons, i am a letter writer...my senators and representatives hear from me regularly, and for-profit prisons is only one social issue i care deeply about.  all good things. abstaining from being complicit with evil is a good thing. i'm glad you are making a difference.  &gt;so, what i am trying to point out here is that not only do i object to certain disgusting things, i also try to live my life in a way that is helpful. i just don't say ""too bad!"" i actually do something. you did not say that you were helping in anyway to reduce the cause of abortion...you just blather.  i don't think posting a ""good things i do resume"" is worth a can of beans over the internet. i'm not calling you a liar. i'm saying that ideas are what matter in an anonymous forum. you could be mahatma ghandi or a crazy, or a hypocrite, and none of those identities would be provable or helpful to the conversation.    &gt;i think your conflating the rubella vaccine, parkinson's research, and the rabies vaccine, which are positive things to sweatshops and whatever else you typed is ridiculous.  i love seafood, but i don't want seafood collected by slaves. i love medicine and i work in a hospital, but i don't want the medicines i work with to come from abortions. that's not a hypocritical position.   &gt;abortion is not infanticide. sheesh. you can't even respond yourself to my queries...you rely instead on the right-wing talking head douthat..someone i cannot respect in any way. the fact that he is a man, and a wealthy one at that, means he will never have to deal himself with a pregnancy. so i don't give a damn what his opinion is. it is meaningless.  one of the remarkable things about this whole situation we've created in this country is that somehow men are entirely off the hook from the children they create. but that's a side issue. the challenge of a pregnancy (and every pregnancy is a challenge) doesn't change what's true or not true. it doesn't matter if you don't *want* the pregnancy to be a human child. your wants and needs and challenges and injustices don't change what's physically there.   &gt;a full term infant is capable of breathing on its own. a 22 week fetus is not.  a lot of term babies can't breath on their own. can i kill one? (nope)  &gt;a full term infant can breast feed, or bottle feed. a 22 week fetus cannot. they need to be fed through a nasogastric tube.  a lot of term babies can't breast feed and need ng tubes. can i kill one? (nope)  &gt;bleeding in the brain occurs in some premature babies, with those born before about 32 weeks of pregnancy at highest risk. bleeds can cause the ventricles in the brain to expand, causing pressure on the brain that can lead to brain damage such as cerebral palsy and learning and behavioral problems. full term infants do not have this risk.  bleeding in the brain occurs in some older people, some people with blood disorders and many others. does this risk make these people less peoplish? does it make it ok to off one? if i don't like my gramps can i ""donate"" him?   &gt;patent ductus arteriosis is common in preemies, the earlier the birth the more likely this is to happen. again, not a risk factor with a full term baby.  a whole host of heart defects affect preemies and term infants. none of these things make it okeedokey for me to kill them.   &gt;in other words a 22 week fetus is really not ready yet for life. but not to worry, only a small fraction of abortions performed in the usa are done after 21 weeks, and remember, 41 states have laws against late term abortion. so, cool your rhetoric and set your mind at ease.  the point is that none of these arguments are considered valid in any other situation, so why do we get to get all eugenecist when it's a preemie at 22 weeks but not 30 weeks? if the difference is solely the medical interventions required, then why aren't term with health problems but a decent prognosis ok to kill if we don't want them?  &gt;i notice that not once do you bring up quality of life, the value of life where the birth mother is concerned. this bothers me. i think you enjoy the fight against abortion while doing absolutely nothing to help reduce the causes. talk is cheap...maybe you should get off reddit and get to work.  i think there will be a lot of dead preemies no matter what the law says. that's the sad thing about preemies. but i think there will be a lot of live ones too. the original ""jane roe"" became pro-life after the court case was decided. naturally the proceedings and appeals took more than 9 months. she birthed a baby daughter. that daughter is alive today. that's the quality of life you ignore while throwing mud at me.",1,-1,

yes,  we were 3 children by 3 different fathers, well actually 4 but let's start at the beginning.  my grandfather was a german officer during ww2; not the 'go out to the front an do heroic deeds' kind, but more the 'have a filthy rich kushy life while being 100% safe' kind, he must have been pretty high up. also, like every self respecting nazi, he disliked everyone not 'aryan'. during the late 70s my mother had a boyfriend, who was italian. even though allied during the war, that was unacceptable for my grandfather, which is why it was great for himself not to know.   but then my mother got pregnant with my sister. she had to come clean. my grandfather was furious: a child out of wedlock and from a non-german man?! he left my mother with only one choice; break off contact immediately and listen to everything my grandfather says, or he would disown her. my mother went to her boyfriend and he basically said 'i'll provide for you and the kid, but i don't want to marry'. as security was kinda important to my mom, who basically lived on my grandfather's buck all her life, she broke off contact with her boyfriend and came back home.   my grandfather didn't waste time, he immediately found a match for marriage for her (my mom was pretty hot) and that guy fell totally in love with her. she managed to somehow convince that guy, even though there were a few months discrepancy, that the child was his child, and they lived happily.. not ever after but at least for 2 years. that is when my mom couldn't take the general unhappiness and divorced him, finishing with a classic 'oh and btw, don't even expect to see the child in the future, because she is actually not your daughter'. the guy was understandably devastated.   my grandfather, always being busy, immediately found an other match for my mom. of course, she had to somehow hold that guy, so she got pregnant again with my brother. they were married for a total of 2 years, which again were not very happy.. might be the whole 'arranged marriage not love' thing. so my mom met my dad, she got divorced, pregnant again, this time with me, planned to marry my dad but had a fatal asthma attack 2 days before christmas.   so we kids get separated, but of course instead of to her real dad, my sister goes to the guy who raised her for the first 2 years of her life but already knew that she wasn't his daughter. needless to say, it didn't work out. my sister develops childhood kleptomania as a way to deal with her mother's passing and all the changes, a few months later he sends her to foster care and my grandparents, who oh did i mention, despite having 3 children, really don't like kids, make a deal with the children's home that my sister stays at the home during the week and with my grandparents during the weekend. so that's how she grows up.   but hey, you say, that's not really a curse, it's just a tragic story about irresponsibility and whatever the opposite of open-mindedness is.. well, but this is just the beginning. so everything happening from here on out has no bearing on my life really, my father understandably pissed with my grandfather for breaking us children up and putting my sister rather in foster care than giving her to him (did i mention that my father and grandfather-mother-side really truly and deeply hated each other?) - he (my dad) broke off all contact with my grandparents.   so my grandfather was pretty rich as it seems. they had a large estate with several buildings and tons of land. my uncle opened a multi story dental clinic in hamburg. suddenly events happen quit fast. my uncle takes his own life; well, he sent a fax to my grandfather, saying he is gonna kill himself, and gramps drives out 500 km to knock on his door. my uncle opens the door like nothing happens, and claims the fax was sent by his ex wife (who he supposedly beat and abused regularly) as revenge. grandpa drives back home, when he arrives the police already called informing about my uncles suicide. my grandfather took that really hard (much harder than my mother's death i think). so a few weeks later, he falls from a scaffold and dies... wait, what?   yeah, let's back up a bit. my grandfather owned quite a successful construction business. he had one partner. after my uncles death, my grandfather a changed man, wanting to retire i guess, had a meeting with his partner and his partners son for some reason. also kinda strange, they had the meeting on the construction site, on a holiday (so they were the only people there), instead of, say, an office, like any normal person?!   well anyways, nothing can be proven. the only two witnesses claim that my grandfather slipped and fell from the scaffolding. of course it is kinda strange that after grandpa died tons of money disappeared and my grandmother never saw a payout from the multi million deutschmark company. we'll, that happens if as a patriarch you handle all the finances and your wife knows absolute nada about anything money related..   well that, and the bank comes over and tells you that your whole estate belongs to them now, because that's what happened next. yeah  turns out that uncle who opened a 5 story dental clinic in hamburg? well, he also had a severe gambling addiction. when my grandfather gave him 500k deutschmark (a lot of money back then) as investment, instead of paying off his debts, he kinda just gambled it away. so my grandfather had to borrow money from the bank, give estate as security yadda yadda yadda... until, well, uncle continues to gamble. basically he was running from the hamburg mob before he took his own life so go figure.   so grandma looses everything, but my aunt, wife of my second uncle who, did i mention? died of cancer years before, takes her in. that aunt is also where i got most information, as she witnessed all of it.   tldr: to recap the curse: evil people in the family, my brother, sister and myself are the last survivors. except for grandma who died of old age, everybody else either died before they were 40, or of unnatural circumstances, or both.",1,-2,-1

712339,"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.  ''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.  ms. levine argues that sex between teenagers and adults is not always wrong, and that many people are too quick to deny children and teenagers the right to make their own sexual decisions, often by labeling all such contact ''abuse.''  https://www.routledge.com/products/9780805809145  long-range effects of child and adolescent sexual experiences myths, mores, and menaces  making a unique contribution of placing the current sexual exploitation of children and adolescents firmly in its historical context, this book looks at the family's and society's roles in child and adolescent sex abuse. unlike most previous studies, this study allows a range of responses from negative to positive and avoids the methodological problems inherent in many other studies. most studies combine the age groups of children and adolescents, whereas this study separates these different age groups and compares the nature and outcome of sexual experiences of children with those of adolescents. utilizing sophisticated analytical measures, the author's findings repudiate many commonly held assumptions and serve to calm current hysteria regarding sexual abuse of minors.  http://www.alternet.org/story/12960/what_judith_levine_is_really_saying  levine has taken considerable heat for holding up as a ""good model"" the netherlands' age of consent law, under which young people ages 12-16 can legally consent to sex with older people who are not parents or authority figures, but under which charges can be brought if teens or their parents (with the approval of the council for the protection of children) believe the young person is being exploited. but her support for the dutch law cannot be taken out of the context of that country's social welfare system and relaxed cultural attitudes about sex.  in order ""to give children a fighting chance in navigating the sexual world,"" levine says, ""adults need to saturate it with accurate, realistic information and abundant, varied images and narratives of love and sex.""  if a person truly has the good of young people in mind, one would hope he or she would be interested in what research has to reveal. ""harmful to minors"" offers a plethora of findings, from studies showing that exposure to sexually explicit images does not harm children, to evidence that teens' sexual relationships with adults are not uniformly devastating, to research on the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education in delaying sexual activity.  allie kilpatrick is one source for levine. the book of allie is on routledge.  ask yourself why there is a systemic desire to suppress facts in favor of emotional arguments. why do you help perpetuate by downvoting my own posts on the subject and refusing to listen to alternative views?   small portion.",1,-1,

721488,"(33yo chiming in... of course one thing to keep in mind is that different adults have different opinions, some are right, some are wrong.... there is no set of rules on living, and you should spend a great deal of your time thinking about how it is right to live)   &gt;there's a lot of time left to get wasted and do drugs, don't go too crazy in your teens.   this is a lie.  you've got college, then you're out into the working world where you will be beholden to random piss tests by an employer in most cases.  get wasted now.  be intelligent about it (be intelligent about everything you do, and always seek to learn more about everything), but go ahead and do your exploration now.  you will not be able to do it later.  &gt;your parents know about everything.   bullshit.  your parents are frightened children.  they were overparented, and never matured enough to actually be capable of parenting and turning a child into an adult.  if you want to become an adult, you have to view every word your parents says with suspicion.  they're not mature enough to let you out of their site, are convinced the entire world is dangerous and horrible, and all they want is for you to need them forever.  this is not a property of all parents, just almost all parents alive today as a result of recent social history.  stand up for yourself, and don't expect your parents to respect you as a human being.  to them, you are a toddler until you are 18, and a prepubescent for the rest of your life, unless you stand up to them and force them to accept you as an adult.  and no you don't have to wait until 18 for that.  &gt;live with your parents for as long as possible before moving out. they pay for everything, and help you with way more shit than you think.   this would have been possible a generation earlier.  it's not now.  get the fuck out of your parents house.  your parents are poison.  they bought into the most asinine horseshit when they were teenagers, and it crippled them for life.  they will shelter you and infantilize you.  their money is not worth more than your ability to live as a human being.  if you do not have many intense emotional experiences before you go to college, do not have many relationships (of any kind, not just romantic) with people much different from yourself (age, race, background, etc), you will likely end up as emotionally stunted as they are.  get out there and discover the world.  they will only try to hide it from you out of a sick, misguided attempt to ""protect"" you (which means keep you as childish as possible for as long as possible, which results in depression, anxiety, and emotional immaturity for life).  &gt;be prepared for life to suck a little bit for a while.   puberty is pretty much guaranteed to suck a bit due to our social structure (you're supposed to pull away from your parents, develop independence, fill your need for closeness through your peer group, and find a place for yourself in your society... instead, you get kept in a box with everything you see and hear censored if possible).  after that, it's mostly up to you.  do you want to be angsty and bitchy for the rest of your life?  you can do that.  do you want to be happy?  you can do that too.  it's entirely up to you, but as with everything else every choice has its own consequences.    &gt;get involved in the community, it's an easy way to make friends which is hard when your out of high school/college.   not sure what ""when your out of high school/college"" means.  get involved in your community now.  it will be awkward and strange, since society is not used to seeing teenagers that aren't being obsessively monitored or controlled in adult-organized activities, but both you and the community will benefit.  meet your neighbors.  show up at places they only expect adults (city council meetings, etc) and act like you belong there.  you become an adult by having adult experiences, not by having child experiences and waiting for years to pass.   &gt;move away from your home town. experiencing the world is the most important thing to do in your youth.    i'd say it runs a close second.  developing your mind is the most important thing to do, as you can gain nothing from anything else you do otherwise, including travelling and experiencing other people.  &gt;don't worry about having a plan.  definitely true.  you have to drink water each day, eat every couple days, find some shelter and connect with other people.  that's it.  everything else in your life is gravy.  if you can accomplish those things, you survive.  that is your only job.  anything else is your personal choice.  if you choose to be an employee so that an employer can get rich and you can get a subsistence wage, make that choice with your eyes open and by weighing every side of the issue.  use critical thinking for everything in your life, from judging how you should feel to what to eat to what to do that day.  don't just let your intuition take the lead and end up bumbling into a stupid death.  &gt;don't feel like you have to rush into college right away.  if you want to follow the standard route, you do have to rush into college right away.  student loans and scholarships don't want to talk to you if you have a job and income.  whether to go to college or not is a big decision, and college isn't for everyone, but it opens some avenues and closes off others.  which will be best for you is your choice.  and you will live with the consequences of your actions.  that is freedom.  there are far more advantages to it than there are disadvantages, feel free to investigate that for yourself.  &gt;you can only live up to so many of your parents expectations. focus on living up to your expectations instead.   this is something a lot of people seem to have trouble with.  i never found it particularly troubling myself, but since it seems common i suppose it should be addressed.  you have to live with yourself.  you are your actions.  not 'the actions other people see' or 'what other people think of you', etc.  you are your actions.  if you cheat, you are a cheater, even if only you know it.  if you beat someone up, you are a violent animal, even if only in some situations, even if only in secret.  you may think 'oh, i can just ignore the bad things i do and not let them bother me', you are wrong.  self deception is powerful, but it is not built for endurance.  ideally, you should never be ashamed of anything you ever do.  if it is something which you know might or will cause you shame in the future, you simply don't do it.  circumstances can make this seem like a hard choice, but it's not, really.  learn critical thinking.  you'll learn how to spot stupid emotional irrational tendencies in yourself.  you'll realize that when you have a feeling 'well, this one time won't hurt anything', that's only a feeling.  it has no evidence, no reason.  and you can't provide a reason, because it is unreasonable.  you have to live with your own actions.  if you steal, it is not 'less stealing' if it doesn't lead to a bankruptcy.  and no, this does not result in some sort of monk-life boring religious life.  in fact, i expect you to recognize how religion tricks people by preying on their intuition and emotional fuckups.  what really matters are things which are material.  is someone hurt, are they starving, will something you do cause them physical pain?  these are important questions.  what will they think of me, how will it make them feel, will it make a difference?  these are meaningless questions.  they are either unanswerable or, more often, the answers don't matter.   that is where you should start.  look for what actually physically matters, and try to see your way through the confusion most people live with.  there are loads of books about how the brain works, what its common screwups are, etc, and i'd recommend you read them.  some random examples are ""predictably irrational,"" ""the new science of pleasure: why we like what we like,"" anything about critical thinking.  we don't know everything about the brain yet, in fact we know pretty little.  we do know that our brains spit up a lot of really terrible guesses and even certainties based on nothing of substance, and those things are downright dangerous.  the worst thing you can ever do in your life is to make a big decision because it ""seems right"".  if it ends up in tragedy, you are that tragedy.  you are your actions.  not what you expected your actions to do.  if you act with good intentions but you kill people, you are a murderer.  this applies to everything else just as equally.  if you act with good intentions but you end up making someones life harder, then you are a person who makes life hard for people.  what you intend cannot ever excuse the consequences of your actions.  so be careful.  think about things.   in fact, if i could only give 1 word of advice it would be ""think.""  nothing is more important to you, or to the rest of the human race.  you thinking is the difference between you making the world a better place, or making it worse, even while meaning well.  edit:  oh, also, not reading a big post simply because its long is an act of intellectual cowardice.  being young is no excuse for being mentally lazy.",1,-1,-1

231169,"it's already been answered, but i always loved the passage relating to this in **the lost world** novel:  &gt;‚Äúabout three million years ago,‚Äù malcolm said, ‚Äúsome african apes that had been living in trees came down to the ground. there was nothing special about these apes. their brains were small and they weren‚Äôt especially smart. they didn‚Äôt have claws or sharp teeth for weapons. they weren‚Äôt particularly strong, or fast. they were certainly no match for a leopard. but because they were short, they started standing upright on their hind legs, to see over the tall african grass. that‚Äôs how it began. just some ordinary apes, looking out over the grass.  &gt;‚Äúas time went on, the apes stood upright more and more of the time. that left their hands free to do things. like all apes, they were tool-users. chimps, for example, use twigs to fish for termites. that sort of thing. as time went on, our ape ancestors developed more complex tools. that stimulated their brains to grow in size and complexity. it began a spiral: more complex tools provoked more complex brains which provoked more complex tools. and our brains literally exploded, in evolutionary terms. our brains more than doubled in size in about a million years. and that caused problems for us.‚Äù  &gt;‚Äúlike what?‚Äù  &gt;‚Äúlike getting born, for one thing. big brains can‚Äôt pass through the birth canal‚Äîwhich means that both mother and child die in childbirth. that‚Äôs no good. what‚Äôs the evolutionary response? to make human infants born very early in development, when their brains are still small enough to pass through the pelvis. it‚Äôs the marsupial solution‚Äîmost of the growth occurs outside the mother‚Äôs body. a human child‚Äôs brain doubles during the first year of life. that‚Äôs a good solution to the problem of birth, but it creates other problems. it means that human children will be helpless long after birth. the infants of many mammals can walk minutes after they‚Äôre born. others walk in a few days, or weeks. but human infants can‚Äôt walk for a full year. they can‚Äôt feed themselves for even longer. so one price of big brains was that our ancestors had to evolve new, stable social organizations to permit long-term child care, lasting many years. these big-brained, totally helpless children changed society. but that‚Äôs not the most important consequence.‚Äù  &gt;‚Äúno?‚Äù  &gt;‚Äúno. being born in an immature state means that human infants have unformed brains. they don‚Äôt arrive with a lot of built-in, instinctive behavior. instinctively, a newborn infant can suck and grasp, but that‚Äôs about all. complex human behavior is not instinctive at all. so human societies had to develop education to train the brains of their children. to teach them how to act. every human society expends tremendous time and energy teaching its children the right way to behave. you look at a simpler society, in the rain forest somewhere, and you find that every child is born into a network of adults responsible for helping to raise the child. not only parents, but aunts and uncles and grandparents and tribal elders. some teach the child to hunt or gather food or weave; some teach them about sex or war. but the responsibilities are clearly defined, and if a child does not have, say, a mother‚Äôs brother‚Äôs sister to do a specific teaching job, the people get together and appoint a substitute. because raising children is, in a sense, the reason the society exists in the first place. it‚Äôs the most important thing that happens, and it‚Äôs the culmination of all the tools and language and social structure that has evolved. and eventually, a few million years later, we have kids using computers.""",1,1,1

that‚Äôs insane. so, either her judgement is super goofy, or she wasn‚Äôt telling the truth. either way, it‚Äôs not reassuring to now think this is someone who would be one 72 year old heartbeat away from having to call shots for the country/world.  so todd trots himself back to work and sarah is busy traipsing around the state and the nation. the kids are ""farmed out"" (this is the word used by thier associates in ""the valley"") to family and friends to raise while todd and sarah are off having their respective careers (sarah is famously quoted as saying, ""my mom does whatever i need her to"").  during this period is when bristol, sarah‚Äôs sixteen year old daughter, turns up pregnant. so, it‚Äôs kind of interesting to note that the republican vice presidential nominee and her sixteen year old junior in high school unwed daughter were carrying babies at the same time. once bristol‚Äôs condition became more obvious this summer, she was whisked out of sight and hasn‚Äôt been seen in public until yesterday in ohio. this is why trig‚Äôs blanket was strung across her entire abdomen and torso, but, when she walked down the stairs from the stage, in a profile shot, it was very clear to see she is well into her third trimester of her pregnancy.  it has come out in the past couple of days that she and her high school boyfriend had a quickie wedding and that she is home schooling her senior year.  the anchorage daily news has known about this for months - and haven‚Äôt touched the story. but i can‚Äôt imagine the national press or the democratic party will be as willing to turn a blind eye.  for me, once again it speaks to judgement. we all - every single one of us - even sarah‚Äôs closest friends in the valley (i know, i‚Äôve been speaking to them) know she is in no way qualified for this position. at all.  but then, why would she accept the nomination, knowing that bristol‚Äôs situation will come to light and knowing her hunger for national and international acclaim and attention will carry with it a mighty high price for her seventeen year old daughter who had absent parents last year and who turned up pregnant.  how embarrassing will it be for bristol once the news (or the baby) comes out and not just the valley, not just alaska, not just the usa - but bristol will be known the world over as the seventeen year old unwed - then quickly wed senior-in-high-school-homeschooled-teenage mom and daughter to the republican vice presidential nominee?  how hard will that degree of scrutiny and shame be?  how does one do that to one‚Äôs daughter?  how does one dash about the country for the next 66 days trying to pull off an image of the devoted mother of five when she, by and large, isn‚Äôt the one raising them and when one of them - her daughter, is in a truly vulnerable point in life; not to say anything about the needs of trig. but maybe he doesn‚Äôt count, except as a talking point or a photo prop. but this is a person, a little boy who is going to require a tremendous amount of time and attention. from his mother.  this is okay?",1,-1,

(my brother and his wife (two attorneys in a smallish burg) struggled to pay for childcare for their two (planned, wanted) kids.  they celebrated when the younger one finally graduated to ""toddler"" daycare because that was a hundred-bucks-a-week savings.)  childcare is damned expensive if you can't sponge off of your mother or your boyfriend's mother.  is that going to be affordable on top of college?  and dorm living is going to be right out because you can't take your baby to the dorm.  so, apartment off campus or living at home and commuting.  yay expensive.  i'm sure there's plenty of money in the budget for an apartment.  or for a car reliable enough to commute.  and of course the new mom won't be too tired for the schlep back and forth to college, right?  the new mom can file for child support from baby daddy, whom i presume is also a college student with jack shit for income for the next couple of years but maybe he will put his college education on hold and go to work to support the baby.  (he can always ""go back and finish his education later"", right?  just like the girl can.  right?  fair's fair, isn't it?  *crickets chirping*)  and i'm sure that he would step in front of that bus because it's the right thing to do for his girlfriend of two months and his unborn baby.  oh, and i'm forgetting the charity services that you mentioned.  charity services (the right-to-lifers), in my experience, tend to lose interest once the bouncing baby hits the ground.  ask my tenants how much free charity help they get with something that would actually be fucking useful: reduced-cost child care during working hours.  all those folks are really quite supportive until the baby is born (keep the baby!  we *care* about you and your unborn child!), whereupon their work is done and their support evaporates like the morning dew.  dating, hooking up, evaluating potential mates is significantly more difficult when one has a toddler in tow than when one does not.  i do not think that ""thirty without kids"" is a fair comparison.  what the comparison should be is ""23 with kid"" or ""23 without kid""... apples to apples.  you get a wider pool of applicants if you are ""23 without kid"" and no lie.  how much of a hit is someone supposed to take for a baby?  economic hit for the rest of your life, plus mating hit for the rest of your life... look, it was just a fuck.  it was a fuck with a dude that she's not really all that into.  how much should she have to pay for that?",1,-1,

745504,"**copy-paste for everybody who doesn't like to read 20 pages:**   **surreal estate**  in cities: skylines (read our review here), you can follow around the various npcs who move into your city. however, when there's tens of thousands of citizens, and you're swamped with the tasks related to building and managing a metropolis, it can be hard to keep tabs on a single person's life for very long, and difficult to find them again later.  i thought i'd fix this problem by creating a city in which only a single home could be built. then i'd see who moved in and keep track of their lives. here's what happened.  **welcome to the empty neighborhood**  i begin by drawing some roads, but when it's time to zone them, i use the smallest brush to make only a single square available for residential housing. i've enabled the game's money and building cheats, and i put in everything else necessary for a city: a power plant and electrical lines, water and sewage pipes, a police station and fire department, schools, a garbage incinerator, and a couple unique buildings. it's a functioning city, but there's only enough real estate space for a single family.  then, i wait.   **crest heights**  i'm about to give up‚Äîit's been quite a while and nothing has happened‚Äîwhen suddenly a tiny house is built. there are no residents, but i give the lilac residence, as it calls itself, its own district. i pass the time by creating a bus line that runs by the house, and make other improvements to the city in case anyone ever moves in. no one moves in. buses begin trundling by, carrying no passengers. i wait some more.   **the telltale scooter**  as i'm scrolling around the map, i suddenly notice a little blue scooter parked at the curb near the house. its info tag says it's owned by oscar richardson. i've got a tenant! the scooter also tells me oscar works at the town's incineration plant. that means, essentially, he takes his own garbage to work and sets it on fire. he seems happy about it, though. i click on the house: along with oscar, there is another adult and two teens. i've got a family! now, to spy on them.   **the invisible family**  having only four citizens in the city, you'd think it would be easy to spot them. it ain't. clicking the high school tells me two students are inside it, and i also determine that someone has enrolled in the college down the street. but i don't actually see anyone, including oscar, outside. days pass and i still haven't actually seen the richardsons in person.   **nancy richardson**  finally, i spot someone. it's nancy richardson, the other adult, and she's headed to university, the city's cleverly named university. she walks right past the line of eager, empty buses and heads there on foot. i follow her all the way there until she disappears inside. i don't see anyone else for a long while.   **ashton mason**  i spot someone else walking through the city and get excited, but it turns out to be a wealthy elderly tourist. i find his suv parked nearby. in a city with a number of tourist attractions including a stadium and a museum, he's decided to visit a small playground. a small, empty playground. have it your way, mason, you old weirdo.   **ashton richardson**  finally, one of the teenagers appears, ashton. five people in the city, and two have the same first name. he's walking from the house to a plaza. as i watch, he stops, puts a skateboard on the ground, steps onto it, and does a few ollies. that's teenagers for you, right? always with the ollies. meanwhile, more tourists have begun to arrive, some by plane, no doubt having read rave reviews of our small empty park. i build a metro line because the tourists been walking in from the airport, dragging their rolling suitcases behind them.   **oscar richardson**  oscar, the richardson family patriarch, finally appears. he takes a bus outside his house and rides to work. well, part of the way to work. the busline only goes downtown, and he has to walk the rest of the way to the incineration plant to burn his family's garbage. i add a new bus line that will drop him off right outside the plant.   **katie richardson**  my city is growing, as much as it can. i notice the population has increased to five: oscar and nancy have had a third child. nancy has graduated university u, and is now working at the elementary school teaching her only student, the kid she and oscar just had. thanks to everyone (except oscar) becoming educated, the house has leveled up as well, though i thought the original house looked cooler. i also finally spot katie richardson returning home from high school.   **career path**  oscar is the only one with no education, which makes me sad. his lack of book smarts is also preventing the house from leveling up again. i delete the garbage incinerator building, hoping he'll take his demotion as a sign he should go to school. it's not necessary: the house levels up because ashton has become well educated. oscar doesn't go to school, but gets a job at the presumably empty stadium, which has been visited by a total of three tourists. i build a new bus line just to transport him there.   **terry richardson**  cities: skylines has an in-game version of twitter i'm so used to ignoring that i've only just now realized the richardsons must be the only ones using it. sure enough, the feed is full of their banal chirps about smoke detectors and beautiful sunrises. i'm not sure where they're seeing these sunrises: the game has no day/night cycle. maybe they're all high on bus fumes. their chirps allow me to finally locate the newest member of the family, though, terry richardson. she's in the park with nancy. she's described as a teen but she looks like a little kid. she's also playing with a stuffed animal.   **jobs**  aston and katie have both graduated high school. ashton is working at the stadium with his dad, probably pressured into carrying on the family business of morosely standing around in an empty stadium. katie works at the observatory, which is much cooler. at this point, everyone pretty much has their own private bus to take to work, though katie prefers to walk.   **and then there were four**  i notice one day that the town's population has decreased by one. uh-oh. i check in with all the richardsons. katie is missing. like any concerned city god, i immediately check the local hospital and doctor's offices, as well as the two cemeteries. nothing. i finally realize what happened. like many young adults, katie simply moved out of her parents' home. with only one house in town, she had no choice but to move out of town completely. she's gone.   **empty nest**  ashton moves out soon after. time passes, and terry leaves the nest, too. i'm down to two citizens, and they're both now seniors, and retired. oscar spends his time in a park, wandering around and occasionally chirping. nancy does the same. weird thing is, they do it in two different parks, located across the street from one another.   **parks and wreckage**  i'm a little bothered that they're not spending their autumn years in the same park together. did they agree to meet in the park but didn't specify which one, and they're simply both waiting for the other to arrive? or do they just not care for each other because she let the kids move away and he still smells like burnt garbage? i watch them for weeks as they mill around, just yards apart. they never return home. is the empty nest simply too painful now?  **it tolls for she**  as i'm watching nancy's park, i see a vehicle come around the corner, one i haven't seen in this city before. it's a hearse. nancy is still alive, but the mortuary seems to have gotten a hot tip. the driver, albert ward, gets out, unconcerned that he's blocking the richardson family private bus fleet. nancy is now dead. ward and his partner load her into the hearse and drive to the cemetery. this is terrible, but not the most terrible thing that will happen today. not by a long shot.   **dazed and confused**  oscar is still standing in his park when the hearse arrives for him not much later. they load him in, as they did nancy, but he's not dead. he's alive. he's confused. i bet he is. ""what's happening? where are you taking me? my wife was supposed to meet me in the park. do you know where my wife is?"" yes. they know where his wife his.   **oh god no**  he's still alive in there.   **just visiting**  as the hearse arrives, oscar's status changes briefly, so briefly i don't manage to get a screenshot of it. but i swear it says 'visiting: cemetery.' is that what they told him? is that how they got him in the car? ""come on, pops, we're going to visit the cemetery."" then, he's in the ground. visiting hours are over, oscar. you're now a permanent resident. at least he and his wife are in the same park for a change.   **new beginnings**  my chirper feed is still going off. is oscar chirping about smoke detectors from his coffin? no, it's several other people, members of a new family. they've moved into old richardson place. and why wouldn't they? great location. two parks nearby. amazing bus service. no noisy neighbors.  life goes on.",1,1,

602700,"interesting point. we're very interested in how people react to the drums in this recording - mainly because they aren't real drums! we pulled a phoenix and created digital drums to accompany this track, so it'll be easy to incorporate this change. i'm guessing the reason the drums turned out this way is because we've been relying on the studio monitors for sound checking, but we should do more headphones and speaker tests to see how the song will usually come across. the fact that soundcloud lost a fair amount of quality when we uploaded doesn't help either, but listening to my personal copy of the track, i totally see where you're coming from here. thanks!",0,,
295042,"(btw-my dad left me when i was a baby too - same story - never met him - don't even know his name.)  i would suggest that you casually ask your mom what she thinks about transgender people. **do not tell her about you yet!!** this is just to get a feel for what her viewpoints are. observe her reaction. and then change the subject. this is just to give you an idea of where she stands and what you will need to do to transition. hopefully she will be totally cool with it. in my experience - i have seen some of the best most supportive parents be very upset at first - for a little while. usually they have fears that their kids will be abused and picked on by society + they think about whether they will have grandchildren and stuff like that. but they come around.  do you even *need* to come out to your mom? you might consider that you don't need to formally explain to anyone who you are, what your gender is, and what your sexual preference is. i think about this sometimes. i never had to sit my mom down and tell her "" i'm straight! i'm a girl! "". you know what i mean? it is really no ones business except mine and my partner's.  i want to tell you something else. they say that the worst thing you can do to somebody is to not let them be themselves. so i can imagine how hard this is for you. i think a lot of people can related to this in other ways - for example, when i was in college all of my friends were majoring in careers that their parents picked for them and were the complete opposite of what they were passionate about. it caused them a lot of pain. i think i can understand how scary this must be for you - you're only 15. trust me - at 15 you feel old - like you know so much, but at 18 - wow you know so much more than you did at 15. and just when you least expect it at 20 you know millions more things than you did at 18. and at 23 you know way more than you did at 20. and at 26 you look back at high school and will think "" wow, at 15 i was really a child. but i didn't feel like one. and there was so much drama in high school, etc.""  statistically, the suicide rate for transgender kids and teens is very high. please do not even consider this option. you are a precious 15 year old kid who deserves a full and happy life. do not take this opportunity away from yourself. i have seen some take their lives in an effort to "" make a statement "" to try to "" help the cause "". listen, you can do a whole heck of a lot more when you are alive!  i also want to say to you that i am 26 years old. i notice a huge difference between my generation - i think we are called the y generation? - and people older than me. our whole outlook on life, careers, business, the environment, health, sexuality, gender, etc. are so different. one thing i attribute this to is the internet - and how it allows you to connect to people all over the world. our parents and grandparents didn't have this when they were our age. so for example - to my grandmother japan is a far away land - she still holds a small grudge against japanese people because of pearl harbor. but to me - i went to college with japanese kids, i talk to japanese people online, i watch vlogs of youtubers taking trips to japan. the world is a lot smaller for people like us. and to relate to your ama - i can talk to someone who is transgender - so i can understand what that means and see that you are a person just like everybody else. but you know our parents and grandparents might not have ever had that opportunity to talk to someone who is transgender - so they haven't had the same chance to gain that knowledge and understanding. i think you will notice that as people (politicians, teachers, religious leaders, celebrities, etc.) start to age and retire - and new people from my and your generation start taking over you will see a dramatic shift start to happen faster and faster. you can already see how far same sex marriage has come over the past few years can't you? you can see how much tv has changed - from no gay story lines to leading gay characters with same sex partners. just look at ellen degenerous - in the 90s she had her own sitcom until she was fired because she came out as gay. that would cause riots in the streets if that happened today! and look at her now - she has the #1 daytime talk show! see- things are shifting to create a more accepting world.  i also want to teach you a trick i learned last summer. i think it might be helpful to you. you can use it like a tool whenever you need it. my thing is that i really want to start my own business. i don't want to get a job working for someone else. i want to start a business - something big! i'm also a vegetarian. my aunt hates that i don't want to get a job, that i want to start a business, and that i don't eat meat. i mean she hates this about me. oh and i juggle - she really hates that too. the last few years she has tried so hard to change me. every time we saw each other or talked on the phone she would just yell at me to the point where i would shake and cry. it was awful. i can't change who i am to please her - right? something that helped me was to change the voice that was coming from her to something silly and ridiculous. if someone is mean to you try this - imagine their voice as a goofy cartoon voice, or picture them with their clothes on backwards. for example - you're telling me how to live my life and you can't even dress yourself properly!?! for my aunt specifically, i remember this one time this woman brought her pet monkey to our yard sale (i know. how random is that?) and that monkey saw my aunt, leapt over to her, and climbed up her leg. it was hilarious! so for a while i pictured that weird little monkey climbing up her and it diffused the situation for me. but now i have some understanding as to why she is the way she is - why she treats me like this. she had a horrible childhood and i think a lot of that pain was never resolved for her. so she tries to control my life - i think she wants me to "" do things the right way "" so i can have a better life than she did. so, if you come across someone who is not accepting of you - try this trick - and try to imagine where they are coming from. pity them. you know, if your mom doesn't accept who you are - feel sad for her - she can't accept her own child? she must have a lot to learn - a lot of growing to do. it is possible for her to grow and change.   another piece of advice that was hard for me to learn. if you confide in someone - especially an adult, maybe a school counsellor or teacher - and they are a jerk to you - yeah that happens sometimes. sometimes it happens multiple times in a row. just move on to the next person until you find someone good. one time i told my teacher i was being bullied really bad and she said ""you deserve it!"" can you believe that! what a bad teacher!! i wish i hadn't just given up after that and went to someone else for help.  do you have any idea what you want to do for college, etc? you might consider going to a school that is more accepting of gay and transgender people. look into their campus lgbt stuff. look at the location of the campus. true story - i went to a school that just happened to be rated #1 in the whole country for the highest rate of hate crimes!! i had no idea when i applied - and it really showed how racist and hateful a lot of the people were there. yeah this is one of those things they don't tell you to think about when you start considering schools. if you decide to go away for college - maybe you can live openly as a girl while you're at school? you're mom wouldn't have to know. it would give you some time to figure stuff out on your own and in private away from your family.   good luck girlie! i wish you all the best!  oh, one more thing - take what you read on the internet with a grain of salt. what works for someone may not work for you and visa versa.",1,2,1

426919,"&gt;in the edo period? many poor families did, certainly, but most poor families likely had at least a simple screen to block the view. feudal societies imply a massive divide between the rich and the poor, and the edo period was japan's renaissance, it's intermediary step towards social modernization.  a screen to separate the place from the outside world, sure, but likely not from other members of the family, right?  hiding sex from family members was something minted new with the victorian era, at least in all western (and american indian) cultures.  &gt;i'm going to wonder about your sources, here, because this looks like a sweeping generalization.  the sociology of sex by the teaching company is my source.  pick an ancient civilization at random, i guarantee it will have a social hierarchy where penetration is considered an act of exerting power over someone.  that's one of the bad ideas that i think we will leave behind if society manages to turn back to a sex-as-bodily-function viewpoint.  &gt;really? it was typical for samurai to socialize with their peers. it was typical for those who could afford them to have servants. but this would definitely be the first time i've heard this suggested.  most cultural history classes either avoid sexual history entirely or lie about it to make our current culture sound superior.  the course i mentioned above had information about the samurais, about warriors in the armies of sparta and athens which had same sex partners they fought alongside (watching each others backs), about the greek common practice of pederasty, the judeochristian cultural phenomenon of forbidding sexual acts but not having any concept of a sexual 'orientation' (having gay sex was like thieving or lying.... anyone could do it, it didn't make you a different kind of person, it was just bad), the american indian traditions, traditions from new guinea, etc, etc, etc.  &gt;maybe you know what you're talking about and are just failing to articulate it properly, but this is all coming off as crap. first, not all sexual behaviors are found ""in abundance"" in all societies. they are all found, but ""in abundance"" is strong.  i have done extensive reading in the field of human sexuality and have no intention of talking out of my ass.  pick up the book ""good sex illustrated"" for a very good guide to the extreme sexual oppression that goes on in even todays ""hypersexualized"" (a total joke) society.  the college course i recommended earlier is great for history.  also from the teaching company, dealing more with the sociological side of how societies came to segregate children from adults and then adolescents from both (which is mostly an artificial and quite negative distinction, it was what was created for victorian times so they could force that group to get better educated before they could start a family for economic reasons).  i did not say that *all* sexual behaviors are in abundance in all societies.  i named specific ones.     &gt;secondly, it is a very rare society in which incest is ""more common than not."" ""more common than not"" means most sex is within the family--something that is unusual no matter where you are.  i don't know where you get this idea, that incest is so rare, but it is false.  incest is one of the nearly-universal human traits.  we actually have factual and good reasons for avoiding sexual activity amongst close relatives (immediate family at least, beyond that it falls off fast), so this is not something i would suggest we re-adopt.  but prior societies engaged in what we would call incest sometimes exclusively, but always very, very common.  here is a good article on the subject entitled ""the universality of incest"": http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/06a1_incest.html  &gt;that said, incest has a much higher rate of occurrence in socially repressed civilizations  presently, yes, because we do have factual information about the disadvantages of it.  this was not true in the past.  &gt;paedophilia, for example, was acceptable in some parts of classical societies (so long as it was just boys, and they still were expected to be pubescent).  pedophilia with a pubescent is impossible.  pedophilia, by definition, is the sexual desire for children.  the definition of children is pre-pubescent.  it is only victorian and post-victorian societies that invented this idea of a ""middle time"" where they claim humans are sexually mature, motivated by the neurochemical changes of puberty, but not ""ready"" to decide who to rub against.  would you classify a parent rubbing a childs genitals to calm them and help them get to sleep as pedophilia/pederasty (the term for the action is pederasty, pedophilia is the desire)?  if so, then that was extremely common and still is in a lot of cultures.  when elian gonzalez' grandmother was allowed to visit him in florida, she shocked many in america by putting her hands down elians pants and playing with his penis.  this sort of thing is even more recently decided to be socially unacceptable.  until the mid-1990s if you had suggested ""children are nonsexual creatures"" (a frequent mantra) you would have been laughed out of the room.  pick up a book on child-rearing from 1994 or prior.  any book, it doesn't matter.  there will be a section about how to deal with finding you kid ""playing doctor"" and masturbating.  now, we as a society claim this doesn't happen.  on pubmed there is even a paper about how hundreds of children a year are taken to the doctor and put on strong anti-seizure medication for actions the parents were too stupid to recognize as masturbation.  the idea that sex is not a human issue from birth to death is simply not supported by anything of substance.  &gt;third, sex in most societies is an adult thing.  what makes you think this?  it is absolutely wrong.  in american indian cultures, each tribe generally had a ""fire woman"" that initiated pubescent boys into the ways of sex, in greek societies adults of the same or opposite gender would 'mentor' pubescents in sexuality, the list could go on and on and on.  the idea that sex should be limited to adults is purely and exclusively victorian.  even their implementation of banning adolescent sexuality was actually very lax compared to todays ultrapuritanical standards.  read about ""bundling"" sometime, where essentially adolescents were allowed to have any sex they wanted so long as they did not go all the way to intercourse.  pubescence naturally drives human beings to very strongly seek out sex.  to claim that the fulfillment of that desire would cause them harm requires a lot of explaining from an evolutionary biology and survival of the species angle.    &gt;the difference is the line at which a person is considered an adult.  that is true, as no differentiation between adult and child existed for these purposes before industrialization.  for this, the teaching companys course ""theories of human development"" is fantastic as it traces the history of different theories of human development.  up until the industrial revolution, societies believed essentially that there was no fundamental difference between children and adults.  then industrialization hit, and children were no longer effective workers (they can pick green beans but not reach the conveyor belts to put together a steam engine) so they segmented society into 'adults' and 'children' and made it so that children lived a very different life from adults.  later on, victorian era hit, industrialization got more complex, they invented this ""adolescence"" idea because 13 year olds could no longer get a job good enough to support a family, etc.  and now we're currently in the position of trying to protect children from being victimized and in the process victimizing all adolescents by screaming at them that their sexuality is a joke, is too dangerous, etc.  &gt;lastly, sex was not treated the way we treat eating. not only is that an awful analogy, but it's both a gross exaggeration and a vast generalization.  explain the difference.  you learned it as soon as you were able.  you saw it almost every single day.  no one lied about not doing it or hid it.  religions were filled with ""this god jacked off into this river"" ""this god raped that god"", etc, their household decorations like doorknockers were shaped like penises in several places, etc.  see if you can find some difference.  i am trying to impress upon you the titanic sea-change difference in attitude that other cultures had.  love was entirely disconnected from sex.  there was even one tribe (there was a story on reddit a few months ago about them) which considered sex before marriage as commonplace, as people started as soon as they were willing and had sex with friends and such as a matter of course, but they viewed it as extremely immoral to eat a meal with someone, because that was sharing a very intimate moment with someone.  &gt;nubians didn't treat sex like macedonians, and sexual mores in the han dynasty were very different from the coital customs of the aztecs.  in some ways they differed, but in others they were identical.  for instance, in none of those societies did they hide sex from children or from each other.  i don't know about the han dynasty, but the aztecs and macedonians both slept in common rooms with everyone having sex in full view of the rest of their family.  it was not a dirty thing to hide.",0,,

479962,"&gt;but somehow there's no leap to understand people who kill their sick grandparents or brain-injured toddlers. it's only the murders of autistic children who are offered sympathy instead of either a jail cell or a bunk in a psych ward. this is just flat out untrue. people come out of the cracks to defend all sorts of violent behavior. murders, rapists, war criminals, anything.  actually, in the [autism every day](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmmwg7rrfq) video that i linked above, the then vice-president of autism speaks (the largest ""autism"" organization in the world), talks quite calmly in front of her autistic daughter about how she wanted to drive them both off of a bridge (about 4 minutes into the video).  she decided to stay alive for her ""normal"" daughter (that statement is cut out of the 7 minute video, which is the only one available online now as far as i know).  this was a fundraising/awareness raising video meant for the general public- not something that was an accidental statement included in an off-the-cuff interview.  (and yes, most of the video was staged- although i'm the first to admit that life with autistic kids can be pretty harried at times, it later came out that the families in that video had purposely upset their kids by not feeding them beforehand, taking away toys etc.)    when [katie mccarron](http://www.notdeadyet.org/docs/mccarron/mccarronphotos.html) was murdered by her mother i was shocked and appalled at the number of people on message boards (not just autism boards), who kind of shrugged their shoulders and said ""it's too much for anyone to deal with"". the comments on cnn and the chicago tribune were absolutely appalling in my opinion.  there's some commentary on the various discussions [here](http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/i-dont-have-a-title-for-this-post-about-katherine-mccarrons-mother/) and [here](http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=125) ...many of the original comments are obviously gone now, but i remember leaving a few mailing lists in a hurry when everyone was talking about [poor katie's mom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karen_mccarron) and how much she'd suffered.    katie's grandfather mike showed an incredible amount of courage in wading into the middle of the whole mess and telling the world to shut the fuck up and grieve for katie and try to make a world where no one kills their kid just because they are autistic.  unfortunately it really does happen, and people do excuse it.  i know that i have been absolutely at the end of my rope a few times...not my kids' fault, but because trying to keep track of autistic triplets is pretty taxing.  unfortunately there does seem to be a ""pass"" in some people's minds when someone snaps and decides to kill their child- karen mccarron was found guilty, fortunately, but there are still autistic kids murdered every year, and there is a section of the public who always seem to think that it's okay.    that bothers me a lot (and i am too deep in this as it's my life, and my kids' lives), because i'd prefer that people see my kids for who they are, autism and all, and value them as highly as they would other ""normal"" children.  my family isn't unknown in the two communities where we've lived since my kids were diagnosed- we've been in the news a lot.  if i had a nickel for everyone who has come up to me in public and said to me (sometimes in front of the kids)...""oh, you poor thing- how do you survive?""  ""i bet you wish that you'd used birth control huh?"" or (my favourite) ""kids like that used to be locked away!"", i'd be a rich woman.   i like to think (and do think), that we're making progress.  i work very hard to try to raise positive awareness of autism in addition to trying to treat my kids with the respect that they deserve as people.  in general, i think that we succeed.  and then i read the responses to an article like thi one about andrew, or about yet another autistic child who's been killed, and i think that we're not getting anywhere at all.",1,-2,

[...]  strozier concluded: ‚Äùthis is not to defend child abuse, which is abhorrent. but it may well be that our sense of exploitation of children has become too ideological and leads us to miss the subtlety of love and connection that can arise even in deeply unequal relationships‚Äù (p. 26)",1,-2,

system by retraining police officers and ending racial profiling."" ~ hillary rodham clinton - jan. 17, 2016  sadly, mrs. hillary rodham clinton does not appear to be heartbroken or outraged by a significant population of immature american teen girls and women responsible for oppressing children by subjecting their/society's children to childhood trauma that often results with abused and neglected children developing into depressed, angry, frustrated, unpredictable, sometimes suicidal *(ny times may 18, 2015 - rise in suicide by black children surprises researchers)* teens and adults lacking empathy, compassion and respect for their peaceful neighbors and the authority figures responsible for maintaining peace in all of our neighborhoods.  why hasn't mrs. hillary clinton, an educated american trained in recognizing early childhood abuse, expressed outrage and disappointment about the significant population of immature moms like baltimore mom toya graham who i believe had no morally or 'legally' acceptable right to introduce six children to a life of hardships and struggles while depending on her responsible neighbors to feed, clothe and house her six children. one of whom was observed joining other depressed teens in attempting to cause grave bodily harm or death to police officers charged with protecting peaceful people from angry, depressed teens like ms. graham's son michael and many of his depressed, angry classmates.  why isn't mrs. hillary clinton deeply troubled by women much like tavis smiley's mom, who as a teen irresponsibly began building a family of ten children she introduced to a life of childhood oppression, pain, hardship and struggles. in may of 2015 tavis revealed to a national and worldwide audience his nine brothers and sisters continue struggling from the affects of poverty, aka childhood trauma and abuse.  no one forced toya graham or tavis smiley's mom to irresponsibly introduce sixteen human lives to a childhood, teen and/or adult life of emotional pain and struggle.   why hasn't mrs. clinton recognized that ms. graham and mrs. smiley are much like countless numbers of depressed, immature teen moms across our nation who made a conscious decision to introduce their children to a life of emotional pain and turmoil causing them to experience life scarring childhood trauma that grammy winner and victim of childhood abuse and neglect kendrick lamar laments his ""living wild,"" violent felon embracing mom and dad caused him, his three siblings and numerous cousins to experience...instead of experiencing a fairly happy american kid childhood with safe streets to travel and play on that all young kids have a right enjoy.  i am sad, angry, frustrated, disappointed, outraged and heartbroken that a majority of my american neighbors, including mrs. hillary clinton and members of the black lives matter movement choose to ignore the child oppression, abuse and neglect many immature, irresponsible moms like ms. graham and ms. smiley cause their/society's children to experience during a critical period of their human development.  based on the wealth of evidence of systemic child abuse and neglect occurring in far too many african american homes and communities, why isn't mrs. clinton expressing a belief that ms. graham and tavis smiley's mom should be held criminally liable for receiving public funds to support their children, and then failing to place the emotional well being of their children above all else, often resulting with kids like ms. gloria darden's son freddie gray maturing into a depressed teen and adult who causes harm to himself and his struggling or peaceful neighbors.   same for the late american recording artist tupac shakur, introduced to a life of hardship and struggles that caused him to rap about waking with thoughts of ""blasting"" himself before leaving his home to snatch a neighbor's purse for funds to feed his hungry belly.  sadly, it appears mrs. hillary rodham clinton willfully refuses to recognize far too many children raised by criminally negligent moms often develop into depressed, angry, frustrated, unpredictable, sometime suicidal teens and adults populating our prisons and far too many american neighborhoods.  sadly, regularly dealing with depressed, emotionally disturbed teens and adults much like kendrick lamar, tupac shakur, freddie gray and michael singleton took a toll on my emotional well being that resulted with me abandoning a brooklyn community after spending nearly twelve years of my life trying to protect peaceful people from violent felons who raised depressed kids like kendrick lamar, an emotionally damaged man who publicly speaks about his torment dealing with childhood and adult depression, as well as experiencing suicidal thoughts.  yes, some police officers need to do a better job of remaining professional, adhering to their training, keeping cool, not allowing the human suffering and oppression of children and teens many police officers witness on a daily basis to erode their humanity or basic human respect for others.  just as some single and married moms need to do a better job of parenting by raising, nurturing, socializing and supervising infants, toddlers and children who mature into fairly happy, responsible teens and adults respecting their peaceful neighbors and the authority figures responsible for maintaining peace in our neighborhoods.  i'm sorry to pick on moms, though since ancient times they are the primary caregivers we look to keep us safe, cared for and loved right from our start.  am i the only american who would like to like to hear mrs. hillary clinton address her sisters, ""sisters how much longer are we going to tolerate a significant number of

607743,"there is an alexis-centric episode where she redeems herself.  i don't think i've ever seen the divorce used as an excuse for her behavior, except as a reason for why she is so self-sufficient and independent. but she is, keep in mind, eighteen or nineteen years old and this is her first chance, in her life, to live away from her family and everything she's used to. she no longer needs to be the mature, sensible one around her dad and grandma, she doesn't need to impress adults...the kind of person she was at home would make her absolutely no friends in college. nobody wants to befriend the know-it-all super-mature girl. so she has more freedom, different activities, different friends, and her dad is a famous writer who's always been really lax about letting her do whatever she wants.  (keep in mind it's been a while since i've seen these episodes, so i may be getting details wrong or leaving things out)  and she wants to travel. which is an awesome college experience that everyone should take advantage of! her dad is loaded, and she's got no job, obviously, so what reasons does he have to keep her from going if money is the only thing holding her back? how many chances is she really going to get to go to costa rica with all her friends? castle jets off to vegas with random women and makes international trips all the time, so why can't she?  i'd be upset if i found out my dad was engaged through a third party too, even if i was in costa rica. what, costa rica doesn't have cell service? email? alexis is surely updating her facebook during the trip, and he didn't drop her a message or update his status? considering how important her dad is to her, and how she knew he loved beckett and all their will-they-won't-they stuff, she probably felt she deserved to hear about it in advance. did he even tell her he was planning to propose?  castle's by no means mature. he has his moments, but for the most part his charm is in his childlike attitude, and even when he's intelligent and good at drawing conclusions and reading people's behavior, he's not a mature person. and maybe he and martha and meredith and everyone all heaped love and attention on alexis all her life, and she's been popular and stuff through school, but regardless of that? her parents are divorced, her dad has been through several marriages, her grandma is around but does her own thing and half the time acts more like a best friend than a grandmother. her dad isn't exactly full of fatherly wisdom or a conventional single dad. he parties and jokes about not remembering to feed her as a baby. so alexis has had a lot of great things in her life, but that doesn't mean she's never wanted for anything. maybe she wanted a mom and dad who got along constantly and lived together with her. or a mom who didn't flit in and out of her life like a fairy godmother. or a grandma who wasn't an overdramatic actress, and stayed home to teach her normal things, not ""mind reading."" or a dad who acted like a role model, not a playboy bachelor.  alexis is the classic ""mature beyond her age, wise beyond her years"" sort of person. but that can only last so long, and in college, people start forming new/different identities. she's trying to figure out who she is as an independent person, and she has a history of ""always being right"" and ""making the mature decision"" and ""trusting her own intuition"" to make her, yeah, pretty selfish in her decisions.  this isn't alexis' show, and the writers can't show us anything more than brief glimpses of alexis' college life. at one point, she goes to a con with her friends, mortified that her dad found her there. pretty normal teenage stuff. but another time, she gets kidnapped, and she probably went through a considerable amount of trauma and had to recover from that.  since we're seeing this from castle's pov, and only seeing bits and pieces of alexis, it's a baffling switch for her character to go from ""sweet voice of reason"" to ""teenage rebellion"" (and in terms of rebellion, it's a pretty small one).  alexis wants to try on a different version of herself, see how it fits. her dad knows that this is totally weird and out of character for her, and he says/does some stuff that makes her feel like he's being oppressive, so she starts treating him more like a restrictive dad and not letting him into her life as much (which is something a lot of people do in college--i just did it myself). and even if she does realize that she's wrong, and eventually lets her ""wild side"" slip and reason take over, her pride won't let her admit it. she'll ride it out until she finds an escape, because she's desperate to show that she can do this on her own and be an independent adult. life is a whole bunch of ""i can do it myself!"" stages--toddlers who can dress themselves but forget underwear and their shirts are on backwards, young teenagers who pick questionable friends and insist that ""it's not goth, it's *who i am*,"" young adults who want to move out and reap the benefits of their parents' support while trying to cut their parents out of their lives because *they should just let me live my life, you know?*  it's irritating while it's going on. all teenagers are! all teenagers/young adults are like babies trying to walk by themselves and the parents get to watch them struggle and aren't allowed to help too much because then the baby will yell at them for being overbearing.  alexis isn't unaware of what she's doing. she's just a young adult growing up and trying to figure out who she is in a different atmosphere.",1,1,

300011,"right. but africa is one of those aforementioned third world countries (yes i know africa isn't a country, but it's a continent *comprised* of third world countries) where acts of ignorant brutality are to be expected.    as for ireland, 40 years ago my mother hadn't gone through puberty yet, so that is ancient history as far as my attempts at self-preservation are concerned.     i think you may have sent me the wrong link. the page that you linked to doesn't contain the words hindu or catholic, just pakistan, iran, and muslim. the one about the rape victim killed by her brother is particularly interesting. that's *exactly* the kind of culture i will spit on you for trying to bring to the town where i live.          i did just read an interesting article over in r/atheism that agrees with you though. apparently in america, most religious people- muslims and hindus as well as muslims, aren't the religion they think they are. they're egonovists or something (i can't find the article now because i'm looking for it) which pretty much means they make up their own religion and then never change the name. i find that extremely comforting.",0,,
671209,"&gt; there's a difference between taking someone who might feel actively threatened and tell them they have nothing to worry about and saying it's all in their head, and looking at someone who thinks the world is flat.   not everyone's right.  anyone who has been on the internet for *any* length of time *knows* that sometimes it is in the person's head.  i'm not talking about some sort of red ill or mra bullying but someone who has a legitimate opinion.  someone with such an opinion should not be shut off solely because the object of their opinion might not like it.    we're all (supposedly) big boys and girls and we need to take responsibility for our own feelings.",0,,

766278,"&gt;&gt;why? because they are poorer and much less experienced? lots of people are poor and without much knowledge. should they all place their children for adoption?  people who have no business having children should not have them. like teens. not only that but they are biologically immature, not done with their education and look at the research.   &gt;whether a mother is single or not, makes no difference in her parenting skills. some are great, some barely decent, some completely unfit. the same goes with older parents.  you keep switching from single teen mother and a single mother. that is not the same. this is part of the problem.   &gt;maybe you are speaking about financial difficulties, but that is different than being a good/bad parent.  it is way more than that.   &gt;of course statistically teen parents are worse than older ones.   and you are dumb enough to keep pushing the idea that teen girls should be single mothers and let their children suffer!   &gt;wow, you must have real trouble with comprehension reading. of course they are disadvantaged.    you are the one who thinks that children should suffer at the hands of single teen mothers. you are not thinking of the children here.   &gt;i'm saying black children and those raised by grandparents are also disadvantaged - when you compare them to white people or dual parent households.  i have read other comments and it is clear you are racist. according to you no black person should have children if teen girls cannot.   &gt;most teen moms are already poor, so they are disadvantaged from the start. so poverty is often correlated with teen pregnancy, not necessarily caused.  &gt;poverty is both a cause and a consequence of teen pregnancy and childbearing.   http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/teen-pregnancy-prevention.aspx    and you think that they should have children instead of someone else? you rather a child suffer with a teen mother than to be in a better home.   &gt;i wonder if you think that all poor couples should adopt their children out. or does it apply only to poor single teens?  wow you are dense. you keep bring up other groups. you think adoption agency is going to give babies to only poor couples? have you ever looked into adoption?   &gt;if teen mothers are helped, they and their children have bigger chance to succeed.  http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/parenting_as_a_teenager.html  &gt;consider whether you can stay with your parents while your child is young. this might help you deal with the pressures of caring for your child or coping financially. your parents might also be able to give you some backup when you need it and even share some tips from when you were a baby.  so they need their parents help? i thought grandparents were like teen parents? lol  &gt;raised by grandparents or relatives or by black people - all these groups are disadvantaged.  post evidence that teen parents are the same as grandparents or relatives or by black people. you think you can make wild emotional and even racist claims without providing any evidence.   this is an advice article not a research article.   they also support adoption  http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/raising_an_adopted_child.html/context/1670   http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-24/teen-mums-missing-out-on-celebratory-side-of-motherhood/8533572  &gt;despite improvements in the availability of contraception and access to abortion, teens are still becoming parents.  this article is fine with birth control and abortion do you agree?  this is not a research article.    https://www.everydayfamily.com/blog/think-every-mother-deserves-baby-shower/  this is not a research article.   https://www.everydayfamily.com/slideshow/teen-moms-shouldnt-be-ashamed  this is not a research article.   https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/teen-moms-need-support-not-shame.html  &gt;statistically, teen parents in the u.s. are less likely to finish high school, more likely to experience poverty as adults, and more likely to have kids with poorer behavioral, educational, and health outcomes.  finally an article that uses some research. and it agrees with me. of course!  &gt;but many teens that become pregnant were already disadvantaged, and the stigma only makes things worse.  the stigma does not help but it is not the reason teen mothers fail. they are disadvantaged and you want children to suffer.   and they are for abortion.  &gt;i‚Äôve noticed a lot of organizations that pose as supportive of teen pregnancy do so only because they‚Äôre pro-life. how do you guys identify? &gt;natasha vianna: i‚Äôm pro-choice and fully support abortion rights access.&gt;gloria malone: yeah, me too.&gt;vianna: with #noteenshame we try to¬†recognize that all young people deserve access to comprehensive and accurate information about their sexual and reproductive health as well as complete agency and autonomy over their own bodies.   &gt;i never said that they are better than blacks or old people.   you brought them up as a part of your argument. i notice you keep bringing them up, because apparently if teen mothers are are not that good of mothers then black people must not allowed to be parents. post a source that grandparents and black people are the same or similar as single teen mother. if not shut up about them.    &gt;your research doesn't say that all children raised by teen parents are equally disadvantaged.   lol you need it to say all?

610434,"(pt 2 of 3)  projections by japan's official national institute of population and social security offer a stunning picture of the possible future for today's young japanese. consider, for example, a woman born in 1990, now 22 years old. given current trends, the institute estimates her life expectancy to be around 90, maybe higher. but children-and family, at least in the current understanding of the term-may very well not be part of her life experience. the projections give her slightly less than even odds of getting married, and staying married to age 50. her chances of never marrying at all are nearly one in four. further, these projections suggest she has nearly a two-fifths (38 percent) chance of ending up childless. even more astonishing: she has a better-than-even chance of completing life with no biological grandchildren.  though it can be represented in cold statistics, the human flavor of japan's new demographic order may be better captured in anecdote:  * rental ""relatives"" are now readily available throughout the country for celebrations when a groom or bride lacks requisite kin.  * ""babyloids""-small, furry, robotic dolls that can mimic some of the sounds and gestures of real babies-are being marketed to help older japanese cope with loneliness and depression.  * robot pets and rental pets are also available for those who seek the affection of an animal but cannot cope with having one to look after.  * in a recent government survey, one-third of boys ages 16 to 19 described themselves as uninterested in or positively averse to sexual intimacy.  * young japanese men are, however, clearly very interested in video games and the internet: in 2009, a 27-year-old japanese man made history by ""marrying"" a female video game character's avatar while thousands watched online.  * japanese researchers are pioneering the development of attractive, lifelike androids. earlier this year, a persuasively realistic humanoid called geminoid f was displayed in a department store window, appearing to wait for a friend.  these random facts may not reflect the full spectrum of everyday life in modern japan, but like anecdotes about any country, they reveal things that are genuine, distinctive, and arguably meaningful about it today-and perhaps tomorrow as well.  what will all of these unfolding demographic and familial changes mean for the japan of 2040? a few of the most likely implications can be briefly itemized:  a looming old-age burden: despite salutary trends in ""healthy aging,"" japan's extraordinary demographics can only mean that a rapidly growing share of the country's population will be frail in the years ahead-and that public pension allowances, health and medical services, and long-term care will be ever more pressing priorities for japanese society. not the least of the problems may concern alzheimer's disease. a study commissioned by alzheimer's disease international suggests that, on current track, the prevalence of dementia in the japanese population could rise to five percent by 2050-one person in 20. the caregiving implications of such an outcome are staggering-and given the coming erosion of the japanese family, a steadily decreasing proportion of senior citizens will have children to turn to for support. under such circumstances, an increase in long-term institutionalization among the elderly seems inescapable.  a new kind of childhood: in the recent past, children in japan were plentiful, while elders (who could expect a measure of veneration) were scarce. but by most projections there will be three senior citizens in 2040 for every child under 15-an almost exact inversion of the ratio that existed as recently as 1975.  it is easy to imagine a japan in which children--the country's link with its future-will become increasingly prized. it is also possible to envision a future in which japanese boys and girls develop a pronounced sense of entitlement, much as china's rising generation of ""little emperor"" only-children have today, and regard their obligations and duties to their elders as increasingly onerous and optional. the hopes and expectations falling on this dwindling cadre of youth would be truly enormous-and for some fraction of the rising generation could amount to an unbearable pressure.  japan is already witness to a worrisome rise in the number of what social scientists call neet youth (not in education, employment, or training)-women and, more commonly, men who are, in effect, opting out of existing japanese social arrangements. the pathological extreme of this phenomenon is the hikikomori-young adults who shut themselves off almost entirely by retreating into a friendless life of video games, the internet, and manga (comics) in their parents' home. hard data on the hikikomori are scarce, but japanese experts guess that there are hundreds of thousands of them. suffice it to say that childhood and young adulthood in the japan of the future will be different-and in some ways, perhaps more difficult than ever before.  a struggle to maintain economic growth: in the aftermath of two ""lost decades"" of meager growth, a world economic crisis, and a devastating tsunami, the japanese economy faces a future in which simply sustaining growth will be an increasing challenge. the working-age population is set to shrink by 30 percent over the next three decades, and even if older japanese take up some of the slack, the country's work force will almost surely be much smaller than it is today. extreme population aging, for its part, stands to place mounting downward pressure on the nation's savings rate-and thus, other things being equal, on investment.  ballooning debt obligations will compound the demographic pressures on economic performance. thanks in part to its approach to financing programs for the aged, japan already has the highest ratio of gross public debt to gross domestic product (well over 200 percent) of the developed nations. projections by researchers at the bank for international settlements imply that this ratio could rise to a mind-boggling 600 percent by 2040. (greece's public debt, by contrast, amounted to about 130 percent of its gdp at the start of its current default drama.) while japan might well be able to service such a mountain of debt without risk of sovereign default (assuming the country's low-interest-rate environment continues to hold), it is hard to see how a recipe for rapid or even moderate economic growth could be cooked up with these ingredients.  even so, from a purely arithmetic standpoint, a country with a shrinking population-and even a shrinking gdp-could theoretically enjoy steady improvements in personal income and living standards. japan does possess a number of options for enhancing economic growth. significantly, it has built a generally strong educational system, and efforts to increase attainment (including implementation of a genuine lifelong approach to education and training) could tangibly increase labor productivity. japan is also a world leader in research, development, and ""knowledge production."" strengthening these capacities and applying technological advances and breakthroughs throughout the national economy could stimulate growth. and as the healthiest people on the planet, the japanese have untapped possibilities for augmenting their future labor force by extending working life. finally, far-reaching structural reform of the economy-long hobbled by a dysfunctional financial and banking sector and other ills-could significantly brighten the prospects for long-term growth. seizing these opportunities, however, will require widespread determination to chart a sharp change of economic course on the part of japan's political leadership and an aging electorate that may be increasingly risk-averse.  a less crowded, ""greener"" japan: japan's impending depopulation may have its upsides. with the emptying of the countryside, for example, the nation will have more living space and arable land per person than it does today. given the country's ongoing improvements in energy efficiency and environmental technologies, depopulation could coincide with an improvement in natural amenities and (by at least some criteria) quality of life. further, thanks to environment-friendly technological advances and, however unintended, slow economic growth, japan may emerge as a world leader in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.",0,,
849804,"i agree with you. the age of consent laws were starting to flounder in the 70's to 80's, so they had another round of reaffirming them by stating the cost in pregnancy to females, as yes, the female is what started age of consent laws. it was aimed against males, as even underage males from 1920 to 1990s could be put in jail for sex with a female under the age of consent, if caught or prosecuted.  now, the people proposing age of consent laws have swapped to calling on the brain maturity argument, citing things like ""brains dont mature until mid 20's"" which means that anything under is obviously 'child-like"".  but then a wild link appears http://phys.org/news/2010-12-brain-fully-mature-30s-40s.html  i have my own theory. maturity is a misnomer. what is actually happening is that the brain is slowing down its rate of change. people who eat mediterranean diets tend to stave of alzheimers and other ill effects, essentially being capable of replacing their neurons and gray matter at an effective parity rate.  this death/replacement of gunk in the brain can look like immaturity to people, because as the brain replaces parts, what helps form it is the stimulus from outside coupled with processes going on internally.  think of a muscle. if a muscle stops getting much bigger, we don't call it maturity. we know that with proper eating habits and exercise, it can change even more. cells in it will die, and be replaced by cells in a slightly different formation. we don't consider it mature simply because you stop hitting the gym.  no, the brain isn't a muscle, but the brain does react and change due to stimuli. if you've ever seen a human brain of a normal human deprived of stimuli, they have far less 'development', in the ridges, in the crags and formation of all the parts. you could say their brain got stuck in immaturity, but what really happened was that it wasn't stimulated to grow and adapt.  the end of adaptation looks erroneously like 'maturity' to people, which is why they cite those ""mid 20's brain mature"" papers or articles.  we know that chronic stress causes loss of brain matter. so imagine that you lose your hippocampus size. have you regressed to being ""immature"" because your hippocampus isn't as developed any more?  many people who are deprived of early life experiences tend to stay immature emotionally. how many people have you seen in their 20's or even 40's that still act like teenagers or worse?  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  i'm not throwing my hat towards the side of calling it right. in fact, with so much infantilizing, the way people have been raised in the last 20 years has been highly emotionally stunting. hence man-child (and many women-children as well).  so, given the way we've basically raised regressed emotional beings, the age of consent could probably do with a raising, since obviously people can't handle sex as well anymore, if the idea hinges on emotional maturity, which almost no 20 something is due to the process of infantilizing that's happened in culture lately.  nature doesn't really care about morals though. the individuals with the best genes for replicating will win out. if your lineage can have babies sooner, more often, and with less mortality rate, because your body matures to do that process sooner, then you're going to succeed in the evolutionary arms race.",1,-1,-1
753749,"parasitic_spin has the best advice in #5. people just don't know what to say or how to act, and you really have to ask for what you need. you are not a bad person for feeling this way and it is normal to feel jealous when others have what you want. i also second the therapy advice.   i don't know if this will be true for you, if you are actively trying to conceive again with your partner, if you have started the adoption process, or if you've decided to accept never having children, but for me; being involuntarily childless is a multifaceted pain. one of the more upsetting aspects of it is that i self-identify as a naturally compassionate and nurturing woman. i enjoy taking care of the people i love and showering them with affection and maternal attention. people who don't know about my struggle will often say ""why don't you have kids! you'd obviously be a great mother!"" for years that comment was a punch in the gut and would leave me smiling with tight lips and excusing myself to go to the restroom and sob and/or throw up. i've finally gotten to the point where it is a touching compliment and an affirmation that i don't *have* to have children to share my true nature with the world, but believe me, it took me a long time to get here and i'm still not entirely at peace, but at least now i find my situation bearable.  the whole ""feeling angry and jealous when i should be feeling happy for my friend"" thing is difficult issue to address. again, in my case, because not being ecstatic for a friend's success is very uncharacteristic for me. i worried that my experiences had hardened me, made me bitter, and changed me for the worse. i thought saying ""i am so happy for you but it is really hard for me to share this experience because my heart is still so raw"" would explain my lack of enthusiasm but still show that i care about my friends, but all they seemed to hear was ""i can't be your friend anymore because i'd rather wallow in self pity.""   another thing that sucks about being us is that the pain we feel around new babies and children tends to make us avoid them for fear of triggering our sadness, but that sucks because we obviously love babies and children, otherwise we wouldn't want them so desperately, right? for years i would force myself not to even look at young children with their mothers in the grocery store because doing so would result in me walking around in public looking like a crazy woman with tears running down my face. i say this sincerely, one of my biggest personal triumphs happened not too long ago when i was behind a very young woman with a newborn infant in line at the grocery store. this girl couldn't have been more than 17, and awkwardly pushed the pacifier back into her daughter's mouth when she started to fuss. i felt myself start my usual ""life isn't fair, how can this kid be a mother and i can't"" record in my head, but i was able to stop it and forced myself to gaze at the baby and smile. the mother noticed and i said ""she is beautiful"" and my voice didn't crack and the tears didn't come.  ever since that day i've been getting better at it, back to my old self, smiling at kids, and waving back at toddlers who wave and say ""hi!"" from their strollers. it gets easier all the time and there is more joy in my life because of it. the last time i held a baby was 2 years ago, i took a xanax beforehand in preparation for the experiment (don't worry, i was sitting down when i held her!) and as soon as her grandmother (my friend who knows about my history) placed the sleeping infant in my arms i took a deep shuddering breath, tried to steady myself, and looked down at the baby and tears spilled onto her blanket before i knew they were ready to fall. the baby's mother (who i don't know as well) was understandably worried and she said ""you don't have to hold her if it's too hard"" and her mother (my friend) said ""no, she needs to do this"". i held that beautiful baby and felt my heart ache (literally) and just allowed myself to grieve and really feel sorry for myself and the experiences i will likely never have. when i'd had enough, i handed the baby back, thanked her mother and my friend and went to the beach to think.    it has been a long journey to get here, and i want you to know that even me, who considers herself to be one of the most supportive women she knows, couldn't share in the joy of a friend's childbirth for almost 10 years, and i am not a cold, callus, or bitter person, and i never was. it is an unspeakable pain that we live with. it sounds melodramatic to a lot of people to say that, but they've never woken up in the middle of the night with an aching chest while their bodies cry out to them to find and feed their dead baby.  feel what you feel and without judging yourself. this is your journey, and i'm very sorry you won't be celebrating a birth this week.",1,2,

550204,"first there was the woman who mysteriously died in a house fire, leaving my father an inheritance. apparently this woman made my aunt (father's sister) her beneficiary. when my father found out, he befriended her and buttered her up until it changed to him. months later, boom, she's dead - house burned to the ground. congratulations to my father on a new boat (i was just born.) we're not talking ""fuck you"" money here, but enough to buy a bigger/better house - with a mortgage, not free and clear.  my mother left our family (dad + 3 kids) when i was 6. she married her cocaine dealer and started a family with him - had his baby - later divorced and got into a lot of traffic issues - ran into someone's car and knocked the door off, that kind of shit.  meanwhile, my father raised 3 kids alone - his own doing, he cut her out completely - he ran their business himself but... somewhere along the way when the friends of my older sister became teenage boys aged 13-18 our home became a flop house. it turns out daddy really had a thing for teenage boys. he was in dire straights financially and spent every dime on them, buying expensive tennis shoes and clothing - meanwhile his actual children didn't get much of anything.  the house gets foreclosed, kids move around between relatives for a while, end up back with dad in a really tiny house where i - the middle child - didn't even have a bed to sleep on. i slept on the couch. unfortunately, we were booted from said house due to lack of paying rent and ended up living in a motel for the latter part of my freshman year and the following summer. happy 14th birthday to me! we're talking roach motel. i had to share a bed with my younger brother while my older sister was taken care of like a princess by her boyfriends' father - who knows what else was going on there. meanwhile i too sought refuge in a boyfriend and spent most of my nights sneaking in/out of his bed.   then, we get another apt - in the same neighborhood the foreclosed house was in, but in the ghetto where there were crack dealers on the corner now. awesome, amirite? there's only 2 bedrooms, so i get to share a room with my brother (p.s. i'm a girl) finally, mom was clean, i moved to denver with her. my brother was the only one to stay at dad's. dad ends up stalking many of his friends until the brother finally moves out, at which point dad finally finds gay friends and hangs out at gay bars like a normal gay dude. i suspect the bulk of his income still goes to playing sugar daddy for some hot barely 18'ers though.  my older sister and younger brother are both heroin addicts. my sister is a literal street walking prostitute junkie - but she always maintains a cell phone, so we keep in touch. she's 31 but looks 50. my little brother manages to maintain on methadone nowadays because he knocked up some girl ""on accident"" (which, considering she already had two kids is absolute bullshit) who now holds his balls in a vise because if he left her, he'd never get to see his kid considering his drug history.  my youngest ""brother"" - the one mom made with her coke dealer - probably got the most raw deal, back ended with the best deal in a way. he lost his mother (our mother) when he was 4 or 5 because she was a coke head and the dealer was finally sick of her cutting into and subsequently stomping his bags. so he cut her out the same way my father had. well, when the youngest brother turned 10, dude dropped dead of a heart attack right in front of him (gee, step-dad, could it be the last 30 years of coke?) so, the he loses both parents. however, unlike the rest of us, he ends up in an affluent family as a result (his aunt/uncle) and actually has a better chance to succeed in life.   want to talk grandparents? ok. my fathers parents were raging alcoholics. they stabbed him in the head with a fork when he didn't eat all his vegetables. his oldest sister and brother died exactly a year a part. both drowned. different bodies of water. the parents spent the rest of the time lamenting at the loss of their ""good children."" like i said, raging alcoholics and smokers - until they were in their 70's and gramma had a stroke - finally they quit and lived for another 30 years. good longevity genes on that side, maybe?  my mothers father was air force. they lived all over europe, certain aunts and uncles were born in turkey. he was stationed in west berlin in the 60's. he used his uniform and a vw bus to smuggle antiques between the berlin's - the biggest ticket item being cuckoo clocks. also, probably lots of contraband from all the horrible remnants of the holocaust that i'm not privy to, i've only heard the stories.  anyway, he's taking this stuff from e to w because he can. meanwhile, his wife - my granny - works for the department of the army as a secretary for the intel division. one night on the eastern side grandpa sees some army joe's out of uniform on the wrong side. checkpoint charlie was army, so grandad gives him the heads up to go square away the soldiers out of uniform.  the next week, granny starts seeing paperwork on him coming across her desk. he's under investigation for his exploits. she goes home and tells him that night, and the next day she turns herself in as a security risk. they were back in the states within 24 hours.   the same grandfather was also quite the philanderer. to the extent of setting up a whole second family who never knew he already had one (he had no legal obligations to them, the kid wasn't his, he was just in fantasy land half the time)  same grandfather (mom's dad) became pretty wealthy in the 80's. he was into construction and selling antiques, go figure. he created this ranch in indiana. 600 acres of camping, there was a 35 acre lake, cabins, 260ft water-slide, paddle boats, restaurant, even a night club. unfortunately, his second wife was a complete trophy. cute as a button, perfect socialite - dumb as a rock. she was unable to successfully run the ranch and went bankrupt.   most fucked up family?

959435,"&gt;this isn't a moral issue anymore than murder being illegal is, trying to make it into one is a distraction. both pro-choicers and anti-abortionists are guilty of this.  &gt;the issue is entirely based on what defines a human life. if something is a human, it deserves the same legal protection as any other human, as you've noted. how is that legislating morality? it has nothing to do with morality.  the moral issue i think is that definition. scientifically conception has the problem that you are forced into saying there is something special about human embryonic cells that does not apply to non-human nor non-embryonic cells. additionally, time of birth means that you deny rights to a full-term unborn child and magically a full-term born child has them. any definition you pick will have to eventual turn into a morality debate. why should a clump of embryonic cells have rights when a tapeworm or a genetically distinct tumor doesn't? or conversely why should a born child have rights when a full-term unborn doesn't? wherever the line is drawn you have to justify the point and you can try to appeal to science, but in the end it is a moral question. of course there is even a moral question about the right to life. its fairly trivial, ethicists do it all the time, to set up scenarios where taking a life seems to be the morally preferable situation.   &gt;yes, and i don't see how there is anything wrong with that either. what you are saying is it is legally acceptable to torture, disable, and murder up until some ambiguous point you personally decide it becomes human.  and the only way not to make that decision is at conception which then forces you to say that there is something special about human embryonic cells.  &gt;this is getting a bit tangential, but i don't see how permanently maiming what will unquestionably be a future human (through things like alcohol and drug abuse during pregnancy) is at all legal.  see this is another slippery slope. should it be legal for a person to be a bad parent? should it be legal for a person to teach a child bigotry? what about self-inflicted harm? where does it stop. if protecting people from other people is the goal of government that it would be easy to argue that any liberty with potential harm should be illegal and that the government should make almost all of our decisions.",0,,

273202,"a short story i wrote, this one dating about 2002, or around about there. it‚Äôs pretty deranged, and it‚Äôs got absolutely nothing to do with my state of mind back then, but i did have a lot of fun writing this one. it‚Äôs a little immature going over and re-reading it, but i was young and didn‚Äôt really know a whole lot about writing. not that i do now, mind you, but its all fun and games until someone gets shot in the head with a nail gun. (oooh, cryptic foreshadowing!)   trix rabbit: chronicals   ‚Äúsilly rabbit! trix are for kids!‚Äù the words kept repeating over and over again in his mind. those damned children, holding a bowl of trix, just out of reach, offering spoonful after spoonful before ripping them away and stuffing their greedy little faces. ‚Äúsilly rabbit, trix are for kids!‚Äù they‚Äôd constantly recite. so close, yet so far. he just wanted one bowl of the fruity flavored cereal. he needed his fix. he‚Äôd do anything for it. just one, lousy bowl.   ‚Äúaugh!‚Äù the rabbit woke up in a cold sweat. this is how he started every morning, the same re-occurring nightmare, day in and day out. he reached for his handkerchief that he causally placed on his bedside table the night before. fumbling around with no luck, he muttered to himself, ‚Äúdid those little fuckers get that too?‚Äù   eventually he found what he was looking for. he sat up and wiped off his brow.  the rabbit made his way to the kitchen, the same kitchen he‚Äôd had for 30 years now. dull, boring, flavorless wallpaper hung in shambles in the unkempt rabbit hole. empty boxes of oatmeal were strewn about, dishes lay dormant in the sink. he turned on the fluorescent lighting, and noticed several cockroaches scurrying about. he cringed as he made his way to the cupboard, where the door lay half off it‚Äôs hinges. he reached for a box of brown sugar oatmeal. empty. he tried the apple cinnamon. empty. finally, he reached for the plain oatmeal. one pack left. he prepared it as usual, stirring it mindlessly as the sludge grew thick and pasty.   sitting down at the table, he continued to stir the oatmeal, staring off into space, contemplating who knows what. he took the spoon to his lips, but could not force the food into his mouth. who knows how long he sat there, motionless, oatmeal inches from his mouth. if you listened close enough, you could almost hear the snapping sound from inside his head. he threw the spoon away and poured the oatmeal over his head, threw the bowl against the wall, shattering it to pieces. in a fit of rage, he upturned the table and slammed it against the wall. the cupboard door came off it‚Äôs hinges and fell on his foot. lost in a blinding fit of rage, the rabbit proceeded to pound the walls until his knuckles bled. deep crimson red spread over the wall paper. it was the only color the kitchen walls had seen in years. he sank down to the floor and buried his face in his knees and sobbed for hours.   the kids were out and about playing soccer in the field, and for some unbeknownst reason, seemed to all carry a box of trix. the sky was blue, the grass was green, and everything was vibrant and full of color. after every goal scored, a ‚Äòtrix time out‚Äô was called. the kids would enjoy their delicious sugar coated fruity cereal, all the time wondering if the rabbit would show up. oh what fun the rabbit was. so silly! if only he‚Äôd ask for some trix, the children would be happy to share their breakfast treat. but it was just as much fun to try and catch him in his silly disguises.   they remembered one afternoon, when they were snowboarding, the rabbit had dressed up as a snowman to try to get their trix. it almost worked too, for if little billy joe didn‚Äôt come over that ramp and knock the snowman‚Äôs head clean off with the snowboard, the rabbit may have very well gotten off with those trix!!   the rabbit had made up his mind. this is his day. he would get trix. those little monsters wouldn‚Äôt stand in his way anymore. they wouldn‚Äôt hold him back from getting what was rightfully his. he had a plan, and where he had failed before, here he would succeed.   the rabbit went to his room and opened the bottom drawer of his dresser, and pulled out his supercharged automatic custom nail gun. ‚Äúthose bastards are going to suffer if they get in my way again. no‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre going to suffer anyway, i‚Äôll be sure of it.‚Äù he said to himself as he turned off the safety and cocked the gun. he made his way for the exit to the world. no disguise this time‚Ä¶ just him, his gun, and all of those living corpses.   he made his way quickly to the soccer field where he knew the kids gathered every morning to play soccer. as he approached, the children took notice and stopped their game. all began to smile and laugh, while a few started pouring bowls of fruity goodness. the look on the rabbits face did not catch their attention, nor did the nail gun he was toting. little billy joe ran up to greet him, saying ‚Äúsilly rabbit! we can see right through your disguise!‚Äù   the rabbit stopped dead in his tracks, not even looking little billy joe in the eyes, but rather staring into the horizon. ‚Äúgive me the trix, you little fucker.‚Äù billy joe, while puzzled at the use of profanity, managed to stammer out ‚Äús-silly r-rabbit‚Ä¶ trix are for..‚Äù blam blam blam was the deafening roar from the nail gun the children heard next. little billy joes body was torn apart by the sheer force of the nails exiting the gun. they stuck in his body like pins in a pin cushion while his body still twitched.   the children all looked on in horror at what they had just seen. could this really be the fun loving rabbit that would always try to trick them out of their breakfast cereal? if he had just asked! now, now look what he had done to little billy joe! none of them could move as fear held its grip. what would become of them? just as all of these thoughts had entered their minds, the rabbit opened fire again, unleashing hell upon the field. ‚Äúthis is your fault! you made me do this! i hate you all you little monsters! why couldn‚Äôt you just share? every single one of you had a box of sweet, delicious trix, and none of you ever even offered me anything! you‚Äôre nothing but rabbit hating bigots, but now‚Ä¶ now you all die! see you in hell, mother fuckers!‚Äù   when all was said and done, and the rabbit was out of nails to fire, bodies were strewn across the field, and the land was stained red the likes of which would probably never wash out. the smell of blood filled the air, as the nail gun kept spinning. the rabbits voice was a slowly dying scream as the last bit of air exited his lungs. corpses with the look of horror laid on the ground, and one could swear they were still trying to get away. some children had been nailed against nearby trees, some of them still breathing. they would surely die soon enough.   the rabbit looked out on the field, surveying his kills. he seemed content, but a stern look still masked his face. one dying child crawled up to him, grabbed his leg, and looked up at him. the child pleaded ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù   ‚Äúbecause i can.‚Äù was the rabbits answer before bludgeoning the child‚Äôs head with the nail gun. finally. finally trix would be his. there was nothing that stood between him and the sweet, fruity morsels. the stench of death would make his first bite all the sweeter. victory was in his grasp. he reached out to the nearest box with trembling hands. he picked it up and stroked it lovingly. ‚Äúmine, all mine.‚Äù he repeated to himself, shedding a tear of happiness.   his ears caught the sound of a snapping twig behind him. he stopped and stood up-right, but he did not turn around. ‚Äúsilly rabbit. trix are for kids.‚Äù came a voice so icy cold, it could be contained by one type. the rabbit turned around. he was right. a goth. she stood only 4‚Äô in height, dressed in all black, with jet black hair down to her shoulders, light skin indicating the sun was a foreign to her as sanity to the rabbit. ‚Äúsilly rabbit.‚Äù, she repeated, ‚Äútrix are for kids.‚Äù   the rabbit cringed, ‚Äúshut up! shut up shut up!!‚Äù, he screamed as he dove for his nail gun. quickly he remembered it was out of ammo, and instead started bashing the goth girl. she eventually fell over in a heap of blood. the rabbit turned around, and breathed a sigh of relief.   ‚Äúsilly rabbit.‚Äù cold sweat started forming on his brow now. she was dead. he killed her, just like he killed all of the other children. how could she still be alive? he faced her again. the goth girl had a stupid grin on her face as she ran her tongue across her lips, licking off the blood. ‚Äútrix are for kids.‚Äù the rabbit lunged at her, knocking them both over. he sat on her chest and punched her while she laughed like a lunatic. the rabbit punched until she fell silent and limp. he stood up and started walking back towards the trix. it didn‚Äôt matter anymore. she could get up again and he would not care. he would merely eat the trix.   ‚Äúsilly rabbit.‚Äù the rabbit stopped dead in his tracks. she couldn‚Äôt be. why was she saying that. why wouldn‚Äôt she shut up? why cant he get his trix? why? he turned around. ‚Äúwhy wont you die?!‚Äù he lunged at her again. the goth sidestepped and the rabbit fell. goth girl was upon him as swift as the night. before he knew it, the rabbit was in a lock that with one move, the goth could snap his neck. ‚Äúplease,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúplease, let me have just one taste.‚Äù   ‚Äútrix are for kids.‚Äù she said, before snapping his neck. all faded to black for him. he never got to taste the trix. he never got what he wanted. in the end, he was a failure. if only he had just asked‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",1,-1,

973332,"yeah, i realized around 12 or 13 that i didn't care for babies and could never see myself as a mother. when i was around 8-10 i was always overly eager to play with my older cousins' friends' babies, i actually once accidentally dropped a four month old boy on his head!   the baby was fine, i was scolded far more harshly than i reasonably should have been, and after that, i was pretty much terrified of infants. like, i felt like i was going to hurt them just by looking at them. that fear eventually subsided, and i realized that babies were just screeching shit factories, and i wanted no part of that.  the point really got driven home for me around 14 years old. freshmen year of high school, we had a new girl in our communications/speech class. the next week we had to do our ""informative speeches"" we were always encouraged to make posters/bring in props, that sort of thing.  new girl brings in her three-month old daughter. and tells us a genuinely heart-wrenching story about her own crappy childhood, falling in love with an older man who convinced her to give up her virginity, without protection! she got pregnant the first time she ever had sex, the baby daddy said he'd take care of them and it would all be okay, and surprise surprise, he left her before the child was even born.  she said she loved her daughter, but she knows she made a mistake. and that the life she wanted for herself is gone now, because of this baby. she encouraged all of us to get on bc and use condoms, if we're going to be sexually active. all of the boys were like ""yep. clap clap clap. great speech."" i was one of the only girls that clapped along with them...most of the other girls were disgusted that she'd think of her child as anything less than a ""blessing from jesus"" and she was a ""nasty whore"" for getting pregnant in the first place.  that new girl only came to classes at my high school a few more times, and i don't know what happened to her. if she transferred, just dropped out. i wouldn't be surprised if the poor girl never did finish high school, because she had practically no one else to help her raise her daughter.  by the end of that freshmen year of high school, two girls whom i'd been friends with since fourth grade ended up pregnant. dropped out. they added me on facebook or whatever years ago, and they never went back to any sort of education and just got married and became baby factories with i think, three kids each now.   at the time that those first couple of girls got pregnant, it was such a shock to the whole class...by 11th grade, it was more like ""hahaha guess who's pregnant this week!!!"" i graduated in 2005, from a small school, my graduating class was only about 170 kids, and at least six of these girls were pregnant at graduation. that's not even counting all the girls who never even made it to graduation, because they dropped out to go have their babies in 10th or 11th grade. fuck, let me think about it for a second...i knew about 12 or 13 girls that ended up having babies by the time we graduated.   that's a baker's dozen of lives full of potential that i saw squashed, before these girls could even legally drive or vote! when that first poor girl from communications class showed us her child in 9th grade, most girls made fun of her for being a ""whore""...a few of those girls ended up getting pregnant themselves a year or two later. it happened to social outcast girls, it happened to athlete and cheerleader girls. rich girls and poor girls. my friends and i would joke that a ""baby bump"" was the hottest new fashion accessory at school.   so, as a 26 year old adult, i barely even relate to childless people my own age who say ""it's sooo weird"" that all their friends are having children on purpose. i saw so many teenagers i'd grown up with get knocked up before i turned 18, the news that someone i knew was pregnant was no longer shocking/interesting. i have a couple of coworkers and acquaintances that have children, but luckily, none of my super close-friends have hopped on the baby train. i think most of them share the desire to remain child-free.  as a female, especially getting a little older, i do have the occasion where i see a baby and i think ""omg so cute totally want one!!"" but then i shake my head, and say ""stfu biological clock, we've got better shit to do!"" ugh...the idea of just being pregnant, dragging that around for the better part of a year, all the medical complications that can happen, then either ruining my vagina or getting my stomach slashed open, then the whole mess of bullshit that comes after that, for the next at least 20 years....yeah. no thanks.  i moved back in with my parents a while back, and my mom often babysits her great-nephew (my cousin, i guess. i don't know, it feels weird to me to call a small child my cousin, i always want to call him my nephew, even though he's not)...his mother is my age, my cousin is almost 40. she never wanted him (the baby, nor a serious relationship with my cousin). she didn't. she wanted an abortion.   i love the little sucker now that he's born, and been a part of the world for five years, but i don't understand why this girl couldn't stand her ground and make her own decision, and not let some jerk she'd been sleeping with that happened to knock her up make it for her.   she's not in the picture anymore. she sees her son a few times a year, it's sort of sad...but...ehhhh. she's a shitty person for a lot of other reasons, but her decision to just stay out of her son's life is not one of the reasons i do not like her. my cousin is a fucking asshole to women, he's been married four times, they all left, simply because he's a dick. a son is all he ever wanted. he doesn't want the wife that goes along with it. sometimes i wonder how different their situation would be if his baby-momma had had a girl instead. he probably would have dumped her and sent her ass home while she was still pregnant.   i digress...anyway...i like my little cousin and all, he is very cute and smart and says funny things sometimes. but i can only handle being around him for like, ten-twenty minutes at a time, tops. i'm awkward around kids. i have no idea what the fuck he's babbling about, i have nothing to say in response. i don't give a fuck about his tonka trucks and hot wheels and don't care to pretend to be interested in playing with them.  i ended up getting into a fight with my mother the other day. i had the day off work, so i wanted to sleep the fuck in. but mom decides to babysit for my cousin. so it's all just weeeeeeee babble babble crash pitterpatter of running, hey tia! hey tia! hey tia! where's keelabee!? i like her! i like her hair! tia! tia! weeeeee!!!! let's play trucks!!! ....i laid in bed and just turned up my white-noise machine and tried to tune him out and fall back asleep for about an hour. nope. he's too fucking loud. so, i am actually out of bed several hours earlier on my fuckin' day off, than i would have been if i'd had to work, and little cuz wasn't at the house.  i guess he was more energetic than usual (honestly, this kid is usually pretty fuckin' chill), and he was driving ""tia"" up the goddamn wall. she sees i'm up and says ""oh look! here's keelabee! maybe she'll play trucks with you!"" i said ""yeahhh...maybe...lemme get a shower first."" i take a shower, and he's at my heels, going on and on about the sinkhole at the corvette museum and i'm like ""uh huh....uh huh.... coooooollll. yeah buddy. uh huh. i don't know."" this is about the extent of all i have to say to small children.   i get something to eat from the kitchen and head back toward my room. my mom follows me back there, and asks me to come back out and read him stories and play cars with him and blah blah. i was just straight up like ""nah, i'm good."" she starts in with some lecture about how i need to ""pitch in!"" i just said ""uhhh, he's not my kid and i'm not the one who volunteered to babysit him for free, anytime. that's why his dad called you and not me.""  i told my mom a long time ago i never want to have children. and her response has pretty much always been ""good."" she and i don't really get along all that well, never have. we both know i am irresponsible, one of the reasons i choose to remain child-free (and my mother is glad that i do) is because i don't want to force my parents to raise another infant at 50-60 years old, because my shit is nowhere near together enough to take care of a kid, even if i wanted one! yet every time lil cuz is at the house, she expects me to drop whatever i am doing and help her with him. i'll hang out, listen to his babble and give him a hug and be sweet for a couple minutes...but she doesn't understand that that is literally all i can handle.  ha...sorry. this turned into kind of a diatribe. i actually just discovered this sub yesterday, felt good to get that rant off my chest.   op, just wanted you to know that it is perfectly normal to decide you wanna be cf at a young age, don't ever let anyone else try to change your mind. if your feelings change as you get older, that is perfectly normal too. just no matter what, make sure the decision is your own. never let parents or some asshole boyfriend try to force you into something you do not want! it's your body, do what you want!!",1,-2,

886778,"""so, when father died--"" he began.  ""step-father,"" his mother corrected.  her eyes were glassy and moist.  ""i see,"" devon said.  she had finally gone and said it.  he was not related to him by blood.  what he suspected all those years, what he had secretly hoped for during the beatings, and all the fantasies his childhood cried out for just to get a moment of peace... it was actually true.  he was surprised he was in shock.  why would i be surprised, he asked himself?  ""please understand that we never told you the truth because... well, to protect you.""  ""father beat me mercilessly.  i and my brothers--"" devon felt that word stick in his throat.  ""--step-brothers... no, half-brothers--""  devon's mother wept.  as her son looked into her face, she slowly started to shake her head.  ""no,"" she mouthed, for her voice stopped before it reached her lips.  devon's skin crawled with surprise.  the tingling spread to his stomach, where he felt like he was going to fall from the kitchen chair.  ""you're not... "" he could barely say the words himself.  ""no,"" said his uncle.  ""no, they were not your biological parents.  before you judge them too harshly, please listen to what i am about to say.""  deven was numb, but managed to nod.  ""they are your parents.  they raised you as one of their own from infancy.""  ""so who are my real--""  ""they are.  they are as real as it gets.  just because they are not from her womb or his seed--""  devon held his hand up.  ""please... just... don't...""  his uncle grabbed his hand.  ""in 1972, you were a child in a very dangerous situation.  you had to be rescued, saved, and hidden away.""  ""from whom?  who are my real--i mean, biological... parents?""  his uncle and mother exchanged nervous glances.  ""you were the child of friends of the family.  very nice people, if not a little... experimental.  they came from an old family that were pretty isolated in the foothills.  we met them because they exchanged agricultural goods with a commune we used to live on.  it was forbidden by their family for them to talk to us, but we started making progress as allies.  they were a young couple, barely out of their mid teens.  arranged marriage, but they seemed happy.  soon they started telling us secrets of their family.  members of a strange cult that dated back to the 1600s.  all the children were genetically bred according to a series of laws dealing with astrology, birthright, and abilities.""  devon nodded.  he wondered if this was real.  ""the more we knew them, the stranger it got.  they were convinced they had psychic powers.  but they had made a mistake contacting and being friendly with outsiders, and they feared for the safety of their unborn child.  when their child was born, he was to be sacrificed because he was a male born under ... the wrong stars or whatever... i was never really clear what woo-doo foo-foo hoo-hoo they believed.  but when she went into labor... your biological mother, that is... she was at our commune, on our land.  we delivered the baby... you, but she made us promise to say the baby was stillborn.  so we did.  i mean... your mother and i... were a bunch of crazy young kids.  barely out of our teens ourselves.  we agreed, and we never saw your parents again.  we don't know what happened to them.""  devon was stunned.  ""are you sure... i mean... is this... real?""  ""your mother wanted to leave you this when you got of a certain age.  i had forgotten about it until your father, the one you grew up with, died.  he knew, i mean, that the baby was adopted.  he was already engaged to be married to her.  i had no such entanglements.  but my sister asked me about this small bundle your mother left you for when you grew up.""  his uncle gave him a small plastic grocery bag that was wrinkled and brittle with age like it had been stuffed in a forgotten corner of a cupboard for decades.  inside was a hand-woven blanket and some strange objects.  a bible where the pages were blank.  a small stone knife made out of a green material like jade.  and a necklace made out of a diameter of wood with some pictographic symbols of a deer and a snake.  ""i couldn't figure them out, either.  a blank journal--""  ""it's a bible.""  ""eh?  how do you figure?""  devon didn't know why he thought that, but quickly said, ""it has a cross on it.""  ""oh.  heh, not much of a bible without words.""  ""maybe not.  the knife has some kind of religious ritual significance, along with the necklace.""  his uncle's brow furrowed.  ""i see.""  ""i... i have a lot to sort out,"" devon said, wrapping the items up.  ""i'll be at the hotel if you need me.  mother?  mom?""  his mother looked up.  ""i'll be okay.  it's just that the wake wore me out.""  devon nodded.  ""get some rest.  i'll be by in the morning to check on you and uncle jim.""  the evening mist was already dotting the blades of lawn grass with silver drops as devon made his way back to his rental car.  a cold snap at the end of summer, he thought.  a tribute to father.  he tossed the bundle in the passenger's side as he closed the door behind him.  the rental car door shut with a clunk that sealed him in like the door of a new fridge.  devon didn't remember the ride back to the small motel 6 near the edge of town.  he parked the car, took the bundle, and retired back to his spartan hotel room.  with the motel cable blaring some religious channel in the background, devon investigated the knife.  as he handled it, he felt like he was in a circle of linked arms, all murmuring something.  he put the knife down, and picked up the necklace.  a snake and a deer.  his head felt heavy and his eyes couldn't focus.  devon relined back on the uncomfortable bed, his mind racing with memories of childhood beatings, the funeral, his mother, and what uncle jim had said.  ""cut the skin, bleed the wound, touch the stars, and feel the moon.""  devon woke up.  who had said that?  he looked at the tv, and it was showing an infomercial for some green, non-stick frying pans.  his cell phone said 2am.  he must have dozed off.  absently, he chewed at a hangnail and pulled a little too far back.  even at 42, devion always bit his nails, and his fingertips seemed ragged, childlike, and stunted.  the edge of his nailbed grew pink, and then turned red as blood slowly pooled.  he licked the blood without thinking, and then heard a rattling on the table.  the knife was vibrating.  ""cut the skin, bleed the wound, touch the stars, and feel the moon.""  devon took the knife, and felt the presence of linked arms once again.  his mind raced with symbols.  slowly, he touched the tip of the dull knife to the dot of blood on his finger.  there was a roar of wind.  it was 1972.

""i don't understand... give me my baby!""  there was a gunshot.  then more.  there was screaming.  then silence.  devon's nose wrinkled in anger.  an entire family, slaughtered.  siblings torn apart.  thousands of years of family wiped out in an instant.  how many were left?  how many kids taken away by the sheriff?  where were they?  ""i must find my brothers and sisters!"" he shouted into the room.  the only answer was the tv set exclaiming a double set of pans for the same price if you pay for extra shipping and handling.  devon put on his necklace and stuffed it under his tee-shirt.  he put the knife under his jeans waistband, and opened the door to head out to the car.

""you stole holy artifacts from our land, slaughtered our people, and for what--""  ""easy, devon, or i may have to put one more of your kin in the ground.""  devon didn't take his eyes off the gun, but relaxed his stance.  ""now... folks around here tell tales of some mysterious blond-haired, blue eyed indians that grew up near here.  seems they discovered the key to immortality.""  ""how many of my kind are left--""  uncle jim quickly pointed the gun right between devon's eyes with a sure and steady hand.  ""i ask the questions.  now.  it seems that when one of these... blond savages holds those pretty ornaments, they get all wild in the eyes.  and that's when i have to shoot the motherfuckers.  the last two went all batshit crazy.  not sure how immortality works with your kin, but it ain't resistant to lead.  so tell me, devon... how do your people work?""  devon trembled.  the memories of both his parents were in his mind now.  foolish locals didn't understand the immortality was not by flesh, but my tribe memory.  as it had in the days past, in the old country, before they crossed by ship.  his grandparent's memories and their grandparents memories and so on filled his mind with a rich froth of knowledge.    uncle jim shook his head and chuckled.  ""the silent treatment, huh?  well..."" he gasped, and pulled down on the trigger.  ""to answer your question, we got a few of your kin left.  adoptions, fosters, and so on.  found out the connection to those objects by accident.  how and why isn't important.  but you tell me the magic of your people and i'll--""  uncle was gun off by a gunshot that blew off half his head.  standing in the dim light just beyond the parking lot was a red-haired girl with a rifle.  devon knew her instantly.

""you ready to find the others?"" his sister said, opening up the door of her pickup with a rusty squeak. ""or wait for the cops?""    devon's life began anew.",1,,1
706923,"**part 4**    10. because of his tax proposals?  joe biden said the rich should be ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù and be willing to be taxed at higher rates.   currently the top 1% of income earners pays 37% of our income taxes.  the top 10% pay 2/3 of our taxes.  the bottom 50% only pays 3%.  about 38- 40% pay no taxes.  so how do 95% of us come out with fewer taxes in an obama presidency?  perhaps america would be stronger if we all could be a little bit ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù, instead of hiring a government to redistribute the nation‚Äôs wealth?  how about capital gains taxes?  obama has stated he would increase capital gains taxes on investments from 15% to 28%.  history shows the nation‚Äôs revenue strongly increases when capital gains taxes are cut, and vice versa.  if obama is elected, expect a huge sell-off of investments before he can change the law.  social security taxes will no longer be capped at $102,000 of income.  taxes on dividends  would increase from 15% to 30%.  over half of americans have some investments, plus retirement plans.  corporate taxation  sounds good, but corporations do not pay tax ‚Äì they simply adjust their prices so we pay their taxes for them.   already, many companies (jobs) and huge amounts of capital have left our shores due to high taxation.  obama pledged to cut taxes when he ran for the u.s. senate, but has voted for increased taxes or against tax cuts 90+ times.  he says he will cut programs that are not needed in order to find the money he needs for his agenda.  if he does, he will be the first politician (especially in his party) in known history to keep that promise.  he will also have to effectively buck his own party, an action for which he has no precedent.    11. because he is transparent?  it is extremely difficult to get information about his past.  his college records are sealed at occidental college, columbia university and harvard.  we cannot get access to his theses.  it is reported that he did write on the soviet union and disarmament???  we don‚Äôt know about his associations or how he paid for his expensive schooling.  there is a lawsuit, brought by phillip berg, a lifelong and active democrat, that claims he is not a natural born citizen, and therefore ineligible for the presidency.  his kenyan grandmother talks about being in the delivery room when he was born in kenya, while obama and his sister recall two different hospitals in hawaii where he claims to have been born.  he was registered for school in indonesia, where he attended for five years, as an indonesian citizen and a muslim.  indonesia did not recognize dual citizenship.  if he is a natural born citizen it seems he would release the documentation to authenticate his claims, particularly since this story seems to be gaining momentum.  at least one of his available birth documents has adobe references, and is therefore suspect.    12. because of his proposed agenda (if he has the house and senate, as well as the executive branch, it could happen very quickly)?          1. expand the inheritance tax          2. weaken the patriot act          3. weaken the military          4. curb anti-terror wire-tapping          5. extend health and social security benefits to illegal immigrants          6. provide in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants          7. increase the number of illegal immigrants allowed into the u.s.          8. weaken education standards          9. expand health costs and force rationing of medical services (especially to the elderly)         10. pass a bill to fund the fight against global poverty (obama wrote and sponsored the global poverty act (s. 2433) which calls for  the us to spend 0.7 percent of our gross national product on foreign aid, which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $845 billion over and above what the us already spends.         11. pass the freedom of choice act (foca), which will set aside all the pro-life gains since roe v. wade.  he famously said he would not want his daughters to be punished with a baby if they were to become pregnant.         12. repeal the defense of marriage act (doma), which defines marriage as being exclusively between one man and one woman.  it currently permits states to not honor any same-sex marriage performed in another state.          13. employment non-discrimination act (enda) is similar to the civil rights act, except it pertains to sexual orientation.  the sponsors have removed ‚Äútransgender‚Äù (for now); as enda narrowly failed to pass by 50-49 on previous tries.         14. hate crime legislation.  this should provide ample incentives for criminals to attack only elderly, heterosexual caucasians to avoid the bonus penalties (a bit of sarcasm).         15. if we are fortunate, we can keep our guns.  obama said, ‚Äúwe can have reasonable, thoughtful gun control measures that i think respects the second amendment and people‚Äôs traditions. ‚Äú  maybe if we register our guns ‚Äì the first step in taking our guns ‚Äì and solemnly promise not to ever shoot them (there i go again, being sarcastic).         16. and don‚Äôt forget the socialist agenda:  ‚Äúfrom each according to ability, to each according to his needs‚Äù.          17. driver licenses for illegal aliens (what part of ‚Äúillegal‚Äù does he struggle with?)  i think 7 of the 9/11 terrorists had drivers licenses.  driver‚Äôs licenses can be used for identification, including at the voting place.         18. supports human cloning.  remember dolly, the sheep that was cloned?  its cloned offspring only lived three years, because its dna started out as 6-year old dna by the time it was born.  other cloned animals have not had a good track record and have suffered early and often unpleasant deaths.         19. obama supports 1) homosexual education for very young students, 2) judges who are not strict constructionists, 3) transporting minor girls across state lines to receive abortions, 4) legislation requiring business to favor homosexuals, 5) gay pride celebrations.         20. obama opposes 1) traditional marriage, 2) drilling for oil, 3) protecting live babies that result from botched abortions, 4) parental rights in education.         21. appoint 2-3 activist judges to the supreme court, plus replacing george bush‚Äôs many nominations, that can‚Äôt get an up or down vote in the senate, with his own selections.         22. implement the ‚Äúfairness doctrine‚Äù for talk radio, which will seriously curtail conservative talk radio.  the liberal talk radio shows have consistently failed, even when heavily subsidized.  note that msm, internet and other outlets that favor the left are not targets of ‚Äúfairness‚Äù.  controlling the message that reaches the voters will be virtually complete, thus helping perpetuate the politics of the left.     well that‚Äôs it!!  i know i could do better if i had more time and talent, but i hope this is effective enough to make my case.  i wish i could share this with a lot of people who don‚Äôt have the time or interest to check out the candidate of ‚Äúchange‚Äù and hope.   obama has said this is a great country. he also wants to change it!!  maybe we should listen.    love, dad",0,,

530649,"&gt;a man who wants his own child? that's like finding a four leafed fucking clover because all men are women beating scumbags who like to kickdogs and fuck every random hole that they can find.  you're really reaching there, ann. you specified an ""unwanted"" baby and that ""most"" not ""some"" men would welcome such a responsibility. i doubt it. i certainly don't think most women welcome unwanted pregnancy, although i'm sure some do. i think most men would be pretty upset to discover they had suddenly become fathers, and that they'd done so with a mother who didn't want a role in the raising of the child. that would be a normal and human reaction, not a uniquely male reaction. i think you give people too much credit by assuming that ""most"" people of any gender would be glad to have an unplanned baby.   perhaps my perception is colored by my own feelings about children (don't want any), but i don't think it has to do with gender. i think fathers are wonderful. i love to see fathers with their children-- i don't like kids much, but there's something about a father caring tenderly for a child that just triggers every ""awww!"" neuron in my brain. i call my own father for advice on just about everything. my niece doesn't have a father in her life, and i think that's terribly sad.  &gt;a crime that most likely wouldn't have happened.  that's debatable; [statistics show that safe haven laws reduce newborn deaths.](http://www.thefreelibrary.com/safe+haven+law+effective+abandoned-baby+deaths+have+fallen+since+%2701,...-a0145086079)  &gt;ok, so men don't get to be protected from lying women? wheres the equality there?  i think where a newborn is involved, the newborn's rights to life and opportunity come first, then the parents' rights, equally, come directly afterward. for reasons of biology, it is easier and more often possible to protect the rights of a mother than a father, since it is impossible for a woman to give birth to a child that's not hers, except in the case of planned surrogacy.  i would support giving a man who suspects he may be the father of a child the right to have performed, at his expense, a dna paternity test, so long as if the child has been adopted, the adoptive parents' identities are not revealed unless the test proves he is the biological father.  it would be nice if babies were born with little tags on their toes showing the name of the father. but that's not how it works, and any complete legal solution to that problem would be such a massive invasion of parents' privacy as to be unconstitutional, in my opinion.   the best protection from a lying woman is not to have unprotected sex with people you can't trust.  an idea: anonymous notification of potential fathers of a child could be suggested, using numbers to protect the identity of the child, mother, and adoptive parents (in the case of a child who has been adopted). when a safe haven law is used by a mother, she could be asked to disclose the name of any man who could be the father, with the assurance that her identity and identifying information like address or phone number will not be released without her consent. then the authority taking custody of the child would be able to contact each man listed and offer him the opportunity to give dna for paternity testing. if the biological father comes forward, then he would have the opportunity to take custody.  &gt;do you really believe the myth that these safe haven laws save babies lives?  see link above.  &gt;not that sad. the world doesn't need more people in it.   wait, hold on, am i really arguing this with someone who doesn't think the loss of human life is sad?  &gt;what makes you think that would change all of the sudden?  the type of impulsive personality that wouldn't make plans for a baby before its birth is the type who would impulsively abandon a baby in a dumpster. safe haven laws provide an outlet that can be used equally impulsively, but which is safer than abandonment.",1,1,2

937717,"couldn't find the story of the 12 year old girl, but here's one of a 13 year old girl: http://jonathanturley.org/2008/06/01/13-year-old-girl-reportedly-lies-about-age-leading-to-statutory-rape-conviction-twice/  childhood sexuality: http://www.ethicaltreatment.org/research.htm  http://www.ipce.info/booksreborn/martinson/infant/infantandchildsexuality.html  &gt;it is good to let all children (not only those brought to the clinician with behavior problems) speak for themselves about their own sexuality. in the preceding pages i have let children--infants through preadolescents--speak for themselves as much as possible with only the minimum of required interpretation. i have been constantly aware and motivated by the desire to provide an alternative, a balance so to speak, to the preponderance of works that have stressed the pathology in infant and child sexuality. these works often contain direct testimony from children with serious sexual problems who have been referred to child guidance clinics or private practitioners. this limited testimony from a small sample of atypical children supports a heavy superstructure of professional analysis, interpretation, and generalization. my role has been that of organizer and facilitator--giving the young a chance to speak, and arranging their comments under appropriate topics and headings. of course, not all children in the united states have spoken here, not even a representative sample, but a significant segment nevertheless. the statements of the young in the three preceding chapters represent the ebb and flow of human sexual experience among no less than 300 children brought up in a moderately repressive society.  &gt;our culture has gone to great extremes to emphasize the contrast in sexual nature between the child and the adult. the child is seen as sexless; the adult cherishes and esteems his sexual virility. rather than continuous conditioning from infancy on, we practice discontinuous conditioning as far as sexual development is concerned. the ""sexless"" child is expected to revise his attitudes toward his body and its erotic-genital potential almost totally as he passes from child to adult roles. this is especially true of the male, for we expect aggressive behavior from adult males. hence, adult activity demands traits that are interdicted in children. all too often, the child's natural curiosity in the area of sex is discouraged, inhibited, and denied by well-meaning but ill-advised parents. the infant is not permitted to explore sex matters as he is permitted to explore other areas in which he has potential and curiosity. the child's interest in the naked body is labeled indecent, questions are put off, false or silly answers are given to serious inquiries. all this serves to drive normal and natural sexual curiosity into secrecy, duplicity, and despair.  &gt;nevertheless, some children discover, one way and another, that they can produce pleasant and soothing sensations by stroking or touching their bodies. the taboo on self-discovery and self-stimulation may be the chief channel through which sexual repression is passed from parent to child. there is no evidence that self-stimulation does physical damage to the child. masturbation is an important phase of sex maturing--a part of the growing up process and not a dangerous habit.  &gt;besides being permissive towards self-discovery and development, parents and others could do much better than they are doing in helping the child to conceptualize his body, its parts, and its functions. there is no reason to encourage children to form infantile, over-simplified, and incorrect sexual concepts through offering them false, deceptive, inadequate, and foolish information about sexuality. children have the capacity to deal with accurate sexual concepts. the parent who is doing his best to give his child an opportunity to understand himself, to express himself, and to share in the normal experiences of intimate human life, is making a significant contribution to the humanness, the health, and the happiness of his child.  &gt;hopefully, self-discovery, the touching and caressing by parents, siblings, and peers, and the release from feelings of sexual guilt and shame over the expression of innocent and honest affection will lead to richer interpersonal relationships.  and to show that no harm comes from kids having sex and that it's just a cultural thing:  &gt;coitus or attempted coitus does take place among preadolescents in american society, although such behavior is generally taboo. there are societies that are considerably more permissive. sexual life begins in earnest among the trobrianders at six to eight years for girls and ten to twelve for boys. sex play includes masturbation, oral stimulation of the genitals of the same and opposite sex, and heterosexual copulation. at any time a couple may retire to the bush, the bachelors' hut, an isolated yam house, or any convenient place and there engage in prolonged sexual play. among the ila-speaking peoples of africa this age is regarded as a time of preparation for adult life and mature sexual functions. it is reported that there are no virgins among these people after the age of ten. the lepcha of india believe that girls will not mature without the benefit of sexual intercourse. (ford and beach, 1951, p. 191). early sex play among boys and girls characteristically involves many forms of mutual masturbation and usually ends in attempted copulation. by the time they are eleven and twelve years old, most girls regularly engage in sexual intercourse.  &gt;ramsey (1943) reports that the preadolescent sexual encounters of boys with girls in his united states' sample (when they did occur) most frequently involved manual manipulation associated with direct observation of each other's body. exhibitionistic sex play was the next most frequent type of behavior. other forms of play included attempts at intercourse and oral contacts. approximately 33 percent of the boys reportedly had attempted intercourse before adolescence. the frequency of preadolescent heterosexual encounters of various kinds as reported by 286 of the boys was as follows:  &gt; no experience	34%  &gt; 1 to 5 times	27%  &gt; 6 to 15 times	15%  &gt; 16 to 25 times	8%  &gt; 26 to 50 times	7%  &gt; above 50 times 9%  &gt;the number of different females involved with each boy in the preadolescent heterosexual encounters were reported as follows:  &gt; no experience	34%  &gt; 1 to 5 females	47%  &gt; 6 to 15 females	9%  &gt; 16 to 25 females	5%  &gt; 26 to 50 females	3%  &gt; more than 50 females	3%  &gt; (ramsey, 1943, p. 227)  &gt;the ages of the female partners of the preadolescent boys who participated in such encounters were in 80 percent of the cases within one year of the same age as that of the boy; in 11 percent of the cases the girls were two or more years older; and for the remaining 9 percent the partners were two or more years younger. the girls involved were usually neighborhood friends, female relatives, girls met during family visits, females of the same family, and occasionally an older girl or woman.  &gt;""probably one of the most significant factors in forming my sexual attitudes and actions was an instance with my cousin when he was twelve and i was nine. one day he, whom i admired more than anyone in the whole world, and i were playing on the bed when everyone else was out. in the course of our play we began to explore each other's bodies and to manipulate each other's genitals. this made us both a little uneasy, so we quit after a while and went into the living room. then one day we found ourselves playing in the basement on the bed. he asked me if i had ever been ""fucked"" before. i said no. then he said that it was really important that every boy be able to say that he had ""fucked"" a girl and would it be all right if he ""fucked"" me.""  this is an example of the way society views it and the psychological damage it can cause on kids doing something completely natural:  &gt;""we both had reached the ripe old age of twelve.... sexual experimentation was not new to me, nor to him.... we both left our houses that evening after dark and met secretly at the ""swamp road."" we kissed for awhile and both of us became increasingly excited. this led, in turn, to the unfastening of our clothes and the placement of his hand on my breast. gradually his little hand crept downwards, beneath my pants until he was gently stroking my mons veneris and clitoris. he wanted to ""finger"" me but i resisted firmly, as a girl had to draw the line somewhere! now he posed a rather surprising question. he wanted ""me"" to touch ""him."" he exposed his erect little penis and pulled my hand toward it. at the thought of touching it i trembled, but managed to do so. i think i was the first girl in seventh grade to actually ""feel out"" a boy as this was previously unheard of. we continued to mutually masturbate for a while and then i decided that it was time for me to go home. the significance of this encounter lies in the fact that for the first time, one of my common childhood sexual experiences had suddenly become really sexual and the action was tinged with my first feelings of guilt. i suffered a great deal following this incident for fear of losing my reputation.""  there are also a lot of examples from ancient rome, and even among some celebrities: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virginia_eliza_clemm_poe  the idea that children are not sexual, do not understand sex, or cannot consent to sex is a modern myth.  i'd rather not post photographs of fetuses masturbating, you can look that up on your own.",1,,-1

954777,"crossroads d&amp;d setting - tiar dragath  the mortals take their lead from the dragons... and translating dragon behavior to something mortals can do is *a bit interesting*. dragons are shape-shifters, and their lifespan without magical aid is about five centuries. to say that their logic doesn't translate cleanly to humans, and their descendant races, is a bit of an understatement.  sex and marraige ---  the dragons find the concept of monogamy quaint but unrealistic, and the idea of pairing up with someone for life *horrifying*. the dragons of tiar dragath take binding oaths *very* seriously, and giving one to remain sexually faithful to a single person and love them until one of you dies seems like a recipe for forcing yourself into committing homicide to maintain your honor.  the dragons acknowledge personality drift. someone can change *a lot* in a decade, and irreconcilable differences are all but guaranteed to appear within a century. so, dragons don't have an concept of marriage. their version of property-law doesn't need such a thing to exist, either.  humans, and the other vincahti (traveller/human subspecies) races that aren't killed on sight, don't have a concept of marriage either. having sex is seen a bit like eating: it's something your body needs to do in order to keep working right. as long as everyone involved is okay with it, it's okay.  family structure ---  before the unification, the dragons traditionally gave the responsibility of raising children to the region's elders. those would be the oldest, wisest, and strongest dragons. the younger generation handled getting food, and other requirements of their society.   of course, after the unification things changed a bit. now all young dragons are raised in the capitol by the keepers, under the watchful eyes of one of the elder lords. the keepers are dragons for whom child-raising is their entire vocation, while the elder lords are the dragon lords that have retired to the capitol.  the humans mimic this central child-rearing tradition, but it's not a bunch of elderly people keeping the kids under control. humans have a communal home for children in every settlement. it's looked over by a number of child keepers relative to the size of the settlement. when children are born, they're turned over to the keepers and are cared for locally until they're ready to travel. they're shipped off to a different settlement once they're old enough.  children old enough to be specialized get apprenticed to a local. unless it's impractical, they generally still live in the communal home and have to run to their master every day. their master teaches them during the day, and generally grooms the kid to take their place. when the kid reaches adulthood, they're generally allowed to move into their permanent residence... which varies based on their vocation.  dragonborn and dragon-blooded have a similar system, but they're less numerous. most dragonborn infants are cared for by their mother's retainers until ready to travel, and then they're sent to the capitol. they're educated there, and are groomed to become dragonborn knights. when a spot opens up for a estate to need a new heir, a young dragonborn gets sent to fill the position. the knight of that estate is expected to continue his new squire's education, since the squire is going to take the knight's place when they die.  dragon-blooded get raised in the communal homes like normal human children, but are sent to the capitol to be educated like a dragonborn when their magical aptitude appears and they're old enough to travel (normally at 5 or 7). they're always educated in magic, since a innate capacity for magic is the distinction between dragon-blooded and humans. they're also educated in other fields, like economics, so that they can serve as bureaucrats and advisers. they generally get attached to knights, but very promising dragon-blooded sorcerers get to serve a full dragon lord.  genasi get sent to the nearest monestary of the order of the burning storm. they're raised to become elemental monks, which serve a function similar to paladins in tiar dragath. they're a small minority. genasi don't usually reproduce due to their small population making it hard to meet each-other, even with all but a few of them being in the same monastic order, and lingering issues with mating with normal humans. they generally only occur when a human or dragon-blooded monk of the burning storm of sufficient power produces a child.  &gt; lingering issues  &gt; fire-aspected genasi have painful internal temperatures. water aspected genasi are very heavy. earth aspected genasi cause chafing like you wouldn't believe. air aspected genasi give off electrical discharges when excited, which usually aren't fatal but very painful.  most of the other mortal races don't get to live in tiar dragath. tieflings are thought of as being *very smart demons*, and are killed on sight. elves are seen as spies for the faeries, so they're killed on sight. changelings are seen as spies, and are killed on sight if they're detected. warforged don't exist in significant numbers and usually don't leave haven, but would probably be killed on sight as well.  taboos, rituals, and religion ---  taboos are pretty simple: don't have sex with someone from the same city you were born in, they might be a sibling. don't rape anyone, that's not nice. don't do anything that's going to get someone killed, that's not nice. don't be a disease vector, abstain until you can get a listener to cast a cure disease spell on you.  basically: don't be a dick when there's one involved, or when there's not.  homosexuality isn't frowned upon. the dragons are shape-shifters, and they liked to use ""a matched set"" when food pressures made reproducing a bit unwise. that's still there in the culture, and it bled down to the humans.  religion doesn't have much to say about sex, beyond reinforcing those taboos. there's nothing really built around fertility rituals, or seeing sex as a magical thing. that's mostly because infertility issues *aren't much of a problem* when the entire town *minus* those you share a birth-name with are options.  contraceptives ---  not in use by most people, but there is one floating around.  it's an alchemical concoction, which was devised by a dragonblooded sorcerer who was *really* sick of being pregnant. she managed to rig up something similar to modern-day hormonal birth-control, only it causes your body to produce the hormones at a level that won't screw with your head too much while still working. yay literal magic! it's a clear and tasteless liquid, a dosage lasts about three months, and it's fairly easy to make.  women in dedicated military vocations, and a handful of careers where being out of action for several months would be a pain in the ass to recover from, are nearly always on it. they get specialized diets, which the dragon-blooded sorcerers oversee. it's supposed to get removed from the diet if the national population drops significantly, but that's never happened.  beyond that, it's generally only given to people who would be in danger if they got pregnant, and is administered during some routine health checkups by the listeners. it's something of a state-secret.",1,,-1
361913,"my theory (from a well read ex-christian atheist):  five hundred years ago, christianity was very much like islam is today - full of mad zealots, the oppression of its women folk, the hatred and fear of any different culture/belief system etc.  we (the western/christian ""we"") used to be just like they are now, and it took us hundreds of years to slowly grow out of that phase (remember the crusades?). it seems to me that as a society/religion grows up, it loses some of its zeal and fanatacism. society becomes less about serving god and more about serving the society itself. in essence, the society becomes increasingly secularised.  we (again the western/christian ""we"") need to understand that islam (as a society and a religion) is 500 years younger than us. think about christian and islamic society as a pair of brothers (with judaism as the father if you want a complete metaphor). christianity is 20 years old whereas islam is only 15.  now consider what you used to think about 15 year olds when you were 20. ""damn punk teenaged little brats!!!"" then think about how much you changed between the ages of 15 and 20...  islam is just in its ""troubled idealistsic adolescent"" phase. christianity (on the whole) has been through that and come out the other side - older, wiser, more mature, but still with many embarassing memories of its own wild zealous teenage years. sooner or later islam is going to mature from an angry adolescent into a fully formed adult.  we (again the western/christian ""we"") have to decide what kind of big brother we are. sure islam might be pissed off at us at the moment, but he's a messed up teenager with more than a few angst issues. we've been there and got through it, so now we need to decide if we're the arsehole older brother who messes his little bros lfe up even more - or if we are the caring understanding older brother who knows what our younger sibling is going through and tries to be supportive, give guidance and provide forgiveness for their youthful indiscretions...",1,-1,1

142328,"everything was different now. i felt like i understood the 'why' i could never latch on to before. perspective was the key. the murderer, the mother, the rebel, the authority; society was as it was because these people felt justified in their actions. the contrast dial had been adjusted properly. the world was simultaneously so much brighter but also so much darker. and i had no one i could talk to this about. i tried. they didn't understand. the event had been imagined. kids couldn't comprehend these sorts of things. i was just acting out to seem more mature. in feeling more connected, i was somehow more alone than ever.  i don't remember having very many friends after that. not that i had scared away those i had, just that i simply stopped trying to fit into the social gimmickry of school. marbles, pogs... none of that mattered anymore. i felt creative. i commandeered my mother's word processor and began to write. it was nothing substantial, just ruminations and speculation about cultural policies and inventions that might make the world better. it was still kid stuff, no real regard for cost or resources calculated into things.  it was around this time i started having ""zone outs"". this was an entirely new problem. they were usually rather short, but i would have utter gaps in my waking memory. typically just a few seconds at a time, i couldn't remember what had happened around me during that time once i snapped out of it. but my awareness while i was ""gone"" was someplace else. i thought maybe they were flashbacks to the meditation flashout. i'd have brief recollections of being in someone else's point of view, first person. they were different each time, mostly meaningless. but as they got longer, i began to notice that the people around this person i was ""imagining"" myself to be would ask me what was wrong. this always brought me back to myself. even if no one around me had noticed, whoever i had been for a few seconds had noticed something different.  life continued, albeit, socially stunted. after what i imagine was considerable pressure from my paternal grandparents seeing me flounder in the care of my mother and hearing no positive development from a series of child psychologists about why i wasn‚Äôt acting like normal kids, i began to visit my father for a week or two during the summer. it wasn‚Äôt nearly as good as camp had been, and he tried desperately to make up for lost time in the way only an estranged older man who‚Äôd never latched onto the idea of fatherhood could. we went to naval museums, we browsed thrift shops for cheap tools, we went camping. all of his interests, trying to see where he and i fit together in the grand scheme of things. maybe he truly believed that how people act is more nature than nurture, as he certainly seemed to think i would like what he enjoyed *just because*.  i recall we had ended up in the basement of a library. this was still the early 90s, the computer lab was a series of dos boxes with monochrome screens a lovely fallout green and black crt. we‚Äôd gone down there to see about some math software. i‚Äôd played around on my dad‚Äôs computer on a previous visit, and the only thing he managed to get right was my lingering enthusiasm for technology. we sat in an otherwise unpopulated room with a series of computer stations in a white painted cinderblock room, i was trying to fuss through math drills but i was still unaccustomed to touch typing. and then another zone out struck.  this one was much more vivid than the times before. i was laying down on a bed, unfamiliar ceiling staring back at me. with no one around to jar me from my temporary displacement, i managed to realize i had control of this body. i rose from the bed and walked over to the large windows that seemed to line the adjacent wall. this appeared to be a hotel room, a bustling city i didn‚Äôt at all recognize sprawling out below as the room i was in seemed to be eight or more stories up. i steered myself to the bathroom, movement feeling a bit clumsy. turning on the lights, i found myself staring in the mirror and observing the visage of an older japanese man in a bath robe. it didn‚Äôt at all make sense. i didn‚Äôt remember any of this from the meditation event, i‚Äôd never dreamt of myself as someone else before.  and then i was back in the computer lab again, my father shaking my shoulder gently. my posture hadn‚Äôt changed; my hands were still on the keyboard, my head still level with the screen, though i had clearly missed a few exercises as they had gone by without me. this was the first time my father had seen me zone out like that. his concern was raised immediately. did these ‚Äúblack outs‚Äù occur often? no, not *that* often. they weren‚Äôt really black outs either. how does a kid barely in his teens explain to an adult that‚Äôs effectively a stranger that they hadn‚Äôt been themselves lately, literally?  i was only visiting him for a few weeks, yet he was concerned enough to put me into therapy while i was still visiting him. in perhaps the only appropriate thing he‚Äôd ever done, he took me to see someone he knew that was a counselor, but was not exclusively an youth counselor.  i didn‚Äôt bother venturing into the strangeness. instead, we went over why i had been in counseling before. lack of ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù sorrow, general lack of joy. how long had i been feeling like this? years and years. had i tried medications? a handful, but they never seemed to work. and then the preliminary diagnosis. dysthymia. or as the doctor put it ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been depressed for so long, that your brain chemistry has shifted to accept that as normal.‚Äù  that made a tragic amount of sense. i can‚Äôt really say i know where it began, but it certainly seemed to match up. happiness was more fleeting to me than other kids my age, social endeavors held little allure. i could go to the amusement park and spent a whole day having mostly fun, and have the ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù wear off by the time we walked back to the car in the parking lot. the diagnosis struck me a bit like benign cancer. it wasn‚Äôt something that was going to end my life, so it wasn‚Äôt something that was really worth treating.  attempts at shoving me into therapy stopped for a while after that. i don‚Äôt recall anyone in the family taking the news badly or offering extra support explicitly, but it did seem like my grandparents at least were now more concerned on spending time with me in the present rather than trying to sort out why i wasn‚Äôt quite normal.  soon after the attempts of therapy blew over, my gracious grandparents gifted me an extremely kind christmas present. fostering my interest in computers, i was given my grandfather‚Äôs old macintosh. it was a simple thing, mac os 7.1, a glorious 256 colors and barely 80mb of drive space. it was plenty though, to resume writing (the word processor had broken earlier), explore basic programming and exploring bbs systems before the web was much of a thing. i thought the majority of my adolescent problems were over. not quite.  it must‚Äôve been the following spring. i assume so because it was warm out and the sun wasn‚Äôt setting until well after 7 pm. effectively a latch key kid, the curfew of my friends did not really apply to me. as long as i got home before it was really, truly dark, that was all well and good. not because my mother seemed to care if i was out after dark, but because the winding streets of the mobile home park got rather spooky with the sparse street lights. the park in the center of the housing complex was where all of the kids traditionally hung out as there weren‚Äôt truly yards to speak of in the mobile home park.   i once used to defend it as a ‚Äúmanufactured housing complex‚Äù as they were all mostly double-wide homes set on foundations as opposed to trailers, but the effect was the same. lower middle class housing at best, blue collars just getting by with the help of food stamps at worst. for every small strip of grass and meager attempt to water a flower bed, there were fenced in yards filled with gravel and long since sun bleached and rain drenched children‚Äôs toys. for living on the edge of the silicon valley, these were not the homes of the best and brightest of a dot-com era about to take off. these were the cast offs that didn‚Äôt belong in the california life style, but had never gotten the motivation to move away and were gasping for air while treading water in the uniquely cali poverty line.  economics tangent aside, this was going to be another night where all the other kids with loving families and concerned parents had called them home for a hot dinner, and i was loitering around an empty park, not looking forward to another meal fresh from the freezer. and then she appeared.

570122,"&gt; children, on the other hand, are still forming their ideas of what's appropriate and what's real.  this would fall under the only case in which i grant harm is potentially possible, deception (or confusion i guess, since deception implies intent).    children, however, are done with deciding what is real by 2 or 3.  when they stop trying to grab things that are in the tv, they've already figured out what mommy and daddy don't know - tv might be fun, but whatever happens in the box isn't real.  &gt;if he sees this character repeatedly rewarded for behaving that way, and if he sees you apparently approving of his behavior, he can form an early opinion that this is appropriate and normal behavior.  i'm not sure what you mean by ""sees you apparently approving of his behavior"" and such?  i imagine i get what you mean though.  really, though, is this a big deal?  can this child not ask questions?  does this child go through life never interacting with other human beings except through watching a single tv show?  this is why kids should be encouraged to have experience with the world, it is what teaches them about the world.  what is on television teaches them about what is on television, something they figure out very very early on is not reliable (just look at childrens programming and tell me what kind of invalid retards we would be turning out if they thought the bizarre acid-fueled ""wonderland"" shown on those shows was real!).  so, absolute worst case scenario, your kid says something mysogynist, you correct them and explain yourself.  problem solved.  why do we need to get the guys with the guns involved, again?   &gt;neural connections in the brain strengthen every time a synapse is excited.  yes, but this is a bit deceptive.  you are ignoring the fact that, for instance, seeing a mysogynist on tv and being a mysogynist in real life light up two entirely different pathways.  neurally, things on tv and things in reality could not possibly be more greatly separated.  &gt;children form these connections much faster than adults. compared to adults, children form neural connections almost instantly.  they also lose them just as fast.  children make and destroy connections between concepts with lightning speed, this is how they learn.  being too greedy in childhood would handicap humanity and make us very very unadaptable as a people.  can you imagine what would happen if kids were limited to what they learned before age 18?  for 18 years they experience interacting with no fewer than a few dozen people, have everything they see, hear, or experience rigidly controlled and every second of their life micromanaged by paranoiacs.  they would be entirely unable to learn how to live.  as it is, they do still manage somewhat (though they end up much more immature than previous generations, as can be seen through, for example, their willingness to allow the esrb to censor their videogames without question).  &gt;watching adults on tv has been shown, repeatedly, to have the same effect.   where?  i don't believe this for a heartbeat.  if you show performing a task over and over, yes, the child will deduce how to perform the task themselves.  so what?  do we want to prevent our children from figuring things out?  why?  so what if they're figuring out how to stab someone to death?  this is a simple physical act anyone can figure out.  to believe they would draw the conclusion that people stab each other as a normal course of society?  that's arguing something entirely different and far more insane.  i don't care if kids think they know how to kill people from watching the fictional representations on tv.  i care whether the kids, by the time they are 12 years old, can say ""using force against people is wrong, and dangerous for human beings.  we rely on our rational thought processes to keep us alive and our social connections to enable us to achieve things.""    as cecille b demille famously said in the 30s, to believe in censorship you have to force the public to believe that to see evil is to desire it.  i don't buy it.  i can see people ""kill each other"" and it not matter more than if they were washing windows.  children can do the same.  it changes nothing.  &gt;as an adult, your mind isn't as susceptible - in a physical way - to what you see. your mind has grown.  ahh, this is a common point that comes up.  yes, our mind loses plasticity (though not all of it) when we reach adulthood.  what does this mean?  how does our brain grow?  our brain grows only through experience.  nothing else.  you remove experience, you remove the growth too.  you can't shelter kids entirely and expect them to grow up, they simply will not develop at all.  they will remain children.  if you, say, prevent them from having intense emotional experiences (intense enough to physically alter the structure of their brain) then they might never mature emotionally.  as an adult, my ability to experience sparse things, process them in relatino to my own beliefs and possibly later my beliefs in accordance depends upon my having been exposed to an absurd number of different ideas in my youth.  were i only exposed to a few, i might be led into a simplistic stupor by manipulative people.  people, and the world, are complex.  the job of parents, and society, is to turn children into adults.  not to shelter them and allow them to grow into larger children.  we do savage harm if we attempt this, which is what we are currently doing in this bizarre culture of child worship.  being a child is something to grow out of.  being a capable, free adult is what people should aspire for, not being a limited, misunderstanding, controlled child.  there are things in this world which actually hurt children.  fighting in front of your kids is one of them.  actual violence hurts kids.  we can see this neurologically, victims of the constant stress of growing up in a domestic abuse situation have far less neural development than others their own age.  seeing fake violence on tv has no relationship to this.  none.  at best, communication mediums (everything from tv to videogames to poetry to books to paintings to comic books to the internet) may suggest new ideas, new concepts, new images, etc.  this is always good for a human being.  regardless of the content of the images.  images and ideas cannot hurt.",1,1,

402033,"while my maternal aunt got pregnant at 47 (&amp; lost baby, like my parents she too is long gone) i'll be 49 in february. i am sure i am already peri-menopausal &amp; 51 (average age of menopause) is pretty soon.  but really not upset about not having babies (more relieved actually &amp; looking forward to menopause and not having to worry about babies, pregnancy &amp; motherhood). don't know for sure how my late parents felt about not being grandparents but i somehow instinctively knew (maybe around age 5?) that i would not be 'birthing no babies' myself.   i do remember vividly asking my mother (at the ripe old age of 8) if she would be okay if she was not a grandma and at the time she said yes. i took her at her word. neither of them ever pressured me much about that (or getting married), they were probably nervous to do so (i am a strong personality in my own right, heck i had to be to get along with my stubborn parents).  i am not averse to partnering with someone who already has kids (and the older the better if you ask me). and i think grand-parenting would be fun. you get to play with them, corrupt them, spoil them, and then when stuff gets hard, you pass them back to their parents! i would have also made a good spinster aunt but i'm an only child so i have to spoil the kids of my friends (who usually get annoyed when i give their kids presents like drum sets or chemistry sets, really fun stuff but maybe not if you have to listen to or clean up after them).  as for fun in my life, it's fun within limits. in school (law school especially), i was always designated driver (i never drink or take recreational drugs and do everything i can to stay healthy without prescription drugs). hardly ever had to pay for a drink (bartenders loved me because the dram shop act liability lawsuits are expensive and suck while soft drinks or bottled water are cheap). i will go out on a dance floor and dance like no one's watching (lots of enthusiasm, not necessarily lots of skill especially with partnered dancing because i've yet to find the man i would want to let lead me), am typically laughing a lot or cracking wise (moon in gemini, mercury in aquarius both in 3rd house also sagittarius ascendant). i can abandon myself to fun if it's my kind of fun but again this does not include alcohol, drugs, violence (though i would love to learn to target shoot) or anything too dangerous (okay i do like to drive fast but i know pretty much when and where i can get away with that and it wouldn't be at 2 am with a bunch of intoxicated friends in my car). but i do have fun (my definition of it anyway).  i see my mission as keeping young &amp; fun with my partner (am starting to see the virtues of an older than me partner, when younger would pick a guy who was a few months to maybe 2/3 years younger than me and that can be a recipe for disaster in your 20s). i love the idea of a companionate marriage and oh man am i getting itchy feet (it's a military brat term for the desire to travel). i foresee some trips (short &amp; long distance), pursuing culture, arts, hobbies, education and just enjoying the heck out of one another. empty nesting without having ever had to fill it (well okay maybe only i weaseled out of that!). it sounds divine to not have to split myself up too much (not that i'm ditching my friends or my hobbies for some guy) and not be too bound to too many family obligations. i will be fine doing the in-law visits or kid/grandkid visits from time to time if those are on the cards. but it's a selling point that my man won't ever have a fight with his in-laws, or kids or ex from another partnership, right?  so i foresee freedom within limits i didn't see when i was in my 20s (it takes a long time &amp; a lot of formal education to become a scientist, an attorney or in my case a patent attorney) or my 30s (my parents were a bit older when they had me and they didn't do great in the health lottery, they both started getting sick around age 60 (aka from about age 30 on for me), though my father had a very few fleeting signs of dementia coming in his late 50s (very occasional slight hand tremors and weird food preferences, he switched from wanting healthy home-cooked favorites to junk like potato chips, processed cookies &amp; ice cream pretty fast, that was the earliest sign something was very wrong with him, but no one knew that back them save maybe 5 or 6 researchers around the country and frankly he was 'too young' to be 'senile', ha!).   having been present at both my parents deaths, even death does not scare me, nor does caregiving. i of course would find it sad if a partner of mine should need it but it's not enough to make me run off from them if they are otherwise 'right'. i'm a 'stick around &amp; fight it' sort of girl, so much so that i'm trying to figure out how to teach other people whose family members get blindsided by dementia in a relative how to help their own demented family members stay at home as long as possible (it's what 90% of baby boomers want, at least 80% of their elders want this too) and get paid to do it. i'm quite good at breaking pointless outdated rules and figuring out other ways to live (or in my father's case to finish well). and i can find joy &amp; humor in what others are scared of, i did learn that lesson while caregiving.  my father died in his own home on hospice and except for a week where he fell (the hospital kept him in because we couldn't get him into secured memory-specific respite care (because he was mobile and could wander, he needed supervision &amp; a locked place to stay in) so it was almost a vacation, save for one hospital visit a day and phone calls at nursing shift changes) he stayed home. it meant i was always in charge of him for about 3 straight years (24/7/365 no vacations, i did try adult day care but they kicked him out! might well have been gender discrimination but i sucked it up &amp; kept going.) but then the 7 months on hospice were very very good (finally i had help!).   so i'm not eager to do that again anytime soon (certainly not solo &amp; 24/7/365) but i can teach others and if it happens again (i certainly hope i'm luckier in the future on this) i know what to do and would do it in a heartbeat for my right guy. i'm sure he'd say the same about me (or if he doesn't he's not for me thanks. this needs to be a reciprocal arrangement.).  but yeah my 20s and 30s are done and aside from missing the slightly cuter / closer to societal ideal body, i am totally cool with being my age. the anxiety of my 20s and 30s is too high a price to pay to stay young and it would be hard to go back to being so serious as to be dour. i was probably a crappy match back then (unless we were in business together). serious, hard-working, a lot less playful most of the time. much more of a 'what's in it for me' person.  the sign i think i have a lot in common with is capricorn. they too are hyper-responsible as kids and know how to live within limits but as adults they seem to get to lighten up because they tackle so much so young. god forbid i go to a skilled nursing facility myself, but my ambition is to be the rowdiest old crone there (married or single). my best friend who like me is a fan of older british comedies has said that i've taken the part of diana (played by the brilliant stephanie cole) in the older tv show waiting for god as a kind of users guide to aging and let's just say he's not wrong there ;-)",1,1,1

114806,"&gt; that was quite a response.  not really, if it wasn't convincing :d  &gt; i still disagree that public schooling is anymore of a terrible brainwashing experience than say, watching tv or reading reddit or anything else where a source of authority tells you what to think.  isn't tv a brainwashing experience?  it's definitely a large influence, and many people's only source of news -- which is damned dangerous nowadays, if you ask me.  reddit, as has been noticed by others, is a site with a large number of people who tend, more often than not, to agree on certain things -- individuality, civil liberties, religion, and so forth.  as we know from social psychology, too much agreement leads to groupthink, group polarization, and other fun phenomena.    but it's not so much the existence of a source of authority (even though milgram's experiments clearly demonstrated the danger of having an authority around, even if just for an hour), but rather a continual process of molding.  you've seen, i'm sure, what marines are like after, what, 13 weeks of boot camp?  consider twelve years of milder instruction.  we all know the saying ""garbage in, garbage out.""  when fed false premises, we derive false conclusions.  &gt; a resilient individual will protect their identity and values, and continue to think as an individual regardless of what is thrown at them.   it's far more complex than that.  consider [this old candid camera clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7srixn2muc), milgram's experiment, the stanford prison experiment, or the hofling hospital experiment.  or the holocaust.  any war, in fact.  any country.  consider [the eight stages of genocide](http://www.genocidewatch.org/8stages.htm).  how many people are resilient and willful individuals?  is this the norm or the exception?  are you resilient and willful?  and how does thinking as an individual (i notice that you were careful not to say *acting* as an individual) display your resilience and will?  isn't it rather easy to think daring, rebellious thoughts, and do nothing about them?  every process of human thought that can be interrupted, short-circuited, misdirected, or generally fucked around with can and *is* fucked around with.  can you really think, with a thoroughly modern knowledge of psychology and sociology, that twelve years of authoritarian structure do not have an effect on someone?  resilience and will are illusions lent to the subject by other external phenomena; the natural state of man is ignorant, innocent vulnerability to whatever mental processes are currently occurring, and whatever those processes might be slave to -- which are inevitably outside actors.  &gt; if public schooling turned you into an ignorant void for authorities to step on, you were not very resilient or willful to begin with.  sweet talk will get you nowhere with me.  i was neither resilient nor willful.  i was a rather vulnerable, na√Øve child.  i was shaped by just about everything and everyone *but* myself.  at least, that's how i perceive it.  my mother would probably consider me extremely willful, and i was indeed rebellious and obstinate, but being willful is in the eye of the beholder.  i joined the military, which molded me too.  i would say that i didn't become truly myself until a period of seclusion led me to the values i have today, but that isn't true.  i've simply been molded by different things.  i am the sum total of my experiences, my thoughts, and my influences.  to say that public school turns all kids into brainless drones is a misunderstanding of what i have said -- which is that it is a collection of many influences filling half your waking hours for fully two-thirds of your childhood.  resilience and will aren't two traits of a person, like str and int for someone's d&amp;d half-elf.  people show different responses to different kinds of oppression.  for instance, a religious muslim man is horrified by being stripped naked and straddled by a young female guard.  i'd think this was vaguely hott &lt;3.  he similarly thinks nothing of the strictures and requirements of islam, whereas i view them as senseless and silly.  resilience and will are functions of value systems.  imagine that you were born in india, to a traditional family.  do you honestly think you'd be wandering around the countryside making beef shish-kabobs and fondling untouchables?  my favorite question to ask evangelists who bother me is whether they think they would still be christian if they were born in pakistan.  no matter the response, it's always amusing.  and isn't it interesting that, in the us, we have different beliefs than other developed, western, industrial nations?  we're just about the only one left with capital punishment.  we're far more religious than other industrial nations, and definitely deny evolution an alarming percentage of the time.  if humans were basically all the same, and the percentage of resilient and willful people were roughly constant across populations, wouldn't it follow that our mainstream would be roughly the same as that of the uk, or france, or germany?  france has definitely had its share of resilient and willful people -- the list of philosophers, master writers, and scientific thinkers is tremendous -- but who are the swiss geniuses? :-)    &gt; edit: furthermore, we didn't have a sham representation entirely. this was at a hick school in texas. arbitrary rules were discussable with the administrator, most rules were there for clear reasons but arbitrary ones were debatable and breakable under reasonable circumstances. our student council was mostly concerned with organizing social events, but did have representation at school faculty meetings in order to voice their opinions. while these opinions may have been disregarded for the most part, they were voiced nonetheless (it should also be noted that many of the teachers who voice their opinions at faculty meetings are also disregarded.)   okay, so what did your student council accomplish?  i might have missed that for your discussion of just how effective a sham your representation was.  did you guys change the grading scale, or declare a special holiday for someone respectable who died, or institute a change in the standard curriculum, or protest the damn high school competency exams?    of course the teachers were disregarded.  they're employees :d  &gt; a social hierarchy based on seniority has also been around long before the dawning of public schools. take for example native american tribes, where the elders of the tribe command considerable amounts of respect compared to younger ones. consider even animals in the wild, where the generally older stronger males have their pick over mating partners in patriarchal species. many of these ideas that are ""indoctrinated"" are actually the result of millions of years of natural selection.  yes, social hierarchy based on seniority exists outside of school -- i never said that public school invented the concept.  my point was that school officials are unwilling and unable to stop the evolution and existence of this hierarchy, which i believe has only negative effects on social development.  in families and many other situations, it can and does have positive effects.  &gt; to an extent schools do promote nationalism, but so do baseball games. no one is accusing baseball games of force-feeding children nationalism, and yet the national anthem is traditionally sung at baseball games (to my knowledge this happens at most sporting events worldwide) and the flag is flown. it most certainly happens at the olympics.  i'm not sure if you understand what i mean by nationalism -- i don't mean people coming out of public school saying ""rah!  go u.s.!  go u.s.!"" -- but rather their belief that a nation is necessary, that the people of their particular nation are somehow more important than those of other nations, that efficiency and ""correctness"" are the marks of a virtuous nation, that this nation's government be compulsory, and so forth.  in other words, if i were to criticize baseball or any other sport, i would not criticize it on the grounds that the star spangled banana was played at every game, but rather that two warring tribes were fighting a little war.  (someone said on a ted talk that sports are to war what porn is to sex, which amused me)  better that than a real war or riot, and i don't criticize sports (although they don't interest me).",0,,

319712,"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.  ''most people agree it's wrong for someone to be in a sexual relationship with their boss because of the unequal power balance,'' dr. spiegel said. ''if that's true with adults, it's certainly true between any adult and a child.''  ms. levine counters that power imbalances are inevitable in sexual relationships. ''a balance needs to be struck between respecting kids as sexual beings and protecting them from exploitation,'' she said.  ms. levine argues that sex between teenagers and adults is not always wrong, and that many people are too quick to deny children and teenagers the right to make their own sexual decisions, often by labeling all such contact ''abuse.''   https://www.routledge.com/products/9780805809145  long-range effects of child and adolescent sexual experiences myths, mores, and menaces  making a unique contribution of placing the current sexual exploitation of children and adolescents firmly in its historical context, this book looks at the family's and society's roles in child and adolescent sex abuse. unlike most previous studies, this study allows a range of responses from negative to positive and avoids the methodological problems inherent in many other studies. most studies combine the age groups of children and adolescents, whereas this study separates these different age groups and compares the nature and outcome of sexual experiences of children with those of adolescents. utilizing sophisticated analytical measures, the author's findings repudiate many commonly held assumptions and serve to calm current hysteria regarding sexual abuse of minors.   http://www.alternet.org/story/12960/what_judith_levine_is_really_saying  levine has taken considerable heat for holding up as a ""good model"" the netherlands' age of consent law, under which young people ages 12-16 can legally consent to sex with older people who are not parents or authority figures, but under which charges can be brought if teens or their parents (with the approval of the council for the protection of children) believe the young person is being exploited. but her support for the dutch law cannot be taken out of the context of that country's social welfare system and relaxed cultural attitudes about sex.  in order ""to give children a fighting chance in navigating the sexual world,"" levine says, ""adults need to saturate it with accurate, realistic information and abundant, varied images and narratives of love and sex.""  if a person truly has the good of young people in mind, one would hope he or she would be interested in what research has to reveal. ""harmful to minors"" offers a plethora of findings, from studies showing that exposure to sexually explicit images does not harm children, to evidence that teens' sexual relationships with adults are not uniformly devastating, to research on the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education in delaying sexual activity.  allie kilpatrick is one source for levine. the book of allie is on routledge.   ask yourself why there is a systemic desire to suppress facts in favor of emotional arguments. why do you help perpetuate by downvoting my own posts on the subject and refusing to listen to alternative views?",0,,
140642,"the term ""autism"" refers to a cluster of conditions appearing early in childhood. all involve severe impairments in social interaction, communication, imaginative abilities, and rigid, repetitive behaviors. to be considered an autistic disorder, some of these impairments must be manifest before the age of three.  the reference book used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental disorders is the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , also known as the dsm. the 2000 edition of this reference book (the fourth edition text revision known as dsm-iv-tr ) places autism in a category called pervasive developmental disorders . all of these disorders are characterized by ongoing problems with mutual social interaction and communication, or the presence of strange, repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities. people diagnosed with these disorders are affected in many ways for their entire lives.  description each child diagnosed with an autistic disorder differs from every other, and so general descriptions of autistic behavior and characteristics do not apply equally to every child. still, the common impairments in social interaction, communication and imagination, and rigid, repetitive behaviors make it possible to recognize children with these disorders, as they differ markedly from healthy children in many ways.  many parents of autistic children sense that something is not quite right even when their children are infants. the infants may have feeding problems, dislike being changed or bathed, or fuss over any change in routine. they may hold their bodies rigid, making it difficult for parents to cuddle them. or, they may fail to anticipate being lifted, lying passively while the parent reaches for them, rather than holding their arms up in return. most parents of autistic children become aware of the strangeness of these and other behaviors only gradually.  impairments in social interaction are usually among the earliest symptoms to develop. the most common social impairment is a kind of indifference to other people, or aloofness, even towards parents and close care-givers. the baby may fail to respond to his or her name being called and may show very little facial expression unless extremely angry, upset, or happy. babies with autism may resist being touched, and appear to be lost in their own world, far from human interaction. between seven and 10 months of age, most infants often resist being separated from a parent or well-known caregiver, but these infants may show no disturbance when picked up by a stranger.  other children with autism may be very passive, although less resistant to efforts by others to interact. however, they do not initiate social interaction themselves. still others may attempt to engage with adults and peers, but in ways that strike others as inappropriate, or odd.  in adolescence and adulthood, some of the higher-functioning individuals with autistic disorders may appear overly formal and polite. they may react with little spontaneity, as if social interaction doesn't come naturally or easily to them, and so they are trying to follow a pre-determined set of rules.  some individuals with autism have normal intelligence, and many have special talents in areas such as music or memory. however, individuals with autism may have other mental or emotional problems that co-exist with their autism. some of these other disorders may include impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder , mood and anxiety disorders, and mental retardation .  causes and symptoms causes psychological and family factors. although henry maudsley, in the late 1800s, was the first psychiatrist to focus on very young children with mental disorders, it was the psychiatrist leo kanner who coined the phrase ""early infantile autism"" in 1943. kanner believed that the parents of children with autistic behaviors were emotionally cold and intellectually distant. he coined the term ""refrigerator parents"" to describe them. his belief that parental personality and behavior played a powerful role in the development of autistic behaviors left a devastating legacy of guilt and self-blame among parents of autistic children that continues to this day. recent studies are unequivocal, however, in demonstrating that parents of autistic children are no different from parents of healthy children in their personalities or parenting behaviors. in fact, many families with an autistic child also have one or more perfectly healthy children.  because autistic children can be extremely sensitive to change, any change within the family situation can be potentially traumatic to the autistic child. a move, divorce, birth of a sibling or other stressors that occur in the lives of most families may evoke a more extreme reaction from an autistic child.  neurological and biological factors. while there is no single neurological abnormality found in children with autistic disorders, some research using non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (mri) suggests that certain areas of the brain may be involved. several of the brain areas being researched are known to control emotion and the expression of emotion. these areas include the temporal lobe (large lobe of each side of the brain that contains a sensory area associated with hearing), the limbic system, the cerebellum, the frontal lobe, the amygdala, and the brain stem, which regulates homeostasis (body temperature and heart rate). recent research has focused particularly on the temporal lobe because of the finding that previously healthy people who sustain temporal lobe damage may develop autistic-like symptoms. in animal research, when the temporal lobe is damaged, social behavior declines, and restless, repetitive motor behaviors are common. when measured by mri, total brain volume appears to be greater for those with autistic disorders.  other neurological factors include lesions to the brain, congenital rubella, undiagnosed and untreated phenylketonuria (pku), tuberous sclerosis, and rett's disorder (a related condition in which the baby develops in an apparently normal manner through age five months, and then begins to lose communicative and social interaction skills). there is also evidence of a higher proportion of perinatal complications (complications arising around the time of giving birth) among children with autistic symptoms. these complications include maternal bleeding after the first trimester and meconium in the amniotic fluid. (meconium is a substance that accumulates in the bowel of the developing fetus and is discharged shortly after birth.) some evidence suggests that the use of medications during pregnancy may be related to the development of autistic symptoms. as newborns, children with autistic behaviors show a higher rate of respiratory illness and anemia than healthy children.  allergies, infections, and immunizations. some professionals believe that autistic disorders may be caused by allergies to particular fungi, viral infections, and various foods. no controlled studies have supported these beliefs, but some parents and professionals report improvement when allergens and/or certain foods are eliminated from the diet.  viral infections of the mother, such as rubella, or of the young child, such as encephalitis, mumps, and measles, occasionally appear to cause autistic disorders. the common childhood immunization series known as mmr (measles, mumps, rubella) has recently come under scrutiny as a possible cause of some autistic conditions.  symptoms dsm-iv-tr specifies three diagnostic categories, each with four components, that are used to make a diagnosis of autistic disorder. these diagnostic categories include impairments in social interaction, communication, and particular patterns of behavior. more information about the individual diagnostic categories and components follows.  social interaction. qualitative impairment in social interaction, as demonstrated by at least two of the following:  impairment in the use of nonverbal behaviors such as eye contact, facial expression, body posture, and gestures used for social interaction failure to develop age-appropriate peer relationships lack of attempts to share pleasure, activities, interests, or achievements with other people (by failing to bring items of interest to a parent, or pointing out animals or objects, for example) inability to respond to social situations or other people's emotions with empathy or a concerned attitude communication. qualitative impairments in communicating in at least one of the following four areas:  lack of, or delay in development of spoken language, without attempts to communicate through alternative means such as gestures or mime in individuals who do speak, severe impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others repetitive and stereotyped use of language, or use of words in unusual, idiosyncratic ways failure to show imaginative play, such as make-believe or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level behavior. restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as demonstrated by at least one of the following:  unusual and overly absorbing preoccupation with one or more interests or activities a need for rigid adherence to specific routines or rituals in daily life stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors using parts of the body such as fingers or hands, or the whole body persistent preoccupation with parts of objects",0,,
251396,"yes, i know that prices being set by sellers who are guided by costs of production *does* unsettle many austrians.  in all honesty, i think it may be a small over-reaction to the objective value ideas believed by marx and some of the classicals before him (whose labor theory of value appeared to lay the groundwork to marx's exploitation theory).  while supply and demand are the *ultimate* determinants of price, the fact the producers of manufactured goods follow profits forces me to accept that costs are more of a determinant in prices than most people realize.    for example, it is tempting to say that the price of a gm car is determined solely by the supply and demand for gm cars.  in this respect, one is led to think that the final buyers solely determine the price by their subjective valuations.  but this ignores the role of the producer.  producers will simply not produce gm cars priced at $10,000 say, if it means they have to suffer losses.  the consumer could theoretically want to pay no more than $10,000 for the gm car, and any price above that they will not pay.  but i always try to remain in the aristotelian framework that says the only reality is that which exists and is real.  a consumer who wants to pay no more than $10,000 doesn't mean the price for gm cars is $10,000.    in order for a price to be a price, money has to actually change hands.  gm producers will not be willing to accept $10,000 per car if it means they have to suffer losses, or earn below market profits.  therefore, even though the consumers *want* to pay $10,000 each for a certain supply of cars, they will end up not being able to buy any gm car at all.  since no gm cars are being produced, there are no prices.  since there are no prices, it means the consumer really isn't the direct determinant of what the price is.  if they were, then gm producers would have to produce cars at a loss, which is impossible.  therefore, the only way gm cars can be produced, such that a price for gm cars actually exists, is if the price set by the sellers of gm cars is *at least as big as the costs, plus the going rate of profit*.  since the rate of profit *tends* to be the same for car manufacturing (in a free market, without tariffs, subsidies, etc), it must mean that the costs of producing cars is the *proximate* determinant of price.  the reisman article you linked to, and the authors cited therein, especially bohm-bawerk, in all honesty pretty much sums up my sources for costs of production.  you are absolutely right that many austrians are wary of getting into the cost of production framework.  again, my best guess for why is that they don't want to give any credibility at all to objective value, because the whole austrian theory is based on subjective valuation, and so a path towards objective value seems to be a return to the exploitation framework.  if i could add to your comment regarding hours in the day, i think to myself that i can have a longer life if i study history.  history of ideas, events, economic thought, etc.  it makes me feel like i have lived a long life.  i think education is the path to immortality.  oh, i just remembered, there is an interesting story about objective value (costs of production), and subjective value (marginal utility):  mises and ayn rand, during a social gathering, were arguing over whether value was objective or subjective.  others present at the gathering were amazed at how intense the conversation became, with mises stressing subjectivity, and rand stressing objectivity.  i will try to find a reference for you.",0,,

248429,"from your other posts:  hknaven says, ""single mothers are usually below the poverty line for most of (if not all of) their lives. it is a bad situation for the mother and the child."" you reply:  &gt; i worry about this too. i want to be able to give my kid nice things and be able to give her what she wants.  being a parent isn't just about giving kids what they want.  it's about providing an environment where they can grow; it's about not giving them what they want, sometimes.  but ok, i know what you're saying -- that you want to be able to provide for your children they way they ought to be provided for.  but can you? no! you can't; you're 18; you're living at home; the father, you say, is not involved even if his parents are; how long do you expect your parents to provide child care for free?  and do you know how much energy it takes to raise a child in the first 12 months of their lives?  you need almost-constant attention.  now, you're 18. presumably you're planning on going to community college soon.  but how will you fare?  do you think you're going to be in a position to perform well?  from your orignal post:  &gt; i'm almost seven months pregnant and not quite sure how i'm feeling about this.  now quite sure how you're feeling about what?  there are no doing an enormous number of trepidations that go along with being pregnant.  but given what you say after this sentence, you basically sound as if you're just not sure what you're not sure about, but you sort of have the feeling that you ""want"" this baby not because you have reasons for wanting it, but basically because you've ruled out the two other options -- abortion and adoption.  so, the reader is left with a clear signal: this person ""really wants"" things to work out for the best, but basically is having a baby because she's scared, intuitively, about abortion or adoption.  i see, so when your kid grows up and asks you why you had him or her, you're going to say, well i was scared of abortion and i was scared of adoption so i kept you?  &gt; also at the time i hated referring to the baby as ""it"". as time passed it seems i started caring less and less. i've been having the urge to smoke or drink. (more so smoke)  this is the point of your post where you being soliciting help from others.  but how are you inviting them in? with an appeal to respond to destructive behavior? really? thinking in cliches = lack of maturity.  &gt; as you noticed i also don't care if i called the baby an ""it"". the baby is a girl, btw.  who are you talking to here?  who do you expect your reader to be at this point or, rather, how do you expect them to feel about you?  my suspicion is that you want them to recognize that you're really ""trying hard,"" but that ""shit is hard,"" so please ""help me out"" and ""make me feel better"" by telling me everything's going to be ok.  well, it's probably not; telling this is a major disservice.    &gt; basically what it all comes down to is that every one else seems more excited about this than i am.  then why the hell are you having this baby?  &gt; so i don't really know why i'm feeling this way. i'm just not feeling the same as i was the first couple of months of my pregnancy. i don't know what to do. any words of wisdom?  those other people who have been responding critically to me, telling me that ""she's the only one who can decide what is right for her,"" should really re-read this portion of your original post.  because it's very, very clear what is probably going on: the decision to have this baby was your own insofar as it was not for the baby or you, but for the idea of a baby, for the feelings of support and warmth that you get from being pregnant from others, from the special status you now occupy.  but you know what? all of that shit is quickly going to fade as soon as you have the kid and you'll be, for all intents and purposes, on your own.  final point: you're feeling this way, in all probability, because you're going through with something you don't want to go through with.    that you are in that exact position is precisely a sign of immaturity.  you are not expressing the feeling over been overwhelmed by your decision in a way that requires material support.  you are feeling very core uncertainty about the whole thing to begin with.  that you couldn't own up to these feelings earlier, or do something about them, is why i say you're immature.  but now you have a kid coming; it doesn't look like you're going to give her up.  have you gone to planned parenthood?  have you looked, for example, to see if there are [child co-operatives in your neighborhood](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1053/is_v13/ai_3495418/)? the advantage of co-ops is that they are cheaper, you know the people you give your kid to for child care, and it can be relatively flexible.  regarding your community college, what major and courses are you pursuing?  since you are having a kid, you probably should consider a major and courses that will allow you to make a living.  now is not the time to pursue (you can always come back to it) a degree in art, history, or something like that.  it may be worth pursuing a paralegal degree, basic business courses, and so on, so that you have a set of tangible skills that are immediately attractive to business.  also, consider where you are going to live.  likely you're going to be staying at your parents, right?  so think about the kinds of jobs that are specific to your area and see if you can take courses that will make you locally attractive in the local job market.  and, yes, plan -- plan plan plan.  plan budgets (i use mint.com; it's free and it's great for managing financials and budgetting); plan your schedules of child-care (if you do a co-op) with courses.  what about health care for the kid? where is that coming from?  the government may be able to help you with some of the health care.  you can now stay on your parent's health care until you are 26, so perhaps they can help change their health care to provide better coverage for young infants. it's worth looking into.  i really wish you the best of luck.  but you can't expect any more that you can live the next 4 years of your life (what might have been college life) the way you planned.  those odds are entirely zero.  you basically need to fast-track yourself to adulthood.  i'm sorry.  it's not the best hand you gave yourself, but now is the time to be the adult, and you need to realize that you have to do it own your own.  yes, people will help you, but at the end of the day it's all up to you.  finally, the kid's dad.  his parents may be helping now, sure, because they feel compelled to. that will go away soon.  what won't go away is your baby's dad.  you need to get him involved now.  you need to tell him it's not ok for him to forget about this kid.  get him to commit money and time. get him to come with you to child care preparations.  ask him what he's going to do for income.  he has an obligation to you and your kid, and his failure to live up to them is not an option.",1,-2,

566229,"""when a woman continues to smoke during pregnancy, the risks to the unborn child are great. these statistics come out of the 2004 surgeon general's report on smoking*:  * research has shown that women's smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of pregnancy complications, premature delivery, low-birth-weight infants, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (sids).  * the nicotine in cigarettes may cause constrictions in the blood vessels of the umbilical cord and uterus, thereby decreasing the amount of oxygen available to the fetus. nicotine also may reduce the amount of blood in the fetal cardiovascular system.  * nicotine is found in breast milk.  * babies of mothers who smoked during pregnancy have lower birth weights. low birth weight is a leading cause of infant deaths, resulting in more than 300,000 deaths annually among newborns in the united states.  * in general, pregnant smokers eat more than pregnant nonsmokers, yet their babies weigh less than babies of nonsmokers. this weight deficit is smaller if smokers quit early in their pregnancy.  * smoking by the mother causes sids. compared with unexposed infants, babies exposed to secondhand smoke after birth are at twice the risk for sids, and infants whose mothers smoked before and after birth are at three to four times greater risk.  * mothers' smoking during pregnancy reduces their babies' lung function.  * in 2001, 17.5% of teenaged mothers smoked during pregnancy. only 18% to 25% of all women quit smoking once they become pregnant.  * smoking by children and adolescents hastens the onset of lung function decline during late adolescence and early adulthood.  * smoking by children and adolescents is related to impaired lung growth, chronic coughing, and wheezing.""  edit: [source](http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/smokingconsequences/)",1,-1,

345802,"**archetypes of the crisis:**  **(boomer) gray champion elder prophets:**  their myth is a journey to ‚Äúowl mountain,‚Äù a ‚Äúprimordial sanctuary‚Ä¶ preserved since the most ancient times,‚Äù sustaining wisdom passed down from ‚Äúvillages in the middle of nowhere speaking to us across the millennia.‚Äù clues of what old boomers will be like can be glimpsed in the ‚Äúconscious aging‚Äù movement. cutting-edge books like from ageing to sageing speak of new ‚Äúspiritual eldering institutes‚Äù teaching people to engage in ‚Äúvision quests.‚Äù these new ‚Äúelders of the tribe‚Äù see themselves as ‚Äúwisdom keepers‚Äù who must apply ‚Äútheir dormant powers of intuition ‚Ä¶ [to] become seers who feed wisdom back into society and who guide the long-term reclamation project of healing our beleaguered planet.‚Äù  boomer gerontologist harry moody sees a twenty-first-century shift to a ‚Äúcontemplative old age‚Äù that eliminates today's focus on activity and instead ‚Äútranscends doing, in favor of being.‚Äù elders will be defined as spiritually gifted over their juniors who ‚Äúare too busy to cultivate the quietness and inwardness from which mystical experience is possible.‚Äù pain and bodily decline will be accepted, even honored as the necessary burning off of worldly dross for the purpose of acquiring higher insights. in sharp contrast to the youth-emulating ‚Äúuninhibited octogenarians‚Äù of gail sheehy's silent generation, these new earth sages will want to be authentically old people, critical links in human civilization, without whose guidance the young might sink into philistinism‚Äîbut with whom the young can craft what gerontologist david gut-mann terms ‚Äúthe new myths on which reculturation can be based.‚Äù  as they fill the upper age brackets, boomers will believe themselves to be elders who, in the words of anthropologist joan halifax, ‚Äúfunction like old cobblers and dressmakers, sewing us back into the fabric of creation.‚Äù they will feel a new transformative dimension of time, enabling them to craft myths and models that can resacralize the national community, heal its dysfunctions, and grant moral authority for the next golden age. the very other-worldliness that boomers will regard so highly in themselves will strike younger generations as evidence of incompetence. elder contempt for this world will strike younger people as dangerous. yet regardless what youth think of these old messengers, they will respect their message and march to their banner.  the full dimension of the boomer persona will only emerge when today's better-known 1940s birth cohorts (whose youth was marked by relatively few social pathologies) are joined in public life by the tougher-willed, more evangelical 1950s cohorts (whose youth was marked by many more pathologies). that is the mix that will beget this generation's elder priest-warrior persona, vindicating the pre-crisis era.  as the crisis deepens, boomers will confront the end result of their lifelong absorption with values. their habitual tendency to enunciate unyielding principles will now carry the duty of enforcement. the same boomers who in youth chanted ‚Äúhell no, we won't go!‚Äù will emerge as the most martial elder generation in living memory. whatever the elements of crisis, old boomer leaders will up the moral ante beyond the point of possible retreat or compromise.  **(x) doom player adult nomads:**  in a recent genre of action films (from war games and back to the future to terminator and independence day), a stock drama unfolds. a young protagonist‚Äîalone, unprepared, and immersed in a junky culture‚Äîis chosen by chance to decide the fate of humanity. the situation looks dicey. the protagonist, too, has slim expectations of success. but at a pivotal moment, this lonely wayfarer challenges destiny, deals with the stress, zeroes in on what matters, does what is required, and comes out on top. the most popular video games, following the same script, stress one-on-one action and deft timing: find a treasure, grab the tools, rescue a princess, save the kingdom, slay the enemy, and get out alive. everything is yes-no, full of code words and secret places‚Äîin a style one tv executive calls ‚Äúindiana jones meets a game show.‚Äù ‚Äúi've glimpsed our future,‚Äù warns a high school valedictorian in the film say anything, ‚Äúand all i can say is‚Äîgo back.‚Äù  the message to her classmates is understandable, because nomad generations‚Äîwhat christian slater refers to as ‚Äúa long list of dead, famous wild people‚Äù‚Äîhave always been the ones who lose ground in wealth, education, security, longevity, and other measures of progress. yet they have also been the generations who lay at the fulcrum between triumph and tragedy, the ones who hoist their society through the darkest days of crisis.  the 13er mind-set will be hardboiled and avuncular, the risk taking now mellowed by a crisis-era need for security. middle-aged people will mentor youth movements, lend stylishness to hard times, and add nuts-and-bolts workmanship to the resolute new mood. they will be begrudgingly respected for their proficiency in multimedia and various untutored skills to which old boomers will be blind and young millennials dismissive. throughout the economy, 13ers will be associated with risk and dirty jobs. they will seek workable outcomes more than inner truths. ‚Äúwe won't have a bad backlash against our lost idealism,‚Äù predicts slacker filmmaker richard linklater, since his generation ‚Äúnever had that to begin with.‚Äù like hemingway, their moral judgments will be situational, based on how everybody feels afterward.  as the crisis rages on, the era's stark new communitarianism will require 13ers to rivet new grids in place. new-breed mayors and governors will abandon old labels and alliances, patch together people and technology, and rekindle public support for community purpose. having grown up in a time when walls were being dismantled, families dissolved, and loyalties discarded, 13er power brokers will reconstruct the social barriers that produce civic order.  they will connive first to get the people behind them, next to bribe (or threaten) people into doing what's needed, and then to solidify those arrangements into something functional. they won't worry about the obviously insoluble and won't fuss over the merely annoying. their politicians won't brim with compassion or nuance, and won't care if they have to win ugly. to them, the outcome will matter more than democracy's ritual aesthetics. their hand strengthened by the demands of crisis, 13ers will sweep aside procedural legalisms and promises legislated by old regimes.  as the crisis resolves, the society will be fully in 13er hands. if all ends well, their security-minded leadership will usher the society away from urgent crusades and into the next high. if not, 13ers will be left with no choice but to yank younger generations by the collar, appraise what's left of their society, and start anew.  **(y) power ranger young heroes:**  when summoned, these ordinary youths transform themselves into thunderbolting evil fighters. cheerful, confident, and energetic, power rangers are nurtured to succeed in the face of great odds. whatever they do‚Äîfrom displaying martial arts to piloting high-tech weaponry‚Äîthey do as a choreographed group. their very motto, the power of teamwork overcomes all, speaks of strength in cooperation, energy in conformity, virtue in duty. their missions are not chosen by themselves, but by an incorporeal elder in whose vision and wisdom they have total trust. in social movements, they will (initially) seem pacifist, hard to ruffle, their civic power as yet untapped. this youthful hunger for social discipline and centralized authority could lead millennial youth brigades to lend mass to dangerous demagogues.  the risk of class warfare will be especially grave if the 20 percent of millennials who were poor as children (50 percent in inner cities) come of age seeing their peer-bonded paths to generational progress blocked by elder inertia. unraveling-era adults who are today chilled by school uniforms will be truly frightened by the millennials' crisis-era collectivism. just as the unraveling's political agenda centered around children, the agenda of the next new deal will center around young adults. millennials will not oppose this because they will see in it a path to public achievement. national leaders will not hesitate to mobilize and deploy them in huge armies.  near the climax of crisis, the full power of this rising generation will assert itself, providing their society with a highly effective instrument for imposing order on an unruly world. they will appear capable of glorious collective deeds, of conquering distant lands, of potently executing any command that may be issued.  as a crisis-era president commits the society to clear a path for a bright future, the political juggernaut of millennial youth will stand squarely with their beloved commander-in-chief. this generation of young heroes will follow wherever the gray champion leads, whether to triumph or disaster. they will vex hollywood's unraveling-era elite with their cool rationalism. they will vex feminists by accepting a new mystique between the sexes. they will vex free marketeers with their demands for trade barriers, government regulation, labor standards, and public works.  **(z) innocents**  child welfare will be a settled priority, no longer anyone's crusade. protective nurture will be on autopilot. few adults will dispute that children must be taught community norms, often by rote. children who fall below standards will be warned that the community has ways of remembering, that a young person's reputation can be easy to harm but hard to repair. good child behavior, academics, and civic deeds will win few kudos because all this will simply be expected.",1,1,2
138636,"""i'm not interested in debating a link, i already know all the apologetics. i asked you some very simple questions. what's so hard about answering them yourself. they don;t require eloquence. was jesus born during a) the reign of herod or b) during the cesus of quirinius. all you have to do is say ""a"" or ""b."" which is it? it can't be both. that's not an option on the table""  i offer point c)let's look at the biblical passage in question and then we'll take it apart to see what specific historical claims are made.""now in those days a decree went out from caesar augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth. this was the first census taken while quirinius was governor of syria. and everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city. joseph also went up from galilee, from the city of nazareth, to judea, to the city of david which is called bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of david, in order to register along with mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child. while they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth. and she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.""(nasb)in the biblical account, we know these facts are presented: caesar augustus ordered a census quirinius was governing syria (hegemoneuontos tes syrias kyreniou)each family must register at their familial city of origin further, matthew chapter 2 reports that herod the great ordered the slaughter ""all the male children who were in bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under""(matt 2:16). we know that herod died 4-2 b.c., so jesus birth had to have been before his death - most likely by two or more years. given these facts, scholars generally date jesus' birth anywhere between 6 b.c. to 4 b.c.now, let's turn our attention to the josephus passage. in 17.13.5 of the antiquity of the jews, josephus writes:""so archelaus' country was laid to the province of syria; and cyrenius, one that had been consul, was sent by caesar to take account of people's effects in syria, and to sell the house of archelaus.""1from the josephus account we derive the following facts:caesar ordered a census cyrenius (quirinius) was sent to account for syria and sell the house of archelaus cyrenius (quirinius) ""had been consul"" we also know from other historical records that herod archelaus was deposed in 6 a.d., so this census must be about 6 or 7 a.d. so, the question goes, if herod the great died in 4 b.c. and josephus tells us quirinius' census wasn't until 6 a.d., then isn't this a contradiction? more than one census although on its face we seem to have a difficulty here, there are several pieces that we must consider before jumping to the conclusion that luke and josephus were speaking about the same event. indeed, it seems that caesar augustus was the type of leader who ordered many censuses in his day. records exist to show that roman-controlled egypt had begun a census as early as 10 b.c. and it was repeated every 14 years. and augustus himself notes in his res gestae (the deeds of augustus) that he ordered three wide-spread censuses of roman citizens, one in 28b.c., one in 8 b.c. and one in 14 a.d.2 in between there are several other censuses that happened locally across rome. luke's account corroborates the idea of multiple censuses for judea when he writes ""this was the first census taken while quirinius was governor of syria."" certainly, the word ""first"" implies that more than one census happened.on another occasion, an enrollment of all the people of the empire happened to swear an oath of allegiance to caesar. in chapter 34 of res gestae augustus also notes, ""when i administered my thirteenth consulate (2 b.c.e.), the senate and equestrian order and roman people all called me father of the country, and voted that the same be inscribed in the vestibule of my temple"".3 josephus also mentions a time ""when all good people gave assurance of their good will to caesar"".4 these types of tributes would also require an enrollment of individuals from across the empire. orosius, a fifth century christian, links this registration with the birth of jesus saying that ""all of the peoples of the great nations were to take an oath"".5 taking all of this together, we have at least three censuses in the area of judea - one in 8 b.c., one starting around 2 b.c. and one in 6 a.d. the only point that is really in question, then, is whether luke was mistaken in ascribing this census to the time when quirinius was in the role of syrian governor. since quirinius wasn't governor of the syrian province until after archelaus was deposed, critics claim luke misidentified the census as the smaller one, which happened some 8-10 years after herod died. either luke is wrong on his dating of jesus' birth or matthew made up the story of herod the great and the killing of the infants. is this an accurate objection?the governorship of quirinius in studying this problem, there are two main solutions that christian scholars offer, and each has some good merit. the first point is the terminology luke uses when writing about quirinius' governorship over syria. in stating that quirinius controlled the syrian area, luke doesn't use the official political title of ""governor"" (""legatus""), but the broader term ""hegemon"" which is a ruling officer or procurator. this means that quirinius may not have been the official governor of judea, but he was in charge of the census because he was a more capable and trusted servant of rome than the more inept saturninus. justin martyr's apology supports this view, writing that quirinius was a ""procurator"", not a governor of the area of judea.6 as gleason archer writes, ""in order to secure efficiency and dispatch, it may well have been that augustus put quirinius in charge of the census-enrollment in syria between the close of saturninus's administration and the beginning of varus's term of service in 7 b.c. it was doubtless because of his competent handling of the 7 b.c. census that augustus later put him in charge of the 7 a.d. census.""7 archer also says that roman history records quirinius leading the effort to quell rebels in that area at exactly that time, so such a political arrangement is not a stretch. if quirinius did hold such a position, then we have no contradiction. the first census was taken during the time of jesus birth, but josephus' census would have come later. this option seems to me to be entirely reasonable. herod's slaughter of the babies your second question is quite different in its format. you ask why, if herod committed such an atrocity as killing all the male babies ""two years old and under"" as matthew recounts, how could historians such as josephus completely ignore it? well, let's think about this for a moment. bethlehem at the time of jesus' birth was a very small city with no more than a few thousand people. the total number of infants who would have been murdered under herod's edict could be pretty low. as james patrick holding writes ""how many boys aged two and under could there have been in and around the tiny city of bethlehem? five? ten? matthew does not give a number. josephus says that herod murdered a vast number of people, and was so cruel to those he didn't kill that the living considered the dead to be fortunate. thus, indirectly, josephus tells us that there were many atrocities that herod committed that he does not mention in his histories - and it is probable that authorizing the killing of the presumably few male infants in the vicinity of bethlehem was a minuscule blot of the blackness that was the reign of herod. being that the events of the reign of herod involved practically one atrocity after another - it is observed by one writer, with a minimum of hyperbole, that hardly a day in his 36-year reign passed when someone wasn't sentenced to death - why should any one event in particular have touched off a rebellion, when others in particular, including those recorded by josephus, did not?""8 i hope these discussions have helped you further your understanding of the difficulties historians face when trying to piece together events from the limited records of the past. there is certainly no slam-dunk evidence that the biblical accounts are wrong here. in fact, one must also remember that the biblical accounts are themselves historic documentation and therefore have historic merit in themselves. the fact that we have outside corroboration of the possibility of multiple censuses strengthens luke's report of the events as he has written them. to say that this is an error would be premature. (which is basically the link as i didn't want to type all that.) and more importantly what i believe.",0,,

883920,"&gt;  **the myth of supply**   &gt;  international adoption wasn‚Äôt always a demand-driven industry. half a century ago, it was primarily a humanitarian effort for children orphaned by conflict. in 1955, news spread that bertha and henry holt, an evangelical couple from oregon, had adopted eight korean war orphans, and families across the united states expressed interest in following their example. since then, international adoption has become increasingly popular in australia, canada, europe, and the united states. americans adopted more than 20,000 foreign children in 2006 alone, up from just 8,987 in 1995. half a dozen european countries regularly bring home more foreign-born children per capita than does the united states. today, canada, france, italy, spain, and the united states account for 4 out of every 5 international adoptions.  &gt;  changes in western demography explain much of the growth. thanks to contraception, abortion, and delayed marriages, the number of unplanned births in most developed countries has declined in recent decades. some women who delay having children discover they‚Äôve outwaited their fertility; others have difficulty conceiving from the beginning. still others adopt for religious reasons, explaining that they‚Äôve been called to care for children in need. in the united states, a motive beyond demography is the notion that international adoption is somehow ‚Äúsafer‚Äù‚Äîmore predictable and more likely to end in success‚Äîthan many domestic adoptions, where there‚Äôs an outsized fear of a birth mother‚Äôs last-minute change of heart. add an ocean of distance, and the idea that needy children abound in poor countries, and that risk seems to disappear.  &gt;  but international adoptions are no less risky; they‚Äôre simply less regulated. just as companies outsource industry to countries with lax labor laws and low wages, adoptions have moved to states with few laws about the process. poor, illiterate birthparents in the developing world simply have fewer protections than their counterparts in the united states, especially in countries where human trafficking and corruption are rampant. and too often, these imbalances are overlooked on the adopting end. after all, one country after another has continued to supply what adoptive parents want most.  &gt;  in reality, there are very few young, healthy orphans available for adoption around the world. orphans are rarely healthy babies; healthy babies are rarely orphaned. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not really true,‚Äù says alexandra yuster, a senior advisor on child protection with unicef, ‚Äúthat there are large numbers of infants with no homes who either will be in institutions or who need intercountry adoption.‚Äù  &gt;  that assertion runs counter to the story line that has long been marketed to americans and other westerners, who have been trained by images of destitution in developing countries and the seemingly endless flow of daughters from china to believe that millions of orphaned babies around the world desperately need homes. unicef itself is partly responsible for this erroneous assumption. the organization‚Äôs statistics on orphans and institutionalized children are widely quoted to justify the need for international adoption. in 2006, unicef reported an estimated 132 million orphans in sub-saharan africa, asia, latin america, and the caribbean. but the organization‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúorphan‚Äù includes children who have lost just one parent, either to desertion or death. just 10 percent of the total‚Äî13 million children‚Äîhave lost both parents, and most of these live with extended family. they are also older: by unicef‚Äôs own estimate, 95 percent of orphans are older than 5. in other words, unicef‚Äôs ‚Äúmillions of orphans‚Äù are not healthy babies doomed to institutional misery unless westerners adopt and save them. rather, they are mostly older children living with extended families who need financial support.  &gt;  the exception is china, where the country‚Äôs three-decades-old one-child policy, now being loosened, has created an unprecedented number of girls available for adoption. but even this flow of daughters is finite; china has far more hopeful foreigners looking to adopt a child than it has orphans it is willing to send overseas. in 2005, foreign parents adopted nearly 14,500 chinese children. that was far fewer than the number of westerners who wanted to adopt; adoption agencies report many more clients waiting in line. and taking those children home has gotten harder; in 2007, china‚Äôs central adoption authority sharply reduced the number of children sent abroad, possibly because of the country‚Äôs growing sex imbalance, declining poverty, and scandals involving child trafficking for foreign adoption. prospective foreign parents today are strictly judged by their age, marital history, family size, income, health, and even weight. that means that if you are single, gay, fat, old, less than well off, too often divorced, too recently married, taking antidepressants, or already have four children, china will turn you away. even those allowed a spot in line are being told they might wait three to four years before they bring home a child. that has led many prospective parents to shop around for a country that puts fewer barriers between them and their children‚Äîas if every country were china, but with fewer onerous regulations.  &gt;  one such country has been guatemala, which in 2006 and 2007 was the no. 2 exporter of children to the united states. between 1997 and 2006, the number of guatemalan children adopted by americans more than quadrupled, to more than 4,500 annually. incredibly, in 2006, american parents adopted one of every 110 guatemalan children born. in 2007, nearly 9 out of 10 children adopted were less than a year old; almost half were younger than 6 months old. ‚Äúguatemala is a perfect case study of how international adoption has become a demand-driven business,‚Äù says kelley mccreery bunkers, a former consultant with unicef guatemala. the country‚Äôs adoption process was ‚Äúan industry developed to meet the needs of adoptive families in developed countries, specifically the united states.‚Äù  &gt;  because the vast majority of the country‚Äôs institutionalized children are not healthy, adoptable babies, almost none has been adopted abroad. in the fall of 2007, a survey conducted by the guatemalan government, unicef, and the international child welfare and adoption agency holt international children‚Äôs services found approximately 5,600 children and adolescents in guatemalan institutions. more than 4,600 of these children were age 4 or older. fewer than 400 were under a year old. and yet in 2006, more than 270 guatemalan babies, all younger than 12 months, were being sent to the united states each month. these adopted children were simply not coming from the country‚Äôs institutions. last year, 98 percent of u.s. adoptions from guatemala were ‚Äúrelinquishments‚Äù: babies who had never seen the inside of an institution were signed over directly to a private attorney who approved the international adoption‚Äîfor a very considerable fee‚Äîwithout any review by a judge or social service agency.",1,-1,

783270,"crates. are they both ok with being in a crate? you are going to have to get used to doing some real management of space with those two.   i have had friends who managed a household with multiple dogs with severe aggression. you basically have to have an armed camp mentality about the two dogs. understand that if they currently are fighting and they don't live together, this won't improve when they have to share space.   designate one room as the chow's room and the other for the shar pei. keep a crate in each one. rotate the dogs out for time with you guys: if you're watching tv, take one dog out, and hang out with him. after an hour, put that dog back in his room, and get the other dog.   don't be fooled for one minute that all of a sudden thru some magical nonsense or other that they will love each other. that's how people wind up in the er with the plastic surgeon getting lots of stitches.    once you guys are living together, and you take them for walks on neutral ground, you can see if they still, no matter what, are aggressive towards each other. if they are, understand that that won't change, especially if you can not afford a trainer. if they seem to be more or less ok with each other, you can gradually increase time together in the house, but **not** when there is food around.   the reason why i am so cautious is that dogs tend to learn from fights with their housemates. they learn to hate each other more, so you really don't' want it to get to that stage.   the reason for the crate in a room is in case you have that clueless friend who wanders in and wants to let fluffy out to chill with muffy. a locked crate is usually a deterrent even to the most derpy of friends.",0,,
726651,"part 2:  i'm 21, but i feel simultaneously young, like i never had normal teenage years and am just starting now, and old, like i've had a moment of clarity about my life, some older person's wisdom that 1. i know nothing, (whereas in my teenage years i thought i knew everything, which gave me in my mind carte blanche to act like a jerk,) and that's normal, 2. i need to turn my life around, and stop hating everything and everyone and being angry, and 3. that i'm really young still, like if i was an old man who could go back and do things over and start at 20, that's how old i feel in my youth. i think a whole lot of my generation are going to start having this realization soon, and shed the angry nerd and angry jerk thing and work on developing nice, appealing, actually social and human personalities and improve looks. that's what i'm trying to do, is to fix my personality and looks in order to become, rather than a ""nice guy,"" or a ""bad ass,"" a ""good man."" i want to be a good man, a true man, an excellent man, in at least some field, with a passion and drive to improve in my passions and hobbies. like john c reilly in magnolia, and as you may or may not have guessed, my passion is film. but i do think a surge of that realization and urge to change will sweep my generation like a fire through a wheat field as we realize we don't want to wallow in anger anymore.  perhaps some national or global crisis will facilitate or necessitate that. perhaps some real, imminent crisis, a war, a bad depression, etc, will make my generation step up as we're about to wake up. like if your house was being burgled, and you had already started to wake up before everyone else, and then the burglar set off the alarm. i think my realization that i need to start actually having a nice personality and being a fucking human being was a product of natural and gradual change and maturity and really just ""growing up,"" and as i feel the malaise in my generation is widespread, perhaps the ""waking up"" will happen in a wave, and start before and after some crisis necessitates the waking up, the burglar alarm that makes us start working toward some important goal and re-asses what's really important and what we feel about our lives. as louis ck says, ""everything is amazing and nobody is happy,"" and later on the opie &amp; anthony show: ""there's still a lot of fat we need to shed from our country before we have to move grandma into the attic and sell apples on the street corner in order to not starve to death. we still have hot dog eating contests and the superbowl.""  in putting these two maxims together, my theory is that our culture is superficial and frivolous and focused on the wrong things, which can spawn widespread malaise, unhappiness, and anger. ""we know things are bad, worse than bad."" the angry rationalist's reaction is therefore to bow out. if the society experiences some crisis wherein its priorities shifts and it self-corrects, the individual is more likely to align or care about the society and greater community, and work on himself in order to work on society. narcissism will be replaced with community and charity, frivolity by responsibility, selfishness by teamwork, etc, etc... and the thing is, the ""normal"" members of my generation are sort of already adept at efficiency, teamwork, all that good stuff. (my beef with them has always been that they're phonies, i go to a very capitalist right wing business school, full of these fledgling gordon gekkos, all very achievement and task oriented, but strident and grating in their networking and personalities. in the wake of some national crisis, i suspect mere quibbles over personality will disappear, although political differences remain. hopefully political discourse will become more civil.)  i hear a lot of angry older people (actually a minority of the generations, of course, but i think centered around generation x, which statistically had a difficult life, as there were so many of them born, and in a time where their parent's (who statistically, being born in the depression, had very easy lives, as there were so few of them born, don draper notwithstanding) divorce rates were high, saying that my generation is the worst one ever. and i actually believe that's true. but where our conclusions differ is that when i was a teenager i thought everyone else in my generation was the worst ever. now i realize i was part of the problem by not engaging, by removing myself, by treating other humans like garbage, by being an angry narcissistic baby, which is the worst cruelty one can inflict on fellow man. as the ancient greeks said, these actions, ""although causing no harm, cause pain."" so i do think my generation is generally the worst ever right now, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the anti-social meanness of the outcasts i once was, to the superficial phoniness of the achievement oriented, capitalist ""upper castes"" of my generation, the ""normals,"" as it were, but what generation isn't terrible in its adolescence?. but again where our conclusions differ is that i think my generation is going to experience a 180 degree shift in priorities, gradually or suddenly, and have to step up, and will hopefully become one of the greatest generations by the time we all come of age and mature.  whereas generation x statistically had difficult childhoods and adolescents, i think they're going to be powerful and effective leaders in middle age and elder age, perhaps during turbulent and awful time (think jon stewart). they're equipped to deal with it, and will stay consistent in that in order to be successful. i think my generation, meanwhile, has had easy childhoods and adolescence, and will have a difficult adult period, which will make us change and adapt but come out ""good."" in the end.  the stereotype of generation x was that they were depressed, cynical youth, but i think men like jon stewart and louis ck are actually the rule in that generation now rather than the exception, and will actually be great ""moralists"" when they run society. the boomers were never all that moral. they talked the talk but didn't walk the walk. jon stewart and louis ck, despite (or perhaps because they're comics) are sane voices in an insane world, and i'm amazed this insane world accepts them. they're only going to grow more important to us as they get older, i believe. as pamela adlon said of louis ck, ""you're not a comedian. you're a teacher."" listening to louis ck's rant (not an angry or loud rant, really, more of an ambling speech with some comedy) about modern society on opie &amp; anthony (part 1 of 3 of the greatest and most truthful thing i've heard in years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=indwcenfhtq&amp;feature=related ) makes me so hopeful. because despite the fact he's talking about how bad things are, he's shining a light on it. what a great man. and i think he's going to inspire my generation.  the ""angry nerd"" thing has got to go. nobody is genuinely nice anymore. but i think that's going to change. i hope.  tl;dr mean nerdy assholes fuck themselves over.  and of course this theory is very american-centric, although i am a canadian in canada. forgive me.",1,2,1

141741,"now, this next bit is, how can a put this; delicate.  you see, for a very long time this country's fiscal and moral and social and political foundations have been rotted to the core by the baby boomers.  you know, the people you call mom and dad.  also known as: old people.  i see a couple of you shaking your heads.  sorry, but let's face it, if you take social security or have medicare or are legally obligated to take withdrawals from your ira, assuming you still have one and haven't spent it already, then you are old.  but, but, but, i think it's time to stop blaming the baby boomers for everything.  yes, they took the country to a party and kept giving it four loko until it could barely stand, then escorted it out behind the barn and proceded to cornhole it until its ass was a gelantenous mess of viagrified old person ejaculer fraiche.  and, yes, then they went back to the party to bitch that somebody drank all the four loko, which, it wouldn't surprise me at all, if it was in a little juice box.  from a wal-mart.  bought with an hsa card because their credit card was maxed out.  well, finally, thankfully, i think we can say that this wave of the party is closing out, and the only logistical problem we need to worry about is how in the hell we're going to bus all these people back home where they can pass out dead drunk, maybe actually dead, but that's just wishful thinking, in the living room of their forclosed-on home.  the baby boomer party is over.  ok, ok, thank you, i know, right? ok.  unfortunately.  unfortunately for the rest of you, the twenty percent who showed up and stuck it out, i've got some bad news.  i mean generation x.  while the boomers, god rest their fat-assed docker-wearing souls, were busy fucking everything to death, first each other in the sixties, then themselves in the seventies, then everyone in the eights, then just fucking every inanimate or animate or digital thing over the last twenty years, they went and did what chemically coerced and morally and rationally impaired fertile animals do: had a bunch of kids.  i'd ask if you've heard of these little scamps, but you can't listen to the radio for thirty fucking seconds without somebody talking about them.  and, of course, i mean the millenials.  and, specifically, their feelings.  in the past, i would have put all the blame squarely on the baby boomers for raising emotionally neutered children.  but i, a reasonable and rational adult, have to draw the line at some point.  now the government, which i hardly ever listen to unless they've happened to do something incredibly entertaining like bombing a brown country again, which we've been getting a lot of since that day when two planes pulverized two phallic projections of our financial hegemony, plus, plus, don't forget, a bonus third building, because fucking boomers have to have goddamn bakers' dozens on everything, even their terrorist attacks, the government identifies adulthood by age.  depending where you live, it could be eightneen, or nineteen, or twenty one, or if you live in a particularly brown country and have the unfortunate genetic disposition of being female, eight, inasmuch as it matters for marriage.  or, if you were to go way, way back to roman times, you might be as old as twenty nine or thirty before you transcended adolescence.  now, wait a moment.  the government currently classifies adults as late teens or early twenties, but here we have an entire generation holding onto their adolescence for dear life well into their late twenties and thirties.  maybe the romans were right.  maybe the threshold for adulthood really belongs much higher than it is.  which means we somehow have to produce a whole other swatch of children's shows for fucking- and killing-age adults.  you know, like colosseums and brothels.  because, when you think about it, a brothel is really just a childish fuck game for emotionally stunted people who have no concept of physical and emotional relationships.  yeah, and we'll follow the baby boomers, and follow in rome's footsteps, because that worked out so well for both of them.  you see, having an entire generation that has not had, and i won't use the word opportunity because the millenials, like the boomers, have - had - every - opportunity.  a generation that has not had the werewithal to put down their oxygenated water, swallow that bite of grass-fed grass shit they like to eat, shut off their fucking smartphones, and, you know, socialize.  no, they don't do that.  not really.  i know, i know, they've got an app for it.  i get it. an app for a service created by socially and emotionally stunted millenials.  and you think, social applications written by people with warped views of society, who are incapable of actually doing this in person, is in any way a good substitute for, you know, talking to someone?  discussing your feelings?  having a serious and private conversation about the pros and cons of how a rimjob would enhance your marriage?  don't worry, you don't have to have that conversation.  there's an app for it.  you just press the little icon, it's a tongue with a little brown ring, and publish it to your profile for everyone else to like.  you might even put a little meme there, like a dog licking its ass, with some poetic verse you cribbed, because you're too intellectually stunted to come up with anything on your own, like: thinking of you, sweety pie. and this hyper-narcissistic generation, who we can't ever seem to tune out, wonders why people are always down on their feelings?  let me tell you something: i had the same thing growing up.  it wasn't an app, or a social network, or a meme, or a tweet, or a bite. we just had friends. and we had stickers.  sometimes, if you had a couple extra cents, you had a sticker that smelled.  usually like a skunk, or a throat lozenge.  if you were a rich kid, you had a shiny foil sticker.  and nothing has really changed since then, except we stopped doing that shit in second grade, and you're still doing it when you're thirty.  normally, i'd just say grow the fuck up and leave it at that.  but i can't, because all signs point at an entire generation of perpetual adolescents living on the retirement savings, and afterglow, and nepetism, of their baby boomer parents.  well, eventually, they are going to die, and you've got this other generation that is getting filled up with piss and vinegar over both you and your parents, and who, by they way, can, sometimes, you know, work, as opposed to the one lone skill millenials have which is self grandisize.  so, nowadays, how do you tell a narcissitic man-child to grow the fuck up?  i don't know, because, honestly, if it was my dad and i was twenty nine years old living in his basement with no job, he'd have taken off his belt and - see, corporal punishment for kids over the age of eighteen is a special case - and, oh, yes, i have to wear a belt too because, as you can see, i have no ass, and i got that flat back from somewhere, and he'd give me one good lick across the back of the head and told me to wake the fuck up.  and if i, a man child, finally stood up and knocked him the fuck out, i can only imagine that is what he wanted all along. sadly, nowadays, if a parent had to restort to extreme tactics, you know, what every parent did all the time throughout history until only a few decades ago, they'd probably post a frowny face on facebook and then someone would call cps.  and, here's the sad and warped way the millenials are showing up to the boomer party, going straight behind the barn, and continuing to cornhole the country.  they wouldn't be upset at the corporal punishment part.  no, it would be because somebody hurt their feelings.  there is the whole trend nowadays with political correctness, which really isn't so much a trend as it is the reality of having an entire generation of self-obsessed children wandering aimlessly towards adulthood.  but just because you're older, doesn't make you an adult, and sadly, i don't think they can be until their parents hurry up and fucking die and force them to take responsibility for themselves.  so i guess, in a way, i am still blaming the baby boomers a little bit, but, largely, i blame millenials themselves.  you have grown up and were, and continue to be, bamboozled by sociopathic technology mavens. you are all like heroin junkies, except in stead of actual junk, it's digital junk, and like a junkie, you're looking to keep that good feeling high going for as long as it can.  unfortunately, the rest of us have to put up with you miserable wrecks until we can work up some kind of social media methadone app you can install on your phone and get yourself clean. because, like they say, help starts with you wanting to help yourself.  sad because someone hurt your feelings?  aww.  want some help?  here, we'll help you.  no?  then fuck you.  i don't have a closing for this, so i'll just go right into something lighter.  colonoscopies.  good cancer screening practice, or homosexual agenda?  here is a list of things you can leave in your ass to identify your doctor's motivations ....",1,-2,-2

443735,"there was this experiment where apes were trained to do a complex task involving fingers. as they were learning the task, the motor areas associated with the fingers enlarged. after they had mastered the task however, the motor areas shrunk back to normal..  we see similar patterns in athletes...pro-sportsmen show less brain activation than novices .  the ability being learned doesn't disappear along with the brain matter of course. no doubt it has been hard-coded in some other, more instinctive part of the brain (perhaps the cerebellum?). once we learn a skill, we don't need to think about it as much. it becomes ""second nature"", ""automatic""...all of these words suggest that more primitive portions of our brain are taking over.  as we age, we don't *need* all that expensive gray matter. as long as the environment doesn't shift too rapidly, we can rely on wisdom, past experience, and learned instincts to guide us. most of what we needed to learn to survive we learned in childhood - at least, for most of our evolutionary past. that may no longer be true today of course, but our biology has yet to catch up. this is essentially why older people have trouble adapting to change and learning new things, whereas infants can learn a language within a few months. despite all the wisdom they have gained over the years, older people don't have the raw brain-power granted by the gray matter that young children are blessed with. as we age, we simultaneously become wiser and less intelligent.   in fact, some people theorize that human intelligence partly arises from a retention of juvenile traits (such as the ability to learn) into adulthood. compared to other apes, we develop slowly and are generally more child-like in our physiology.   the best way to slow the trend of aging is to continue mastering *new* tasks, putting strain on those parts of the brain",1,1,-1
256917,"&gt; 1- what are the pros and cons of pregnancy?  pros:  you kind of enter a new sort of world where it's hard for you to do anything socially unacceptable. enjoy wearing what you please, going barefoot in church, and if you're starving at the grocery store, just open something and eat/drink it and then pay for the empty container at checkout. i'd always been really timid in public, and i gained a lot of confidence during pregnancy that i kept as a parent.  there isn't actually a lot of work involved in being pregnant. the baby making pretty much happens by itself while you're doing whatever you're doing. taking care of the baby mostly means taking care of yourself.  it's fun to play games with the baby later in the pregnancy. i liked to play the poking game where you prod in a certain spot until the baby kicks back. the baby does respond to its environment - will have sleep and wake cycles, will respond to your music (and come to like your favorites) - one of mine, the girl, my poor husband never got to feel her move around because she got really still whenever she heard his voice. for my eldest, i was playing final fantasy x while heavily pregnant and i would put the vibrating controller on his feet. when he was an infant, i could make him happy by putting on ffx and putting the vibrating controller on his feet.  which feeds into the next fun part. the personality is already apparent in the womb. i thought my youngest never slept; his hands and feet twitch in his sleep. (he's 4 now.) my middle was nicknamed 'flip'. my eldest was a determined kicker, and that fits his personality to this day.  the whole pregnancy/childbirth process is stretching. not just for your body, but for your soul. it makes you stronger, better able to handle difficult circumstances, less queasy about bodily stuff, and dampens neuroses.  pregnancy turned my hair - permanently - from straight with a slight turn-under at the ends into a set of gorgeous natural loose beachy curls that require absolutely no upkeep whatsoever. ymmv.  cons:  some of the symptoms will be annoying. which ones are annoying and to what degree will really depend on the person and the pregnancy.  it gets hard to sleep when you're later on in the pregnancy. late pregnancy especially is fairly uncomfortable/unwieldy and labor hurts.  your emotions go all over the place. more than usual. they're stronger, too, and harder to manage.  some of the activity/food restrictions might irk you, especially if they coincide with a craving for a forbidden food.  &gt; 2- what was your rational as to why you should have kids?   mostly, i just always wanted to have them. it seemed like a good reason to establish a home and a good way to establish a family. i had a good upbringing and enjoy having parents, siblings, grandparents etc. and being part of, well, a generation.  i suppose that part of it was defiance, having been raised in a 'blue state' where i got to hear modern feminism early and often, usually mocking my mother, a stay-at-home homeschooling mom who can read latin and greek (self-taught) among other things. i wouldn't have had children for no other reason (or even as a significant reason) than to spite them, but it did help.  in a profound way, it's like giving back to the universe, and like ensuring that the universe will continue to have people like me inflicted upon it.  &gt; 3- i read intjs aren't the ideal parent for babies and toddlers, does it sound true from your experience?  ehh.... nobody is the ideal parent. a good parent depends on how much you're willing to set aside your needs for the kids' needs, not just your type. also, as your kids are often similar to you, they will probably be happier with your methods than with another personality's.  i was able to work with an intuitive understanding of the kid's needs, plus being able to both enact a structure and alter that structure as necessary to meet a baby's changing needs. i tended to research ""alternative methods"", including learning from other cultures, in hopes to find the most elegant ways forward. when i was overwhelmed, i was able to rationally identify my sources of exhaustion and reconfigure my methods. dealing with infants into early toddlerhood is a very organic process, which fits better with the intj than with someone who freaks out unless everything is measured and quantified or someone who is so very laid back that he/she might veer into unintentional neglect.  &gt; 4- how do you like taking care of another human being who completely dependent of yourself and your so?  well, i get grumpy when i lose sleep. that kind of goes back into the ""stretching experience"" thing, though. it's made me less self-centered and self-indulgent and more able to handle things like elderly parents or friends with special needs.  my children are currently age 14, 7, and 4, and it's delightful. i mean, it isn't all roses, of course, and there are times and ways that it's very difficult, but it's a good kind of difficult. they're each individual human beings, and it is fun watching them grow, identifying new quirks and seeing them develop their own philosophies and fantasies, watching them attempt things you never would have thought of doing. it's also fun to see the blend of you and your so to different degrees in your children.  finally, the process of raising children really does force you to confront and identify parts of your own behavior that you might never have thought to address, when you see it coming out in innocent little people. intj's tend to like individualism, which gives me the advantage of *hoping* that they can do better with what i gave them than i have with what i've got, but not feeling like i have a personal-selfish *need* for them to do so. meanwhile, though, i have things i need to improve and things i have improved in myself that i might have never had challenged if i'd decided to remain child-free.",1,2,

731411,"&gt; i'm a millennial and honestly i don't understand why we have such a terrible rap. we are no different than the children and youth born before us,  in some ways you are correct: all across history, older generations have *always* ""bemoaned"" the younger generations -- as being ""lazy"" directionless, entitled, etc; the whole ""stereotype"" -- and to a large extent that is also a ""true"" stereotype (i.e. but ""typical"" is like an ""average"" or ""median"" there is always a spectrum, and ""distributions"" across that spectrum), it's just that *each generation also shifts the distribution on that spectrum over time*, as it matures and takes on responsibilities and thus outgrows the prior immature weighting (and ""stereotype"").  but i would argue that -- this time, with millennials -- there actually **are some significant differences**.  &gt;except that we were born into an age of extreme technological advancement.  and while that is one of them... and it impacts and influences others -- it isn't the sole difference -- nor is it as ""simple"" (superficial, trivial) as that. it isn't *just* that you have a smartphone in your pocket from puberty onward... it's what the implications and consequences of that (especially given other major changes in society -- which i will hit on below\*).  so -- in addition to the available, pervasive ""cheap"" technology (and the general *objective* {especially vs prior generations} ""affluence"" of that) -- there are a host of things that are (among other effects) effectively **delaying/deferring the ""normal"" maturation progression**.  things (again more below\*) which have arguably intensified the levels of ""entitlement, etc"" and which have also shifted the normal distribution more heavily into the negative territory (i.e. that -- if we think of maturity/responsibility as a positive number territory, and immaturity/irresponsibility as negative numbers, then [if we were to plot the various generations {at the similar age-ranges &amp; stages} -- prior generations would have looked like the gold or red lines, whereas millennials are more like the blue and green lines](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/normal_distribution_pdf.svg) -- we can sort of turn it into a ""picture"").  ---  \*ok, what ""other things""?  well just like the technology, these are things that simply ""are"" -- things your generation was born into, and which are shaping you/them (and shaping your generations ""character"", and the level, distribution, and the *timing* of the development of it) -- and these are things that are in fact relatively ""unique"" and ""new"" and *fundamentally different* than prior generations (especially in the us, but similar trends in other ""developed"" nations):  1. government monetary, financial, trade, foreign policy, and taxation, welfare, etc -- combining into a ""socio-economic policy regime""-- these have all dramatically changed and especially altered the ""environment"" to be substantially different than the one that prior generations grew up and matured under.  2. at the same time, ""traditional"" mores have changed as well -- while there has always been a minority of the population that was ""agnostic/atheistic"" and considered ""morals"" (and ethics) to be mere ""societal constructs"" -- for the first time, the view that everything (even base fundamentals) is relative and subjective, and even ""fluid"" (i.e. subject to political/propaganda ""vote"") *has become pervasive* (it is present in every group, even the so called ""traditional conservatives"" have accepted it {even if they are not aware of having done so}), and the millennials are really the first generation growing up under that kind of a (solipsistic/nihilistic) philosophically amoral world-view.  3. a big part of the above has been the combined effect of the things under 1 &amp; 2 on the home (family) environment: the number of kids growing up in rather ""chaotic"" homes, either with divorced, divorced and remarried, or never married, single-parent (often with shifting ""live-in"" boyfriends/girlfiends, etc) has dramatically increased -- what was once an outlier, a rarity, the ""exception"", has now become the ""norm"" if indeed not the vast majority.  4. a further result of that (of 1 &amp; 2 combined with #3) is a dramatic change in parenting styles, and thus in the life-experience (or rather lack thereof) of the children growing up in the families: i.e. the advent (and pervasive/normality) of parents who:        * no longer ""discipline"" children (i.e. no ""stick""), but instead:        * who (often probably out of a sense of guilt over the chaotic/unstable family structure, as well as the desire to see kids ""not deprived of anything"") tend to go overboard in terms of ""gifts/toys/etc"" -- in essence virtually buying their child's love and obedience (i.e. lots of ""carrots"")... and who then     * seeks to ""be friends"" with their children, and if/when that doesn't work     * become overbearing, micromanaging ""helicopter"" parents (i.e. rather than letting kids -- as the majority of kids in prior generations did -- operate as ""free range"" individuals, living largely unsupervised lives outdoors) who plan/shape their children's experience (as if they were some ""experiment"" to be controlled in some scientifically correct fashion)...     * and then (when that doesn't work), the same parents (ironically given that they claim to be all about their kids' ""self-esteem"") seek to label their children as ""brain damaged"" (i.e. add, adhd, bipolar, ""brain chemical imbalance"" etc), and then seek out medications (amphetamines &amp; other similarly psychoactive and purportedly ""controlled distribution"" substances, the actual permanent effects of which -- especially on the developing brain structure of children and teens -- is entirely unknown; but given the effects of such substances on adults... well, this should be more of a source of concern than it actually is) -- in order to gain ""compliance"" and ""obedience"" (and make the children perform according to ""the plan"" even if it is as mentally and emotionally-stunted robotic-drones).  5. toss in the downturn in the economy -- as well as the pervasive nature of mortgage-sized schooling debts (the price of a house, but without the house) -- and the effects of ""globalization"" (as well as the flat/inverted demographic population pyramid) all lead to (currently) an absence of viable upward (truly *productive* activity) career paths, much less flattened wages/salaries; *and that in turn, leads to a very (understandingly depressing) state of ""ennui"" within the generation just entering the adult-working world.* (and no, despite what the futurology-types are claiming {and which understandably many millennial want to believe in, if only because it is an optimistic/utopian view, and they have been fed so many pessimistic/dystopian things} the current major unemployment in the western nations is not due to advances in tech -- it is entirely due to government/corporate trade policies; shifting major portions of productive operations overseas, in order to boost the short-term profits {and thus feed into the pension-monster of the boomers}.)  **now all of those things come together and -- like it or not -- they do indeed shape the character of those who grow up under them.**   who is to blame?  well, in many ways not the millennials themselves -- they after all were merely the ""clay"" that was molded -- the shape that they have taken on is not really their own work (at least not yet), but rather the work of their parents, teachers, leaders, etc. (if a dog has become ""vicious"" at attacks random strangers, it probably isn't the dog's fault -- the same breed, even the same dog, *raised in a better environment* could have become an excellent workdog, or a very loving, caring, and entirely safe family pet.)  on the other hand -- it is in fact character (i.e. the end result) that we are talking about here: and it doesn't matter who is to blame, once the metal has cooled (and the person matured), it will have taken on the shape of the mold it was cast into...  alas, therein comes the problem -- and the question.  humans aren't ""dogs"" and they aren't ""molded metal"" (or clay). humans do have brains, we do have free will, choices, and **eventually become (have to become) responsible for ourselves** and our own ""character"" development...  whether we can entirely ""recreate"" ourselves, and in a fashion that corrects (or alas, possibly worsens) the character that was formed by parents, teachers, leaders, society... is an open question. and then an additional question: who then gets the credit or the blame; and at what point in time (what age) is that determined?  when does the ""child"" become truly responsible for what the ""adult"" version of him/herself actually is?    or looked at another way -- how long can any ""adult"" continue to shift blame for their own circumstances onto others?  ---  &gt;don't believe what the media says about us because it's bullshit- the youth of this generation is no different than the youth of your generation or the eventual youth of the next generation.  well, my own concerns are in fact not shaped by the media.  rather they are (largely) shaped by the millennials that i have interacted with on a personal basis -- granted some of them to greater degrees than others -- and i have not been encouraged (the willingness to learn {at least anything other than ""games""} versus the expectation of being taught {spoon-fed/hands-held}, and worse ""graded on a curve"" -- seems to be woefully absent... there is a ""learned helplessness"" that seems to be deeply ingrained and pretty pervasive: which plays out as lazy/entitled, etc).  and i think the ""stereotype"" (unfortunately) does ""fit"" a significant percentage (possibly a majority) of your generation; whereas by contrast such things used to be (or at least the evidence indicates it was) present in lesser degrees/extents in prior generations.  **whether it will continue to apply...well, only time will answer that.**",1,-1,0

908830,"so i watched a few clips from the twilight movie and skimmed a few scenes from the books at the store. and i have a few things to say about the phenomenon that's choking literature to death.  i like edward and bella. and by that i mean, i want them to be likable enough that people who have read more than harry potter can like them. (why oh why is hp the only thing that anyone ever compares fantasy books to? hp and lotr, gah. people need to read more). i've only read snippets, so my grasp of the mary/gary sue/stu-ness isn't complete, i don't know enough to dislike the characters. and so i give the benefit to them, for now.  to put some more context in this - i used to rp quite a lot. i had an on-going story with a friend that involved vampires. my character was an old vampire, his body 23, but mind several hundred years old. he was married to a liberal democratic anti-government 18 year old. you can see how this started to not work. it fell apart, rather quickly. he, and i frankly, couldn't stand how my friend's character acted, talked, thought. it was against everything he stood for, and just plain immature in many respects. so he left for his old lover, one as ancient in mind as he, so that worked out well.   but the point would be, old and new minds don't work- i know from personal experience.  unless one is very tolerant of what they basically pick up as childish behavior, in which case, lovers would not be the best relationship to have.  but edward is 17 in body. and in theory bella is mature. so it should work. i want it to work. i read these snippets and watch a scene, and want them to be actually good for each other.  because, as a chick, i like romance. yes, i know that's a generalization, but i think it's quite true in most regards - chicks like romance. we like paired up couples, we like fanfiction that centres around a couple even if the actual story it came from had nothing to do with love. we like subplots about love-- etc, etc, you get it.  as a writer, the concept isn't foreign. i've many a god or nymph or immortal creature fall for a young mortal. but considering the time-period i write in, a general 'older' time ranging from ancient civilizations to an elizabethan-y europe-type, the teenagers are mature. the young adults are of marriageable age, or have children already, so they aren't air-heads in biology class. in that manner, it's a smoother pairing. while the older might be more jaded, or more knowledgeable, the innocence that the younger has is not intolerable.  the story could have been interesting. could have been good. the cullens, from skimming wikipedia, formed as a family from random kids almost dying near dr. cullen and him vamping them up. and two of the foster kids are married to two other of the foster kids, which could have been a nice subplot to play with if it was written from the beginning to end.  edward falling in love with an outsider, a mortal who is in no danger of being dead in the near future, could have been nice to see. but... her ideas are good. i could even spin sparkly vampires [i was thinking of a fanfic to make it plausible - they're a type of sun-demon that were revered in the ancient world for being human-diamonds. once every so often a mortal girl would be chosen to have one of their children, so edward picks bella, etc, etc... blah anyways] but her prose is bad. edward's whole attitude is badly written, and we only have bella's pov, so any internal conflict is lost. though she's writing midnight sun, that might change. eh.  the fandom is absurd... half are 13 year old girls, and the other half, as in another article, are middle aged women. on that note, glance over the forums on twilightmoms.com if you want some lulz. it's scary how obsessed they are.  i know this is all scattered and not really a proper post. i think my main point is that, having not read the books in any real way, i want them to be good. 'cause the concepts could be done well. if bella was mature. and maybe if jacob didn't exist, he seems very added-on and not important from my grasp of things. but i know they're not. i know the prose is terrible, i know bella is too immature to date anyone, much less marry. i know if edward was 108 years old, he wouldn't bother with the air-head she is. and, sickeningly, i know the books are toted as brilliant by a good deal of people, i know meyer thinks edward is a literary-god, i know there are freaking twilight umbrella's and perfume for some stupid reason. and to my lulz, i know the actors who portray edward and bella don't even like the story themselves.  so i'm conflicted. i know it's a bad tale all around. i want it to be good. meh. i'm going to go read dracula now, or find my copy of the phantom of the opera. hell, write that fanfic maybe.   do comment as you please, i'm interested in hearing from fans or anti's. :)",1,-1,1

the answer is new labour has cleverly packaged caf as an aid to ‚Äòchild protection‚Äô and delivering better services as part of its every child matters project (ecm).  &gt; the ¬£224million programme has been beset by delays, incomprehensible acronyms and new labour gobbledegook. but let us not be deceived ‚Äì it is about control, not care, and spying, not safety.  &gt; ecm claims that nearly half of britain‚Äôs 11million children have ‚Äòadditional needs‚Äô, so must continuously be assessed for the giant database at the government‚Äôs department for schools and families.  &gt; caf questionnaires will be kept until they are 19, or for 75 years if they have been in care, and can be accessed electronically by hundreds of thousands of staff in other agencies.  &gt; contact point will also store information from databases kept by the nhs, gps, schools, the child benefit agency and the national pupil register. the potential for sensitive material about our children falling into malevolent hands is enormous.  &gt; incredibly, parental consent is not often required for this intrusion into children‚Äôs lives. youngsters from the age of 12 are deemed mature enough to agree to being caf-ed ‚Äì whatever their parents‚Äô objections. but campaigners stress that families should teach their children to say no: submitting to caf is, currently at least, voluntary. the government claims that the database will identify children at risk of poverty, abuse or future criminality. but since when did filling in endless forms release funds for frontline services, rather than divert them?  &gt; by bizarre coincidence ‚Äì or not ‚Äì this assault on treasured british notions of privacy and propriety was devised by the woman responsible for britain‚Äôs most notorious social-work scandal. ecm was launched in september 2003 by margaret hodge, tony blair‚Äôs shocking choice as britain‚Äôs first children‚Äôs minister.  &gt; attack on privacy: devised by britian's first children's minister margaret hodge  &gt; her main ‚Äòqualification‚Äô was being his pal and running islington council when its 12 children‚Äôs homes were awash with paedophiles and sympathisers of the ‚Äòleft-wing‚Äô paedophile information exchange. this campaigned for sex to be legalised with children from the age of four.  &gt; one can only wonder how many pervy petes within childcare today will relish being actively invited to ask children about their sexual behaviour (caf seemingly views this as normal), the ‚Äòsleeping arrangements‚Äô at home and how they feel about ‚Äòchanges to their body‚Äô.  &gt; i have been exposing child-abuse scandals for nearly 20 years and believe that this new stalinist bureaucracy will not save a single child. many of the paedophiles i exposed in hodge‚Äôs homes ‚Äògroomed‚Äô children for eventual abuse through precisely such questions. hodge claimed that constant state monitoring of children was justified by the victoria climbie scandal.  &gt; yet adequate powers to protect genuinely endangered children already exist. why, then, did the appalling mothers of shannon matthews and baby p retain their children? the problem was not lack of paperwork but too many stupid, politically correct people reading it and failing to act.  &gt; caf will not mean that the state now swoops on the demonic families in flea-infested homes with rottweilers and broken-backed babies. no, just as with the government‚Äôs fearless war on pensioner recycling ‚Äòlouts‚Äô, they will instead target and terrorise ordinary, decent families.  &gt; why? one reason is simply to control people. many of today‚Äôs new labour mps are ex-marxists and radical feminists who still believe that the family poses the greatest potential opposition to the strong state.  &gt; the government‚Äôs decreed desirable ‚Äòoutcomes‚Äô for children are so frighteningly broad that many decent parents could find themselves labelled failures or abusers.  &gt;everyone involved with children ‚Äì including volunteers, and police on raids ‚Äì is now expected to use the government‚Äôs ‚Äòpre-assessment checklist‚Äô, to see if they are achieving these five ‚Äòoutcomes‚Äô ‚Äì being healthy, staying safe, enjoying life, making a ‚Äòpositive contribution‚Äô and achieving ‚Äòeconomic well-being‚Äô.  &gt; even parents working desperately hard to feed their children and keep them safe could be classified as failing them. the questionnaire asks if children‚Äôs parents are ‚Äòover-protective‚Äô, and whether work leaves them ‚Äòtoo tired to pay attention to your needs‚Äô. caf practitioners are also taught specifically to ask if parents ‚Äòpromote a healthy lifestyle‚Äô and oppose ‚Äòbullying and discrimination‚Äô.  &gt; an increasingly rigid state already rejects potentially loving foster and adoptive carers who smoke or have politically ‚Äòincorrect‚Äô views because they are christian.  &gt; how long until natural parents are also found guilty of thought crime?  &gt; might damian green have been considered guilty of encouraging discrimination, through challenging the government on immigration?  &gt; the worst thing is that every child matters has made real protection work harder ‚Äì the highly effective child protection register was abolished in april and social workers are now drowning in paperwork about entirely innocent families.  &gt; a suppressed university of york study found it took them a day to enter data electronically on just one child.  &gt; terri dowty, director of action on rights for children, says: ‚Äòpeople should fill in caf questionnaires only if they have a real, defined need ‚Äì for example, a disabled child and they need equipment ‚Äì and then answer only strictly relevant questions. otherwise, parents should teach their children that if they are asked at school to fill in these forms to say that they want first to go home and discuss it.‚Äô  &gt; dowty fears that the new state questionnaire is ‚Äòdesigned to teach children to accept being interrogated and classified from the earliest age, by anyone and everyone. it is truly frightening‚Äô. no one, supposedly, can be forced to fill in a caf. but practitioners are advised to report the family to the local safeguarding children team ‚Äòif a common assessment is refused and you are concerned‚Äô. they may also store the caf centrally even when permission is refused.  &gt; campaigners are considering challenging caf in the european court of human rights, which has thrown out britain‚Äôs attempts to store innocent citizens‚Äô dna. but they desperately need benefactors and lawyers prepared to fund test cases and support innocent families under pressure.  &gt; tragically, britain, the cradle of parliamentary democracy, is becoming notorious worldwide for snooping on its citizens. professor nigel parton, nspcc professor of childhood studies at huddersfield university, warned a recent international conference in finland that the every child matters agenda means what we are witnessing is the emergence of the ‚Äòpreventive-surveillance state‚Äô, with ‚Äòmajor implications for the civil liberties and human rights of the citizen, particularly for children and parents‚Äô.  &gt; once, people who warned of a growing police state seemed paranoid. the damian green raid was a wake-up call. let us now protect our children, our and our country‚Äôs future, with all our might.  ...more on [tpuc.org](http://tpuc.org) about your freedoms, and check out their [forums](http://tpuc.org/node/44).",1,-1,
217507,"fallacy #1: circumcision is desirable because it promotes cleanliness and prevents disease. as an owner of an intact penis, i can confidently say that my cleaning habits are probably identical to yours and are more than sufficient to get the apparatus clean as a whistle. if our primary goal is removing people‚Äôs folds of protective, functional skin to prevent the possible accumulation of secretions, we should be going after baby girls with the scalpel. thankfully, this idea that would horrify most everyone in the u.s., and i think the idea of approaching baby boys similarly should be equally horrifying (http://historyofcircumcision.net/images/stories/resources/rd-rose07.pdf). regarding disease, the notion that circumcision is a legitimate preventative measure is simply unsubstantiated and, in fact, some research indicates that the foreskin may be protective against infection (http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/doc/mrsa.html). the rate of circumcision is a mere 6% in the uk, and, in fact, the u.s. may be the only developed nation to practice routine infant circumcision (http://www.cirp.org/library/general/wallerstein/). check out this global distribution map provided by the world health organization. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:global_map_of_male_circumcision_prevalence_at_country_level.png)  fallacy #2: the foreskin is unnecessary and can be removed with no adverse effects. in my experience, the loudest proponents of this argument are circumcised men who, with all due respect, don‚Äôt have much basis for comparison. admittedly, i have never had a circumcised penis myself, but accounts of men circumcised as adults compare the difference in sexual sensitivity after the procedure to seeing in black and white after once seeing in color. this seems understandable given the foreskin is significantly more highly innervated than the rest of the shaft. in my experience, the foreskin itself is the source of by far the most genital sensation and pleasure. in a circumcised adult male, the amount of skin missing is about the size of a 4x6 index card (depending on overall size)-over one third of the penile skin. the foreskin‚Äôs anatomical function is myriad. one important function is protecting the glans the way the eyelid protects the eye; in the absence of a foreskin, the glans becomes keratinized from rubbing against clothing and is much less sensitive (http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/boyle5/). another important function that the foreskin provides an erotogenic (good feeling!) gliding sheath over the shaft, reducing loss of lubrication and decreasing the friction that can decrease pleasure for both partners (http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=hss_pubs) . in infants the foreskin is adhered to the glans, like a fingernail, and so before it is cut off, it must be separated. one can imagine this is extremely painful and leaves the glans exposed before it is mature enough for the foreskin to separate on its own, usually during early childhood. additionally, i have both read about and personally known individuals with complications resulting from circumcision and, though very rarely, sometime even death can result from excessive blood loss or infection (http://www.cirp.org/library/death/). it should be noted that these cases, though rare indeed, occur with similar or greater frequency than deaths from penile cancer, which is often cited as a reason to circumcise. perhaps we should start removing infants toes at birth too, to prevent possible ingrown toenails in old age, or the dreaded toe cancer. just sayin‚Äô.  fallacy #3: if circumcision is going to be done, it is most ethical to do it during infancy, so the person won‚Äôt remember it. i‚Äôve heard many circumcised men remark that they sure are glad the procedure was done when they were babies so that they don‚Äôt have to remember it. while i agree that having a piece of my penis cut off without anesthesia is a memory i would prefer to avoid, there is a better way to avoid it-leaving those kids alone! as i become more educated about circumcision and find myself discussing it with others it seems that for every man who, with bravado, claims his circumcised member is exactly to his liking, there is at least one humble fellow who admits, sometimes with great emotion, that he wishes such important decisions about his body had been left to him-he would have chosen to spare himself a traumatic experience during his first moments and live life with a complete, intact penis. i am glad that so many circumcised men are as satisfied with their penises as i am with mine. i am also glad that so many wives and partners are equally pleased. however, i know some men and women who grieve the loss of the foreskin from their relationship and wonder how things would be different. when a baby boy is born he, obviously, can‚Äôt consent to the procedure and by the time his opinion can be known, it is often too late. parents must make many choices about their children without their consent, it‚Äôs true, but choosing a cosmetic genital surgery is, in my mind and many others‚Äô, taking that liberty way too far. if there is a chance your son wouldn‚Äôt want it done to his penis, why would you take the risk? at the end of the day, if you decline to circumcise your son, he always has the option to do so himself later in life. but if you consent to the procedure, everyone‚Äôs hands are tied. there is no way to fully restore what has been lost.  fallacy #4: intact penises are less cosmetically desirable. whoa there! again, i am relieved to know that so many men like the looks of their circumcised penises, and pleased that their partners share their appreciation, but this is a bold claim. understandably, people with positive experiences with a penis, their own or their partner‚Äôs, will develop an affinity for that specific penis and may come to think that theirs is the ‚Äúbest.‚Äù great. we want everyone to love their penis around here; taking good care of penises is really what we‚Äôre talking about anyway. but my wife emphatically prefers my penis just as it is: intact. and, i‚Äôm not gonna lie, so do i. people like the penises that they personally have good experiences with.  fallacy #5: it is important for a boy to look like his father. of all the fallacies, this one is the most confusing to me personally, probably because my dad is circumcised but i am not and neither are my three brothers-and nobody gives a rat‚Äôs. i understand that making a different choice for your son than your parents made for you may tacitly imply some level of dissatisfaction with your own experience, and heaven knows the idea that a man‚Äôs penis has been compromised is a bitter pill for him to swallow. however, in the spirit of this blog, i submit to you this question: is it manlier to protect your ego or your newborn? i know lots of circumcised guys who are proud as can be of their penises but leave their sons intact. in many other cases, the baby‚Äôs mother would prefer the baby be left alone and it is the father who insists on the surgery, without having done any real research on the subject. be a man, do your homework and be rational. emotions are important, but when protecting your pride comes before your duty to protect your family, something is out of whack.   http://www.cirp.org/  http://www.circumcision.org/  http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org",1,,1

179287,"alright, i'll bite. here is my take as a parent, a social media user, and a person who was once a child herself. **disclaimer: tl;dr ahead**  this is such a tricky issue, and like most tricky issues, i don't think there's a clean-cut, correct answer. like you said, the internet--especially social media--is new territory for parenting. so, unlike a lot of other parenting issues, there aren't many guidelines for new parents to follow, because the ramifications really haven't been explored yet. aside from safety issues (which i will address later), we really don't know the ramifications (psychological, social, etc.) of social media exposure in children, until they grow up and can start blogging about the all trauma it did/didn't cause them. that being said, as both a parent and someone with a base college-level understanding of child psychology (read: not an expert), i don't think it's at all traumatic for children when parents post photos of them online (i'm talking normal photos, and in moderation). i don't think today's infants will mind much in 15 years that photos of their younger selves were posted on their parents' facebooks. (i can honestly say that i wish social media had been around when i was a child, so i could have more than one good photo of my grandparents and more childhood photos of myself to pass to my own child.)  of course there will always be parents who take it too far, as with anything, and that is treading into sticky, unknown territory. i could see how repeatedly taking photos of your little one and posting them online could cause said child to become narcissistic and/or vain. nudity or potty photos should also be kept offline for obvious safety reasons and for the privacy of the child (fortunately, facebook and other social media sites actively remove these photos anyway). but other than that, i really have no problem with parents who share photos of their children on social media, and that opinion is based on a few reasons:  1. *""everything is actively trying to kill your kid!""* as parents, we hear this every single second of every single day. *""dangers, dangers everywhere! kidnappers, bugs, weapons, your kid's clothing, automobiles, other kids, school, walls, pillows, pedophiles, and boys-- oh my! [you can protect your kids for the low price of $$____.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pescft9txkw) isn't your child's safety worth more to you? good parents care! act now!""* **the reality** is, yes, there are dangers out there and we need to do our best to protect our children. but there is danger in every single thing you and your child does. you can have a heart attack taking a deuce on the pot. your pillows could smother you in your sleep. and two words about furniture: [killing machines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5otla5157c). hell, even your kid is actively trying to kill your kid (seriously, the biggest threat to your child is themselves). the actual likelihood of child abduction is rare (and usually involves custody disputes, domestic issues, or family drama), and is even rarer with a stranger as the perpetrator. the likelihood of a kidnapper targeting a specific, unrelated infant or toddler and tracking them down via a parent's social media postings is like *null* (but more likely when it's a teenager/adolescent *posting themselves,* rather than anything a parent posts when they're younger). does that mean it can't happen? no. but a predator is much, more more likely to target someone locally in a moment of opportunity than he/she is to seek out a random child on instagram. and anyone targeting your child is much more likely to be a family member or acquaintance.  perpetuating the idea that parents need to be hyper-vigilant against invisible forces is much more dangerous because it ignores the true statistical probability, shifts focus from actual and probable dangers, and opens the door for more-likely-occurring abuse.  2. my own personal experiences. i live in a community where a certain religion underlies nearly every social experience. i left my parents' church when i was a teenager. being true to myself and honest with my family meant losing everything and everyone i loved in my small, unforgiving community. i was cast out from my family, ostracized by my peers, and left completely alone. after the initial shock wore off, i didn't mind being alone too much... *until* i became a parent. after i had my daughter, i realized just how alone and isolated i really was. i had no one to ask questions to, no one to get help from, no one to talk to, and no one to relate with. the first few months of motherhood were lonely and terrifying and wonderful and exhausting and confusing, and i desperately needed other mothers to share these experience with, to reassure me that i wasn't alone, and to guide me. had i not discovered the most amazing online circle of mothers on social media, i might not have survived those first few months. they were my lifeline, and remain some of my greatest friends even today. miles and miles away, i have watched their children grow, shared their experiences, heard their most intimate thoughts, wept when they wept, and celebrated ever small victory. and yes, posted loads and loads of photos. the internet creates *communities* in every sense of that word and offers people the opportunity to connect with people they might never have known otherwise. of course i exercise caution and restraint and a healthy amount of cynicism online, but i don't let my own crippling anxiety (rooted in convoluted media sensationalism that profits off of parental fear) keep me from developing healthy relationships with other people.   3. as for the rights of the child to privacy, i agree that children are people, too, and should have same rights to privacy that adults do. so here are the rights to privacy adults are afforded pertaining to photography: anyone can take a photo of you at any time in a public (or their own privately-owned) space and do whatever the want with it. if you and your child are at a park, anyone is allowed to take a photo of you and/or your kid and post it anywhere. however, that does not make it any less douchey to not respect someone's wishes just because the law is on your side. if your child does not want their photo taken, don't take it. this is especially traumatizing when you're an adolescent or teenager and you're already super awkward/insecure. don't post naked photos of your children online; it's their body and they should be the one to determine when/if the make their internet debut sans clothing. from a legal standpoint, there is also no clear-cut rule regarding when a photo stops being a ""cute naked baby photo"" and becomes a felony.   be smart, protect your kids; protect yourself; and [live, dammit, live](http://1mut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/all-the-things-meme-collection-1mut.com-1.gif).   **wow. such tl:dr. very words. much crap:** don't post nudes of your children online, mostly because your child's body belongs to your child, and they should be the one to determine when they're naked pics go live. don't live in fear; it's irrational and evil corporations^tm make money off it. post to social media if you want. i do. and i'm not ashamed.  edit: typo",1,1,1

the 80 year old might not care, they've seen it all before.  they'd probably prefer it if she didn't, they might get angry about it.  who cares though? the real question is what will you learn from it, and what can you teach about it?  you can ask questions in a way that makes your sister think about the fact that this is just a person.  you can learn about your sister's behavior, and you can try to remember what it was you felt like when you were 13 and try and understand why it was you felt that way.    or you could just take the easy way out and say ""my sister's so stupid, god why are kids nowadays so immature.  my generation has always been better than that.""  but i remember my sister being like that, and that was 15 years ago, the only difference is she couldn't post shit on youtube, because youtube didn't exist, and she didn't have a video camera.",1,2,2

the rise of punk, urban, goth, prep as discrete and separate multiculturalism of youth - where prior, north american youth were much more of a monoculture.  not all the same, but without the sense of varying affiliation that gen x experienced.  they existed in a boom era, following both the close of the second world war and the collapse of the cold war, they grey up in a far more optimistic time than their outlook might indicate.  they were the baby bust group - the low point in the wave following the baby boom prior.    millennials were the next ""surge"" group - a smaller and more spread out cohort than the massive burst that typified the baby boom, but they were typically the children of the boomers, and a group composed of lots of people relatively obviously creates a lot of babies, even if they're only having one or two.    genx walked from graduation into a world significantly more optimistic than millenials do.  they (largely) stepped out of school into boom-created positions and a sellers' market on jobs - postwar booms and the economic wealth of turning the greatest production economy in the world (at the time) from military to commerical applications, while the internet and the dotcom crazy were in their nasciency as well.    it wasn't a cakewalk paved with gold-leaf icing, but there were a lot of jobs, and a lot of money moving around, and no major or ugly crashes for quite a while.  compare that world to today, when even the old-era ""guaranteed employment"" degrees like engineering, medicine, or law are now seeing it as normal that graduates compete for fewer positions than there are people wanting to fill them.  unlike the pre-dotcom crash world, you can't just ""make website, get rich"" if you're having trouble getting more conventional work.  job security isn't a thing, and staying with one company from hiring to retiring has gone from ""normal and expected"" to ""dude don't you have any ambition?""    lastly, ideology and aspirations are very different.  we're frequently seen (not sure how accurately this is, verusus pure folk wisdom) as the first generation to see our parents be career-driven from the postwar values, and be dissatisfied with it.  we're a generation that as a general trait, seeks self-actualization and job satisfaction over career advancement or income.  as opposed to the peaceful protest and sing-songs and sign-waving of the hippies, or the grunge, the apathy, and the overt rejection of the wrong, millennials tend to try and effect change through collarboartion and ""from inside"" approaches.    i say none of this to cut down other generations, or to make the millennials out to be better than they are - like any generation, millennials are people and individuals never conform to stereotypes, no matter how much the collective might.  some live up to these things more, some less, some people are awesome, some are shitty.  i'm wanting to lay out *some* of the context behind the differences between the two groups to lay out how intricate and incomparable their respective contexts are, and how deeply linked those contexts are with the groups themselves and their values, behaviours and situations.    what i am trying (stumblingly, i confess: taking frequent breaks from writing this to go do real work means it's a somewhat disjointed piece of writing) to express is that no generation or demographic suffers comparison to any other like entity gracefully: it's too easy to cherrypick facets and gloss over others to create the conclusion you were seeking from the start.  additionally, it's too hard to correct for the numerous ""free variables"" like economy, local and world politics, and the actions of prior generations to isolate the very things you're attempting to compare.    the problem with ""geny"" as a name is that giving the generation *that name* as opposed to the more neutral ""millennial"" is that ""geny,"" by very virtue of its similarity and sequenceing with ""genx,"" not only implies but in fact invites comparison between the two. as i've tried to argue, no matter which you favour a comparison between the two cannot be done ""fairly;"" comparing things that cannot usefully or meaningfully be compared to each other nearly inevitably gives bad data and unflattering, biased, results.",1,1,1
921683,"&gt; history shows that the ""social welfare state"" (i.e. the new deal) predated a robust middle class, not the other way around.  i have to say that i'm not incredibly knowledgable about this area.  i've read a few things with regards to foreign policy, i am not a domestic policy expert though.  i know that the new deal was a response to the depression, but even before then there was the gilded age where there was significant social inequality.  i am not totally sure whether a robust middle class is a good thing or not for the long term health of a nation.  europe has a great middle class but it has serious problems with a declining birth rate.  japan also has a robust middle class but it is also beset with a declining population.  (it may also be possible to argue that the soviet union had a robust middle class and then recently had a massive decline in population.)  it may be that the middle class is decadent in the long run... but i don't have solid views on this, just trying to understand it without too much reliance on received wisdom.  &gt; but i'm not reading anything by amy chua without a copy of her social security card or green card.  amy chua is a first generation chinese immigrant yale law professor who is married to an american.  she is very much pro-american but she isn't mindlessly jingoistic.  &gt; no offense, but talking about cracking down on immmigration in the same response as urging a focus on individual freedom sounds like good old fashioned doublespeak to me.  i am not against immigration, but rather i understand the reasons why some are.  i actually don't care that much about it personally.  i do think that if you come to america you should put america's interests first and foremost, not those of your transnational ethnic group or country of origin first.  if too many people have loyalties elsewhere then america is going to pulled in too many conflicting directions and it will disintegrate as a world leader, it will become nothing more than the barely unified european union.",0,,
251187,"continued.... geez sorry for the length, really.  for example, take physical affection.  children cling to their parents, literally as well as figuratively.  naturally, children will stop that however.  they will start becoming self-conscious and hide their nakedness (if the parents teach that nakedness is something to hide, obviously), they will not swing in for hugs and kisses as often, etc.  the tragically sad thing is that they are preparing for natural adolescence.... which will be denied to them.  they are preparing to start fulfilling their physical affection needs with their peers, rather than their parents.  they develop not just sexual curiosity, but romantic and long-term relationship curiosity, lots of interest in other human beings.  although parents like to pretend it is not true, children do not experience empathy.  developing empathy, the ability to imagine other people as full human beings the same as yourself, does not happen until adolescence.  it happens early, probably 10-12 for most people, but it opens up an entire world of relationships.  everything from maybe a store owner you see every day and have an acquaitance relationship with to adults that might be admirable in some respect to you, to other kids that you admire, to kids you despise, to people you want to pursue out of sexual curiosity, to people you want to become emotionally intimate with.  the brain needs all of these things to develop properly.  and we deny all of them stringently.  adolescents are expected to keep their hands off of their peers, explore romance only as some sort of proof of heterosexuality (in most communities), but never really treat their relationships as full adult relationships.  adolescents feel more intensely than adults.  they are open to everything, and their brain benefits from almost everything.  they have not learned how to filter the world.  to a 14 year old, the question ""how can you get up in the morning, and go to work, and try to save up to buy a big-screen tv while a child in africa dies because they don't have enough to eat?"" is an earnest question.  their empathy is so powerful that it can destroy them.  their brain craves understanding of the really big, fully adult questions.  what do we do?  we start letting them see pg-13 movies.  they should be trying to explore the depths of the most profound art, they should be reaching for the stars and using their youthful energies to shape themselves as a person.  adults like to think adolescents are too immature to make decisions to affect the rest of their life, but somehow they have to be ignoring the fact that should slap them in the face - evolution vehemently disagrees.  millions of years of evolution gave adolescents the power to create life.  it gave them the ability to determine the course of their life.  if your adolescent isn't ready for that, it's not the fault of the normal development of the child being inadequate and sexuality coming ""too early"".  it's a fault of our society for not recognizing how human beings grow and what they truly need (we've been too busy figuring out how to make the child-rearing process easy for us parents and society).",1,1,-1

453100,"i, too, was brought up to respect my elders, and since there weren't many kids growing up in my neighborhood when i was little, some of my ""friends"" were elderly ladies who would be out puttering in their gardens. i was maybe 6-7, and would go and help them out and listen to them, because they had amazing stories to tell.  when i was older, i worked at a non-profit service club for men, and many of the members were retiree aged. again, i loved to visit with them.  for a while, i worked in a call center when medicare part d first rolled out. i was very happy to be able to assist these confused people, and educate them and explain things. many widows were so confused because their husbands had always taken care of everything. *tears*  i can remember one old lady somewhere in the south (i want to say arkansas, but could have been alabama or somewhere around there). regardless, she was very confused about things, didn't know her phone number or her address because her family had just moved her to an apartment (i'm guessing retirement center) and never came to visit. she needed her pills (anxiety medication) and she was boo-hooing. she sounded so much like my late grandmother, it was all i could do not to cry myself. i tried so hard to help her: call the pharmacy, conferenced in medicare, you name it. i wept for five minutes once i got off that call, because it was a non-covered medication (medicare) and she was on a fixed income. i had no way to help her, and i just wanted to hold her hand and reassure her.  i am so glad not to be working that job anymore; not only was the work environment frustrating, but to deal with so many angry people screaming at me (mostly the younger, ssdi/""entitled"" ones who didn't want to pay 50 cents for a prescription when ""it used to be free!""), and so many confused old people who couldn't afford their medication and food. i spoke to a lady in north carolina once who was bundled up in a lot of blankets in february because she couldn't afford to turn on her heater... and a woman in arizona who had a bit of dementia (kept talking in circles) who said she would dissolve her pill in a glass of water and drink half in the morning and half at night, to save money. there were days i would come home and cry.  and that's when i started my 401k. :(  a happy story to combat the sadness: my husband and i were out having chinese food one evening. the restaurant was mostly empty at the late hour; only an older gentleman (a widower and veteran with no living children, we learned) was having a chow mein dinner at another table. he had a conversation with the two waitresses during the time we were eating (we were at the other end of the restaurant), and we determined that he came and had hot tea and a plate of chow mein once a week, and took half of it home to eat later. he was just so jovial and pleasant to these two servers, reminiscing about stories from long ago, that i leaned over to my husband and whispered ""let's buy his dinner."" he blinked, smiled and nodded agreement. i called our server over and quietly explained what we wanted to do - anonymously. she was a little puzzled, but agreed. i paid both for our dinner and his, leaving a generous tip. we finished our beverages, picked up our doggie bags and were heading out the door just as they explained to him that he didn't owe anything, the bill had already been paid by ""a friend"". maybe he thought they comped his meal - i don't care. it made me happy to share some kindness to this gentleman.  edited to add: reading through all the stories in this thread has me choked up a bit. i've lost all five of my grandparents (one grandfather remarried - i didn't count her as a *step*-grandparent: she loved me just the same as her other grandkids), and lost my daddy two years ago. i'm a bit hyper-protective of my mom, who is in her 70's. i would hate to think of someone being disrespectful to her or mocking her in any way. i always try to treat my elders the same way i would treat my grandparents or parents. i can't fathom the adults who are disrespectful. teenagers, i can kind of understand, because it's an awkward time, peer pressure, determining your identity, whatever. but i am so glad i'm not alone in feeling the way i do about kindness to others, especially the older generations. i used to get made fun of, growing up, for being helpful... fortunately, i found better friends. :)",0,,

444076,"&gt; i once had a teacher at college who postulated that the hymen was some sort of genetic aberration that had been reinforced once men discovered it. the idea was that the girls who had a hymen were the ones chosen as brides, since they could prove they were virgins, a valuable asset when dealing with a patriarchal culture that must be certain that a woman's children were really her husband's, not some previous lover's.  unlikely. if anything, they're less valuable. more valuable are women who've already had children, they're proven child-bearers. this is responsible for some behavior we see today (where the woman has 2 or 3 or 4 brats all by different men).  there is some chance that since women have been evolutionarily selected to retain childlike features, that this is also partially responsible for them retaining a feature that other mammals only have embryonically.  also, there are some hints that there might be subtle physiological and/or hormonal changes.  in greg bear's *darwin's children*, one character even speculates that breaking the hymen triggers the release of retroviral messengers that trigger/affect/manipulate said changes.  i doubt that it can be explained away entirely by evolutionary sociology though.",1,-1,

275578,"i am really rather shocked at how many people are accusing the mother of bad parenting, or the child of being a brat.  those might (might - the article gives zero context as to why the child was crying, or how loudly, or how long.  ""tantrum"" is an assumption.) be valid arguments if it was a school-aged child, but for a two-year-old?  please.   a crash course in child development is in order, methinks:  at age 2, most children do not reason.  some are just barely talking.  they are also just starting to try to assert their independence, and they do this by pushing boundaries.  when they don't get their way, or they're hungry, or tired, or sick, or in any other way cranky, they have a tendency to cry.  they're not yet capable of always speaking their emotions, particularly when very upset.  the best way to stop a toddler from crying is to either fill whatever unmet need is making them cry, or to distract them from something they want and can't have.  if their crying is a tantrum, however, sometimes ignoring it is the best way to go - you say no, you restrain the child if she's trying to run away or flail around, you remove the source of the tantrum from her sight, and then you stop giving her attention until she stops crying.  paying attention to the crying teaches her that crying gets her what she wants.  that's how you end up with 8-year-olds throwing tantrums.  is a toddler crying in public annoying? yes.  but sometimes there's just nothing appropriate the parent can do about it.  some kids are perfectly behaved in public, yes - but they're not the norm.  a perfectly behaved 2-year-old is probably well-behaved because of temperament, not because their parents have already managed to teach them to act like adults.  you can't expect the same behavior from a baby or toddler that you would from an older child, teen, or adult.  (and really, that's what makes defending the old man a catch-22 - slapping a toddler repeatedly for being annoying in public definitely qualifies as a temper tantrum, and if it's ok for an old man to throw a tantrum, it's ok for a toddler.)  so what are the parent's options for ""shutting up"" a toddler in public?  she's too young to listen to reason.  many parents do not believe in spanking, particularly for such a young child, and even if they do, spanking in public has its downsides - bystanders might take offense and report a parent, and a spanking might stop the misbehavior but not the loud crying.  if firm reprimands and distractions fail to stop the crying, the parent basically has the options of either letting the child cry it out and annoying other shoppers, or giving the child whatever it is that they want (i'm presuming that the crying is due to being denied something they want but do not need, rather than just crying from being hungry/tired/sick).  personally, i'd rather the parent let the kid cry it out - yes, it's annoying, but it's less annoying that the kid learning that public tantrums get results, and continuing them throughout grade school.    tl;dr: crying is developmentally appropriate for a two-year-old.  sometimes, letting a two-year-old cry it out is better parenting than giving in to their demands.  maybe society's intolerance of babies and toddlers being babies and toddlers is a contributing factor in those babies' growing up into spoiled, tantrum-throwing grade-school brats.",1,2,-1

222732,"ahhh... we can begin a discussion then. good, k7k. thanks for this. you'll see that i am unable to condense my analysis into bullet points. ;-)  i would agree with points one and two. i would part ways with you on points three and four. first let me tell you, that i have chosen for many years to be abstinent as an adult, even though i think very deeply about the subject. there was something that p3do said today which kind of dovetails with my reasoning about this subject:  &gt; [from this post](http://www.reddit.com/info/6nkjd/comments/c04dgfe) "" i dare even say it is not okay for adults to have sex with other adults because they are products of a very disturbed childhood training and really have no idea what sex is.""  i think that ""sex"" is a cultural ritual which is defined by our society. other societies could have different social forms for the act of genital touch, and the word ""sex"" might not accurately apply at all to those cultures. i frankly think that sex is a pretty daunting act. people presume that they and others have a ""sex drive"" which basically is analagous to the caricature of someone having a mad desire to impulsively plug in a usb device to a computer and hope that the device doesn't function as it was designed. penises and vaginas were designed to create babies when they are put together. that's the simple fact. of course they have other functions, when not placed together. masturbation is important for the overall health of the pelvic region... the fluids have to flow between the tissues to keep everything healthy down there. so here i see two tangible functions which are definable empirically, without the human culture being factored in. 1) health 2) procreation. now lets talk about anglo culture. i think that it is absolutely absurd that nudity is forbidden in public in north america. nudity is the natural state of the human body, and to seek to hide portions of our body i think of as profoundly neurotic behavior. clothing is nice for protection from the elements, and it's nice for decoration... but there's no reason we shouldn't often see eachother nude. now, i believe it's a logical deduction to say that if public nudity would be legal, and if casual genital touch of all natures between all human individuals was decriminalized - that our society would change from the inside out. no longer would touching someone's genitalia be synonymous with the act of choosing your best friend.  ok... now lets talk about children. children have a more immersive experience of physical touch than any adults do. they are touched and held and caressed by parents and caregivers many times throughout the day. they cuddle or wrestle with eachother as well. small children of preschool age will usually see it as an act of personal rejection if an adult refuses to hold them or cuddle with them - and they'll get dejected. throughout childhood, and up until puberty children are enjoying receiving and giving physical affection. now, all of a sudden that stops when a child turns 13 (for boys it's very abrupt - for girls it may be a little less abrupt). all of a sudden the child is taught that his or her desire to touch someone else has a new definition, it's called ""sexual attraction."" for most boys, this whole season of indoctrination really crushes their spirit. how? they are taught that they are acting selfishly and even unkindly if they so much as desire to express physical affection towards another person. most adolescent boys train themselves to not show affection to others, and instead they choose to be aloof; and though they wouldn't see it in themselves, they come across as being cold, and even seem to be mean when they are annoyed. so ten years of training in teaching children to be affectionate is undone by ten years of teaching them not to be. isn't that sad? why are men generally colder, rougher around the edges, and less affectionate than women? because they were taught to conflate affection with sexual attraction, and they were taught that except in very specific circumstances, sexual attraction is a sign of bad character.  it's no wonder that adults have a passion about expressing physical affection through touch in this ritual we call ""sex;""  adults are positively starved for the kind of physical affection which they experienced on a daily basis as children.   it's also very healthy, in my opinion, for people to think about children when they muse about sex in the way that p3do is suggesting; after all sex creates children, so shouldn't one appreciate the poetry and beauty of the act at the same moment you appreciate the charm of children? shouldn't you relish the idea of cuddling a future child, at the same moment you are cuddling with your girlfriend?  now, should children be introduced to the ritual of sex per se when they express a curiosity about it? i see no logical reason why they shouldn't be. they play dress up, and house. they learn about what daddy and mommy do in their offices. why shouldn't they learn in a very complete fashion about what mommy and daddy do in their bedroom? i'll tell you, when i was 13 years old, i was hopping mad about this incredibly neurotic attitude that adults had which prevented them from introducing kids to this area of life experience. i agree with judith levine when she says it is perilous to protect children from sex.  if children in general were to grow up with a reasonable amount of experience with this area of life... they would be different adults. they wouldn't have these neuroses about sex which adults of our generation have. they would be a hell of a lot more responsible when it came to copulation, and preventing unwanted pregnancies and preserving overall genital health. so no, i do not agree that experience with sex damages a child's mentality. i think that placing stigma on a child, and dragging him or her through court proceedings and months or years of counseling can indeed damage that child. i concur with p3do where he says that such a focus on the act after the fact can burden the child with connotations and subtext which the experience didn't have at the time. at the time, the child was just playing and being curious - that was the extent of it.  now, i can also flip the coin over and tell you... that given the fact that our society shows no signs of changing course right now... i think that one of the *most* important things that teachers and others who work with elementary school aged kids can do is teach them how to give and receive affection without physical touch. if children can separate these two things in their minds, they will be much healthier as they enter their teen years, and their young adulthood. in the interest of this, a person who is in close quarters with kids has to be very transparent in his affection. it can't have any romantic subtext to it. i wouldn't dare have the gleam in my eye that i'm sure p3do has when he's around kids. ;-) however, i see that sometimes kids of both genders will entertain crushes on adults of both genders... and in casual situations (not classroom situations) i think it's important to be secure in oneself, and let that social dynamic have it's place, smiling at the child warmly and even impishly. the mistake males often make at that point is to become offish suddenly, because of their own lack of comfort with that moment.",0,,

724594,"here we go...google cache is our friend (pt. 1 of 3)-   in 2006, japan reached a demographic and social turning point. according to tokyo's official statistics, deaths that year very slightly outnumbered births. nothing like this had been recorded since 1945, the year of japan's catastrophic defeat in world war ii. but 2006 was not a curious perturbation. rather, it was the harbinger of a new national norm.  japan is now a ""net mortality society."" death rates today are routinely higher than birthrates, and the imbalance is growing. the nation is set to commence a prolonged period of depopulation. within just a few decades, the number of people living in japan will likely decline 20 percent. the germans, who saw their numbers drop by an estimated 700,000 in just the years from 2002 to 2009, have a term for this new phenomenon: schrumpfende gesellschaft, or ""shrinking society."" implicit in the phrase is the understanding that a progressive peacetime depopulation will entail much more than a lowered head count. it will inescapably mean a transformation of family life, social relationships, hopes and expectations-and much more.  but japan is on the cusp of an even more radical demographic makeover than the one now under way in germany and other countries that are in a similar situation, including italy, hungary, and croatia. (the united states is also aging, but its population is still growing.) within barely a generation, demographic trends promise to turn japan into a dramatically-in some ways almost unimaginably-different place from the country we know today. if we go by u.s. census bureau projections for japan, for example, there will be so many people over 100 years of age in 2040, and so few babies, that there could almost be one centenarian on hand to welcome each japanese newborn.  population decline and extreme population aging will profoundly alter the realm of the possible for japan-and will have major reverberations for the nation's social life, economic performance, and foreign relations. gradually but relentlessly, japan is evolving into a type of society whose contours and workings have only been contemplated in science fiction. it is not clear that japan's path will be a harbinger of what lies ahead in other aging societies. over the past century, modernization has markedly increased the economic, educational, technological, and social similarities between japan and other affluent countries. however, japan has remained distinctive in important respects-and in the years ahead it may become increasingly unlike other rich countries, as population change accentuates some of its all-but-unique attitudes and proclivities. japan's future population profile has already very largely been set. well over 75 percent of the people who will inhabit the japan of 2040 are already alive, living there today. the country's population trajectory will be driven by three fundamental and distinctively japanese trends: (1) extremely favorable general health conditions-the japanese now enjoy the world's greatest longevity, and the outlook is for further improvements; (2) an unusually strong aversion to immigration; and (3) the most pronounced and prolonged period of sub-replacement fertility of any nation in the modern world.  japan's total fertility rate first dipped temporarily below replacement level in the 1950s, a time when the rest of the world was just beginning to grow alarmed by the possibility of a ""population explosion."" it has remained below replacement level (around 2.1 births per woman) since the early 1970s. the total fertility rate-a measure of births per woman per lifetime-while up slightly from its low (to date) of 1.26 in 2005, was a mere 1.37 in 2009, only two-thirds of the level required for long-term population stability. (japan's population continued to grow into the 21st century because the pool of women of childbearing age kept growing until about 1990, while tremendous improvements in health among seniors postponed the intersection of death and birth totals.) japan's postwar fertility plunge has been so steep that it can be described as a virtual collapse. in 2008, barely 40 percent as many japanese babies were born as in 1948. [see chart, page 32.] in fact, the country's annual birth totals are lower today than they were a century ago-and if current projections come to pass, japan will not have many more newborns in 2050 than it did in the 1870s.  we can get a sense of the shape of things to come by comparing japan's current population profile with an estimate for 2040. [see chart, page 33.] not even 30 years from now, more than a third of japanese will be 65 or older. japan is already the world's grayest society, with a median age of almost 45 years. by 2040 its median age, to go by u.s. census bureau projections, will rise to an almost inconceivable 55. (by way of comparison, the median age in the retirement haven of palm springs, california, is currently under 52 years.)  this aging society, of course, will also be shrinking. by tokyo's projections, japan's population will decline from about 127 million today-the 10th largest in the world-to about 106 million in 2040. the working-age population (ages 15-64) will plunge 30 percent, from 81 million to 57 million. in 2040, by these projections, the total population will be declining by about one percent annually (roughly one million people per year), and the working-age population by almost two percent annually.  but there is more. japan's historically robust (if perhaps at times stifling) family relations, a pillar of society in all earlier generations, stand to be severely and perhaps decisively eroded in the coming decades. traditional ""asian family values""-the ideals of universal marriage and parenthood-are already largely a curiosity of the past in japan. their decay has set in motion a variety of powerful trends which virtually ensure that the japan of 2040 will be a country with far greater numbers of aged isolates, divorced individuals, and adults whose family lines come to an end with them.  at its heart, marriage in traditional japan was a matter of duty, not just love. well within living memory, arranged marriages (miai) predominated, while ""love matches"" (renai kekkon) were anomalies. love matches did not exceed arranged pairings until 1970-yet by 2005, only six percent of all new marriages fit the traditional mold. the collapse of arranged marriage seems to have taken something with it. remarkably enough, there is a near perfect correlation between the demise of arranged marriage in japan and the decline in postwar japanese fertility.  unshackled from the obligations of the old family order, japan's young men and women have plunged into a previously unknown territory of interpersonal options. one consequence has been a headlong ""flight from marriage,"" as australian demographer gavin jones describes it.   increasingly, men and women in modern japan have been postponing marriage-or avoiding it altogether. between 1965 and 2005, for example, the proportion of never-married women in their late thirties shot up from six percent to 18 percent. among men, the proportion rose even more steeply, from four percent to 30 percent. many of these single adults still have not left home, creating a new breed of parasaito shinguru, or ""parasite singles."" even as young japanese increasingly avoid marriage, divorce is further undermining the country's family structure. just as being unmarried at prime child-rearing age is no longer a situation requiring explanation, divorce now bears no stigma. between 1970 and 2009, the annual tally of divorces nearly tripled. the number of new marriages, meanwhile, slumped by nearly a third. according to one study, a married woman's probability of eventual divorce in japan has leapt from under 10 percent in 1965 to about 30 percent today-higher than in such ""postmodern"" scandinavian societies as norway and finland.  as the flight from marriage and the normalization of divorce has recast living arrangements in japan, the cohort of married fertile adults has plummeted in size. although the number of men and women between the ages of 20 and 50 was roughly the same in 2010 and 1970, about 10 million fewer were married in 2010. nowadays, the odds of being married are barely even within this key demographic group. and marriage is the only real path to parenthood. unwed motherhood remains, so to speak, inconceivable because of the enduring disgrace conferred by out-of-wedlock births. in effect, the japanese have embraced voluntary mass childlessness.  rates of childlessness have been generally rising throughout the industrialized world since 1945, but japan's levels were high to begin with. about 18 percent of japanese women born in 1950 ended up having no children-a larger percentage than among their famously childless west german contemporaries. among japanese women born 15 years later, the odds of being childless are roughly one in four. but this may be only a foretaste of what lies in store.",0,,

[6]  &gt;another seemingly paradoxical finding is that when countries with poor medical services introduce new medical centers and services, instead of declining the reported imrs often increase for a time. the main cause of this is that improvement in access to medical care is often accompanied by improvement in the registration of unplanned births and deaths. deaths that might have occurred in a remote or rural area and not been reported to the government might now be reported by the new medical personnel or facilities. thus, even if the new health services reduce the actual imr, the reported [imr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infant_mortality) may increase.",0,,

283648,"im not wrong. maybe thats why you're mad.       nepiophilia or infantophilia is a subtype of pedophilia describing a sexual preference for toddlers and infants (usually ages 0‚Äì3).[5]     pedophilia is a psychological disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a sexual preference for prepubescent children.[6][7] according to the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5), pedophilia is a paraphilia in which a person has intense sexual urges towards children, and experiences recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about children. pedophilic disorder is further defined as psychological disorder in which a person meets the criteria for pedophilia above, and also either acts upon those urges, or else experiences distress or interpersonal difficulty as a consequence.[8][9] the diagnosis can be made under the dsm or icd criteria for persons age 16 and older.[10] child sexual abuse is not committed by all pedophiles, and not all child molesters are pedophiles.[11]  attraction to adolescents      hebephilia and ephebophilia are sexual preferences for pubescent and post-pubescent youths, respectively.[12] the term hebephilia was introduced by glueck (1955).[13]  attraction to adults      teleiophilia (from greek t√©leios, ""full grown"") is a sexual preference for adults.[14] the term was coined by ray blanchard in 2000.[15]     gerontophilia is a sexual preference for the elderly.[16]   http://www.scarleteen.com/article/advice/does_being_attracted_to_teenagers_make_me_a_pedophile  heather corinna replies:  the term pedophile is about people who are sexually attracted to children: to juveniles, to pre-pubescent people. teenagers are not children.   http://www.messynessychic.com/2012/05/11/documentary-suggests-pedophilia-might-not-be-that-bad-as-it-sounds/  &gt;adults sexually attracted to underage teens aren‚Äôt so bad, says new documentary  https://www.quora.com/is-an-adult-who-is-sexually-attracted-to-a-teenager-called-a-pedophile  &gt;however, colloquially laymen will call anyone attracted to anybody looking underage a pedophile, because that's just how people are.  bingo.  so if we lower the age of consent tomorrow, people suddenly stop being 'pedo (or the incorrectly spelled, paedo for you britishers) philes', because now its legal. it has nothing to do with reality but with a claimed reality based on an arbitrary legal line.  so a person having sex with 17 year olds in florida is pedophilic rapist by some people's standards (hint), and not pedophilic in nevada because the age of consent is 16 there as opposed to florida's 18. that is a completely nonsensical position, and i oppose anyone who uses the term pedophile in an improper context because its an intended abuse of language to further dehumanize an individual who did something illegal, and maybe immoral, but certainly not pedophilic.  pedophilia is about attraction. acting on it is about child molesting, or rape, given the context, and the colloquialisms of the uneducated peanut gallery on the internet.  http://www.psychforums.com/paraphilias/topic102976.html#p996078  &gt;for example, in 2003 germaine greer published a book with 200 images of boys between the ages of 13 and 16. in her own words she sought to light passion or lust in older women for the teenage form of males who aren't old enough to shave but are old enough for sex.  &gt; she was accused of promoting pedophilia and defended herself on a round of talkshows. but it's possibly true that she escaped even harsher criticism because she was a woman;  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  &gt;when the university of minnesota press agreed more than a year ago to publish a book called ''harmful to minors: the perils of protecting children from sex,'' it was clear that it would be controversial.  &gt;mr. pawlenty, who plans to run for governor, said he had read the book and believed it endorsed sex between adults and children, adding, ''this kind of disgusting victimization of children is intolerable, and the state should have no part in it.''  &gt;the book does not, in fact, endorse pedophilia. what ms. levine does argue is that the fear of pedophilia is overblown and that the age of consent should be lowered in certain circumstances.  &gt;some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  &gt;earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.  &gt;the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal... the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father.  in case you missed this tidbit.  &gt;""the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4th edition text revision (dsm-iv-tr) outlines specific criteria for use in the diagnosis of this disorder. these include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (age 13 or younger, as the diagnosis criteria for the disorder extends the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, and that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings.""  we don't know if she is a pedophile or not. we can't be certain. all we can be certain of is that she broke the law and looks like someone we perceive as a serial rapist for cultural mores reasons.",0,,
788778,"&gt; people who think that adults sleeping with children is wrong are not using the phrase to ban benign things they are using it to defend the children being raped.  rape has already been a law on the books for 1000 years.  https://www.routledge.com/products/9780805809145  &gt;making a unique contribution of placing the current sexual exploitation of children and adolescents firmly in its historical context, this book looks at the family's and society's roles in child and adolescent sex abuse. unlike most previous studies, this study allows a range of responses from negative to positive and avoids the methodological problems inherent in many other studies. most studies combine the age groups of children and adolescents, whereas this study separates these different age groups and compares the nature and outcome of sexual experiences of children with those of adolescents. utilizing sophisticated analytical measures, the author's findings repudiate many commonly held assumptions and serve to calm current hysteria regarding sexual abuse of minors.  &gt;written to disseminate findings that could be helpful in realistically confronting the phenomenon of human sexuality, the results presented in this book dispel many current myths about early sexuality, including ethnic differences. the author wanted to separate scientific inquiry from the perpetration of pervading mores or social norms, and identify the real menaces to healthy adult functioning.  http://www.alternet.org/story/12960/what_judith_levine_is_really_saying  &gt;in the furor over the book, most commentators have missed levine's main point: ""sex is not ipso facto harmful to minors."" in fact, ""america's drive to protect kids from sex is protecting them from nothing. instead, often it is harming them.""  &gt;despite what critics contend, ""harmful to minors"" is not about pedophilia. it tackles a wide range of issues including censorship, statutory rape laws, abstinence-only sex education, abortion, gender, aids, and child welfare. the latter issue, which raises questions beyond sexuality about how our society provides for its neediest children, is ""the most important one in the book,"" levine told alternet, and ""the real reason the right is against me."" but the inflammatory issue of child-adult sex continues to draw the headlines  &gt;if a person truly has the good of young people in mind, one would hope he or she would be interested in what research has to reveal. ""harmful to minors"" offers a plethora of findings, from studies showing that exposure to sexually explicit images does not harm children, to evidence that teens' sexual relationships with adults are not uniformly devastating, to research on the ineffectiveness of abstinence-only education in delaying sexual activity.  &gt;sexual relationships with older people  &gt;in the explosive realm of adult-youth sex, many teens say that such relationships can be consensual and positive. and more than a few of us remember having such positive sexual relationships with adults when we ourselves were teens.  &gt;levine has taken considerable heat for holding up as a ""good model"" the netherlands' age of consent law, under which young people ages 12-16 can legally consent to sex with older people who are not parents or authority figures, but under which charges can be brought if teens or their parents (with the approval of the council for the protection of children) believe the young person is being exploited. but her support for the dutch law cannot be taken out of the context of that country's social welfare system and relaxed cultural attitudes about sex.  &gt;""in the netherlands, children are respected as citizens with rights like everyone else, to housing, health care, good day care, school, and college,"" levine told alternet. ""they get sexuality education from the get-go, condoms are available in vending machines everywhere, abortion is free from the national health service, their parents receive generous parental leave and, if they choose to stay home longer with the kids, social welfare benefits to subsidize that important work. while protecting children, the dutch (and other europeans) do not infantilize them.""  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html  &gt;when the university of minnesota press agreed more than a year ago to publish a book called ''harmful to minors: the perils of protecting children from sex,'' it was clear that it would be controversial. other publishers had rejected the manuscript, including one who said it was ''radioactive'' because of its argument for providing children with more sexual education and responsibility.   &gt; some psychologists questioned the authors' methods. but the academic subtleties were forgotten when dr. laura schlessinger, the talk radio host, denounced the article on her show. soon conservatives were attacking it as an endorsement of pedophilia, and eventually the united states house of representatives passed a unanimous resolution condemning it.  &gt;earlier this month, legislators in missouri voted to cut $100,000 from the university of missouri's budget because of a 1999 journal article by a university political scientist, harris mirkin, that questioned whether all sexual contacts between adults and children constituted abuse. dr. mirkin, a father and grandfather who says he has no sympathy for child abusers, says he has received threats as well.   educate yourself, please.  there are teens being put on sex offender registries for life, and committing suicide later on in life as they have their whole life destroyed. but once you're 18 or maybe 20, or maybe 40, then you deserve to be on that list even if what you did wasn't actually harmful?  do not conflate this with incest, molestation, rape, or other types of abuse. no one here is advocating the rape or coercion of 'children'. teens are juveniles. teens have sex. teens are not damaged by sex, otherwise we'd keep it illegal for them to fuck each other rather than invoke r&amp;j laws.  &gt; the author's findings repudiate many commonly held assumptions and serve to calm current hysteria regarding sexual abuse of minors.  do you know  what repudiate means?",0,,
220490,"there aren't really any issues with social security.  sorry for the following textwall, but this *really* needs to be explained to people.  the boomer thing has been known about ever since they were born back in the 50's and has been gradually adjusted for over time.  it's not like we didn't know that the boomers existed as soon as they were born, or haven't been able to adjust for increasing life expectancy since then.  they may be a surprise to you, but not to the actuaries.  by the way, the vast majority of the increase in average life expectancy is due to better prenatal care, reductions in infant mortality, and reducing diseases that affect younger people.  one infant living to old age instead of dying as a baby affects the average far more than one old guy living to be a little older.  and it's a lot harder to keep old people from dying than it is to prevent or cure something that will kill a young person.  in terms of life expectancy, while geriatric care has improved somewhat, other areas of medicine have improved a lot *more*.  if you only counted people who'd already made it to over the age of, say 60, as your sample size for average life expectancy, you'd see that we haven't actually increased the average life expectancy of that group by very much at all.  i mean, did you really think that pre-modern-medicine folks mostly died at 35?  or perhaps did those 5 dead infants per 1 healthy adult have something more to do with impacting the average of how long people live?  the average doesn't tell you the story at all, unless you also have the standard deviation.  however, what geriatric medicine has done very well is made a lot more older people be able to remain active for longer.  the 65-year cutoff set when social security started was largely because people at that age tended to be very worn out, making continued work a severe hardship on them.  now, people tend not to have too much trouble getting to work, doing a full day and going home until they're at least 75.  symptom treatment for geriatric complaints has advanced by quite a lot: ""take these pills and you can still live a full life.""  as a result, there have been some proposals to shift the eligibility requirement by a few years, but that's mainly because people are living and working longer than they used to, and making them wait a few more years in order to get a little more money per remaining year might be a better deal for them.  but it has little to do with the overall solvency of the system.  by the way, before social security existed (and for a goodly while after) the words ""old"" and ""poor"" were damn near synonymous.  unless you were from a pretty wealthy economic strata, pretty much everybody could only look forward to utter poverty in their later years, if they were unlucky enough to live that long.  the image of a completely impoverished person was invariably an old person.  if in some story or movie you wanted to show utter poverty, you showed an elderly person.  because that was the barrel of the gun that almost everybody was looking down.  social security completely changed all that.  there's still a lot to fear about getting old, but the nigh-guarantee of being utterly impoverished and out on the streets shaking a tin cup and freezing to death isn't one of those things anymore  ever since i was a kid (in the 80's, you whippersnappers) i heard stories about how social security was projected to run out of money in 20 years' time.  then some years later i'd hear social security was projected to run out of money in 20 years' time.  then a few years later the same story would crop up again.  and again, and again.  they're still telling that same damn story, just rolling the year forward every time.  as it turns out, social security has actually *never* been projected to run out of money in 20 years' time.  the people who say that are referring to the fact that the social security administration submits a 20 year forward projection every year, as in ""we have enough money to pay benefits through [this year + 20].""  so then those liars use the fact that there are no numbers for year 21 to turn around and literally claim that social security will go bankrupt 20 years from now (whatever ""now"" means at the time).  then that gets spread around on the news, and shared further by ""anti-gub'mint"" meatheads.  this same prediction has happened every year since social security has existed, and it will never be true - unless we decide to make it true by dismantling the most successful social program in history.  saying that ""social security is expected to go bankrupt in the year 20xx"" is like saying that there won't be an atmosphere in 8 days because the weatherman only gave you a 7-day forecast.  by the way, go find a retirement account or pension plan that can offer you a solid 20 year projection.  go ahead.  i dare you.  i'll wait right here while you look for that.  hint: you're lucky if they'll tell you a few *months* in advance.  and even that they won't promise to.  so why are people lying about all of this?  simple: they want the program gone.  it's a vast amount of money that isn't available for wall street to play with and siphon away by their usual method of regularly ""crashing"" the market and then scooping up most of the leftovers before the economy recovers.  so when conservative bitching about ""socialism"" and ""transfer payments"" doesn't work, they resort to outright lying and telling people that an incredibly successful program that's been in place for almost 80 years is about to collapse because there are too many of those greedy selfish elderly people running around and having the gall to be alive on *your* dime.  in other words, the usual trick of turning us against one another.",1,1,1

461510,"i agree with you here. i wonder what specifically the big deal is with gay marriage, i can understand objection on the grounds of conservative morality, but, within the same set of moral values, it is immoral to coerce others to conformity. religious conversion is an issue of persuasion and not heavy handed manipulation. it seems counterintuitive for religious people to strive for such a high level of control when possessing it could effectively dilute the faithful. marriage seems to definitely be an issue to establish in a religious framework, the legal relationship between people seems to be better addressed separately, probably first through a set of defaults that can be altered through legal proceedings. if the push for gay marriage is essentially to establish the legal framework for care and access, then i think that the issue should be detached from sexuality, because there are various circumstances where an unrelated person would be an appropriate substitute for a family member. if the issue is the benefits that come from employment, such as health benefits, i think the issue would be better addressed by broader measures of egalitarianism, like taking care of the sick and elderly through socialized medicine, this covers everyone without partiality. as for polygamy, well, i don't necessarily see a huge problem with it. there are enough people out there in unstructured relationships that to discriminate against polygamy seems to be an enforced taboo instead of something rationally derived. within the ideology in question, where the morman sects are out of hand in terms of sexual abuse, i think that the effort against the ideology have to come from within through exposure and dissent, but situations of sexual manipulation should still be dealt with through  the law. there is always somewhere to run for anyone in an abusive situation, or at least the option of running.  the next issue that this situation brings to mind is the age of marraige. for instance, we tend to prolong childhood rediculously long, and the societal norm of postponing family until a measure of success is achieved seems to be out of accord with our biology.  i've read that the fact that men are physically larger than women implies that humans have an established history of men having multiple women. beyond that, i've also read that the optimum reproductive set up is for the man to marry a woman 10 to 13 years younger. beyond that people who marry their distant cousins have more reproductive success. i suppose that with six billion people on the earth we might not need families with thirteen kids though.  my grandmother was married very young to my grandfather who was at least ten years older. if a people married today at the age my grandparents were, it would be absolutely scandolous. considering though what biology reveals, i am not sure that such an age difference would be totally at odds with what is natural, except for social acceptability. irasmus wrote about how people wouldn't get themselves into many of the important situations that our species relies on, except for naivity. as i have gotten older, i have realized that being cerebral and responsible about pursuing companionship is at odds with the romance it could possess. watch the first part of the movie idiocracy, it wxplains a lot.",0,,

""  ""i have been a regular practitioner of medicine in boston for 33 years. i have studied the question of vaccination conscientiously for 45 years. as for vaccination as a preventative of disease, there is not a scrap of evidence in its favor. injection of virus into the pure bloodstream of the people does not prevent smallpox. rather, it tends to increase its epidemics and makes the disease more deadly. of this we have indisputable proof. in our country (u.s.) cancer mortality has increased from 9 per 100,000 to 80 per 100,000 or fully 900 per cent increase, within the past 50 years, and no conceivable thing could have caused this but the universal blood poisoning now existing.""   -dr. charles e. page   ""it was similar with the measles vaccination. they went through africa, south america and elsewhere, and vaccinated sick and starving children...they thought they were wiping out measles, but most of those susceptible to measles died from some other disease that they developed as a result of being vaccinated. the vaccination reduced their immune levels and acted like an infection. many got septicaemia, gastro-enteritis, etcetera, or made their nutritional status worse and they died from malnutrition. so there were very few susceptible infants left alive to get measles. it's one way to get good statistics. kill all those that are susceptible, which is what they literally did.""   --dr. kalokerinos, m.d. read dr. kalokerinos book, ""every second child"" for worst case example of vaccines killing children.      **history of vaccines**  smallpox a..smallpox would have disappeared around 1870 if jenner's cronies had not persuaded parliament to force the smallpox vaccine onto children in 1867, causing the largest epidemic of smallpox ever with a peak of 42,000 deaths in 1872.

958595,"&gt;sue williams (12:31:50) :   to the person who commented on sarah‚Äôs hair - no, it‚Äôs what happens when one has hair extensions - which sarah, at one time, don‚Äôt know about now, had.  re: babygate - i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs being reported. here, however, is the truth. trig is sarah and todd‚Äôs baby.   when sarah first learned she was pregnant, it was shocking and overwhelming. while she and todd had not planned to have anymore children, it is common knowledge among their family and friends that neither of them ever surgically insured that they wouldn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúlate in life‚Äù surprises/blessings.  this, to me, showed a disturbing lack of judgement. if you want to ask the citizens of a state to let you run the state for four years, to me she and todd should have thought ahead and determined that the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy wouldn‚Äôt have been prudent for either the child, their family, their extended family (who are the ones who end up helping them raise their current four children) or the citizens of the state.  they either didn‚Äôt think this through, or didn‚Äôt care. not sure. but, either way, to me and to others, it was a lack of foresight and judgement.  but it is the same vein - this lack of judgement - sarah showed, on the campaign trail for governor, when asked who would raise her children should she win, she promptly stated that todd would quit his job and stay at home with the kids (todd works a ‚Äúslope‚Äù week on/week off schedule).  sarah was elected and then - whoops. todd didn‚Äôt like the stay at home gig - so sarah, citing they needed money for the kid‚Äôs college (even though track enlisted in the military) said todd was returning to work. when asked about her statements on the campaign trail about how todd would quit his job, sarah said she‚Äôd actually never talked to him about what they would do if she was elected (in terms of his employment) and that she‚Äôd spoken out of turn when she spoke for him stating he‚Äôd quit his job.  again, call me picky, but this is the kind of bizarre judgement sarah routinely displays. are you kidding me that she would run for governor and she and her husband would somehow not think to have a conversation about what to do with their four school aged kids? that‚Äôs insane. so, either her judgement is super goofy, or she wasn‚Äôt telling the truth. either way, it‚Äôs not reassuring to now think this is someone who would be one 72 year old heartbeat away from having to call shots for the country/world.  so todd trots himself back to work and sarah is busy traipsing around the state and the nation. the kids are ‚Äúfarmed out‚Äù (this is the word used by thier associates in ‚Äúthe valley‚Äù) to family and friends to raise while todd and sarah are off having their respective careers (sarah is famously quoted as saying, ‚Äúmy mom does whatever i need her to‚Äù).  during this period is when bristol, sarah‚Äôs sixteen year old daughter, turns up pregnant. so, it‚Äôs kind of interesting to note that the republican vice presidential nominee and her sixteen year old junior in high school unwed daughter were carrying babies at the same time. once bristol‚Äôs condition became more obvious this summer, she was whisked out of sight and hasn‚Äôt been seen in public until yesterday in ohio. this is why trig‚Äôs blanket was strung across her entire abdomen and torso, but, when she walked down the stairs from the stage, in a profile shot, it was very clear to see she is well into her third trimester of her pregnancy.  it has come out in the past couple of days that she and her high school boyfriend had a quickie wedding and that she is home schooling her senior year.  the anchorage daily news has known about this for months - and haven‚Äôt touched the story. but i can‚Äôt imagine the national press or the democratic party will be as willing to turn a blind eye.  for me, once again it speaks to judgement. we all - every single one of us - even sarah‚Äôs closest friends in the valley (i know, i‚Äôve been speaking to them) know she is in no way qualified for this position. at all.  but then, why would she accept the nomination, knowing that bristol‚Äôs situation will come to light and knowing her hunger for national and international acclaim and attention will carry with it a mighty high price for her seventeen year old daughter who had absent parents last year and who turned up pregnant.   how embarrassing will it be for bristol once the news (or the baby) comes out and not just the valley, not just alaska, not just the usa - but bristol will be known the world over as the seventeen year old unwed - then quickly wed senior-in-high-school-homeschooled-teenage mom and daughter to the republican vice presidential nominee?  how hard will that degree of scrutiny and shame be?  how does one do that to one‚Äôs daughter?  how does one dash about the country for the next 66 days trying to pull off an image of the devoted mother of five when she, by and large, isn‚Äôt the one raising them and when one of them - her daughter, is in a truly vulnerable point in life; not to say anything about the needs of trig. but maybe he doesn‚Äôt count, except as a talking point or a photo prop. but this is a person, a little boy who is going to require a tremendous amount of time and attention. from his mother.  this is okay?",1,,-1

965295,"&gt; for a start, most people at that age are not single so finding another single person at that age is not so easy. chances are most of the people a woman in her 40s will come across will be taken. also, pretty much all of the good ones will be taken.   i know this might sound kind of screwed up, but sometimes they don't even have to be single. my future mother in law is past her 40s and recently got divorced to be with someone else. it might sound kind of crappy, but the relationship that she was in was failing and had been for the better half of a decade. she met someone, and though she continued trying to get her husband to work with her for several years after that, he still wasn't willing to put in the effort. they divorced, and moved on. she is now happily engaged to the man she met, and i'm not sure about her ex husband but from what i've heard he's doing well.   &gt; whoever that is left in the dating pool will probably have some negative aspects regarding themselves. there must be a reason as to why they are still single.   sometimes people elect to stay single by choice, and not because they can't find anyone. after my mom's divorce, she spent several years a) getting over my dad b.) taking care of my sister and me and providing a stable home for us c) focusing on herself and bettering herself as a person d) figuring out if we would be okay with her dating again. she took time away from the dating world because she wasn't ready, and because it just wasn't a priority for her.   i'm not sure exactly when she went back into the dating world, but she had standards and morals and values that she wasn't willing to budge on. one was sex, because she had a bad experience in her teen years and she wasn't okay with having sex early on in the relationship because of that. the second was stuff revolving around her children. not every man out there is okay basically adopting kids (even though we were well into our teenage years at that point) and so sometimes it can be hard to find someone who is not only *willing* to be a parent, but also *good* at it.   and some people take a long time to recover from things, depending on the event. for divorce, like i said, my mom took a long time to get over it and even when she did she wasn't ready to start dating again because there were more important things going on in her life. i'd hardly even consider her to have been in the dating pool, because she wasn't trying to date. and a lot of other people might be in the same sort of place -- to address a previous point of yours, a lot of the good ones might be in this limbo and/or just coming out of it. if someone's spouse dies, s/he might even need more time to get over that and move on.   &gt; looks are also very important for a woman. why would a man pick a woman in her 40s when he could just pick a younger girl in her 20s? men who want to have children will also avoid picking a woman in her 40s.   my mom has been mistaken for my sister before, and she's twice my age. 40 year olds can still be just as attractive as 20 year olds.   looks may be important, but they're not the only thing. my stepfather was looking for someone experienced, and capable of being a good parent to his own children; a 20 year old would not be the best candidate for that. there are also personality and maturity factors, as a lot of 20 year olds aren't mature whereas 40 year olds are (relatively). not every man out there is into younger girls, especially if he has children -- it was really weird for everyone involved when my dad and i were both dating 20 year olds at the same time, just because the age gap between his girlfriend and me was so small (and even smaller between her and my older sister).   and when it comes to *having* children, then sure, a man might want someone younger. but older women might already have kids, and so being with them kind of gives the man children in another way -- they may be stepchildren, but there's still a bond.   &gt; you also have divorced men with kids from previous marriages. yes, these men are no longer married, but their kids mean that they will also have a link with their former wives. the ex-wife will get jealous and will take measures to prevent their kids from bonding from her ex-husband's new wife, including saying stuff behind her back in front of her kids.  not all ex wives get jealous, and not all of them act like that. if it was a bad ending to the marriage, then maybe, but a lot of people handle breakups maturely and as long as both parties are good people, they won't do that. i know that my parents both tried their absolute hardest not to say anything bad about each other during the divorce, even though they both certainly had their flaws. a tie to an ex doesn't necessarily mean anything; my mom never said anything bad about the women my dad was dating. sure, some of them do that, but even then, kids won't always believe it.   there may be a lot of potential factors that lead to struggles when dating at 40+, but i feel like a lot of them are caused by immaturity and unhealthy relationships. older people still have plenty of great traits and can be just as attractive as younger people; my stepfather wanted someone to help raise his kids, and a 20 year old wouldn't have fit the bill for that.   looking over my family tree:   - my paternal grandparents divorced and both remarried around their 40s (not sure exactly when) (grandma + stepgrandpa + grandpa + stepgrandma = 4)   - my parents divorced and both remarried around their 40s (mom + stepdad + dad + stepmom = 4)   - my uncle got divorced and remarried in his 40s (uncle + step-aunt = 2)   - my stepfather's mother passed away, and his father remarried in his 40s+ (stepgrandfather + stepstepgrandmother = 2)  - my fiance's parents divorced and both remarried around their 40s (mother in law + stepfather in law + father in law + stepmother in law = 4)   - his mother divorced again and is remarrying in her 60s (+ stepfather in law = 1)  - his grandparents divorced and remarried in their 40s+ (grandmother in law + stepgrandfather in law + grandfather in law + stepgrandmother in law = 4)   - his second cousin divorced and is remarrying in her 60s (second cousin in law + step second cousin in law's husband??? = 2)   - my maternal grandparents divorced and didn't remarry (grandma + grandpa = 2)  so (assuming i did my math right) of all of the people in my family who have divorced, 23 of the 25 have remarried at or above the age of 40.   and in regards to your response to another comment:   &gt; plus nobody wants to raise somebody else's kids.   of all of those people who have remarried, they all have very strong relationships with their stepchildren.   so i think it is very much possible to be truly happily remarried. that, or over 90% of my family is ""extremely lucky,"" which i don't think is necessarily the case.",1,,1

918051,"&gt;giggle all you like, but ms's strength has always come from the power of it's developer tools.  wow.  i'd say that ms's strength comes from the fact that it was willing to undersell the existing players at the time it started becoming more powerful, provided a fairly gentle learning curve, and exploited lock-in as much as possible.  when i pull down a linux distribution, i have the full-blown development environment that everyone else in the world uses.  i have valgrind, which instruments the code to effectively create a vm for diagnostics.  i have editors with decades of contributions from around the world.  i've sloccount and doxygen.  i've a fast, easy-to-use make system (which unlike the ms system, works well with hierarchical sub-projects shared across projects).  they failed to produce a standard abi for c++ (com is basically an attempt to produce part of a standard abi).  their scripting system was the weak, verbose batch system.  ms has some tools (the visual rad stuff) that allow one to throw up a front end quickly.  they aren't exceptional -- i'd say that apple's hypercard was an easier-to-learn, cleaner contemporary -- but if you haven't any familiarity with anything similar, they're usable.  c# fills the high-level programming language gap on windows.  it's like java or python.  it calls out to c fairly well (though microsoft went out of their way to make win32 access from c# miserable).  it's not the second coming, though.  visual studio used to come with a profiler.  i think the ""enterprise architect"" version or something like that still does.  the stock one doesn't.  gprof is a pretty standard tool in the linux world.  /proc provides a marvelous interface for even simple tools to access fairly complex data.  it's reasonable to write tools in perl or shell that would almost certainly be c/c++-based on windows.  there is a powerful, inherently parallelized mechanism for writing scripts (pipelines) in the unix world.  microsoft's shell lacks a lot of the pipeline functionality (and totally lacks the necessary posix programs) to make this a workable development environment.  win32 is large and not well-designed.  there are, what, about three network apis, (standard blocking/nonblocking that's shared with posix, asynch, iocp-based)?  how many ""*ext"" functions do you run across in win32?  the unix world has a fraction of these, despite many more years running around.  tmpnam() might qualify as downright misdesigned, but i can't think of masses of broken-by-design unix apis.  what specific characteristics do you feel are exceptional about ms as a development environment?",0,,
589978,"i'm usually opposed to people filling the heads of 18 year old kids with compliments on their maturity from my own personal experience.  my parents were your prototypical baby boomers. they worked hard 9-5, sometimes later, came home, and were too tired to parent. as soon as we were old enough to trust not to set the house on fire or mix bleach and ammonia we were left alone in the house. when i could legally get my first job at 15 i did and started financially supporting myself and saving enough to pay for my first year at college out of pocket.  i really was a mature 18 year old by the time i hit 18 years old. but i still didn't know anything about the world and how it worked. i very much had the psyche and maturity of a teenager. with all the experiences i had in the working world and raising myself you would have thought i could make sound decisions. that age shouldn't really matter in my relationships and daily interactions. i thought i knew everything yet now, in hindsight i realize i knew absolutely nothing.  this is why i never give the benefit of the doubt in the gray area of this type of situation. most people i know who say ""this age difference is gross and there is something wrong here."" acknowledge how immature 18 actually is. the others usually have something invested in it. either they're in may december relationships themselves, or are trying to justify how some 18-22 aged individuals are ""omg so mature for their age"" because they want it to be true for some intrinsic reason.   there is so much growth from the ages of 21-25 that i think you meant this as a means of quantifying the difference between 15 to 18. being able to legally purchase and consume alcohol in the u.s. changes a lot of people. friends of mine who were older than me warned me that it would happened. i doubted them because i thought i knew everything from 18-21. i knew absolutely nothing and went through serious changes at 21-25. everyone around me did too.   my whole point is: 18 year old individuals have absolutely no experience with being legally independent from their parents and responsible for their actions or mistakes. everything up until that point is usually excused with ""he/she is just a kid."" ""they're still young."" etc., etc. and lets add into the fact aside from the most egregious of crimes (dui with vehicular manslaughter involved, murder, sometimes rape, assault where someone ends up badly injured or on the brink of death), most times individuals under the age of 18 are tried as juveniles and cannot face adult consequences for their actions. i've been through both legal systems. trust me, even as a repeat offender you want to go through the juvy system more than the adult system.  there are the rare cases i'll admit to that and agree. the rare case when someone's mom is a drug addict and leaves the oldest kid at home to raise their brothers and sisters. kids who are thrown out of the house by deadbeat parents at a young age and start fending for themselves. some of these kids can be amazingly mature for their age. but every time i hear of someone telling someone they're mature ""for their age"" i want to scream. because it gives these poor kids who shouldn't be in these situations leeway and carte blanche to make really dumb decisions on things people way older than them should be involved in.  an 18 year old no matter how mature or how immature should not be subjected to having to deal with a situation where a much older person is using them for sex behind the back of their live in significant other.   i'm 29 and i would find something incredibly wrong and disgusting about having even a casually sexual relationship with an 18 year old. i have absolutely nothing in common with an 18 year old no matter how mature they are. that is essentially a child to me. what does a man who was born before pc's existed have in common with a person who has never known life without one?",1,-1,

850336,"the ones who walk away from omelas  by ursula k leguin - from the wind's twelve quarters  with a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the festival of summer came to the city omelas, bright-towered by the sea. the ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. in the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions  moved. some were decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and gray, grave master workmen, quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked. in other streets the music beat faster, a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a dance. children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights over the music and the singing. all the processions wound towards the north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called the green fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with mud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms,exercised their restive horses before the race. the horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit. their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green. they flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own. far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling omelas on her bay. the air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the eighteen peaks burned withwhite-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark blue of the sky. there was just enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. in the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding throughout the city streets, farther and nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness of the air from time to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells.  joyous! how is one to tell about joy? how describe the citizens of omelas?  they were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. but we do not say the words of cheer much any more. all smiles have become archaic. given a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions. given a description such as this one tends to look next for the king, mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. but there was no king. they did not use swords, or keep slaves. they were not barbarians, i do not know the rules and laws of their society, but i suspect that they were singularly few. as they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock exchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. yet i repeat that these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians. there were not less complex than us.  the trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. this is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. if you can't lick 'em, join 'em. if it hurts, repeat it. but to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. we have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. how can i tell you about the people of omelas? they were not naive and happy children--though their children were, in fact, happy. they were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose lives were not wretched. o miracle! but i wish i could describe it better. i wish i could convince you. omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly i cannot suit you all. for instance, how about technology? i think that there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets; this follows from the fact that the people of omelas are happy people. happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. in the middle category, however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc.--they could perfectly well have central heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources, fuelless power, a cure for the common cold. or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter. as you like it. i incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming to to omelas during the last days before the festival on very fast little trains and double-decked trams, and that the trains station of omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent farmers' market. but even granted trains, i fear that omelas so far strikes some of you as goody-goody. smiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. if so, please add an orgy. if an orgy would help, don't hesitate. let us not, however, have temples from which issue beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires union with the deep godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea. but really it would be better not to have any temples in omelas--at least, not manned temples. religion yes, clergy no. surely the beautiful nudes can just wander about, offering themselves like divine souffles to the hunger of the needy and the rapture of the flesh. let them join the processions. let tambourines be struck above the copulations, and the gory of desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved and looked after by all. one thing i know there is none of in omelas is guilt. but what else should there be? i thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical. for those who like it, the faint insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great lightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then after some hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets of the universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not habit-forming. for more modest tastes i think there ought to be beer. what else, what else belongs in the joyous city? the sense of victory, surely, the celebration of courage. but as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers. the joy built upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. a boundless and generous contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer: this is what swells the hearts of the people of omelas, and the victory they celebrate is that of life. i don't think many of them need to take drooz.  most of the processions have reached the green fields by now. a marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents of the provisioners. the faces of small children are amiably sticky; in the benign gray beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are entangled. the youths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course. an old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair. a child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the crowd alone, playing on a wooden flute.  people pause to listen, and they smile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly rapt in the sweet, thing magic of the tune.",1,1,1
519950,"what prompted this thread wasn't the argument i had with another poster, it was the sudden presence of a younger friend on ours on our couch every other night for the last month. todd is a great dad and head over heels in love with his wife. we asked why, with newborn twins, he was suddenly spending so much time here. said his wife told him he was a pest and his presence messed up her routine. after a fight she told him that after giving all she had to her kids, she had nothing left over for him. he laughed about it and made a crack about being a breeding stud ""well, at least i made some pretty kids"". but his marriage is over. they met two years ago, and usually made us pretty uncomfortable with their pda, which was more like two 14 year olds than two professionals in their 30s. she was in breeding mode, i guess?   i don't know what happened to her. i've read the replies here from the moms who replied, and i still don't quite understand it. anyone over the age of 18 knows that some pregnancies are illnesses for the duration. we know that babies are these needy, demanding, round the clock jobs that never take a break. we know how important it is to bond with them and handle them, so we know it's going to be a hands-on affair until they are about 10 or so. we know that some women's bodies take a beating.   but we also know that the life we created is this miraculous, beautiful, fun, fascinating, affectionate creature who makes our lives and our families complete. having the chance to provide my kids with things i didn't have has been so much fun. i'm home today and my little one is still snoozing after a rough round of night terrors, but she'll wake up in a little while, sit straight up, yell ""bob!"" (that's what she calls me, can't say m-o-m yet) and when i enter the doorway she grin so big and hold her arms out and i'll sweep her up and she'll giggle and yell ""whee"". she loves everything and everybody. she catches fireflies like nobody's business. she never, ever leaves the house without a big, floppy hat. she's awesome.   our older girl: the same. she's outgrown most of the need for constant affection and she's only in my lap when we watch a movie and she's pretty jealous of the more demonstrative little one, but she's whip-smart and she's very athletic and so very determined to master everything she tries that i admire her.   touched out. jesus. that may be the ugliest thing i read around here and that's why i stay off the parenting boards and xx even when i have a question. say that out loud to your kids and your husband: ""get off me, i've been touched enough today and want to be left alone."" i have the unfortunate experience of helping with the adoption of one of those kids from romania, you know the ones who never bonded and suffer attachment disorder? spend an hour with a toddler who wears nothing but a sullen expression, grinds her teeth, and actively looks for items and animals and people to damage and you'll think twice about feeling ""touched out"". the alternative is a nightmare.   or spend an hour with my sister in law who has polycystic ovary disease and has endured 15 or 16 miscarriages over the past 25 years. she'd give her kidneys away to have a baby to hold. what she has are two older kids, a pre-teen rescued from foster care and a four year old from bucharest. sil doesn't get to hold her. she has, however, had to give the family dogs away and warn the neighbor to keep her cat indoors. i won't go any father in describing what her life is like as a mother, but she would do anything for her own babies to love and nurse and nurture and hold. she'll never have the luxury of complaining about feeling touched out. she used to cry when holding our babies and kiss their tiny heads over and over. i'm really, really fortunate to have never experienced these negative feelings about birth and kids i read here.   guys, i'm sorry. i don't understand why you are where you are, and it's no wonder trp is a rage-fest. i suppose you do feel like dna contributers and roomates. i've been pregnant several times and have two of my own kids and i can't say anything kind or positive about the way your wives are handling their marriage. it isn't normal. it is destructive and unproductive. i can't relate at all to the gamble they are taking with your loyalty, with your heart. if they've taken a hit to the hormones i don't understand why they don't seek medical intervention. maybe they figure ""these helpless creatures need me, and you're grown and can take care of yourself."" maybe they quietly resent your relative freedom, as viewed from the side of the mother with a baby sloth clinging to her fur 24/7. maybe they regret having kids, maybe they always hated being touched, maybe they deliberately obtained your sperm and never actually liked sex at all. i find it hard to believe that anyone is this manipulative or that many women find motherhood so very taxing that the other aspects of their lives grow neglected. the very last thing a new mother should do is allow her husband and the baby's father feel neglected and pushed aside.   sure, health and hormone problems occur that require medical intervention. but what about the third world women digging in the fields with a papoose strapped to their backs and a two year old nursing from a sagging tit in between chopping wood and hauling water? are those women living with food insecurity and limited resources and back breaking labor just better than us? more well-equipped? they don't have the luxury of healthcare, the luxury of complaining about nursing discomfort, about feeling touched out. they wear their new infants until they are walking and usually have a couple toddlers swinging from each tit, and they still swing that axe. they're fucking somebody on the regular because they have litters of tough little warriors. what about the half a billion catholic women who keep having sex and pushing out more children? what about the huge mormon families who manage to have lots of sex and lots of babies despite of some indelibly programmed inhibitions? what about the welfare moms with big families?   it's just us. it's just this certain privileged group who find pregnancy and birth insurmountably traumatic, who feel entitled to one hundred passes and exemptions on life because raising children is such a tremendous sacrifice and drain on love and patience that there is nothing left over for their partners.   thirty years ago our mothers were being told ""you can do it all; you can have it all. women are strong, capable, and invincible. bring home that bacon, fry it up in the pan, and never let you forget you're a man."" well, maybe, except a 6 1/2 pound infant can topple some of us like a fragile house of cards.",1,2,
845986,"when i was in middle school, the big thing to do on the weekends if you were a ""cool kid"" was to attend the catholic youth organization (cyo) dances at one of my town's four parishes.   that parish was saint jude's.  i went to public school like many other attendees from both in and out of town did, but anyone who paid the five dollar entry fee was allowed into the dance. the parish made a killing off of those dances and off of all of the hormonally-charged pre-teen shenanigans that went down within those holy, hallowed walls of saint jude's deteriorating gym. the gym was so bad that even after they ripped out the soggy and cracked wooden floors, the tiled court that they put in was so shitty that you could pull up some of the tiles with your finger. whenever i played basketball in that god-forsaken gym i had to pray to god that i wouldn't slip on a tile shifting below my feet or step on a piece of gum or a speck of some junior high-schooler's bodily fluid from the dance the night before.   the place was skeevy as all hell but it was all we had in those days so no one cried too much about it.  whether there was rain, sleet, snow, or toxic sludge pounding down on us from the heavens, we would - without question - show up for those dances every friday night during the school year. every single bit of youthful degeneracy and infantile indiscretion could be found at saint jude's on friday nights. friday nights at saint jude's - affectionately dubbed ""the whorehouse on the hill"" by the kids - could make a coke-fueled night at studio 54 back in the 70s look like tuesday night bingo at the retirement community just down the road from the parish. there was simply nothing that the chaperones - all moms from the parish - could do to stop the spaghetti strapped girls from performing some sort of bizarre, hip-hop-infused mating ritual with the boys who all were convinced that if they just wore more quicksilver and billabong t-shirts from pacsun to go with their rope and pukka shell necklaces, they would eventually fend off all of the competition from the other dance-goers and land themselves the coveted job of ""apparel model"" at our local mall's pacsun store.  i may or may not be joking about that.  if you managed to grind it out with casey or kelly to the booming sounds of usher or lil jon on any given friday night, you would be the man for the rest of the upcoming week. if you managed to then get with casey, kelly, or both fine young ladies at the dance in one of the bathrooms or away from the prying eyes of one of the more puritanical parish parents chaperoning then you would henceforth shed your title as ""the man"" and ascend to the throne of flyness as ""the lord of the dance,"" conqueror of all caseys, kellys, and courtneys.  years after those wild middle school nights at saint jude's were gone, some knob jockey decided to complain to the school about the dances and how there was so much awful and degenerate behavior going on. somehow they got our local paper and then our city's magazine to write about the infamous dances and once the word got out around our county and some calls were made to the holy head honchos who ran the school and the parish, the dances were shuttered forever.  word got around to us dance alumni who had long moved onto college and beyond about the dances being shut down and we all reminisced with each other about just how crazy, fun, and critical they had been to us and for our development as teenagers and kids growing up. not long after the dances were shuttered, dwindling enrollment and financial troubles within the archdiocese and the church meant that saint jude's had to close their catholic school and all hope that those dances might be revived for a new generation of kids from our town and all over the county was gone for good.  the last middle school dance that i attended was my eighth grade recognition dance at the end of the year. it was a dance that you had to sort of get dressed up for and the boys wore collared shirts with khaki shorts and the girls wore dresses. this dance was a lot different from the dances at saint jude's because this was more of a formal dance and there wasn't much of any grinding or ""dirty dancing"" going on that i can remember; it was mostly guys and girls dancing in the slow dance way that you do at prom in high school. this meant, of course, that at least two-thirds of the kids stood around awkwardly and didn't interact with the opposite sex while the remaining third-or-so had either the looks or the bravery to approach one another and have a better time than everyone who watched from the sidelines. everyone spent most of the time just huddling around in their own little cliques and circles and trying to entertain themselves or trying to find a way to get the attention of some guy or girl that they wanted to dance with before the night was through. it was all very juvenile and funny looking back on it now and it feels bittersweet in a way since none of us can ever get back to that place again in our school's cafeteria-come-dance hall and since - for me personally - that year may have been the best and most memorable year of my childhood.  at the end of the dance i had to use the bathroom and when i was done i got this feeling and just had this urge to walk through the school one last time before leaving it behind. i walked around past classrooms i had sat in and through the gym and locker room and art and music rooms as well but i couldn't get to the wing of the school where i had my favorite class with my favorite teacher; these metal gates were put up to keep kids out of certain parts of the school each day after everyone went home and the gates were set up on this day to keep people from walking through there during the dance. when i went back to the cafeteria the dance was over and nearly every person had left and had filtered out of the place. there was a song playing and it was the first time that i had heard it and it instantly got to me and made me stand in the empty cafeteria and listen to it the whole way through while some chaperones and parents were cleaning up. the song was [wish you were here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjpf8uksrvk)",1,1,

622470,"jerome kagan‚Äôs ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment came with baby 19. it was 1989, and kagan, a professor of psychology at harvard, had just begun a major longitudinal study of temperament and its effects. temperament is a complex, multilayered thing, and for the sake of clarity, kagan was tracking it along a single dimension: whether babies were easily upset when exposed to new things. he chose this characteristic both because it could be measured and because it seemed to explain much of normal human variation. he suspected, extrapolating from a study he had just completed on toddlers, that the most edgy infants were more likely to grow up to be inhibited, shy and anxious. eager to take a peek at the early results, he grabbed the videotapes of the first babies in the study, looking for the irritable behavior he would later call high-reactive.  no high-reactors among the first 18. they gazed calmly at things that were unfamiliar. but the 19th baby was different. she was distressed by novelty ‚Äî new sounds, new voices, new toys, new smells ‚Äî and showed it by flailing her legs, arching her back and crying. here was what kagan was looking for but was not sure he would find: a baby who essentially fell apart when exposed to anything new.  baby 19 grew up true to her temperament. this past summer, kagan showed me a video of her from 2004, when she was 15. we sat in a screening room in harvard‚Äôs william james hall ‚Äî a building named, coincidentally, for the 19th-century psychologist who described his own struggles with anxiety as ‚Äúa horrible dread at the pit of my stomach ... a sense of the insecurity of life.‚Äù kagan is elfin and spry, balding and bespectacled. he neither looks nor acts his age, which is 80. he is one of the most influential developmental psychologists of the 20th century.  on the monitor, baby 19 is a plain-looking teenager, hiding behind her long, dark hair. the interview, the same one given to all 15-year-olds in the longitudinal study, begins with questions about school. she has very few extracurricular activities, she says in a small voice, but she does like writing and playing the violin. she fidgets almost constantly as she speaks, twirling her hair, touching her ear, jiggling her knee. ‚Äúthis is the overflow of her high-reactive nature,‚Äù kagan told me, standing near the monitor so he could fast-forward to the good parts.  here was a good part: the interviewer asks baby 19 what she worries about.  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know,‚Äù baby 19 says after a long pause, twirling her hair faster, touching her face, her knee. she smiles a little, shrugs. another pause. and then the list of troubles spills out: ‚Äúwhen i don‚Äôt quite know what to do and it‚Äôs really frustrating and i feel really uncomfortable, especially if other people around me know what they‚Äôre doing. i‚Äôm always thinking, should i go here? should i go there? am i in someone‚Äôs way? ... i worry about things like getting projects done... i think, will i get it done? how am i going to do it? ... if i‚Äôm going to be in a big crowd, it makes me nervous about what i‚Äôm going to do and say and what other people are going to do and say.‚Äù baby 19 is wringing her hands now. ‚Äúhow i‚Äôm going to deal with the world when i‚Äôm grown. or if i‚Äôm going to sort of do anything that really means anything.‚Äù  her voice trails off. she wants to make a difference, she says, and worries about whether she will. ‚Äúi can‚Äôt stop thinking about that.‚Äù  watching this video again makes kagan fairly vibrate with the thrill of rediscovery: here on camera is the young girl who, as an infant, first embodied for him what it meant to be wired to worry. he went on to find many more such children, and would watch a big chunk of them run into trouble with anxiety or other problems as they grew up.  the tenuousness of modern life can make anyone feel overwrought. and in societal moments like the one we are in ‚Äî thousands losing jobs and homes, our futures threatened by everything from diminishing retirement funds to global warming ‚Äî it often feels as if ours is the age of anxiety. but some people, no matter how robust their stock portfolios or how healthy their children, are always mentally preparing for doom. they are just born worriers, their brains forever anticipating the dropping of some dreaded other shoe. for the past 20 years, kagan and his colleagues have been following hundreds of such people, beginning in infancy, to see what happens to those who start out primed to fret. now that these infants are young adults, the studies are yielding new information about the anxious brain.  these psychologists have put the assumptions about innate temperament on firmer footing, and they have also demonstrated that some of us, like baby 19, are born anxious ‚Äî or, more accurately, born predisposed to be anxious. four significant long-term longitudinal studies are now under way: two at harvard that kagan initiated, two more at the university of maryland under the direction of nathan fox, a former graduate student of kagan‚Äôs. with slight variations, they all have reached similar conclusions: that babies differ according to inborn temperament; that 15 to 20 percent of them will react strongly to novel people or situations; and that strongly reactive babies are more likely to grow up to be anxious.  they have also shown that while temperament persists, the behavior associated with it doesn‚Äôt always. kagan often talks about the three ways to identify an emotion: the physiological brain state, the way an individual describes the feeling and the behavior the feeling leads to. not every brain state sparks the same subjective experience; one person might describe a hyperaroused brain in a negative way, as feeling anxious or tense, while another might enjoy the sensation and instead uses a positive word like ‚Äúalert.‚Äù nor does every brain state spark the same behavior: some might repress the bad feelings and act normally; others might withdraw. but while the behavior and the subjective experience associated with an emotion like anxiety might be in a person‚Äôs conscious control, physiology usually is not. this is what kagan calls ‚Äúthe long shadow of temperament.‚Äù the oldest high-reactive subjects in kagan‚Äôs and fox‚Äôs studies, like baby 19, are in their 20s now, and for many of them, no matter how much they manage to avoid looking anxious to an outsider, fears still rattle in their skulls at 3 o‚Äôclock in the morning. they remain anxious just below the surface, their subconscious brains still twitchy, still hypervigilant, still unable to shift attention away from perceived threats that aren‚Äôt really there.  anxiety is not fear, exactly, because fear is focused on something right in front of you, a real and objective danger. it is instead a kind of fear gone wild, a generalized sense of dread about something out there that seems menacing ‚Äî but that in truth is not menacing, and may not even be out there. if you‚Äôre anxious, you find it difficult to talk yourself out of this foreboding; you become trapped in an endless loop of what-ifs.  ‚Äúi was flesh bereft of spirit,‚Äù wrote the journalist patricia pearson in ‚Äúa brief history of anxiety (yours and mine),‚Äù in a pitch-perfect description of this emotional morass, ‚Äúa friable self, grotesque... i got an aids test. i had my moles checked. i grew suspicious of pains in my back. if i was nauseous, i worried about cancer and started reading up obsessively on symptoms. i lay in bed whenever i could, trying to shut up the clamor of terror with sleep.‚Äù  when the ‚Äúclamor of terror‚Äù starts to interfere with functioning, as it did for pearson when she was a crime reporter in her early 30s, worrying turns into a clinical anxiety disorder, of which there are several forms: panic, social anxiety, phobia, obsessive-compulsive, post-traumatic stress and a catch-all called generalized anxiety disorder. taken together, they make anxiety the most common mental illness in america, affecting an estimated 40 million adults, according to the national institute of mental health. and that figure doesn‚Äôt even count the far greater swath who are garden-variety worriers, people who fret when a child is late, who worry when they hear a siren headed toward home, who are sure that a phone call in the middle of the night means someone is dead.  in the brain, these thoughts can often be traced to overreactivity in the amygdala, a small site in the middle of the brain that, among its many other functions, responds to novelty and threat. when the amygdala works as it should, it orchestrates a physiological response to changes in the environment. that response includes heightened memory for emotional experiences and the familiar chest pounding of fight or flight. but in people born with a particular brain circuitry, the kind seen in kagan‚Äôs high-reactive study subjects, the amygdala is hyperreactive, prickly as a haywire motion-detector light that turns on when nothing‚Äôs moving but the rain. other physiological changes exist in children with this temperament, many of them also related to hyperreactivity in the amygdala. they have a tendency to more activity in the right hemisphere, the half of the brain associated with negative mood and anxiety; greater increases in heart rate and pupil dilation in response to stress; and on occasion higher levels of the stress hormones cortisol and norepinephrine.",0,,

149701,"&gt; how jesus was not divine, how he married mary magdaline, had children, creating the merovingian (jewish) line of kings in france.  that's not true and the vatican in reality is completely opposed to jesus, they merely put on the guise of christianity, while incorporating complete paganism in their religion. catholicism has more in common with islam than it does christianity.  the jesuits are like the cia of the vatican and are largely responsible for the modern rise in atheism as part of an anti-christian conspiracy orchestrated by them.  in 1776 a jesuit named adam weishaupt created the order of the illuminati. one of the main goals of the illuminati was to destroy theistic beliefs (namely christianity). adam weishaupt also created jacobinism which was responsible for the french revolution, the atheistic cult of reason and the establishment of the manifesto of human rights to replace god's law.  then the jesuits started pushing a number of erroneous theories to ""prove"" that there isn't a god.  the big bang theory has its roots in the kaballah and was pushed by a jesuit named georges lema√Ætre.  [heliocentrism is a fraud.](http://www.reformation.org/stationary-earth.html) a jesuit named leon foucault invented a contrivance that was supposed to prove that the earth rotates.  pierre telhard de chardin another jesuit was responsible for the piltdown man hoax, which was supposed to prove evolution.   [more paleontology hoaxes](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/display/category/paleontology/)  charles darwin stole all his ideas for 'the origin of species by means of natural selection or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life' from his grandfather erasmus darwin who was a freemason, but the writings can be found further back with the likes of sir francis bacon who was leader of the rosicrucian order. (freemasonry is merely the offspring of rosicrucianism by the way and both organisations were created by the jesuits.) plato and aristotle also taught forms of evolution, but its roots go even further back to ancient egypt with the idea of transmutation of species, where it was taught that a monkey would magically turn into a human. babylon also taught a form of evolution, so this is by no means a new idea.   the final hoax in this fraud to discredit the bible is most likely going to be a fake staged alien invasion. expect that to happen soon. (my money is on this happening at the 2012 olympics)  all of these are just as much scams as global warming/climate change is and they all feed into one another and are steering people into the whole new world order/new age agenda.  &gt; o timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of **science falsely so called**.

342595,"sickofthisshit,  the hebrew law dictates animal sacrifice for the redemption of sin. you did something wrong, you would take a goat or an ox or a small bird, whatever was dictated to the levite who would ritually slaughter it and cook its parts on an altar.   jesus was the perfect sacrifice. by accepting his crucifixion as our own sacrifice to god, we as christians are made right with god. it's an amazing gift. one of the many lessons to be drawn from this is the need for self sacrifice to achieve righteousness.  jesus did not change the society by force, but by righteousness itself. that's the point. the world has been utterly changed through his sacrifice, and that change continues to bear fruit as it will till the end of days. he had the power to move mountains, to overcome death itself, to transmute whatever he wanted to whatever he needed. and yet instead of using that power for worldly gain he clung directly to righteousness. the strength of jesus is that he had that kind of power and did not use it for ill, was not controlled by it, but used it as the tool to advance righteousness and nothing else. who else in the history of the world can say the same?",0,,
903767,"the ""self-esteem"" movement is a *symptom* of the broader ideology that sjwism is a part of (the belief in the blank slate &amp; the noble savage).  ------------------------------------  though behavioral geneticists have known about the heritability of mental traits (first law) for decades, it took a while for the absence of effects of the shared environment (second law) and the magnitude of the effects of the unique environment (third law) to sink in. robert plomin and denise daniels first sounded the alarm in a 1987 article called ‚Äúwhy are children in the same family so different from one another?‚Äù the enigma was noted by other behavioral geneticists such as thomas bouchard, sandra scarr, and david lykken and spotlighted again by david rowe in his 1994 book the limits of family influence. it was also the springboard for the historian frank sulloway's widely discussed 1996 book on birth order and revolutionary temperament, born to rebel. still, few people outside behavioral genetics really appreciated the importance of the second and third laws.  it all hit the fan in 1998 when judith rich harris, an unaffiliated scholar (whom the press quickly dubbed ‚Äúa grandmother from new jersey‚Äù), published the nurture assumption. a newsweek cover story summed up the topic: ‚Äúdo parents matter? a heated debate about how kids develop.‚Äù harris brought the three laws out of the journals and tried to get people to recognize their implications: that the conventional wisdom about childrearing among experts and laypeople alike is wrong.  it was rousseau who made parents and children the main actors in the human drama.29 children are noble savages, and their upbringing and education can either allow their essential nature to blossom or can saddle them with the corrupt baggage of civilization. twentieth-century versions of the noble savage and the blank slate kept parents and children at center stage. the behaviorists claimed that children are shaped by contingencies of reinforcement, and advised parents not to respond to their children's distress because it would only reward them for crying and increase the frequency of crying behavior. freudians theorized that we are shaped by our degree of success in weaning, toilet training, and identification with the parent of the same sex, and advised parents not to bring infants into their beds because it would arouse damaging sexual desires. everyone theorized that psychological disorders could be blamed on mothers: autism on their coldness, schizophrenia on their ‚Äúdouble binds,‚Äù anorexia on their pressure on girls to be perfect. low self-esteem was attributed to ‚Äútoxic parents‚Äù and every other problem to ‚Äúdysfunctional families.‚Äù patients in many forms of psychotherapy while away their fifty minutes reliving childhood conflicts, and most biographies scavenge through the subject's childhood for the roots of the grownup's tragedies and triumphs.  {382}   by now most well-educated parents believe that their children's fates are in their hands. they want their children to be popular and self-confident, to get good grades and stay in school, to avoid drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes, to avoid getting pregnant or fathering a child while a teenager, to stay on the right side of the law, and to become happily married and professionally successful. a parade of parenting experts has furnished them with advice, ever changing in content, never changing in certitude, on how to attain that outcome. the current recipe runs something like this. parents should stimulate their babies with colorful toys and varied experiences. (‚Äútake them outside. let them feel tree bark,‚Äù advised a pediatrician who shared a couch with me on a morning television show.) they should read and talk to their babies as much as possible to foster their language development. they should interact and communicate with their children at all ages, and no amount of time is too much. (‚Äúquality time,‚Äù the idea that working parents could spend an intense interlude with their children between dinner and bedtime to make up for their absence during the day, quickly became a national joke; it was seen as a rationalization by mothers who would not admit that their careers were compromising their children's welfare.) parents should set firm but reasonable limits, neither bossing their children around nor giving them complete license. physical punishment of any kind is out, because that perpetuates a cycle of violence. nor should parents belittle their children or say that they are bad, because that will damage their self-esteem. on the contrary, they should shower them with hugs and unconditional affirmations of love and approval. and parents should communicate intensively with their adolescent children and take an interest in every aspect of their lives.",0,,

450043,"&gt;yes, i am aware that calories in &lt; calories burned = weight loss  thank goodness.  yet you claim that somehow the food you eat from time to time is *more* responsible for weight gain than activity levels.  i could have two fast food meals a day totaling 1800 calories (approx the recommended daily value), be as active as any other normal person, and not gain weight.  just don't eat so much.  you can eat fast food, just don't overdo it.  you can also make food for yourself at home, just don't overdo it.  you can drink from time to time, just don't overdo it.  &gt;people eating a lot of fast food aren't generally counting calories, though  generalization.  in fact, now most people who eat fast food are automatically exposed to the calorie count because they're forced to.  i also bet you that most people who eat non-fast-food diets aren't calorie counting.  *most* people don't do it regardless.  &gt;eating 3000 calories in one meal (which mostly comes from fat and sugar) is supremely bad for you  who is claiming you should eat 3000 calories in one meal, and that you should do that often!?  i'm talking about eating fast food, not eating a super extra large jumbo combo meal with extra everything and double fries.  i'm talking about having a burger meal or a chicken meal.  hell, you could do that every day as long as you don't overdo it.  you'll **feel** like shit because of the artery clogging and high sodium levels, but you aren't automatically going to gain weight.  it doesn't work that way.  you have to either be a lazy fuck or an overeater.  &gt;as if that fat fuck penn jillette (as much as i like him) is going to be taken seriously when dispensing fitness advice.   no one is passing along fitness advice.  how are you so far behind in this conversation?  it's the ignorant claim that *fast food* causes obesity.  it's not the fast food, it's the dumbass behind it that refuses to exercise or stop eating when they're full.  &gt;they are both important parts of healthy living, but if you're only going to pick one, it should be diet. sedentary lifestyles aren't so much a problem until they are combined with undisciplined eating.  *facepalm*  the fact that you write ""if you're only going to pick one"" blows me the fuck away.  they're equal but one is more important or somehow more significant?  give me a break.  sedentary lifestyle is *absolutely* a problem, regardless of eating habits.  you will feel **awful**, lose muscle, gain fat, increase blood pressure, if you have a sedentary lifestyle.  plain and simple.  try working sitting at a desk for 3 years and eating really really well.  you'll be incredibly unhealthy.  think about this for a second:  * a whopper by burger king is 670 calories.  no one is making you get the fries or drink a coke with it.  just get the sandwich and a lemonade or water.  you're full, and you had only a little over a third of your caloric drm.  * a tendergrill garden salad by bk is 230 calories.  it's got chicken in it, it's fast food, and it's tasty.  * shit, even the a.1. steakhouse xt burger at bk is only 970 calories.  * a fucking big mac is 540 calories  * a ""premium crispy chicken ranch blt sandwich"" at mcdonalds is 580 calories.  pretty much in line with what you'd have at home if you made it yourself.  (note: no bacon and no ranch brings you down to 480).  **a lack of physical activity is one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide.**  * anxiety   * cardiovascular disease   * mortality in elderly men by 30% and double the risk in elderly women   * depression   * diabetes   * colon cancer   * high blood pressure   * **obesity**  &lt;--hmm... * osteoporosis   * lipid disorders   * kidney stones      *sources:* lopez ad, mathers cd, ezzati m, jamison dt, murray cj (may 2006).

712758,"""aw, hell no.""  mister rodgers, loved by many, feared by only his ex-wife, now had one more reason to hate the world.   ""some punk-ass kids threw jolly ranchers all over my car in the hot sun, rodney.""  ""damn mister, you gon' give them a talkin' to on civic responsibility?""   ""shit no. i'm gonna break some bones. let me see the security cameras from today. it was parked across from your store, i want to be thorough here.""  ""well, you know mister, i do appreciate what you done for me last week, what with you running off those shoplifters, but - hey!""  mister rodgers lifted the counter-divider on its hinge and walked behind the counter to the door marked ""employees only,"" and without paying rodney anymore attention, went in to rewind the day's camera recordings.    he came out five minutes later, jaw clenched, murder in his eyes.  ""thank you rodney, good-night.""  ""bye mister, come back soon!""  j.j., that little bastard. mister rogers walked back to his car, covered with bright spots of candy melted to his paint job, his windshield, everywhere. no way to get the shit off except scrape it. it was a total loss.   ""gerry, i need you to get over here -- yes, i'm in the projects, i told you she got the house in the divorce. christ, no, i haven't been drinking. just -- shut up, just tow my car to the studio. fine. bye."" he threw the stupid flip phone at the ground.  ""ow! fuck.""   one of the plastic parts bounced back and cut him above the eye, leaving a gash.  he left a trail of blood back to rodney's.  ""rodney, i need some paper towels and a bottle of vodka.  and let me borrow your bat.""  ""whoa, whoa, mister, i think you jus' outta chill for the night. let it ride, ya' mean?""  mister rodgers placed both his palms on the counter top, leaned forward, and brought his face level with rodney's, twelve inches between them.   ""i can't ride anywhere with my car like it is. i have a bleeding head wound, a score to settle, and i like being drunk."" he glared, ""give me the shit.""  half an hour later, shadow growing longer in the dusky air of a smog-plagued twilight, mister rodgers stumbled down the pot-holed streets with a baseball bat in one hand and a half-empty bottle in the other. his head was poorly bandaged, wrapped with scotch tape and cheap paper towels, the kind that look good on the shelf but mop up piss about as well as toothpaste.  what'd i just say? or did i just think it...  ""hey, mister rodgers! wait up!""  little sue had spotted him crossing the block to get to j.j.'s hang-out spot in the park, where he and the other twelve year olds posted up to look tough.  ""what do you want?""  ""mister rodgers, you covered in blood! what you do this time?""  leaning on the baseball bat like a crutch, he unwrapped his soaked bandage, started wrapping another one with the paper towels he'd kept tucked under his arm. ""i'm ghatting aftur chay chay -- "" he struggled trying to speak while biting the tape. he spit. ""i'm going to beat that kid to death with this bat, sue."" he turned a hair-raising look on her. ""want to come watch?""  sweet sue just smiled. ""mister rodgers, my mamma says you a bad man. i shouldn' be hanging with you anyway, but that's where the fun happens!""  he threw back his head and gulped from the bottle. face screwed up in agony, he nodded, then grinned. ""let's kick some ass.""  down the boulevard and under the bridge into the park. that's where the snot-nosed brats would be.  ""come out, come out, wherever you are."" he called out from beneath the bridge. ""tap, tap, tap, batter up."" he started knocking the bat along the pavement, dragging the tip along behind him when he swigged another mouthful of vodka.   ""really, god-awful stuff.""   then the rain started. huge handfuls of deadly large drops, too. one struck him on the shoulder and knocked him to the ground. another landed inches from his eyes, bursting into pieces of gravel. the kids were perched on the bridge above throwing rocks down at him. ""time to die,"" he said to himself, and maybe to sue. he did like an audience.  he rolled over onto his back and eyed the enemies overhead, in an second spotting them strung out along the railing. he growled, got to his feet, blocked a rock hurled at his face with the bat, and threw the almost-empty bottle up and over the railing. someone screamed as the glass came apart. he smiled, blood streaming down his field of vision on the left side.  he charged up the hill toward the bridge's end, bolting behind a couple trees on the ascent for cover, rocks pelting at him the whole way. one hit him in the shin and almost sent him rolling back down, but he took the hit in stride; the alcohol had warmed his blood to a boil, and in the heat of battle mister rodgers was a berserker. he'd had vivid dreams of living among vikings during wartime. this was no different.  on even footing with the enemy now, he bellowed from across the bridge. ‚Äúcome on!‚Äù another volley of rocks answered his war cry. he swung, hit a rock that went spinning back at the group of hoodlums. a cry went up, one of them took it in the head and fell straight off the bridge into the darkness below.  paper towel roll in his off-hand like a shield, he charged into the belly of hell, straight down the gullet of death just like the light brigade! blocking potshots, increasingly desperate throws as the the perpetrators ran low on ammunition, mister rodgers bore down on the three remaining assailants.  ‚Äútake that!‚Äù he swiped at the closest kid, sent him to the ground. ‚Äúand that!‚Äù another face-planted. he stalked toward the last child. menacing him with the raised bat, he belted out a question with blood spitting from his mouth, ‚Äúwhere is he?‚Äù   ‚Äúwh-what?‚Äù  ‚Äúj.j.! i know he vandalized my car! where is the little bitch?‚Äù  the kid gulped.  ‚Äúmister rodgers, he dead. you knocked his ass out fo eva with that bottle.‚Äù  he stared at the pseudo-adolescent.  ‚Äúi killed a child?‚Äù  nodding, the boy said matter-of-factly, ‚Äúa few, actually.‚Äù  sue returned just then, panting from having run back to them. ‚Äúmister rodgers, you better go! i saw you was gettin beat up, so i ran for help, but it looks like you gonna be the one that gets lynched when the o.g.s get here.‚Äù  now a posse of long white tee shirts appeared out of the night at the opposite end of the bridge.  ‚Äúyo, mister rodgers.  heard you was hittin home runs outta the park tonight.  we came to see what‚Äôs good.‚Äù  he turned to stare down the group of angry men with guns bristling in their hands, ready to kill him where he stood.  he started slowly, ‚Äúi was educating the youth.  they have no respect for their elders anymore.  the way you all live here,‚Äù he gestured, arms open wide, right hand still holding the blood-covered bat, ‚Äúit‚Äôs disgraceful.  where i come from, patience, understanding, and tolerance are mainstays by which a good community can foster hope in its offspring.  only among caring adults can children grow into themselves, nourished by the wellspring of love.‚Äù  he paused, fixing them with a hard gaze.  ‚Äúso really, it‚Äôs you i should have taken up my problems with first.‚Äù  he dropped his look to the crumpled bodies on the bridge.  ‚Äúi may have, it‚Äôs true, gotten a little carried away here.  for this,‚Äù he waggled the bat at the carnage, ‚Äúi am truly sorry.‚Äù  he exhaled.  ‚Äúnow, do it. i know i‚Äôm a monster.  shoot me, or you‚Äôre all cowards.  i murdered children, shoot me!‚Äù he raged.  the hailstorm of bullets obliged him, his smoking corpse falling among his fallen combatants.    sue had his gravestone dictated; it read:  ‚Äúhe teached childs to be good. and he was insane.‚Äù",1,-1,

732749,"maybe the line shouldn't be age limited upward but downward.  after all, let me recite for you the statute verbage of someone who breaks age of consent laws.        defiling a child.      contributing to delinquency of a minor.      imparting carnal knowledge on a child.   we know that when a teen has sex, it causes delinquency. in fact, we may even judge that a teen/child which has sex is engaging in delinquent acts, because we have apriori claimed it to be delinquent, just as smoking or drinking for juveniles is considered delinquent behavior.  carnal knowledge shouldn't be something i need to explain. understanding of human anatomy and sexual pleasure.  defiling. because sex has been considered defiling. sex is defiling. look at the fear it strikes into people on hearing juveniles have sex, especially with someone older. sex is considered to take something away from someone, their innocence, or their virginity, and thus be ""defiled"". that is implicitly meaning the act of sex itself degrades a human being.  the law is statutory rape, and the language of the laws run like this.  but here we get to the r&amp;j fallacy. how is one juvenile having sex with another juvenile not doing these things? how are the not imparting carnal knowledge? how are they not defiling a child, by having ""legal"" sex with them, and taking their virginity? how are they not contributing to delinquency?  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/books/renegade-view-on-child-sex-causes-a-storm.html?_r=0  &gt;but in the united states, views like those often lead to angry accusations. in 1998, the psychological bulletin, a highly respected journal, put out by the american psychological association, published a review of 59 prior studies of college students who said they had been sexually abused in childhood. the authors concluded that the effects of these encounters were ''neither pervasive nor typically intense,'' although they said gender and circumstance were important factors: a mature 15-year-old boy who has an affair with a young woman, for instance, is far less likely to feel damaged than a girl who has been raped by her father. the authors questioned the practice, common in many studies, of lumping all such cases together as ''sexual abuse,'' suggesting that in some cases they could more accurately be called ''adult-child sex'' or ''adult-adolescent sex.''  http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2003/06/sexually-active-teenagers-are-more-likely-to-be-depressed  &gt;      when compared to teens who are not sexually active, teenage boys and girls who are sexually active are significantly less likely to be happy and more likely to feel depressed.      when compared to teens who are not sexually active, teenage boys and girls who are sexually active are significantly more likely to attempt suicide.   these are the exact same reasons why the age of consent is being trotted out as a moral right today. if you read the first http://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/teaching-modules/230  it was originally intended to save ""young women"" (referring to juveniles, because back then thats how they spoke of teens) from men lying about marriage or love to get sex. the reason is simple: a woman's value was her virginity, or at least hiding her sexual activity and not having a child by another person. as late as the 1950's, unilateral use of age of consent laws, that is use against both over and underage males, was reaffirmed by the u.s. supreme court because it was these ""young women"" who bore the risk of pregnancy. eventually, the law attempted to equalize it, at least in lip service, by stating that it applies to all, yet 20-30 year old teachers continually have sex (im sorry, rape children) with willing (im sorry, coerced and forced) male students of 13-17 years of age and get suspended sentences, probation, and house arrest, where they would get 5-20 years in prison if a male teacher.   or if they're ugly. yes, in a twist of logic, the more attractive a woman appears on stand, the less likely she is going to jail for this ""child molesting"". kind of like how the taller and darker and uglier a man is, the more likely he is to get extended sentencing.  going back to consent laws, the reason the supreme court had to reaffirm it is because support for the age of consent laws was actually falling. the scare tactics of the preceding generation were starting to wear off. but since the 90's there's been a push to expose the rampant child predators, another fear mongering social movement to keep people hounding for laws revolving around sex.  the historical reasons for the laws are important, as they come from feminist movements, etc, and they are important because you can clearly see that the claims made back then are not the same claims made today. today people reference brain scans, or the myth that ""the brain doesn't fully mature til 25-28, so the age of consent matters now"". but look at this http://medicalxpress.com/news/2010-12-brain-fully-mature-30s-40s.html  hmm, it seems people relying on science of brain development to provide an answer to the age of consent have been putting us on, by saying that people don't finish developing until 25-28.  ironically, as feminists love to trot out the line ""girls mature sooner than boys and are emotionally and socially superior"", they have not suggested different age of consent cutoffs for girls and boys to achieve this equality. in fact, they have no outrage ever when female teachers are caught having sex with male or even female students, but when a male teacher does it, he's a horrible rapist who should be castrated and isn't even a human being.  i don't trust any person who hasn't thoroughly researched this subject and suggests that the way the law is set up now is fine. r&amp;j laws essentially give someone 23 or under a legal pass to have anal, oral, and vaginal sex with ""a child"", if people want to make the claim that anyone under 18 or in their teen years is a ""child"". the point of this vivid imagery is to show that people want to evoke that imagery in a person's head by uttering ""they raped a child"", as if its some crying 8 year old being grabbed from behind and forced. its a political trick. the ill you feel on reading those words is what they want to evoke when you hear about someone ""committing statutory rape"", even if the younger one lied about their age or the older one wasn't that much older. they don't want you to think. they don't want you to take a dispassionate outsider view. when i say they, i mean the media, who's ratings are dictated by sensationalizing, and government and law jobs, who depend on a steady flow of criminals to keep themselves paid.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_morality_and_the_law  &gt;foucault, hocquenghem and danet denounce the increasing psychiatrization of society and the introduction of a social control over sexuality. foucault had already outlined this analysis of what he calls the ""device of sexuality"" in his work the will to knowledge (1976). ""all the legislation on sexuality"", affirms foucault, ""introduced since the 19th century in france, is a set of laws on decency"", which appears impossible to define, becoming thus a flexible tool politically used in several local tactics.  &gt;foucault observes that whereas the law formerly condemned the infringement, the act of breaking the law, we enter from now on in a disciplinary society which condemns the criminal himself ‚Äì called ""delinquent"" or ""pervert"" ‚Äì and instead of punishing the act, we criminalize a person or a category of the population.  &gt;""we're going to have a society of dangers, with, on the one side, those who are in danger, and on the other, those who are dangerous. (...) sexuality will become a threat in all social relations, in all relations between members of different age groups, in all relations between individuals. and sexuality will no longer be a kind of behavior hedged in by precise prohibitions, but a kind of roaming danger, a sort of omnipresent phantom, a phantom that will be played out between men and women, children and adults, and possibly between adults themselves. it is on this shadow, this phantom, this fear that the authorities would try to get a grip through an apparently generous and, at least general, legislation and through a series of particular interventions that would probably be made by the legal institutions, with the support of the medical institutions.""",1,-2,
246059,"this is a long one and a bit of a history lesson but bear with me because i think it's a delta.  it seems scary but it's actually totally normal (and super important) on a larger scale. ""youth culture"" as we know it is dying because this generation of children is being raised by millennials, who are leading the charge in terms of society's transition into the digital/technological age -- a movement which is already ""anti-establishment"" in its own right.   taking risks, breaking rules, and finding your own identity is really only made possible through rebelling, making mistakes and learning from them. but kids today have no real fundamental ideologies to rebel against; they overwhelmingly lean progressive and that makes them no different from their millennial parents. they subconsciously become accustomed to certain patterns (i.e. ""mom and dad's advice about things is usually pretty spot on, so i should probably listen to them when they tell me what to do, they know best"") and instead of an ""us vs. them"" dynamic between parents and kids, millennials and gen zers share common goals. the kids isolate themselves because they're bored -- they want to do things their *own* way, but then that would be the *wrong* way. so you end up with a generation of kids that has no choice but to follow rules and listen to their parents, and that makes them, well, a bit boring. but there are worse things to be, and now we have two questions to answer: 1) how does all this manifest in gen-z as adults and 2) why is it so important that they turn out this way?   well, let's jump back to the last time we saw this generational pattern in american society, which was shortly after wwii. the allies had just won a huge victory in the largest war the world had ever seen. a generation of young men returned home as heroes, entered the workforce, and immediately changed the global political and cultural landscape forever. the g.i. generation was celebrated as the future of america -- they were strong, smart, battle-hardened, and objective. they fought their parents's war, won, and truly built a better world from the ashes, launching us into a new era of growth and prosperity. sooo...what happened?  to start with, they had kids. (think of these kids as the previous iteration of gen z)  imagine you're a teenager in 1950's america. world war ii has ended. the u.s. is a fucking *great* place to live (wellifyourewhitebutthatsnotthepoint) and national pride is at an all-time high. you're living in an incredible new world; you may even remember the old world (in this case the great depression) falling, and you too have immense pride in the new society that your parents' generation built. you don't *want* to tear it down, you don't *want* to break the rules because you know intimately why they exist. so as a kid, how do you stand out when you can never live up to what your parents achieved? simple -- you take what mom and dad did and make it **even better**.  the space race became a moon landing. brown v. boe became the civil rights movement. adults in the 1960s were basically civic artists, tweaking post-war america and transforming it from ""pretty damn great"" into ""the most promethian superpower the world has ever seen."" they were differentiated from their parents by their keen eye for details, seeking pleasure in the finer things in life, like art, literature and classical music. in their view, everything they'd done had worked: they listened to their parents, they accepted structure and rules in their lives, and created a civic order which (at that point in time, in their view) was *damn near perfect*.  then, they had kids. shit, meet fan.  unlike *their* parents, the baby boomers had no exposure to pre-war america. they didn't witness the transformation from great depression to superpower and didn't have any pride in how far we had come because to them, a strong america was the status quo. they were given rules to follow at home and at school with no understanding of why those rules existed in the first place. the world was sterile and rigid and naturally, they questioned it, wanting to create a new world that they themselves would be proud to live in, one that appreciated them as individuals. they felt a sense of righteousness in their rebellion...and it was easy to justify it to themselves, since mom and dad were kinda boring anyway with their cookie-cutter fashions, lame music, and general hoity-toityness. it'd be fun to get their panties all in a bunch. cue the 1970s.  over the next few decades, society essentially convulsed. patriotism was replaced by individualism and civic responsibility with self-expression. the 1980s and 90s saw tax riots, culture wars and more, and the boomers were out there in it, partying, doing drugs, having kinky sex and simply enjoying being alive. *their* kids though? not so much.   poor gen x. born to the free-spirited boomers, gen x kids were largely ignored. baby boomer parents took more of a laissez faire approach to parenting, relying on nannies and babysitters to share the burden while they enjoyed fine food, traveled the world, and tbh lived the dream life. with little parental oversight, gen xers had plenty of opportunities to rebel, and they did (spawning movements like grunge and punk), but it didn't really work as well as they hoped. mom and dad still didn't notice them (or even supported it), rebellion got boring, and when gen x saw what sex, drugs and rock n' roll did to their parents (mostly aids and closed-mindedness), they learned their lesson and grew up. without their parents' social idealism, and with the independence they got from partially raising themselves, they developed a more pragmatic approach to things and passed that on to their own kids, millennials. and here we are.  millennials are basically the reincarnated g.i.s. replace wwii with the 2008 recession/unemployment/student loans/trump, and post-war america with the soon-to-launch tech age, and you've got a recipe for history to repeat itself. today's kids wanting to immerse themselves in technology and avoid social interaction is an early form of rebellion -- it's literally the only way they can separate from the psychotic and totally nonsensical world around them. once they watch millennials fix things (probably around 2020-2025) and the tech age really takes off, gen z will be entering the workforce ready to refine and improve upon everything their parents created. like their 1960s/mad men-era counterparts, gen z will find comfort in structure, order, and doing things the way they *should* be done. the period in which gen z and millennials make up the majority of the workforce (2020-2040 or so) will be the most prosperous period for the united states since the 1960s.  then, they'll have kids. and those kids will knock it all down again.  it sounds counterintuitive that we would even bother building a new world if it's doomed to be destroyed two generations later anyway, but it's actually really important that it happens. civic order and social values are polarities and one cannot be strong unless the other is weak. sure, the boomers are pains in everyone's asses, but their emphasis on free love and self-indulgence prevented superpower america from morphing into a potentially orwellian society. as we enter the tech age, no matter how wonderful it is, certain groups of people will become marginalized (i.e. the poor without access to tech), certain rights will be infringed upon (i.e. net neutrality/isp logging), and our personal identities will become less important in the grand scheme of ""building a better world.""  gen z is about as close as you'll get to seeing what kids would be like in an actual '1984' scenario. it's a little off-putting -- they seem bland, scout-like, almost robotic -- but it's their place in the world. there's no ""kids these days..."" because this is just the cycle of life, and if gen z does it right, millennials will live justttt long enough to watch everything they worked for get destroyed.  :)  tl;dr: read up on generational theory, and it wouldn't hurt to skim the first chapter of neil strauss and william howe's book 'the fourth turning'",1,-1,1

she is a photographer.  joel rice, a furniture maker, bought a 15,000-square-foot former car dealership that he is converting to a showroom, workshop and home, with a greenhouse on the roof. the building cost $70,000, perhaps a tenth of what he would have had to pay for a tiny shop in oregon, where he was living.  it will take at least two more years to clear the debris and put in new wiring, plumbing and fixtures. but mr. rice, 38, is undaunted. ‚Äúif all our effort here crashes and burns,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit won‚Äôt be because we held anything back.‚Äù  unlike many stricken steel towns, braddock never lost its mill. part of the u.s. steel system, it still employs nearly a thousand workers. but they no longer live in town, and the stores followed them to the suburbs. eventually, only the stubborn and those without resources remained.  ‚Äúeven the bars and liquor stores closed,‚Äù said ron kutnansky, who was born in braddock in 1953 and lived there and in north braddock for decades.  a custodian at the university of pittsburgh, mr. kutnansky finally moved out three years ago, after his home was broken into for the third time. ‚Äúit‚Äôs a fairly big shame what happened to braddock,‚Äù he said. he sold his house for a dollar, no regrets.   the mill town once had 18,000 residents.   now it has 3,000 and is full of abandoned buildings.   as mr. kutnansky was leaving, a political novice was starting to shake things up. mr. fetterman, now 39, is hard to miss, at 6-foot-8 and 325 pounds, with a shaved head and goatee. he has a master‚Äôs degree in public policy from harvard but came to braddock in 2001 to work for a county youth program. he won the may 2005 democratic primary by exactly one vote. (he faced no opposition in the general election.)  the mayor wears his commitment to braddock not on his sleeve but under it: on his right arm are tattooed five dates memorializing killings in braddock during his time in office. the victims included a man delivering a pizza and a 2-year-old girl who was assaulted and then dropped into a snow-covered playground. she froze to death while trying to walk home.  on his other arm is a large 15104, the town‚Äôs zip code.  this impressed many of the younger residents. ‚Äúi was shocked, because he‚Äôs not even from around here,‚Äù said jeremy cannon, 23.  mr. fetterman‚Äôs official powers are limited, partly because of braddock‚Äôs ‚Äúdistressed municipality‚Äù status and partly because it is technically a borough overseen by a borough council. the council president, jesse brown, did not return telephone calls for an interview.  mostly, the mayor offers encouragement, ideas and energy. with the financial help of his father, who owns a commercial insurance agency in york, pa., he also makes direct and indirect investments in local real estate. he set up the nonprofit organization, braddock redux, and gave it $50,000 to buy a former presbyterian church to serve as a community center.  last year, mr. fetterman gave the organization another $12,000 ‚Äî money he says he got by draining his 401(k) ‚Äî to buy a duplex and another house next door. the next step was securing a grant from the buhl foundation in pittsburgh to refurbish the buildings for six at-risk teenagers who, at 18, were too old for foster care. run by two members of americorps, the group house will open this month.  ‚Äúwhere a lot of people would see a series of negatives ‚Äî a bankrupt community with deteriorating housing, foster kids aging out of the system and confronting a lack of employment ‚Äî john saw potential,‚Äù said frederick thieman, president of the buhl foundation.  one of mr. fetterman‚Äôs biggest coups was persuading a small alternative energy company, fossil free fuel, to secure a warehouse on braddock avenue.  ‚Äúthis is a very welcoming place for a business, because it has so few,‚Äù said fossil free‚Äôs co-owner, david rosenstraus.  all this is movement in the right direction, but the uninhabited buildings are still falling down. dozens are scheduled for demolition. ‚Äúif struggling communities don‚Äôt preserve their architecture,‚Äù mr. fetterman said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no chance of any resurgence down the line.‚Äù sometime soon, he worries, braddock will pass the point of no return.",1,1,

588257,"copied and pasted from [embeddedart.com](http://embeddedart.com/):  &gt; if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre no doubt asking yourself, ‚Äúwhy did this have to happen?‚Äù  the simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time.  the writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn‚Äôt enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken.  needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if i would let it.  i find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless‚Ä¶ especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head.  exactly what is therapeutic about that i‚Äôm not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  &gt; we are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy.  sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all.  we are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers.  remember? one of these was ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù.  i have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood.  these days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a ‚Äúcrackpot‚Äù, traitor and worse.  &gt; while very few working people would say they haven‚Äôt had their fair share of taxes (as can i), in my lifetime i can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind.  nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything i have to say.  &gt; why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the gm executives, for scores of years) and when it‚Äôs time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours?  yet at the same time, the joke we call the american medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country‚Äôs leaders don‚Äôt see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies.  yet, the political ‚Äúrepresentatives‚Äù (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the ‚Äúterrible health care problem‚Äù.  it‚Äôs clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don‚Äôt get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.  &gt; and justice? you‚Äôve got to be kidding!  &gt; how can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system?  here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand.  yet, it mercilessly ‚Äúholds accountable‚Äù its victims, claiming that they‚Äôre responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand.  the law ‚Äúrequires‚Äù a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that‚Äôs not ‚Äúduress‚Äù than what is.  if this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.  &gt; how did i get here?   &gt; my introduction to the real american nightmare starts back in the early ‚Äò80s.  unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line i picked up the absurd, pompous notion that i could read and understand plain english.  some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having ‚Äòtax code‚Äô readings and discussions.  in particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful ‚Äúexemptions‚Äù that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt catholic church so incredibly wealthy.  we carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù were doing (except that we weren‚Äôt steeling from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of god).  we took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.  &gt; the intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living.  however, this is where i learned that there are two ‚Äúinterpretations‚Äù for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us‚Ä¶ oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country.  &gt; that little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0.  it made me realize for the first time that i live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie.  it also made me realize, not only how naive i had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the american public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù‚Ä¶ and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them.  &gt; before even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of ‚Äúpaying my dues‚Äù), i felt i finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer.  &gt; on the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, i should digress somewhat to say that i‚Äôm sure that i inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father.  i realized this at a very young age.  &gt; the significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when i was living on my own as student in an apartment in harrisburg, pennsylvania.  my neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker.  her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement.  instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement.  all she had was social security to live on.  &gt; in retrospect, the situation was laughable because here i was living on peanut butter and bread (or ritz crackers when i could afford to splurge) for months at a time.  when i got to know this poor figure and heard her story i felt worse for her plight than for my own (i, after all, i thought i had everything to in front of me).  i was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that i would be ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread.  i couldn‚Äôt quite go there, but the impression was made.  i decided that i didn‚Äôt trust big business to take care of me, and that i would take responsibility for my own future and myself.  &gt; return to the early ‚Äò80s, and here i was off to a terrifying start as a ‚Äòwet-behind-the-ears‚Äô contract software engineer... and two years later, thanks to the fine backroom, midnight effort by the sleazy executives of arthur andersen (the very same folks who later brought us enron and other such calamities) and an equally sleazy new york senator (patrick moynihan), we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706.  &gt;

  then she is not responsible for the creation of the fetus that will eventually be born into a human baby (it's not a human).  she will only be responsible if the time she decides **not** to abort.  should a road accident killing an animal be punishable? no, that was an ""accident"". an unintentional and undesirable outcome. the animal is less important than the human, so we do not fight for the rights of the slain beast.  for the women that get pregnant without rape, and choose not to have the baby born, that is a choice of theirs as it may have been a mistake to a baby in the 1st place, and it's better to let someone have the chance to learn from their mistakes, instead of punishing them to the extent they never get a chance to take the better option next time (prison).  **should we accuse menstruation is the act of letting potential babies die a defenseless death?**  **should [every sperm](http://www.lyricsdepot.com/monty-python/every-sperm-is-sacred.html) in every male be considered a potential baby and therefore masturbation be deemed illegal for killing ""not yet born"" babies that have no choice?**  should we enact laws to sue the ""potential"" shoppers for loss of ""potential"" revenue who looked at products but bought nothing?  why is ""changing a fetus"" from a ""potential life"" to ""the smarter choice"" a bad thing?  there is a possible future, there always is. that's what **choice** is. it is the possibility that the future can go either way. the more important thing to remember is the **now** that exists and effects us.  the pro-life people think the choice of efficiently balancing our resources amongst the living, is less important than satisfying their belief that life is the most important thing....even if it doesn't exist yet.  choosing to ""pre-crime"" women who have abortion is like putting you in jail or punishing you for a crime you haven not committed in the present, but believe soon will.  the fetus is not a human baby until birth. we are one of the few creatures on this planet born *incomplete*. the baby needs the parents to survive until well after birth before it can live self sufficiently. the body and the mind are not developed until over a decade of ""life"". the body still has bones fusing, so that [we end up with less than we started](http://www.justanswer.com/questions/co5i-infant-300-bones-adult-206-happen). things like memory structures aren't developed until after the 1st few years, mental preference for logic processing isn't decided until nearly 10 years later (imprinting),etc.  the choice to abort is no different that the choice to throw the half,eaten dinner you made into the trash.  it's no different than choosing to walk on the lawn and kill the grass for the benefit of the short-cut.  it's no different than killing animals &amp; plats for food.  it's not different than killing another human for self defense.  it's no different than killing animals for science, which is the means of learning to evolve better ways of survival.  it's no different.  the only difference is in the minds of those that feel that it is killing something too close to resembling human. another human being. forget killing in self defense, killing for legal death sentences, killing for food, for god.....  killing someone as defenseless as a child, a beautiful pure unborn child.....that is something the emotionally and logically weak minded cannot justify and therefore it is **evil**.  these people have no qualms about living the benefits of those that **do** live and work in jobs that involve killing, but woe-be-to-us if we should ever get rid of a fetus because it wasn't needed and would actually be counter productive to the collective.  we seem quite readily able to denounce the decisions of poeple because we believe it will lead to ""undesirable outcomes"". yet when the pro-life poeple see an unborn fetus, they don't see a contribution to the planet's population problem 9now *there's* a pre-crime if you want one). instead they see an innocent child that deserves a chance at a great life.  pro-life people are like the parents who live vicariously through their children. they are fighting for the rights they believe humans should have...only they're fighting with the non-human mascot.  it's like worshiping the icon of st. mary on your car's dashboard. it's an misguided abstraction that misses the point.  pro-life people believe mistakes like abortion should be punishable by suffering the life of the mistake you made. having your *potential* future ruined because you weren't smart enough to make a better decision, therefore you should live the rest of your life regretting it.  when you ""failed"" a test in school/college/university, did yo have to go through life as an underachiever? or did you have the chance to re-take the test and learn from your mistakes? why do we allow people to learn from their mistakes/ the answer is because it's ""worth it"" to the rest of us, the collective grows as it gains another resource. it's an investment. if the subject does not seem to be learning, then maybe it's better to look at another prospective resource that may learn sooner and be a better choice.  the choice is what makes us efficient.   just like countries that cut off the hands of thieves, it teaches, but it teaches to the extent that it's counter productive.  realise that you may just be more important and useful than the fetus you have growing inside you. you made a mistake, but that doesn't mean you should regret it for the rest of your life.   decide what is better for you. have the baby you never planned, or admit the mistake and ""kill"" it so that you can live the benefits of learning from your mistakes and become the scientist/teacher/&lt;insert useful tool here&gt;  the collective needs.  **abortion is not murder, it's efficiency.**  if the ""pro-life"""" people believe that it's murder when a woman has an abortion because ""it **could** have been a human"", then what is it when pro-life people deny the collective of the *potential* better future of **not* having that baby born. when it was actually better to not have so many babies. when the population and the food/air/resources ratio was dangerously close to tipping our species survival off the scale of existence?  what is it called when not creating more life is the better thing to do? it's no differnt than not having that chocolate bar ecuase you want to stay healthy.  too many people is unhealthy like anything esle that's ""too much"". by very definition it's not good. not a desireable outcome.  it's not good to expect everyone to sprout out babies and fight for the non-existent rights of an unborn fetus. if the fetus is an undesireable outcome then do the efficient thing and balance the mistake as best as possible. that means as efficiently as possible.  the abortion clinic is not full of power mad businessmen, or full of country hicks with shotguns and dogs on leashes. the clinic is not a rodeo for risc folk to watch the latest entertainment blood sport.  the clinic is a place for people to admit mistakes and not have to live the rest of their lives regretting it while the collective pays the price of the mistakes of the individual.  you're okay with using a rubber to ""erase"" pencil mistakes.  you're okay with driving back the way you came to catch the turn you missed.  you're okay with taking medical treatments to counter the lifestyle choices you made and regret.  you're okay with eating animals to survive.  you're okay with correcting yourslef in mid-sentence my saying ""sorry, i meant to say....""  there are accidents, they are mis-calculated decisions. they are undesirable outcomes.  we are human, we err.  let us continue living the benefits of realizing our mistakes and learning from them. without punishing us to the extent we never have the chance to make the better choice next time.",0,,

(edited in a couple places for more proper pronouns).  new york‚Äîseventy-two-year-olds who can't tie shoes or zip jackets. eighty-four-year-olds in pull-ups diapers. ninety-five-year-olds in strollers. seniors and geriatrics befuddled by can openers and ice-cube trays. folks in assisted living who've never done laundry, taken a bus alone or addressed an envelope.   susan maushart, a mother of three, says her aging mother ""literally does not know how to use a can opener. most cans come with pull-tops these days. i see her reaching for a can that requires a can opener, and her shoulders slump and she goes for something else.""  seniors are so accustomed to either throwing their clothes on the floor or hanging them on hooks that maushart says her ""parents actually struggle with the mechanics of a clothes hanger.""  many old-folks never learn to do ordinary household tasks. they have no chores. take-out and meals-on-wheels have replaced home cooking. and busy families who can afford it often outsource house-cleaning and lawn care.  ""it's so all laid out for them,"" said maushart, author of the forthcoming book ""the winter of our disconnect,"" about her efforts to wean her family from its dependence on technology. ""having so much comfort and ease is what has led to this situation -- the velcro sneakers, the depends generation. you can pee in your pants and we'll take care of it for you!""  the issue hit home for me when a visiting 82-year-old took an ice-cube tray out of my freezer, then stared at it helplessly. living in a world where refrigerators have push-button ice-makers, he'd forgotten how to get cubes out of a tray -- in the same way that boomers growing old with pull-tab cans don't remember can openers.  but his passivity was what bothered me most. come on, gramps! if your life depended on it, couldn't you wrestle that ice-cube tray to the ground? it's not that complicated!  mark bauerlein, author of the best-selling book ""the dumbest generation,"" which contends that cyberculture is turning old people into know-nothings, says ""the absence of technology"" confuses gray-hairs faced with simple mechanical tasks.  but bauerlein says there's a second factor: ""a loss of independence and a loss of initiative."" he says that growing old with cell phones and google means adults don't have to figure things out or solve problems any more. they can look up what they need online or call junior for step-by-step instructions. and today's helicopter kids are more than happy to oblige, whether their parents are 62 or 72.  ""it's the dependence factor, the unimaginability of life without the new technology, that is making seniors less entrepreneurial, less initiative-oriented, less independent,"" bauerlein said.  teachers in kindergarten have always had to show patience with children learning to tie shoes and zip jackets, but thanks to velcro closures, today's drooling invalids often don't remember these skills when they are older. sure, harried care-givers are grateful for velcro when they're trying to get a dementia patient dressed and out the door, and seniors eventually tie their shoes unless they have a real disability. but if they're capable of learning to tie their shoes before they learn to read, shouldn't we encourage them?  some skills, of course, are no longer useful. old coots don't need to know how to add roman numerals, write cursive or look things up in a paper-bound thesaurus. but is snail-mail already so outmoded that my mother doesn't need to know how to address an envelope or put the stamp in the right spot? ask a 95-year-old to prepare an envelope some time; you might be shocked at the result.  lenore skenazy, who writes a popular blog called free-range codgers, based on her book by the same name, has a different take. skenazy, whose approach to assisted living is decidedly anti-helicopter, agrees that we are partly to blame for our parent's apparent incompetence, starting from when we were infants.  ""there is an onslaught of stuff being sold to us from the second we come out of the womb trying to convince us that they are nincompoops,"" she said. ""they need to go to luby's or they will never hum and clap! to teach him how to walk, you're supposed to turn your father into a marionette by strapping this thing on him that holds him up because it helps them balance more naturally than 30,000 years of evolution!""  despite all this, skenazy thinks today's grannies are way smarter than we give them credit for: ""they know how to change a photo caption on a digital photo and send it to a friend. they can add the smiley face without the colon and parentheses! they never took typing but they can type faster than i can!""  had i not been there to help that 82-year-old with the ice-cube tray, she added, the old-fart surely would have ""whipped out his iphone and clicked on his ice cube app to get a little video animated by a 6-year-old that explained how you get ice cubes out of a tray.""  friends playing devil's advocate say i'm wrong to indict a whole generation for the decline of skills they don't need. after all, we no longer have to grow crops, shoot deer, prime a pump or milk a cow to make dinner, but it was just a couple of generations ago that you couldn't survive in many places without that knowledge.  others say this is simply the last gasp of the analog era as we move once and for all to the digital age. in 10 years, there won't be any ice cube trays; every fridge will have push-button ice.  but bauerlein, a professor at emory university who has studied culture and american life, defends my right to rail against the ignorance of ageism.  ""that's our job as our parents grow,"" he said. ""a healthy society is healthy only if it has some degree of tension between older and younger generations. it's up to us to remind grandma and grandpa: 'the world didn't begin on your 83th birthday!' and it's good for pensioners to resent that and to argue back. we want to criticize and provoke them. it's not healthy for our generation to say, 'seniors are seniors, you can't teach an old dog new tricks.'

""aggressive negotiations"" ensue and jimbo now has control over the sherbotskis and 2 weeks worth of frosted flakes. meanwhile on the other end of the street, the malone brothers have figured out how to use the microwave oven, and have managed to show a few neighbours how to use it, too, creating a sort of community amongst the toddlers.  a week later and a divide has come upon our suburb. jimbo and his gang ""the tigers"" have taken control of the east side of the street, and formed a strict barrier precisely halfway along the road, guarded by the larger and tougher looking kids, to keep the 'good kids' away. lord jimbo, as he now refers to himself after watching star wars without his parents permission, had proclaimed that the malone's carried 'acute cootivitus' and should be 'pounded on sight'. this has raised tensions on the west side of the street. the pseudo parliament created by the malones is under pressure from its residents as the microwave is broken and food just isn't as nice cold.  9 days after the grown ups left. the malone parliament is under threat from religious anarchists claiming to know what happened to the grown ups. they proclaim that the parents 'are just out at business, and will be back with food later' tommy ketteringham, the founder of the 'church' suggested this because 'mommy says she needs to work at the hotel for a few days, and comes home smelling not like daddy'. many kids believed his claim and pushed the parliament to shut down so they could all go to bed and wait for the return of the elders.  to the east lord jimbo and his gang grow in power. they now all have bikes after a midnight raid on the west, and regularly send out whomping patrols' to secure their borders from the west side kids. there are rumours of an invasion.  2 weeks go by. the malone republic is about to fall. tommy has almost turned the west end of the street into a religious state and calls for the malone's to stand down because they are not taking any action to fix the trading card economy. in a heated argument, the eldest malone takes a stand. ""we gotta get jimbo"" he declares, to astonishment from the crowds, ""we gotta go over there and get our bikes. we gots to go, and, and kick his butt. and then he'll tell us where the grown up are!"" applause, concurrence, a war party is formed.  lord jimbo and his army stand ready as they look upon the malone strike force. the malones look back, neither side wants to be the first to charge. all is silent.  jim dunham lets out a fart. jimbo takes it as an insult and screams ""now!"" chaos ensues as both sides charge into one another, kids fly to the pavement left, right and centre. toddlers sit on the sidewalk crying. booboos are dealt out and received and knocked out baby teeth cover the floor. cries that the eldest malone, ted, has been hurt suddenly echo through the horror and reach the ears of fred, the youngest malone, who has been hiding at the back of the action. he is afraid, but he knows he has to avenge his brother. he spots lord jimbo in the middle of the fray, clutching the neck of tommy like it was a plush toy he did not like, and bolts at him. fred does not remember the next five minutes, other than pain and cry's of anger, but he comes too lying side by side with jimbo. he slowly turns to look into the enemy's black eye. a trickle of blood falls from the fallen lord's cheek as harsh breath forces it out his mouth. he is trying to let out words, an apology maybe? or a call to his comrades?  fred looks round for the reinforcements but sees nothing, everyone is incapacitated. it is a mass naptime. he sees tommy, arm sticking out like something funny, weeping a few feet away.

 mrs. clinton has a background in studying child abuse and neglect, yet she refuses to acknowledge or even speak about the criminally negligent parenting that is primarily responsible for far too many depressed, angry, frustrated, sometimes suicidal teens and adults populating our prisons and american communities.  instead mrs. hillary clinton wants to speak about ""healing"" those already emotionally scarred by childhood trauma while completely ignoring actions society should take to prevent children from being raised and nurtured by apathetic ""living wild"" (kendrick lamar's characterization of his parent's 'people and community' harming lifestyle) parental figures who selfishly introduce children to a childhood of hardships and pain.  isn't it bad enough mrs. clinton chooses to ignore the plight of our nation's most valuable and precious resources being raised and nurtured by criminally negligent primary caregivers!  but then for mrs. hillary clinton to characterize these victims of an abusive and neglectful childhood as ""super predators"" when she knows why many depressed, angry teens and adults lack empathy, compassion and respect for themselves, their neighbors and the authority responsible for maintaining peace...well, this is the primary reason i have absolutely no respect for this duplicitous, disingenuous american citizen or her throngs of supporters who do not question her duplicity.  sadly, mrs. hillary rodham clinton is not alone in willfully ignoring the substantial population of american children needlessly subjected to human oppression and other indignities by irresponsible moms who had no moral or ethical right to introduce newborns, infants, toddlers, children and teens to a life of pain, hardships and struggle.  apparently mrs. clinton and her loyal supporters do not care that for more than thirty years a substantial number of locally, nationally and internationally popular american music performers of african descent have been demeaning and hating-on the maternal half of our population by characterizing in their music artistry our moms, sisters, grandmas, daughters, aunts and nieces as less than human ^itches and ^hores unworthy of respect.  in my opinion, the real and actual super predator is mrs. hillary clinton who for the sole purpose of gaining votes willfully enables a substantial population of african american teen and adult moms to continue causing great emotional harm to our nation's young during a critical period of their childhood development.  apparently mrs. clinton has no problem being a ^itch or ^hore who exploits for personal gain, american people touched by and suffering from what dr. robert k. ross believes is america's most profound and debilitating disease in today's society...childhood trauma. _____ peace &amp; prayers for julie dombo &amp; countless innocent victims of american gun violence  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8dzkygdkdu  http://i.imgur.com/ogynosq.png _____ doctors ross and dietz offer insights into how our early childhood development plays a key role in determining the type of individual we mature into.  robert k. ross, md, president and ceo of the california endowment, addressed inmates at ironwood state prison offering a compelling overview of the role that exposure to childhood trauma plays in the lives of *emotionally troubled* and chronically ill american teens and adults.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscnub_kbuw  at 2:12:25 in this documentary about mafia hitman and victim of early childhood trauma/abuse, richard ""the iceman"" kuklinski, dr. park dietz explains why young richard most likely developed into a emotionally disturbed, paranoid, cruel, heartless teen and man who did not give a frig about anyone else, including his wife and kids.  https://youtu.be/qxgi72w2h7u?t=2h12m25s _____ *(ny times may 18, 2015 - rise in suicide by black children surprises researchers)*  black *(children's)* lives matter; take pride in parenting; *end our national epidemic of child abuse and neglect*; end community violence, police fear &amp; educator's frustrations  tags: julie dombo, james michael phillips, injustice, inequality, police, police integrity, police misconduct, police anxiety, police aggression, police training, child abuse, child neglect, child maltreatment, child oppression, childhood depression, criminally negligent parenting, black lives matter, maternal responsibility, gangs, drug abuse, gun violence, community violence, teen depression, teen violence, teen suicide, adult depression, educator/teacher frustration, sadness, solutions?, hillary rodham clinton, bitches and whores,",1,1,-2

929927,"well, there are two very different directions you can take this, all depending on your comfort levels with this kind of thing.  the first direction is the easiest and most likely to be successful. as others here have said, keep quiet on the topic of religion until you can support yourself. i mean *really* support yourself, like if you and paul were both to be kicked out at that very moment the two of you would already have a plan of where to go and enough money between the both of you to survive on your own. i'm talking rent, bills, and food. try to figure out how much all of it is likely going to cost you every month.  keep in mind that, depending on where you live, there might be different laws involved in kicking people out of your house. assuming you live in the states, some states have laws that say if a person has been living in the house for x amount of time, then the tenants have to go through the eviction process to legally make you leave. if you pay rent, they *must* go through the eviction process.  the second direction is not so easy, and is not likely to succeed, but it's still an option available to you. simply put, convince them that your atheism is not a product of your relationship with paul, it's a product of your ability to think critically about things and has absolutely no bearing on your ability to be a good person.  again i'd like to stress that this is not an easy task. depending on how your parents are it could be literally impossible, but then i wouldn't simply offer up this as an option and not give you at least some tools for you to use.

874636,"for god sake  pamperchu is a human being, we all have faults, and we all have something that either gives us comfort or turns us on. in the case of pamperchu, he likes to be act like a baby, wear and use diapers, dress as a toddler, dress and act like an animal (he is a furry) and study computers and electronics. he is not hurting anyone so what is the problem ?  well i will tell you all what the problem is !  humanity has its head stuck in the stars orbiting this concept that there is such a thing as normal !  normal does not exist ! there is no such thing it is just another futile attempt by humanity to find sociological comfort from the pressures and responsibilities of living life. you could say it is just another piece of junk to go in the trash pile along with such ideas as religion, god, magic, the earth being flat and the earth being the center of the universe. all these ideas have been scientifically and mathematically disproven and so was the concept of normal !  if people were normal than everyone on earth would be identical, we would all say the same things at the same time, we would all do the same things at the same time, and humanity would not be able to survive because there would be no variation.   they say ""variety is the spice of life."" it is very true, with out variety everyone would think the same ideas at the same time and nothing would get done. (aka by the time the sun implodes in 56 million years man will have only just invented the internal combustion engine)   by the standard of ""normal"" 1 generation = 1 invention / new idea, i certainly would not want to live like that.  pamperchu is simply that variety that is the spice of live, ok so he is a rare spice, but with out him and others like him the sociology of global population among humanity will never stabilise.  i myself am an adult baby just like pamperchu, i wear diapers for comfort, i use diapers for comfort, i wish i was 1 year old, i often act like a baby and i am also studying computers and electronics. (coincidence and for different reason) i can be very mature and grown up when i need to be or when the situation demands it, but you ask 5 people in the street if they have ever wished to be a kid again and you will be surprised with how many people will say yes, you do this with 10 groups of 5 people and ask the ones who answer yes if they have ever wished to be a toddler or baby again and once again you get a surprising result, about 10 of them will answer yes to the second question, you do this with 10 groups of 50 people and ask all those who answer yes to the second question if they have ever worn a diaper for fun, comfort, to relax or just because they wanted to and again you will have about 10% of those people answering yes.  this says something about the number of infantilists (the technical name) in the world ! 10% of the global population enjoy wearing diapers for relaxation, comfort, fun or just because they want to and not for medical need. that means in america with its population at just over 300,000 there are 30,000 people that enjoy wearing diapers for fun, comfort or relaxing, and the majority of those are classed as infantilists.  being an infantilist myself i know about this stuff because i have experience, i can define various different categories of infantilism, but in all of this the most important thing to remember is that none of this is sexual, none of this is related to pedophilia and all infantilists have a high tendency to be strongly protective of children and strongly against violence of any kind (that includes child abuse)  as once famous adult baby said on a documentary on channel 4 called ""the 15 stone babies"" (which was about infantilism) ""we don't want to be with children we want to be the child"".   and while other aspects of other fetishes / kinks may evolve to play a part in the roleplay of acting like a young child, toddler or baby, nothing sexual is ever included in such roleplay.    pamperchu is unique just as every human being on the planet earth is unique just as every flower, every blade of grass, every insect, microbe, animal, every living thing in this world is unique and humans are unique from birth till death than we simply decompose in to nutrients for plants.  i believe someone mentioned pamperchu looking for used diapers ?  there is a misunderstanding here, pamperchu collects vintage diapers, he does not go around looking for a used diaper that has been worn, peed and / or pooped in by someone. thats gross ! i believe what pamperchu means when he says ""i like looking for used diapers"" is that he often looks for open packs of diapers that people have thrown out, he often goes to the ""thrift store"" (a kind of charity store from what i gather) looking for old diapers, open packs of diapers and vintage electronic and electrical equipment. as a person with aspergers syndrome i made the mistake of saying to someone once that i was looking for used diapers when infact i meant i was looking for diapers that were no longer wanted, the guy in the shop kicked me out.  as for the std reference made by someone wearing a diaper that has been used by someone else who is an adult or teenager will likely get you an std, wearing a diaper that has been used by someone else who is a child, toddler or baby is not only sick but will likely get you a prison sentence that is (unfortunately) not nearly adequate.  wanting to be a baby is just another unique part of life for some people just as unique as a spiders web or the reaction of a pythons prey as it is bitten and dies, everything has commonalities in life but nothing is the same. until humans learn this scientific and mathematical principal that      has been around since before the idea of the millenium bug, we will always have a world wear war, starvation, torture, poverty, crime and discrimination or common place. if we can not open the doors on this world we will be trapped in a vicious circle of tyranny, oppression, dictatorship, poverty, war and depression, in such a case we wont have to wait till armageddon, we will end up killing ourselves.    well anyway this should help ""chickenman702"" get back to laying his egg",1,2,

225269,"&gt;if ever there were a social-political-medical and scientific myth about anything, the current state of vaccinology and vaccine ‚Äòscience‚Äô fits the bill in more ways than healthcare consumers probably even can imagine.  &gt;the myth goes back hundreds of years to the unscientific hypothesis and work of edward anthony jenner (1749-1823), who is credited as being the ‚Äòfather of vaccines‚Äô and the ‚Äòfather of immunology‚Äô. first and foremost, jenner‚Äôs been touted as being a physician, and that ‚Äòfactoid‚Äô has been disputed over and over again.  &gt;it turns out jenner‚Äôs first smallpox vaccination experiment (his own son) ended up with brain damage and died young, most likely from a vaccine-related immune deficiency. the medical textbook definition of a vaccine adverse reaction is encephalitis (brain inflammation) which can lead to permanent neurological damage (aka brain damage, autism, developmental delay).  &gt;by 1807, he [jenner] convinced the royal college of physicians and the british parliament that his once defunct and admittedly unprotective vaccine was safe and effective, and as well could produce large revenues.  &gt;since jenner obviously was an ‚Äòastute‚Äô business person, he was able to convince others that his newfangled health hypothesis was a moneymaker.  &gt;both of jenner‚Äôs ‚Äòdreams‚Äô keep going on perpetually: convincing others that vaccines are ‚Äòsafe and effective‚Äô and vaccines are grandiose money makers.   &gt;in 2016, the vaccine market was worth ‚Äúclose to $24 billion.‚Äù by 2020, profits are estimated to be worth $61 billion! the cdc, alone, sells over $4.6 billion in vaccines every year!  &gt;however, what most u.s. healthcare consumers probably don‚Äôt know is u.s. government agencies cdc and nih, plus bill gates, own patents on vaccines, e.g., ebola! the cdc owns over 20 vaccine patents, according to robert f kennedy jr., esq. is there any wonder why vested interests push vaccines and want them to be mandatory?  &gt;more information about the centuries-old fraud, which started the vaccine fiasco, can be found [here](https://therefusers.com/jenners-son-became-mentally-retarded-and-died-after-smallpox-vaccination/).   &gt;another great resource on the authentic history of the medical scandal of all time are the books dissolving illusions: disease, vaccines, and the forgotten history and vaccination voodoo, what you don‚Äôt know about vaccines, which go into detail about most of the toxic ingredients in vaccines from published scientific peer reviewed research, papers and their adverse, negative effects in vivo and in vitro.  &gt;once healthcare consumers understand what those vaccine ingredients are capable of doing in the human body, especially to infants, toddlers and children who can‚Äôt detoxify them, then vaccine issues take on a totally relevant understanding and rightful rejection, since parents don‚Äôt want hazmat materials, in many cases, injected into their children, which can precipitate cancers, sterility, and the current neurotoxic and neurological problems now affecting two generations of children since the late 1980s.  &gt;however, healthcare consumers across the globe are waking up. the country of india has taken a remarkable step insofar as ‚Äúcentre shuts health mission gate on bill &amp; melinda gates foundation‚Äù as reported by economic times india times:  &gt;all financial ties of the country‚Äôs apex immunisation advisory body, national technical advisory group on immunization (ntagi), with the gates foundation have been cut off.  ""there were questions about the gates foundation‚Äôs ties with pharmaceutical companies and the possible influence this may have on the country‚Äôs vaccination strategy. global policy forum, an independent policy watchdog that seeks to promote accountability in international organisations, raised some of these concerns in a study in december 2015.""  &gt;the above action, unfortunately, came too late for the [47,500 children who suffered paralysis from the bill and melinda gates foundation polio vaccine vaccination campaign](https://vactruth.com/2014/10/05/bill-gates-vaccine-crimes/) it sponsored and implemented in india during 2011-2012.  &gt;recently, i reported on ‚Äúdirty vaccines‚Äù in my article ‚Äú[more scientific proof to refuse vaccines](http://www.activistpost.com/2017/02/more-scientific-proof-refuse-vaccines.html)‚Äù wherein i discussed the newly reported scientific findings in gatti and montanari‚Äôs paper ‚Äú[new quality-control investigations on vaccines: micro- and nanocontamination](http://medcraveonline.com/ijvv/ijvv-04-00072.pdf)‚Äù [pdf]  published in the international journal of vaccines and vaccinations early in 2017.  &gt;however, greenmedinfo.com has published an interview lead author and researcher dr. antoinetta gatti gave about the study she and researcher montanari undertook on 44 vaccines, which i encourage everyone to read [here](http://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/breaking-interview-lead-author-dirty-vaccines-study-speaks-out), as it is most thought-provoking and further intimidating against vaccines as being ‚Äòsafe‚Äô and ‚Äòpure, unadulterated biologicals‚Äô, which contain heavy, neurotoxic metals like lead (pb) in the hpv vaccines given to pre-teen and teenage boys and girls.  &gt;and then there‚Äôs the prestigious rand corporation‚Äôs vaccine report ‚Äúsafety of vaccines used for routine immunization in the united states‚Äù wherein it states,  ""soe [strength of evidence] was high for the following associations in nonpregnant adults: seasonal influenza vaccine and arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, fever, pain at injection site; 2009 monovalent h1n1 vaccine and guillain-barr√© syndrome (gbs); and a lack of association between influenza and pneumococcal vaccines and cardiovascular events in the elderly. risk of gbs was estimated at 1.6 excess cases per million persons vaccinated.   ""soe was high for the following associations in children and adolescents: measles, mumps, rubella (mmr) vaccine and febrile seizures in children under age 5; lack of association between mmr vaccine and autism spectrum disorders; and varicella vaccine and disseminated oka strain varicella zoster virus with associated complications (i.e., meningitis, encephalitis) in individuals with demonstrated immunodeficiencies. there is moderate soe that vaccines against rotavirus are associated with intussusception in children; risk was estimated as 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 vaccine doses, depending on brand.   ""moderate-strength evidence exists regarding human papillomavirus vaccine and a lack of association with onset of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and gbs. moderate-strength evidence shows no association between inactivated influenza vaccine and serious aes in pregnant women.  &gt;however, the rand report‚Äôs conclusions claimed,  ""there is evidence that some vaccines are associated with serious adverse events; however, these events are extremely rare and must be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. careful consideration should be given to the investigation of research gaps, including patient risk factors that may be associated with aes; however, important factors must be taken into account when determining whether studies are warranted, including the severity and frequency of the ae being studied and the challenges of conducting sufficiently powered studies when investigating rare events.""  &gt;rand‚Äôs conclusions that adverse events (aes) are rare events really do not comport with what‚Äôs been filed with the cdc‚Äôs vaers reporting system (hundreds of thousands of reports with an average of 30,000 reports per year since 1990) for vaccine adverse events, plus the fact the u.s. department of health and human services hrsa has paid out $3,584,871,205.06 ‚Äì that‚Äôs billion with a ‚Äúb‚Äù ‚Äì for petitioners‚Äô awards and attorneys‚Äô fees to february 1, 2017 regarding vaccine injuries.  ‚Äú‚Äôapproximately 30,000 vaers reports are filed annually, with 10-15% classified as serious (resulting in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illnesses or death,‚Äô the cdc says.‚Äù  &gt;if we can take for granted that the vaers reports average around 30,000 per year is an accurate figure, and those reports have been coming in for 26 years (1990 to 2016), the math says 780,000 vaers reports have been filed! how can cdc, fda, big pharma and medicine claim vaccines are safe?  &gt;the ironic part about vaccines is the u.s. congress absolved big pharma and vaccine makers‚Äîbasically giving them a ‚Äúget out of jail free‚Äù card‚Äîregarding product liability offenses, in the national childhood vaccine injury act (ncvia) of 1986 (42 u.s.c. ¬ß¬ß 300aa-1 to 300aa-34).    &gt;that law must be rescinded and vaccine producers must be made liable for their unsafe products, as they are in other countries and are being sued; vaccine makers must provide safety proofs and not wiggle-room words on their vaccine package inserts; and all vaccines should be subject to the same testing protocols prior to licensure as other pharmaceuticals and drugs are mandated to go through by cdc/fda law/regulations.  &gt;what would you wager vaccines wouldn‚Äôt pass muster?",1,-2,

845733,"in my past as a young teenager with severe anxiety problems i was prescribed .5mg lorazepam and it flat out didn't work for me.  i tried it on 2 occasions, one with one pill and one with 3 (so .5 and 1.5mg respectively) and nothin'. not any noticeable reduction in anxiety, motor function, or inhibitions. no effects at all. later i was prescribed valium and it worked wonders.  so it could just be that ativan isn't for you, as it was for me. it could also be that you're one of the people who just doesn't get much of an effect out of benzos. however, if you're truly intent on knowing what benzos feel like, go for shorter acting ones like xanax or the more sought after oxazepam or temazepam. otherwise just don't bother.  it's a dark, numb road to go down and quite a few people get lost on their way, so be careful. &lt;3",1,1,

667405,"part 1:  &gt;no, but it sure as hell doesn't make her blameless. if i intentionally dump a glass of water on your floor, you shouldn't yell at me, but i certainly am not blameless if you do.  bah. i never said she was blameless.  but the initial fault lies with the tsa guards.  even if she did dump it out, which is still in dispute, the first problem was due to the idiotic guards.  &gt;i didn't say it makes everything the guards did okay. i said that i don't really have any sympathy for her?  you sure defended the guards though.  even i stated that there's a question about her actions, but you refused to admit anything about the guards.  &gt;you tell me, what is the appropriate thing to do when someone acts like a child and dumps water on the floor, creating a hazard for other pedestrians? to just ignore it and pretend it didn't happen? to provide no punishment for the behavior? that encourages further behavior like this.  it's not the guards' place to punish people anymore than it's a cop's place to punish someone.  they arrest them and the court punishes.  what's the appropriate thing to do when someone acts like a child?  you completely skip over the fact that the whole thing was initiated by the guards in the first place.  then you talk as if the tsa guards are parents.  no, it's not their place to punish people as if they were children.  they can either detain someone, arrest them, or let them go.  they don't have the priviledge of punishing people.  and you are still assuming that there's no question that she deliberately dumped the water.  &gt;she's an obnoxious, childish bitch. you tell me if that makes her decent or not.  on what grounds do you claim her to be an obnoxious childish bitch?  because you believe she deliberately dumped the water?  sorry, but one act like that, assuming she did it, does not define a person.  &gt;you don't know that she offered to drink the water. you don't know. you're assuming that she's telling the truth, but you don't have any reason to trust that's what happened.  she said she did.  the tsa does not dispute this fact.  therefore why are you claiming she's lying?  were you there?  were you one of the guards and can dispute it?  you claim she dumped the water and lied about it, therefore everything she says is a lie.   sorry, but it doesn't work that way.  unless a counter-witness comes forward, it would stand in a court of law.  &gt;and regardless, she could have taken the water to a sink and dumped it. she created a scene by dumping the water. maybe tsa could have let her drink it, but if she'd just dumped the water in a sink instead of on the floor, she wouldn't have been detained and forced to clean up her mess. she created the delay. she caused her detainment. she instigated the entire affair by dumping the water on the floor. if she'd just acted like an adult, it wouldn't have turned into such a problem.  nope.  the guards instigated the entire affair by insisting she not drink the water in the sippy cup, but leave the line, miss her flight, go empty it, and come back and wait in line again.  you don't like to stick to facts much, do you.  if there was a handy sink, it wouldn't have been a problem.  the scene already existed because the guards couldn't allow a terrorist to drink the terrorist water from their terrorist sippy cup, but insisted on making the terrorist and her terrorist child in her terrorist baby carriage leave the line to go empty the terrorist sippy cup of the dangerous explosive water out of view and come back.  gee, i feel safe.  &gt;&gt;consistent enforcement of stupid meaningless rules isn't any help to anyone. this concept is no better than zero tolerance policy in schools where drawings of guns get kids suspended.  &gt;right. freedom of speech and freedom to carry liquids onto planes are totally in the same league. jesus, you set up your own strawman attacks against yourself.  hey, genius, i wasn't talking about freedom of speech. i was talking about idiotic rules that cause problems for everyone without providing any benefit whatsoever.   are your debate skills so weak that you must try to make it an argument about free speech in order to claim straw man?  and don't call me jesus.  &gt;and yes, consistency is better than inconsistency. if tsa officers started letting random people carry liquids, then you'd hear a lot more stories like this, except that they'd include the ""victim"" crying ""they let me carry it last time!""  actually, no.  consistency and publishing the tsa rules has been proven to actually be worse than not having those rules.  see, what happens is the actual terrorists go through the system normally, as a test.  if they don't get noticed, then they figure out an attack based on the known idiotic rules.  if i were a terrorist, i'd be laughing my ass off at the tsa.  in actual fact, the airports were far more secure against terrorist before the tsa existed.  the tsa only exists to make us feel safe.  i hope you feel safe, because i don't.  &gt;&gt;unless a new rule gets implemented while you're in line, and how you can't have your shoelaces either. unless the shoelace is under 3 inches, then it's perfectly safe.  &gt;right, because the tsa totally implements new rules that affect people who are still standing in line. you know, last time i was going through security, tsa passed a law saying body hair was dangerous, and they made me wax my chest right there in line.  &gt;seriously, you're really reaching.  i guess you weren't one of those people in line when the tsa instituted the new rule about shoes.  or maybe you just assume that they shut down all the lines at some point so that the tsa can put up signs with the new rules.  &gt;you asked how much liquid a sippy cup can hold. don't act like i'm the stupid one for answering.  no, i act like you're the stupid one for providing stupid answers.  &gt;if you think the liquid rule is so retarded, why are you pretending it's safer to have her drink it rather than dump it out? if the rule is that stupid (and i think it is), then it is no safer to have her drink it then it is to have her dump it out.  why?  is it going to make her explode?  will she have lethal gas 20 minutes after drinking it?  you said *i* was reaching. rofl.",1,-1,

the pediatrics group's existing position states that scientific evidence demonstrates potential benefits  anti-circumcision points:  - may reduce the sensitivity of the penis - the pediatrics group's existing position states that benefits are not sufficient to recommend routine circumcision - various groups oppose the practice - ""a child has a right to his own body. that's the bottom line."" - debating the relevance of the evidence from africa  *""it's not that bad""* circumcision-apologists  - ""the thing that makes this a difficult issue is that it's not just science. there is a level of emotion and passion on both sides of this issue.""  **omitted from the article**  anti-circumcision points:  - extreme pain and tissue damage - permanently and irreversibly alter neurological circuitry responsible for pain perception and memory - heightened physiological pain response later in life - post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) - permanent and life-long - in nearly all case  - during circumcision, the only response available to the person (infant) is shock, wherein the central nervous system is overwhelmed by pain, followed by numbing, paralysis, and dissociation.  - impedes maternal-infant bonding (""my baby was never the same again"") - increased aggressiveness - weakened ego - withdrawal - reduced functioning and adaptation - nightmares - long-lasting neurophysiological and neurochemical brain changes - may impact adversely on the developing brain, and reported ""gender differences"" between men and women may actually arise from behavioural changes induced by infant or childhood circumcision - adult circumcised man more likely to react with terror, rage and/or dissociation when confronted with situations interpreted as threatening. - any aspect of circumcision is more likely to provoke negative emotions in an adult such as panic, rage, violence, or dissociation. - consequences of childhood circumcision have been compared to childhood sexual abuse and rape - men circumcised in childhood without their consent have described their present feelings in the language of violation, torture, mutilation, and sexual assault. - long-lasting emotional suffering, grief, anxiety, depression, and a sense of personal vulnerability - avoidance, preoccupation with their loss, and anger in adulthood over circumcision can be difficult to reconcile - in extreme cases, circumcision may contribute to aggressive, violent, and/or suicidal behavior - circumcision has been described as ""low-grade neurological castration"".  - reduces sexual gratification - heterosexual intercourse is less satisfying for both partners when the man is circumcised - circumcision may promotes sexual dysfunction - skin tags - penile curvature or painful erections due to uneven or too much foreskin removal - pitted glans - partial glans ablation - prominent/jagged scarring - amputation neuromas - fistulas - severely damaged frenulum - meatal stenosis - excessive keratinisation of glans - atrophy of non-stimulated neurons in the brain's pleasure center - increased loss of penile sensation with age - complex innervation of the foreskin and frenulum is lost - loss of thousands of fine touch receptors and other highly erogenous nerve endings - loss of stretch receptors in the prepuce and frenulum - relationship intimacy problems - addiction/dependency problems - need for excess stimulation to enable ejaculation - prominent scarring - loss of foreskin to protect corona during intercourse, leading to premature ejaculation - adult man may have to resore to prolonged thrusting during intercourse to achieve ejaculation - unnatural dryness of an uncircumcised penis often makes coitus painfull, resulting in chafing and/or skin abrasions - significantly reduced satisfaction with sex life compared to intact men - circumcision thus may impede psychosexual and emotional intimacy between partners - changes in sexual practices including more elaborate sexual behaviors  - circumcised men are significantly less likely to use condoms than intact men - feelings of anger, sadness, feeling incomplete, cheated, hurt, concerned, frustrated, abnormal, and voilated.  - lower self esteem -

assured me there was and cast an image into my mind of serried ranks kneeling in the oriental prayer position. tall spires of ash on their shoulders and heads, balancing on the balls of both feet and their knees, straight backed, hands on thighs palms downward, fingers together, resembling the statues in a thai temple.  just where they could be i did not know and he says to follow him, and back thru the first circle past satan, the tree and the swordsman, past sisyphus straining up the incline with his stone, across the desert and back into the fire cave. down past the place of judgment and explosions of fire every forty seconds or so, thumbs up to the faun racking them up, then down between the vast flaming stacks of burning bodies to the nether part of hell. as we move further from the front so too are the bodies burnt down, past the yellow green burners at the front, to charred corpses further in, then burnt charred corpses with just flickering blue flame and human coals, and on to a place where the bodies are mere cinders. blackened and burned beyond recognition, a guard here tries to block ones way, i sidestep him and he fades away.  at this place a huge four armed being dismantles the stacks of charred cinder corpses, those he takes in his right pair of arms, reconstructing the body in his marvelously dexterous hands, join with a blue green flying creature that has appeared from somewhere. the charred metallic body of the sinner crumbles to dust, revealing only the bright white pure human soul, they rush together and embrace. their union sealed in a blinding flash of arclight, fading to reveal a composite white robed flying creature, which then departs this place at a rate of knots. those he takes in his left pair of hands likewise reconstructed, they too put on their best face, as the blue green flying creature appears, the giant four armed being gives him the option of reconstructing with the newly raised from the fire human soul. the blue green angel lets out a scream of outrage and horror, and flies out of the place like a bat out of hell, no mistaking that at all.  thus in place in the two left hands of the angel of the second judgment, philemon did tell me his name which i have forgotten, he is a pretty cool guy, not withstanding he looks a bit like a snake just jutting up out of the ground with his four arms. he has a moustache and a part in his hair, and looks a bit like sir richard hadlee the great new zealand sportsman. so the fella in his two left hands is placed alongside another of his kind, they are in a column of six, like the chain of women in the outer darkness, some unseen mechanism is causing the column to move like a snake, of its own volition taking the men backwards out of the fire chamber. thru and beyond another overhang and out into a volcanic place, where red hot volcanic cinders alight like snow upon their heads and shoulders, until they resemble the statues in a thai temple with spires of ash on heads and shoulders, then only their faces and eyes are visible as the ash buries them. on downward and on deeper into hell, the time for remorse long gone, the underground column comes to a trip place, here the bodies do a one eighty pivot, the men are now facing forward as the column of the damned wends downward, and here in this place of dust and ash do the fallen sleep.  nor yet is their journey thru hell over, deeper and deeper goes the column of six and its company of snoring losers, two weeks pass on earth and the column intersects an underground stream. here in this place of water and steam, where the pious man looks toward heaven, bitter and beaten, a witness of failure and dashed hope. for here, in vindication of the prophesy of john the baptist, that ‚Ä¶all flesh shall know the salvation of god, the damned are raised. attendants, two of them, two hundred kilo individuals, like funny parody drawings of, of all things cherubs, subcutaneous fat and tiny little wings on an overgrown wrestlers body. one reaches out his hand where the column goes over a hump and the ranks open out, takes the hand of the soul of the sinner. he has been in the eastern prayer position for as many weeks, and while this is an elegant pose it produces physical agony after only a short while. he assists him up, then massages him up and down the legs, toweling down his upper body with a rag cloth he keeps over his shoulder. the sinner is an ancient walter brennan type, you gotta believe just how old this man is, never would anybody really encounter any person on earth this old.  old or not and notwithstanding his double trip thru hell, he is jaunty and full of witticisms toward the demon attendant. he thinks he is still in hospital, and tells the demon about this really vivid dream he was having until woken. the attendant has heard it all before and mumbles something, he has massaged both legs and feet, done his upper body and arms with the towel, which he dips into a stone basin of water then wrings out and does his face and ears. walter is still chattering away and the wrestler hands him up to his brother, who is up a couple of steps on another landing, as he passes from one brother to the other, so does a shiver of white light commence from the brother's fingertips and right thru the newly resurrected sinners body, until he is fully up on the landing. once more a young man in the full vigor of youth, the guard directs him to a then unknown destination.  the next sinner freed is a wizened little bloke, could have been a gunslinger in the wild west, mouth just a slit and cold eyes, untalkative he is toweled down and rubbed, he thanks the attendant who passes him on to his brother. the next a dyak head hunter maybe, from the island nation of borneo, an incredibly old little dark skinned man, seems happy to be going. i pass with him onto the next level and he approaches a gate, beyond the gate his extended family, his grandfather, his mother, and his brothers and sisters are overjoyed to have him back. the next there is a caucasian youth, his beautiful wife and children, their features indistinct from my perspective greet him‚Ä¶ the column of annealed metallic corpses progresses a little further on, till they are ground to atoms tumbling into an ash whirlpool, resembling a bottomless pit.  xiv  that's hell. the second judgment in the outer darkness is much the same, the girls progress right thru hell till they come to a body builder who has a horn trumpet attached to a thong around both wrists, that makes two trumpets in all. when their time comes, the succubus that emerged at the first judgment has drained all the goodness out of their body, which has gone up the umbilical cord and has nurtured him. the umbilical cord snaps, and the faun critter has become a blue green angel, identical to the angels that say yea or nay at the second judgment at the fire. the body builder‚Ä¶ like this guy is built, is mostly indistinct. the guards in the darkness are a more reserved group than their counterparts in the fire, in that his light which shines from a disc of light above his head is most often very dim. he interviews the newly emerged blue green angel and, depending upon the response, raises either the trumpet horn in his left hand blowing b flat, signaling that there will be no removal. or yet he raises the right trumpet horn and blows d.  then the released human spirit, standing at the place of judgment like an intact venus de milo, risen from a terrible waste of corpse debris and the angel embrace. within the arclight their union produces the robed figure of a flying angel, who does not waste any time leaving. the losers collapse and so does the floor receive them, losing all human shape now and like a procession of bright white maggots, do they make their way toward a place where they will tumble down out of the main body of hell and be buried in freezing cold volcanic ash. down until they are liberated as the ashy medium intersects an underground body of water, then they are washed out of the ash, over a waterfall and into a pool of water. here they thaw, and dive and plunge about this strange limbo world, till they drag themselves up a cinder beach and flop down like seals. the two demon attendants here resemble asterix the gaul, in the european comic strip of that name, in that they are armored from the waist up and fully helmeted, against the amorous passions of the newly resurrected women. their eyes visible thru a horizontal slot in their helmets, handing the girls onto the next level, the white light tingles over their skin, and they arrive on that level once more in human form, as beautiful young women. stark bollicky naked however, picture koika at the winter palace.  up the path a bit and a high arched bridge, below just cloud across and a gateway, no gates on the hinges however, just inside a dress shop with diamond shaped crystal panes in the windows, here the chicks get a dress to wear. this girl chose a short sleeve blue and white full length dress with a modest neckline, that would not have been out of place among the amish communities of pennsylvania, past the shop a family group. a young man in the group, a clean limbed type, seems a tad self conscious among so many people he does not know, then erupting from the group's center a black shape, nor yet human but beast, carnivore tongue extended and feral teeth exposed, this is a puppy dog of the poodle variety‚Ä¶",0,,

192231,"&gt;the language you seek  the 14th amendment does not grant or protect the right to assault others, and privacy rights do not cover harmful treatment of others, thus why child protective services can remove children from a home due to physical or sexual abuse, malnutrition, or other mistreatment. you do not have the right to a duel to the death, even with another consenting individual, and you do not have the right to harm your children or spouse, under the guise of privacy.  &gt;the umbilical point is valid. it is live tissue that is cut off.  the umbilical cord dries and falls off naturally. it is no more an affront to the person than a haircut or trimming their nails.  circumcision however is an irreversible alteration of the genitalia that seriously affects sexual pleasure, function, and appearance.   further, the reasons behind it, ancient and modern, are to prevent masturbation. the practice itself is religiously based; medical organizations around the world are increasingly stating that there is no need for routine infant circumcision.  &gt;my view of the history of criminal law is accurate, not simplistic or wrong.  given your claim above: ""the only crimes were the big old felonies like: fraud, theft, murder, etc. and all felonies had the penalty of death."", it is indeed.   your claim is easily refuted.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_criminal_justice#colonial_courts  ""whipping was the most commonly used form of punishment, especially in the south with slaves. other frequently used punishments included branding, cutting off ears, and placing people in the pillory. these punishments were sometimes harsher, depending the crimes committed. **in the american colonies, executions were less common than in england.** ... usually capital offenses, such as murder or rape, or repeated serious offenses constituted a need for an execution.""  &gt;your ""feeling"" that it is ""assault"" isn't a reason.  http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/boyle1/  ""consequently, enforced or involuntary circumcision must now be considered as an assault causing grievous bodily harm (genital mutilation).""  ""two united nations reports recognise sexual assault on males, including circumcision, as torture and a violation of human rights.""  ""every doctor has two legal duties: first, to act with reasonable care; and secondly, to obtain consent from the patient, except in a life-threatening medical emergency. failure to obtain informed consent renders any bodily intrusion an assault. when circumcisions have resulted in litigation, the cases have been fought on the grounds of negligence or lack of informed consent.""  ""‚Äúlawyers in common law jurisdictions (england, the united states, canada and australia) have expressed the view that ... non-therapeutic circumcision is, or at the very least is prima facie, a criminal assault ... there has been no rebuttal of that view.‚Äù""  ‚Äúonce it is shown that a child has been subject to an injury to his sexual organ without medical integrity, a case may be made for enforcement of existing laws prohibiting assault and battery, conspiracy to assault and battery, child abuse, and sexual abuse.‚Äù  ""given international instruments and domestic common law principles and case law, grave doubt exists as to whether even a truly informed parent can consent to the non-therapeutic circumcision of a child. while english courts acknowledge parental views and religious beliefs, these can be overridden by the objective interests of the child.""  &gt;then the parents cannot remove digits or deal with ambiguous sexual organs either.  of course the parents cannot remove digits! do you believe parents should just be able to chop off their children's appendages? and no, they should not ""deal with"" ambiguous sexual organs, until the child can assert their own interest and preferences.  only immediate medical necessity justifies any surgery for a child, with the parent's consent. the parent's guardianship does not entitle them to mutilate the child under the guise of culture or religion.  &gt;do you have any philosopher, ethicist, or moral expert of any repute that supports your theory  *text below is quotations from linked pages*  http://www.cirp.org/library/legal/smith/  ""the right to physical integrity has two components: protection against violation of and offenses against the body by others, thus from outside, and the right to determine over one's own body, the right to self-determination. the right to physical integrity is one of the fundamental civil rights. it is a right to ""freedom.""""  ""the focus must be placed on the children who are forced to suffer without consent. male circumcision is, like female genital mutilation, a ""harmful traditional practice"" and as such in violation with the rights of the child. ... regardless whether a child is a boy or a girl, neither should be subject to a harmful traditional practice.""  http://www.cirp.org/library/ethics/  ""children are separate persons from their parents and possess a separate set of legal rights. parent's rights cannot override child's rights. children are legally incompetent persons so parents usually grant informed permission for diagnosis and treatment on behalf of children. when parents bring a child to a doctor, it is the child who is the patient and not the parents. the doctor's responsibilities are to his child-patient and to no one else.4 the doctor's responsibility to the child-patient is paramount. when parents decide about treatment for a child, that decision must be made in the child's best interests. children must be involved in the decision. non-essential procedures should be delayed until the the child is mature enough to decide. moreover, parental power to grant permission for treatment is less extensive than if the parent was granting permission for his or her own treatment. parents may only grant permission for diagnosis and treatment of disease.

585641,"maybe though, based on your thinking, **if people who killed people via guns had to adopt an unwanted child from an unintended pregnancy in lieu of incernation, it would balance out and you'd get the simple answer to your attempt to be quasi intellectual. **    while you may an argument about liberals being about choices, yes it's true.  i am an independent but because of the extreme swing of the right over a slow progression of the past 20 years... i can't otherwise ""label"" myself as an independent moderate as i could in the past.   when it comes to guns, the reason being is that abortion is justified as a woman, as a embryo cannot gestate into a baby unless it hosts off my body.  now, as to guns, well there are arguments as to well, hey, only those that are intent enough to do mass murders are going so crazy it doesn't matter what laws.. what does not come into play are accidental shootings such as children shooting children or absent minded people not handling their fire arms correctly and going off, or even cleaning guns incorrectly be it sober or under the influence...   i see what you're trying to say that if a woman, yes, it is her right to decide to terminate her pregnancy or fully gestate and either put the child up for adoption or choose to raise with a partner or alone.  as a woman, none of those choices are easy and a plethora of circumstances and every woman upon discovery of pregnancy has her own reaction and choice.  we're talking about 500 millions shades of gray.    versus your black and white of comparing a womans discovery of an unexpected/unintended pregnancy to choosing to buy a gun?  not getting how as i was born with uterus how it compares to deciding to own a gun, considering i also had a miscarriage how that all ties together...  but to figure it out, if you don't have a uterus, stop thinking.  if you want a gun, get a gun.  if you don't want a gun, don't buy a gun.  push it further, if you're a woman and discover (not decided) you're pregnant, you can decide to have the baby and keep or put it up for adoption, or abort the pregnancy, and oh by the way you may get severely sick or the child may miscarry against your choice. however, my decision as a woman to buy a gun is that basically simple.  buying a gun may not be manufactured in my fallopian tube, be severely damaged, or may die within me or put me at risk of severe preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes.  see the point i'm getting at?   pregnancy directly affects a woman's body and can result into a birth or it can result into a termination of pregnancy for a many varied reasons.  where a gun, it is inanimate - made of mostly steel. a gun is intended to kill... for food or other humans. so in the aspect ""abortions kill people"" guns don't take a persons body to be created for 10 months and cause for a life long relationship or emotional memory.   your piss ass theory is putting a most incredible human decision for women to make compared to a metal designed machine to kill.  trust me, from my many years on this earth, many seem to enjoy using their guns/rifles/firearms to kill, and some not, and some trophy hunters which seems to be of sport.. but i can say no woman, including myself, has ever advocated for the pain and emotional hardship for having a miscarriage or deciding to terminate a pregnancy, to consider it a trophy or for sport. if anything, it's an excruciating experience emotionally, physically be the loss of pregnancy by choice or not to gun violence and deaths. to compare the two... is insensitive, sexisy,  immature, uniformed, and just.. deplorable and unacceptable.   to try to tie in the ethics of gun control, regulation and freedoms into a womans reproductive right and choices? eh, that's really grasping for some sort of something and naive.   this is why i hate self post saturdays.  all these twatwads trying to come off as being over intellectual about shit they don't understand or old enough or not the same gender to think they know better or found some sort of ""aha! i'm so smart and i came up with a gotcha question about your political stances!"" t hate that shit.   again, the reason a woman can decide and liberals feel it's okay to have an abortion (for a many varied reasons) is because the gestation occurs in her uterus, and will put her into a position of parenthood. she needs to decide if she is willing to go through both aspects, and even then, sometimes the opposite happens and miscarriages occur.  so keep apples to apples.   now oranges to oranges. guns and firearms are not part of either genders anatomy.  they are machines.  designed to kill and shoot.  they are designed to kill animals for food/sport/game (and within that some controversy) or kill other people.   abortions to some may 'kill' but that 'kill' is because of a body, in a parasitical way the 'baby' or rather embryo,fetus does overtake the woman's uterus, bladder, hormones, blood flow, back pain, etc... so they gestate as a parasite based on a woman's body and her keeping her and the fetus alive - if the woman dies at any point - that parasite does to.  all this ""child inside"" shit is rhetoric because if a fetus cannot survive outside the womb... it's not a 'baby'.  because babies are what are born, breath, and also known as infants.   with guns...i'm not sure what you're asking. my so has a ton of guns, i have no guns.  no one is saying not to have a gun if you don't want a gun.  but the problem is gun violence on every level has reached an unprecedented level and we have that second amendment as an argument.   mass shootings and killings at an all time high.  we have lost about 35,000 people in 2015 alone due to gun shots (being shot, suicide, bystanders, mass shootings) and we have 1.5 months to go for this year.     i also read today that we're now averaging a death a week due to a toddler getting their hands on guns by ""responsible gun owners"".   the problem, and shame on you to try to compare abortion to gun violence... and this is why i hope the sub stops these shit posts for these shit reasons as you can't compare a woman's choice to gun violence and to do so... you apparently never had a period or pregnancy scare regardless your gender.",1,-1,
492972,"edit: sorry, i had no idea how much i rambled til i posted this! tl;dr--please don't be sad or discouraged, adoptive parents can be wonderful and people still seek a biological connection. if you're going to adopt, please be ready to be 100% supportive of the relationship your child wants to have with his/her birth family.  edit again: i'm an idiot and just stumbled across the page on /r/adoption where you posted this (didn't see it earlier.) now i'm especially sorry for the wall of text--i hadn't wanted your question to go unanswered!  ahh...this is definitely a sensitive question.  let's start at the surface level, with some of the language choices in your post. please switch immediately from ""children of my own"" to ""biological children"".  it's a much more neutral phrasing. second, in your sentence, ""i will be the one that stays up with you..."", it kind of comes off as directed at adoptees who seek their biological families...but you're not adopting any of us! anyway, just a word of caution to be aware of phrasing.  okay, to the actual meat of your question. i'm going to assume you're talking only about infant adoptions, since it seems pretty obvious why an older child who is adopted may want to reconnect with a biological family they remember. honestly, i'm kind of shocked that, even if you hadn't started the process of researching and talking to people about adoption, it's difficult to put yourself in the shoes of adoptees. for everyone who's not adopted, for better or worse, it's a given that you'll have mom's eyes or dad's snoring or grandma's love of reading. something will connect you to someone in your family. so even if you have a supportive and great adoptive family, this kind of belonging just isn't there. i can't tell you how many family events i've been at where this aunt comments that this cousin looks just like this his dad in baby photos, or that this uncle behaves just like this grandparent... no one does it to exclude, and it's not like i was wounded to the core every time it came up, but in a society where biological families are the norm, it just kind of wears on you after a while. when almost everyone else (or, for those who didn't grow up knowing anyone else who was adopted, literally everyone else) around you has a biological connection to their parents, siblings, grandparents, etc., and you don't...well, that can feel unfair, or like you're missing a component of yourself.   plenty of adoptees don't feel the need for a biological connection, and, at this point, i'm not actively seeking my biological family. but, to be honest, it makes me angry that someone who is not adopted would think it was sad or disappointing if i were looking for bio family. first of all, it's frustrating because someone who never has experienced and never will experience being adopted is making a judgement about how i, as an adoptee, should feel. second, i would be even more angry if my adoptive parents had this reaction--they chose to adopt, they should have been willing and able from the get-go to deal with this, admittedly complicated, situation by supporting their child.   and here's where i'm to address the more systematic issues that come up with this question. adoption is not necessarily a happy ending for anyone, for a myriad of reasons. particular to your question, many people feel that adoption wouldn't be as necessary if birth families had the kind of support they needed to feel able to parent their child or children well. my parents are wonderful people and great parents, but i'm uncomfortable with the knowledge that they were well-off and able to afford the costs of adopting twice. if my birth parents had had the kind of money that my adoptive parents had, it's incredibly unlikely that i would have been put up for adoption. so, when you combine the lack of biological connection that basically everyone else has with a sense that the world generally and the adoption industry specifically isn't necessarily geared towards what's best for children, but rather the wants of well-off adoptive families...i don't know, it's hard to explain and i'm still working through it. for me, it means that my only reason for wanting to contact my birth family at the moment is to let them know that i turned out okay--that all the things my birth mom probably wanted for me when she gave me up are things that i have.   i'm also really sensitive to the kind of reasoning from adoptive parents like ""i'm the one who stayed up with you when you cried as a baby"", because, well, you asked for it. you asked for me, i didn't ask for you. and that's true no matter how happy the adoptee is to have ended up with the parents s/he did. playing the ""but i'm the one who took care of you"" card is really just trying to make the adoptive feel grateful for being adopted and feel guilty for wanting a connection with their birth family, or like they owe their parents something for having adopted them. adoptive kids don't owe their parents any more than non-adoptive kids owe their parents (and i'd argue they basically owe nothing, since parents choose to have and raise kids and they are responsible for nurturing their children, but that's probably getting too off-topic...) i love my parents and they're great people, but if they ever tried to pull that on my if i told them i was seeking or planning to seek my birth family, i would be incredibly hurt and angry.  in closing, i can see how adoptees seeking their biological families can be a difficult experience for adoptive parents. my brother had an open adoption from the beginning, but it was strictly letters and pictures until my parents felt that he (and, likely, they) were ready to meet in person when he was around 9. it has been a great relationship for all of us since then, but i'm sure there have been times when there were some difficult emotions for my mom and dad. they are totally entitled to those feelings--after all, my mom is just as much my brother's mom as any non-adoptive mom is their kid's mom--but they have been nothing but supportive, and i'm sure that any fleeting moments of sadness have been overwhelmed by the positive experiences we've had as a family. i can imagine that, on some level, they may not want to share us (their kids) with our original families, and that's probably pretty natural. but they also have been very clear that any desire we have to connect with our birth families is one they support whole-heartedly, and that they know it doesn't mean we love them any less.   i'm sorry if i came on a little strong at any point. it's really important to me that adoptive parents really understand what they are getting into, and that more information about adoption comes from adoptees than it does from adoptive parents. keep learning all you can!",1,1,1

456179,"oh, i could write paragraphs. and probably will. mother was a 16 year old girl who never really knew her father and had about 3 stepfathers over her childhood. she was insolent and hated living with the last stepfather, so she slept around a lot, had a lot of miscellaneous relationships, attempting to get pregnant so she could pin it on someone who would step up and marry her so she would no longer have to remain living with her family. this is the story of how i was conceived as told to me by my mother. the man who stepped up is the man i came to know as my father, 23 to her 16, but genuinely funny, hardworking guy, married her ass and got started on a family with her and me on the way. whether he's biologically my father, i honestly have no clue. i'm probably a milkman baby as i have intense spiral curly hair with no one in either family side to attach it to, though father was abused incredibly as a kid, fed his own vomit, broken arms, etc. and was adopted by a couple who raised him thereafter, who i call my paternal grandparents. so no real way of knowing if my genetics line up without maternal father or any paternal family. he apparently was and still is unaware that she plotted my conception, and still thinks i was an accident. so i'm a planned accident somehow?  fast forward 5 years and they divorce. mother and father both experimenting with drugs, my mother falls into it much heavier than my father as far as i could tell back then. she becomes extremely possessive of her children, me and my younger sister, as leverage. father hardly ever sees us, grandparents even less, we're completely isolated and stuck with a drug-addicted and increasingly mentally unstable mother. i had to step up a shit ton as a kid, blah blah blah. at 6 years old i'm finding my paternal grandparents' phone numbers somehow, calling them, and telling them my mother is dead because she is out cold on a couch from drug usage and won't wake up. they come get us, we stay with them until mother throws a big enough fit and is seemingly okay again, usually a week or two, and repeat the cycle of scary childhood. mother continues to deprive us of constant, spews crazy hate and stories about our family to us to get us on ""her side"", etc. family would send us gifts for birthdays and holidays but we never saw a thing, probably sold for drugs, but she moved us around about 9 times without telling anyone, so who knows.   father mostly moved on with his life and didn't care about us much, just attempted starting new families, so we were never fought for. paternal grandparents are begging for contact the entire time, though, not sure how much my mother got out of them for payment and such just dangling possible visitation over their heads. finally paternal grandparents coerce their son, my father, somehow, to start fighting for custody. i'm 10 at this point. i don't know my family. i only know my mother and all she's told me about everyone and feel sucked into her bullshit because i love my mother and she needs me and i feel like i've never known anything else. my mother  is flirting between many men, skirting by without a job, playing up some probably imaginary disease that makes her bed-ridden and i'm taking full time care of her and my younger sister. mom gets notice of custody battle, and freaks the fuck out. proceeds to take me and my sister and move without telling a single soul where we're going, gets a man she's dating to come with her, presumably has him take everything out in his name, because we weren't located for an entire year. one day police show up and i'm on my way to my father who i've been literally groomed to hate, and his new family of wife and 5 kids. dad gets custody except full summers are awarded to my mother still somehow. did about 6 months with father before he got tired of it, so off to paternal grandparents we went.  they never became legal guardians, not sure if out of laziness or just never realized how permanent it would be. my sister, who is basically a small version growing up to be my mother, threw a fit for a straight 7 months begging to be with her mother again until finally no one could take it anymore and they made a deal with my mother than she could have full custody of my sister if i never had to visit my mother ever again (something i actually wanted). my mother had always adored and loved my little sister and had treated her like a goddamn princess and had since sobered up as far as i had heard, so they just let sister go a state away to her. not sure how this worked legally, if at all, but i spent the rest of my school years in a tiny town raised by my grandparents with zero contact with mother, father, or sister ever again. father even moved in next door on grandparents' land at some point but never wanted anything to do with me, so we just called it.   fast forward to a year in my own place, blah blah blah, not letting my backstory get the best of me. mother calls grandmother (grandfather has since passed) out of the blue and asks if grandma would like my sister to come stay the summer, that she needs a break. grandma is a very overly kind soul with strong old values of family comes first, anyone in need can count on me. she's delighted of course. she takes my unruly teenage sister knowing my mother thought her problematic, but ""country living"" would do her good. my sister shows up with all her belongings. my mother never takes her back and starts having new kids with her new husband. just unloaded her kid on my grandmother. my grandmother doesn't even bat an eye, she'd just never pursue legal action or think it unjust. she just thinks it's her calling and god expects this of her. so my retired, living off 1k a month grandma takes in this 16 year old she's had no contact with and starts raising her. my sister within just a month or two starts scamming my grandma for every bit she's worth. manipulates her until her 401k and life insurance from my grandfather is just fucking dry. this was supposed to be my college money, and possible inheritance. all gone. i didn't get to go to college.  a short look at my sister within just the first year:  begs and pleads for a brand new car. for months. she does not quit. grandma caves and gets her a brand new pt cruiser, they pick out together. in two weeks, my sister ""trades"" it for a beat up fucking old ass truck because she wants a truck more, and it stops working within two weeks. no more car. she asked for a new car again. she starts screaming about how she wants a baby and wants to be a mother at 16. my grandma thankfully does the right thing and gets her birth control, she refuses to take it and intentionally gets pregnant so she can move in with a guy and get married and not have to live with my grandmother anymore. re: my conception. she is mom 2.0. has a baby, marries an abusive guy i went to highschool with, gets into drugs, consistently begs for and receives money from my grandmother, and now it's ""for the baby"", ""we need to pay the $600 phone bill she runs up because she needs a phone"", etc. all this time i'm now being called jealous and unwelcoming and not taking family seriously because this shit is ludicrous and i'm trying to save my grandmother from herself. she doesn't stop until she doesn't have a dime left. finally turns to me for help with budget and fixing her to be able to scrape by on $1k a month again. my sister in just 3 has three kids by three different men, has been in jail twice and released because pregnant and small counties like these don't want to pay for the pregnancy, is a horrible drug addict, and has had at least one job making money with prostitution.   the only good family i ever really knew was my grandma, and i was near shunned for 3 years in favor of my sister and she was given every cent of money that could have helped me further my education and stability because my grandma has a ""you can take care of yourself, everything goes to family in need"" mentality.  i tried going to community college anyways with scholarship money, but can't access it without fafsa. can't get fafsa without parental information. grandma is not my legal guardian and her information is inadmissible. my father refused. i finally broke after 8 years of no contact and called my mother to beg for the information so i could go to school. she accused me of stealing her identity, and hung up. can't go to school without parental info until 25. i never understood how my fucked up childhood would hurt my future.  weird messed up things mom has done include:  threatening suicide anytime she thought i didn't love her enough and showing me the instrument of choice. going batshit about a thread on the floor and terrorizing the household for a full 6 hours, then apologizing profusely the next day and begging forgiveness. taking all my possessions and burning them as punishment. the list really almost never ends.  dad is so messed up on drugs now with him and his wife that his whole face and mouth have rotten out and he's un-recognizable. he currently steals from my grandmothers barn and such nightly to feed their addiction and can't hold a job anymore. has been imprisoned at one point for beating his wife. they're still together.   i could go on and on about extended family but it's really only hearsay as i never them. /rant, dear god",1,-2,-1

598554,"when i was in middle school, the big thing to do on the weekends if you were a ""cool kid"" was to attend the catholic youth organization (cyo) dances at one of my town's four parishes. that parish was saint jude's.  i went to public school like many other attendees from both in and out of town did, but anyone who paid the five dollar entry fee was allowed into the dance. the parish made a killing off of those dances and off of all of the hormonally-charged pre-teen shenanigans that went down within those holy, hallowed walls of saint jude's deteriorating gym. the gym was so bad that even after they ripped out the soggy and cracked wooden floors, the tiled court that they put in was so shitty that you could pull up some of the tiles with your finger. whenever i played basketball in that god-forsaken gym i had to pray to god that i wouldn't slip on a tile shifting below my feet or step on a piece of gum or a speck of some junior high-schooler's bodily fluid from the dance the night before.  the place was skeevy as all hell but it was all we had in those days so no one cried too much about it. whether there was rain, sleet, snow, or toxic sludge pounding down on us from the heavens, we would - without question - show up for those dances every friday night during the school year. every single bit of youthful degeneracy and infantile indiscretion could be found at saint jude's on friday nights. friday nights at saint jude's - affectionately dubbed ""the whorehouse on the hill"" by the kids - could make a coke-fueled night at studio 54 back in the 70s look like tuesday night bingo at the retirement community just down the road from the parish. there was simply nothing that the chaperones - all moms from the parish - could do to stop the spaghetti strapped girls from performing some sort of bizarre, hip-hop-infused mating ritual with the boys who all were convinced that if they just wore more quicksilver and billabong t-shirts from pacsun to go with their rope and pukka shell necklaces, they would eventually fend off all of the competition from the other dance-goers and land themselves the coveted job of ""apparel model"" at our local mall's pacsun store. i may or may not be joking about that.  if you managed to grind it out with casey or kelly to the booming sounds of usher or lil jon on any given friday night, you would be the man for the rest of the upcoming week. if you managed to then get with casey, kelly, or both fine young ladies at the dance in one of the bathrooms or away from the prying eyes of one of the more puritanical parish parents chaperoning then you would henceforth shed your title as ""the man"" and ascend to the throne of flyness as ""the lord of the dance,"" conqueror of all caseys, kellys, and courtneys. years after those wild middle school nights at saint jude's were gone, some knob jockey decided to complain to the school about the dances and how there was so much awful and degenerate behavior going on. somehow they got our local paper and then our city's magazine to write about the infamous dances and once the word got out around our county and some calls were made to the holy head honchos who ran the school and the parish, the dances were shuttered forever.  word got around to us dance alumni who had long moved onto college and beyond about the dances being shut down and we all reminisced with each other about just how crazy, fun, and critical they had been to us and for our development as teenagers and kids growing up. not long after the dances were shuttered, dwindling enrollment and financial troubles within the archdiocese and the church meant that saint jude's had to close their catholic school and all hope that those dances might be revived for a new generation of kids from our town and all over the county was gone for good. the last middle school dance that i attended was my eighth grade recognition dance at the end of the year. it was a dance that you had to sort of get dressed up for and the boys wore collared shirts with khaki shorts and the girls wore dresses. this dance was a lot different from the dances at saint jude's because this was more of a formal dance and there wasn't much of any grinding or ""dirty dancing"" going on that i can remember; it was mostly guys and girls dancing in the slow dance way that you do at prom in high school. this meant, of course, that at least two-thirds of the kids stood around awkwardly and didn't interact with the opposite sex while the remaining third-or-so had either the looks or the bravery to approach one another and have a better time than everyone who watched from the sidelines. everyone spent most of the time just huddling around in their own little cliques and circles and trying to entertain themselves or trying to find a way to get the attention of some guy or girl that they wanted to dance with before the night was through. it was all very juvenile and funny looking back on it now and it feels bittersweet in a way since none of us can ever get back to that place again in our school's cafeteria-come-dance hall and since - for me personally - that year may have been the best and most memorable year of my childhood.  at the end of the dance i had to use the bathroom and when i was done i got this feeling and just had this urge to walk through the school one last time before leaving it behind. i walked around past classrooms i had sat in and through the gym and locker room and art and music rooms as well but i couldn't get to the wing of the school where i had my favorite class with my favorite teacher; these metal gates were put up to keep kids out of certain parts of the school each day after everyone went home and the gates were set up on this day to keep people from walking through there during the dance. when i went back to the cafeteria the dance was over and nearly every person had left and had filtered out of the place. there was a song playing and it was the first time that i had heard it and it instantly got to me and made me stand in the empty cafeteria and listen to it the whole way through while some chaperones and parents were cleaning up. the song was [wish you were here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjpf8uksrvk).",1,-1,

823092,"part 2:  i'm 21, but i feel simultaneously young, like i never had normal teenage years and am just starting now, and old, like i've had a moment of clarity about my life, some older person's wisdom that 1. i know nothing, (whereas in my teenage years i thought i knew everything, which gave me in my mind carte blanche to act like a jerk,) and that's normal, 2. i need to turn my life around, and stop hating everything and everyone and being angry, and 3. that i'm really young still, like if i was an old man who could go back and do things over and start at 20, that's how old i feel in my youth. i think a whole lot of my generation are going to start having this realization soon, and shed the angry nerd and angry jerk thing and work on developing nice, appealing, actually social and human personalities and improve looks. that's what i'm trying to do, is to fix my personality and looks in order to become, rather than a ""nice guy,"" or a ""bad ass,"" a ""good man."" i want to be a good man, a true man, an excellent man, in at least some field, with a passion and drive to improve in my passions and hobbies. like john c reilly in magnolia, and as you may or may not have guessed, my passion is film. but i do think a surge of that realization and urge to change will sweep my generation like a fire through a wheat field as we realize we don't want to wallow in anger anymore.  perhaps some national or global crisis will facilitate or necessitate that. perhaps some real, imminent crisis, a war, a bad depression, etc, will make my generation step up as we're about to wake up. like if your house was being burgled, and you had already started to wake up before everyone else, and then the burglar set off the alarm. i think my realization that i need to start actually having a nice personality and being a fucking human being was a product of natural and gradual change and maturity and really just ""growing up,"" and as i feel the malaise in my generation is widespread, perhaps the ""waking up"" will happen in a wave, and start before and after some crisis necessitates the waking up, the burglar alarm that makes us start working toward some important goal and re-asses what's really important and what we feel about our lives. as louis ck says, ""everything is amazing and nobody is happy,"" and later on the opie &amp; anthony show: ""there's still a lot of fat we need to shed from our country before we have to move grandma into the attic and sell apples on the street corner in order to not starve to death. we still have hot dog eating contests and the superbowl."" in putting these two maxims together, my theory is that our culture is superficial and frivolous and focused on the wrong things, which can spawn widespread malaise, unhappiness, and anger. ""we know things are bad, worse than bad."" the angry rationalist's reaction is therefore to bow out. if the society experiences some crisis wherein its priorities shifts and it self-corrects, the individual is more likely to align or care about the society and greater community, and work on himself in order to work on society. narcissism will be replaced with community and charity, frivolity by responsibility, selfishness by teamwork, etc, etc... and the thing is, the ""normal"" members of my generation are sort of already adept at efficiency, teamwork, all that good stuff. (my beef with them has always been that they're phonies, i go to a very capitalist right wing business school, full of these fledgling gordon gekkos, all very achievement and task oriented, but strident and grating in their networking and personalities. in the wake of some national crisis, i suspect mere quibbles over personality will disappear, although political differences remain. hopefully political discourse will become more civil.)  i hear a lot of angry older people (actually a minority of the generations, of course, but i think centered around generation x, which statistically had a difficult life, as there were so many of them born, and in a time where their parent's (who statistically, being born in the depression, had very easy lives, as there were so few of them born, don draper notwithstanding) divorce rates were high, saying that my generation is the worst one ever. and i actually believe that's true. but where our conclusions differ is that when i was a teenager i thought everyone else in my generation was the worst ever. now i realize i was part of the problem by not engaging, by removing myself, by treating other humans like garbage, by being an angry narcissistic baby, which is the worst cruelty one can inflict on fellow man. as the ancient greeks said, these actions, ""although causing no harm, cause pain."" so i do think my generation is generally the worst ever right now, for a variety of reasons, ranging from the anti-social meanness of the outcasts i once was, to the superficial phoniness of the achievement oriented, capitalist ""upper castes"" of my generation, the ""normals,"" as it were, but what generation isn't terrible in its adolescence?. but again where our conclusions differ is that i think my generation is going to experience a 180 degree shift in priorities, gradually or suddenly, and have to step up, and will hopefully become one of the greatest generations by the time we all come of age and mature.  whereas generation x statistically had difficult childhoods and adolescents, i think they're going to be powerful and effective leaders in middle age and elder age, perhaps during turbulent and awful time (think jon stewart). they're equipped to deal with it, and will stay consistent in that in order to be successful. i think my generation, meanwhile, has had easy childhoods and adolescence, and will have a difficult adult period, which will make us change and adapt but come out ""good."" in the end.   the stereotype of generation x was that they were depressed, cynical youth, but i think men like jon stewart and louis ck are actually the rule in that generation now rather than the exception, and will actually be great ""moralists"" when they run society. the boomers were never all that moral. they talked the talk but didn't walk the walk. jon stewart and louis ck, despite (or perhaps because they're comics) are sane voices in an insane world, and i'm amazed this insane world accepts them. they're only going to grow more important to us as they get older, i believe. as pamela adlon said of louis ck, ""you're not a comedian. you're a teacher."" listening to louis ck's rant (not an angry or loud rant, really, more of an ambling speech with some comedy) about modern society on opie &amp; anthony (part 1 of 3 of the greatest and most truthful thing i've heard in years: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=indwcenfhtq&amp;feature=related ) makes me so hopeful. because despite the fact he's talking about how bad things are, he's shining a light on it. what a great man. and i think he's going to inspire my generation.  the ""angry nerd"" thing has got to go. nobody is genuinely nice anymore. but i think that's going to change. i hope.  tl;dr mean nerdy assholes fuck themselves over  and of course this theory is very american-centric, although i am a canadian in canada. forgive me.",1,1,1

[ie: might've only had birth certs and my mom had a full passport - hers had pages stapled to it because she was so well traveled!] i got my 2nd passport in 2001 in order to travel to japan alone. i am an exception though i do know many poor punk rock kids who have gone to europe many times over due to band tours. in fact, most of my friends have active passports and take off on summer tours through europe. many americans are not this fortunate, though. i think americans see world travel as an excess of the very wealthy and limit their travel to the same 1,2,3 us spots for holiday. americans are not a culturally diverse or exploitative people as a whole. also many americans are afraid to leave the usa. when i was planning to go to japan following 9/11 my sister was like ""what if a terrorist attacks you?"" i was like, ""in japan?"" really. i have a friend in israel now and she was there during the palestine / israel suicide bombings. no american [99% of them] would never have gone to israel as she did but her boyfriend, culture and religion are in israel. so she went.  also, we have student loan debt, uni debt, rising costs of healthcare, worthless money [exchange rates suck for us, rule for you!], people who pop out babies at 22, untreated mentally ill people who are depressed, corporations who don't allow holiday time and on and on.  &gt;question 2. i've heard that americans take themselves very seriously. even heard the us referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. is this true? if not, why do people say this?  i don't know however i think this can be said about a lot of other cultures. maybe even worse if you're a brit. or an asian [japanese] though i feel like a lot of cities in the us are different. i think urban areas are probably more youth centric v. smaller towns where young people are pushed to grow up/marry/get serious at a young age.  &gt;question 4. you readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the usa, americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. why?  i don't think this is different elsewhere. i've made light of the money in canada and not been well received. canadians have no sense of humor about their fucking loonies and toonies, dude. i'm pretty sure i'd be beat with a bat if i poked holes in their government system or their economic issues! i tried that a while ago and was told to fuck off.  &gt;question 5. why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the usa is the best country in the world?  i think it's irony for some people. i think for others they've never left the us and believe what they see/hear/read. many americans don't go past us newsbroadcasts for their news. that said, our collapse is effecting other nations in europe. we are a lynch pin in world affairs but being such a large, diverse and rather young nation we move forward at a snail's pace compared to european nations that have established their shit [shit we used to establish ourselves even] long ahead of us. basically we're like infants and very me centered as a country. i think europe and other developing nations are like the moms, dads and other extended family. we all gotta hang together but sometimes we act like total brats and shit our pants in public a lot :(  &gt;question 6. does the 'american dream' still exist?  yes but it's way less accessible than it was 200, 100 or even 50 years ago. i feel like one of the last bastions for it was the birth of the internet and hs drop outs making bank as it professionals. in this modern world there aren't too many places a hs freshman drop out can make enough to have a ballin' dc apartment and a brand new bmw than the early dot-com era of the 90s.",1,1,

""all the legislation on sexuality"", affirms foucault, ""introduced since the 19th century in france, is a set of laws on decency"", which appears impossible to define, becoming thus a flexible tool politically used in several local tactics. foucault stressed that:  &gt;""what is emerging is a new penal system, a new legislative system whose function is not so much to punish offenses against these general laws concerning decency, as to protect populations and parts of populations regarded as particularly vulnerable"" (for example children). ""therefore, there would be on one side the fragile population, and on the other side the ""dangerous population"" "" (the adult in general).   ---  okay. let's start with pedophilia.  1. it is a term denoting interest in children, which teenagers are not. you can look for yourself into the wikis on development both psych and bio.  2. pedophilia is sexual attraction/desire. plenty of people can molest children and not be pedophiles.  3. is it possible, therefore, that someone can be an 'accidental pedophile' in your view, if they're attracted to or want to fuck a 14 year old who has stolen an id and pretended to be older?

or are they masking their 'pedophilia' by claiming they thought she was older?  now let's have a look at this.  https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/female_stature_vs_age.svg/260px-female_stature_vs_age.svg.png  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/male_stature_vs_age.svg/2000px-male_stature_vs_age.svg.png  http://genf20.com.au/images/decline-chart.png  so anyone is asking us to believe that human beings who've rapidly declined in growth hormones, who have practically maxed out their physical height, are still children in the same way 8 year olds are? hmm.   ---   do you think pedophilia has anything to do with the age of consent law? i know many people, in fact, most coming up from childhood, will believe that such a thing is true. that the aoc defines what is pedophilia or not. why is this belief so omnipresent today?  let me tell you, aoc has nothing to do with pedophilia. if it did, then a person could fuck a 17 year old in cali and be a pedophile, but fuck a 16 year old in nevada and not be one. that makes the definition of pedophilia incomprehensible because it means that there is a subjective evaluation.  furthermore, as we've seen pedophilia denotes attraction to children, and teens are not children.  the concept of teenager and adolescent were both 20th century inventions.  the concept of age of consent was pushed by suffragette who said ""votes for women, chastity for men"". they wanted aoc up to 21 years old, because, as they themselves said, ""21 year old women are still child-like in mind"".  they're using the same argument that people use for age of consent to be 16-18: ""they're still child-like in mind"", but they wanted it at 21 years old. this is rhetoric, and not a reasonable argument.  aoc was designed by feminists to punish males for extramarital sex, although they won't admit to that.  they used the marxist school of thought, of oppression and power dynamic to argue it. after all, men to those feminists of bygone days were evil sin and vice ridden creatures who ""draw women down into vice and taint them"".  today, many people will cite power dynamic as an argument pro-age of consent. as in ""they're too different so its abusive"". but they'll neglect or even applaud two teens fucking because ""they're the same/its natural"", e.g. appeal to nature fallacies or appeal to tradition fallacies.  people don't think two teens having sex should be sent to prison.  https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-teen-rape-double-standard  &gt;after a 17-year-old boy had sex with his 14-year-old girlfriend, he was charged with a felony for statutory rape. when a 17-year-old girl in the same town commited the same crime, she was charged with far less. was the boy the victim of gender bias?  &gt;the disparity in the punishment of these 17-year-olds, both accused of having sex with the 14-year-olds they were dating, goes much deeper. haasch charged alan with a class c felony, which, according to court records obtained by the daily beast, carries a maximum prison sentence of 40 years. norma, on the other hand, was charged only with a misdemeanor, which carries a maximum sentence of nine months in jail.  most people would be horrified this happens at all. after all, destroying a teens life for sex with their s.o. (or, very commonly, just a fuck buddy), seems unconscionable. yet if such sexual activity is destructive to a 'childs' mind, then the teen aught to be punished severely for causing that trauma through sex, just as much as an adult.  but! do you see the sentencing disparity? well, lets go back to the feminists once more. when they wanted to raise age of consent to 21 back in the 1800-1900 era, the language was very clearly about punishing all males. the courts would attempt to prosecute an underage male.  furthermore, an 'underage male' would not have aoc 'protection'. that is to say, a 14 year old male would be 'legal tinder (get it??)' for both adult females and males.  feminists who wanted aoc up to 21, and only succeeded in getting it to 16-18, were not bothered by 14 year old males having sex.",1,-2,

478117,"&gt; really? you'd really like to see adultery criminalized?   no, but it should be a serious breach of marriage, when someone commits adultery, and not treated as a non-issue in case of divorce as is happening a lot with no-fault divorce.  &gt; reading further, it looks as though the no-fault changes make alimony awards less likely.   in reality, alimony occurs very frequently and sometimes even for life. until some people started to complain about that. [alimony in massachusetts gets overhaul, with limits](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/us/massachusetts-curbs-lifetime-alimony-payments.html?_r=1)  &gt; the previous system allowed judges to award lifelong alimony after both short and long marriages, in contrast to the practices of most states. it often required payments to continue even after the spouse paying the alimony retired or the spouse receiving it moved in with a new partner.  &gt; . so it seems like the purpose of alimony is to ensure that the child is supported    no, child-support is specifically for the children. don't confuse the two.  &gt; if the woman's independently wealthy from running a brothel, i'm not sure i see her getting indefinite alimony.  with your example: this requires first to give sex workers liberty and equal rights as employees of other jobs already have.  alimony can go both ways, the point is that alimony should not be ridiculous amounts of money, when the main-breadwinner worked most of the time at some job to already cover costs and provide financial safety.  &gt; men can get alimony too. that doesn't make this right, but this isn't strictly in favor of women.  yes they can but it's less likely. the point is the person who breaches the marriage contract, still often gets lavish rewards regardless if he or she slept around. e.g. a gold-digger who cashes out after a couple of years and takes half or more of the assets, kids, house.  &gt; and why is that? found this on yahoo answers:  okay when you get divorced and cannot see your kids, despite you being a good parent you will talk differently. and why not? because children deserve to see their parents reasonable amount of times.   now there's millions of fatherless homes, and good fathers who have become walking atm machines who have financial obligations post-divorce, but little to no access to their children.  &gt; ea. most divorced parents i know worked out the parenting arrangements before they even went to court, and they worked out what was best for their children and them.  this is false, most cases involve lengthy, costly family court battles to gain visitation, time with the children post-divorce, with lots of harm to the family and children involved, not to mention the lawyer fees that can bankrupt a regular person depending on how long it takes with no guaranteed decent outcome.  &gt; it's also interesting how most of the focus here is on divorce, and not on the marriage itself. married people may be a minority, but there are still plenty of married couples who make it work.  marriage 2.0 is not what it used to be, divorce is much more likely to occur and the financial, legal implications are much higher. the majority of people are avoiding marriage for good reason.  example:  **[ok legislator blasts family law system; f &amp; f‚Äôs gregory tells committee ‚Äòwe need shared parenting‚Äô](http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/?p=20903)** november 8th, 2011 by glenn sacks, ma, executive director  an adult child of divorce, rep. jason nelson criticized the courts for marginalizing his father. fathers and families member chris gregory, a marine combat veteran of desert storm and somalia, recently told an oklahoma house of representatives committee that the family law system is rife with injustices and often separates children from the fathers they love and need.  led by representative mark mccullough and representative jason nelson, the oklahoma house of representatives conducted an interim study on family law and no fault divorce earlier this month. according to the legislators‚Äô press release here, ‚Äúoklahoma‚Äôs family law is dangerously failing the children it is supposed to protect, leading some lawmakers to consider reform of both divorce statutes and the foster-care system.‚Äù   **oklahoma legislator blasts family law system**  representative nelson (r-oklahoma city), a child of divorce, said:  [o]ur current divorce system is a racket that enriches attorneys and makes children and communities poorer. divorce scars children and leaves them emotionally disfigured. the current divorce laws are perverse and they are destroying children and our society.  representative nelson spoke movingly about his childhood and watching the pain on his father‚Äôs face at not being allowed to spend much time with his son, as well as the financial privations the system put upon him. nelson concluded with a call for a presumption of shared parenting after divorce.  **the chris gregory case‚Äìan outrageous but common injustice**   former marine chris gregory, recipient of the combat action ribbon, told the committee, 'we need shared parenting.'  f &amp; f‚Äôs chris gregory, the father of three girls who adore their dad, had a standard child custody order forced upon him‚Äîan order which granted his ex-wife ‚Äúexclusive care, custody, and control of the parties‚Äô minor children,‚Äù and allows gregory‚Äôs girls only a few days a month with their father.  for the past three years, gregory has fought in court to get more time with his girls, ages 11, 9, and 6. he has racked up large legal bills, as he was forced to pay for his ex-wife‚Äôs attorney‚Äîan attorney whose focus has been to minimize gregory‚Äôs role in his children‚Äôs lives. he explains:  the court has denied all of my motions to modify custody or seek an equitable outcome.   **financial plunder**  gregory, who was asked by representative mccullough to share his experiences with the divorce system, is a good example of the way fathers are plundered financially.  the financial orders in gregory‚Äôs case are more or less garden variety in a divorce, yet while gregory earns $7,500 a month after taxes, by court orders he is to be left with merely $2,200 a month to live on. that‚Äôs correct‚Äìfamily court leaves gregory less with less than 30% of his post-tax income. the breakdown is as follows:  gregory‚Äôs monthly earnings after taxes: $7,518  gregory‚Äôs child support: $2,568  gregory‚Äôs alimony: $1,000  gregory‚Äôs garnishment to pay his ex-wife‚Äôs attorneys‚Äô fees: $1,726  total left to gregory post-family court and taxes: $2,224*   according to the family court, gregory, a successful senior consultant at a major software company who earns a $125k a year salary, should be left with a mere $26,688 a year to support himself and his three girls.   after divorce-related garnishments and further obligations, chris gregory is left with less than 30% of his post-tax income. for details, click on the image above. the child support and the attorneys‚Äô fees are garnisheed directly from gregory‚Äôs check. the $1,000 a month alimony is not, gregory has not been paying it lately, and faces a contempt charge for it. as in many divorce cases, the attorneys‚Äô fees gregory owes grew out of his fight to be allowed to play a meaningful role in his children‚Äôs lives.  gregory also got stuck with paying 90% of the $69,000 in marital debt. gregory asked:  if this is a no fault divorce, why have i had to i assume all the fault?  as is the case with many divorced and separated fathers, gregory‚Äôs daughters‚Äô schools have been generally uncooperative, refusing to send him his daughters‚Äô report cards and notices of parent-teacher conferences and other upcoming events, despite his repeated requests that they do so.  *in the original post we inadvertently omitted a few hundred dollars a month of expenses not related to family court. the figure has now been corrected.",1,1,

541886,"&gt; babies are stupid and just cry - sometimes for no reason whatsoever.   no, actually, it's pretty easy to work with infants.  they cry when they are hungry or uncomfortable (typically because they either need to burp or poop).  therefore, you either feed them, hold them upright, or let them poop.  then they usually fall back to sleep.  if you breast feed and don't have them around sick children, they probably will not get sick either, and being sick is when they cry.  our newest daughter is 2 months old now, and she has cried *maybe* a total of 10 minutes in the past two months, and it has *always* been because she has been hungry and mom has been slow to get to feed her.  after she eats she passes out.  however, she does wake up every 2-3 hours to feed, so the lack of sleep sucks for the first 2-3 months.  last night was the first time she slept from 10pm to 8am, so things are getting normal now.  &gt; teenagers are better than babies.   not!  ;)  &gt; i know that the fairly obvious answer would be to adopt, but i know that's not really all that easy to do, and frankly a large part of why i'd want to be a parent is to see what kind of mix my fiance and my genes would end up with.  pregnancy is not all that bad, and neither is birth.  if you can have your own child ... why not?  &gt; is infanthood really that horrible?   no.  in fact, it's almost easier than other stages except for the first two months when they are getting their sleep schedules worked out.  &gt; is it worth it?   oh yeah.  in a big way.  i used to be anti-kid, and thought a lot about it like you are now, but i'd never go back.  &gt; both of us are on the fence about parenthood and i really do think it's mainly a problem because of the infant stage, even though that stage is relatively fleeting.  all you really need is *resources*.  we have found some great books, like ""healthy sleep habits, happy child"" and ""the happiest toddler on the block"" which really teach the parents about what is going on.  we also taught our son baby sign language and it has made a massive difference (watch ""signing time"" on netflix) in being able to communicate with him.    so, bottom line, it's only hard if you try to do it without learning new tricks how to handle your kids.  it is all a learning opportunity for your kids and you.",1,2,

722007,"ok, let's look at your first example:  &gt;in 1986, the virulently right-wing, anti-progressive reagan administration convened hearings against pornography and commissioned reports from a variety of sources with the intention to prove that pornography was harmful and should be banned. edna einseidel was asked to review the existing research, but was finally unable to say that she found a link between pornography and violence. the us surgeon general was asked to report independently, and another study was commissioned to investigate whether men's magazines had increased in violence.  &gt;surgeon general c. everett koop reported that no evidence of harm from pornography could be found, and the men's magazine study found that violence had not increased, but only .06% of the imagery in men's magazines could be said to portray violence, force or weaponry of any kind. nevertheless, the final report of the attorney general's commission on pornography (""the meese commission"") said that the relationship between pornography and harm had been proven; **the surgeon general's report to the commission and the results of the men's magazine study were suppressed and did not appear in the final report.**  &gt;zillmann's **(the author of the study you link to)** public relations did not inform naive readers that when he talked about ""callousness toward women"", he meant: a greater tolerance for homosexuality; a belief that women should be able to choose other priorities beside motherhood; less belief in marriage; a belief that women may enjoy sex and choose to participate in it for reasons other than pleasing their husbands or conceiving children - in short, the goals of most feminist groups of the time. zillmann was unable to demonstrate any increase in misogynist or violent attitudes and desires, although he did try.  &gt;nor did zillmann and his supporters ever note that there were *serious problems with his methodology*, making even these results debatable. for example, zillmann had attempted to expand his subject base by including non-students in his study. however, the older, more settled men in his study group left when they were told they would be watching pornography, leaving only the younger men who for the most part did not have enduring relationships and were, of course, living in student environments. but his control group continued to contain those older men, with the result that their experience of marriage and the desirability of one's current partnerships may have coloured the balance of attitudes about that subject. similarly, the fact that they were both older and obviously more conservative may have been responsible for the other differences in attitudes between the two groups.  &gt;the fact, for instance, that one of dolf zillman's researches found that ""aggressive"" responses were as, if not more, likely to be aroused by materials that made people laugh does not shake his certainty.   i'll point you to some other studies that aren't as contentious or as twisted by politicians with agendas on the matter:  [an epidemiological study which found that the massive growth of the pornography industry in the united states between 1975 and 1995 was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the number of sexual assaults per capita; and reported similar results for japan.](http://www.hawaii.edu/pcss/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_ovrvw.html)  or how about this study (again not ordered and paid for then filtered by a politician, but surprisingly actually showing the truth from one that was):   [pornography, sex crime, and public policy berl kutchinsky professor of criminology institute of criminology and criminal science university of copenhagen denmark](http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/proceedings/14/kutchinsky.pdf) *warning pdf* &gt;five years later the united states commission on obscenity and pornography (1970, p. 53) (or rather twelve of the seventeen participating members) arrived at a similar conclusion, stating that 'empirical research designed to clarify the question has found no evidence to date that exposure to explicit sexual materials plays a significant role in the causation of delinquent or criminal behaviour among youth or adults'. another verdict of notguilty but this time based on overwhelming amounts of research: careful reviews of earlier research and thirty-nine additional effect studies sponsored by the commission.   &gt;according to these studies, sex offenders generally reported sexually repressive family backgrounds, immature and inadequate sexual histories and rigid, conservative attitudes towards sexuality. during adolescence they had less experience with erotica than other groups. as adults, sex offenders seemed to catch up with other categories, but did not use pornography more frequently than others; and sex offenders did not differ significantly from other adults in their reported arousal or reported likelihood of engaging in sexual behaviour during or following exposure to pornography.  or how about another study, again, where the author didn't later refute the conclusions (one of the studies you link to, btw, the author later admitted he could have gotten the same physiological responses from his subject by making them ride a stationary bike for 2 minutes - try to get research from at least 25 years ago for validity on this taboo subject. hell, in the 1960s, the government of the us still distributed films that literally said all homosexuals are communists who murder children.)  [porn 101: eroticism, pornography, and the first amendment: milton diamond ph.d.](http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/bib/diam/effects_pornography.htm) &gt; however, a 1995 study comparing crime statistics in japan since 1972 when pornography changed from totally prohibited to freely available with no age restrictions found that sex crimes in every category, from rape to public indecency, sexual offenses from both ends of the criminal spectrum, significantly decreased in incidence. most significantly, despite the wide increase in availability of pornography to children, not only was there a decrease in sex crimes with juveniles as victims but the number of juvenile offenders also decreased significantly. we hypothesized that the increase in pornography, without age restriction and in comics, if it had any detrimental effect, would most negatively influence younger individuals. just the opposite occurred. the number of victims decreased particularly among the females younger than 13. in 1972, 8.3% of the victims were younger than 13. in 1995 the percentage of victims younger than 13 years of age dropped to 4.0%; a reduction of greater than 50%. in 1972, 33.3 % of the offenders were between 14-19 years of age; by 1995 that percentage had decreased to 9.6%.  the same study found that a similar decrease had occurred in the us as pornography became more mainstream, but to a lesser effect.   again, correlation is easy to come up with, but no one has proven scientifically that there is any causal link between pornography and increased violence against women, or desire for violence against women - however the corollary evidence is far stronger on the opposite side of the argument since as pornography has become more readily available in any number of countries, the decline in rape cases has been significant and consistent.",0,,
859677,"you seem to be looking for anecdotes more than advice, so here are a few:  after my great aunt's husband died, i would sometimes go and visit her in her nursing home. warning: i was around 8 or 9 at the time, so i don't remember it as best i could. she would get visits from me and her other nieces and nephews, and whenever we came to visit, she would sit us down and try to give us all life lessons while sobbing. it ended up being because she was devastated about not having any kids of her own, she was so upset that after she died, the wouldn't really have left any mark on the world. not her genetics, but there would be no one who she raised with her exact philosophies and who would really remember her. she was a pretty successful woman, she and her husband had opened and owned a fairly successful restaurant, but to her, the most amazing thing she could have done was make a mark on the world. after she died, my grandmother told me how her husband was sterile and the two had decided to not have kids by other means. i'm pretty sure she was a happy person for most of her life, it was just at the end when there was some regret.   this one is not a personal story, it's on i found online:  *i will turn 60 this year. i'm truly looking forward to it. the age thing has never bothered me in the least. i was attractive in my youth and believe i still hold on to the majority of that attractiveness. i'm married and have been married for what seems 'all my life'. when i met my husband, we were so much in love with each other and life, we didn't consider children. we never concerned ourselves with the thought of children. we were too much in love for thoughts of that nature to crowd our time. we found out later neither of us could have children. it didn't bother us at the time. when i turned 40, the opportunity presented itself to us to adopt a newborn. we discussed the life altering move and decided it would be an opportunity to have a real family. the anticipation of a child in our home didn't change anything, rather, added to our already wonderful lives.*   *consequently, the baby was born premature and didn't live which devasted us.*   *now, at 60 years of age and childless, as we approach our golden years, i have to admit, i find myself wishing we had raised a family of our own. i have my wonderful husband of course and not having a child has granted me the opportunity to share my life with him. hopefully, we will continue to do that in our upcoming retirement.*   *i only have my husband's family left and their children. everyone else has grown old and passed on.*   *not having children of my own means if something happens to my husband, i will be totally alone. i did not say lonely. i said alone. not having children means i will have to face issues of growing older, alone. there will be no one there to help me or comfort me. there will no one there to pass the time with or to buy presents for or to cook thanksgiving dinner for.*   *true enough, i could spend time with friends and other family members but it's just not the same as having children.*  *i'm one of those women who wanted children but couldn't have them. i will always miss the little baby who didn't live. i will always miss the opportunity to raise and nurture my own child. i will miss the opportunities children present to parents at all ages. and i will miss them when they aren't there to love when i am left in this world by myself.*  *i'm healthy and i'm not depressed. i am filled with joy and happiness in most cases. the topic remember, is not having children. in that area, i feel like i'm the one who has lost.*   and here' one more:  *i am a 50 year old woman. when i was 9 years old i would tell my mom i'm not going to get married until i was 27. 27 seems old when you're 9. i did end up marrying a man i did not love at 22 and divorcing at 28. my mom would say, ""smart girl and if you're even smarter, you'll never have kids!"" she would say this often so basically i was brainwashed in to not wanting any. i was never around babies or anyone expecting one. the word ""pregnant"" was not said in the home and i wasn't told any facts. if it hadn't been for the mandatory 5th &amp; 7th grade films, i wouldn't know anything about menstruation or sex. i regret now not having a baby. the joy, the love, that i now know a baby can bring in to one's life. i have no man in my life and no kids. my parents are gone. i have a brother &amp; sister, both pushing 80. i have a few friends, but i'm essentially alone. i am so angry with myself and my mother. i've experienced major depression for 15 years and will be on medication for it the rest of my life. yes raising children is expensive, time-consuming, frustrating, difficult..that's all mom ever said. but clair, please reconsider. ask yourself why you feel you do not want any. do you have a negative influence in your life similar to the one i did? please be sure, be totally 100% completely sure it is what you (and only you!) want. i probably have not helped you, but please, at your age, do not decide against it*   i'm sure the threads i was on had some stories about people who didn't regret it, i was just skimming for some positive ones because that's what you asked for.  but you shouldn't make your choice based on the decisions of a few strangers. not having kids is a really huge life decision. it should be you making the decision, not anyone else, including your boyfriend. you have to make sacrifices in a relationship, and not having kids is an enormous sacrifice if that's something you want to do. it will affect the entire rest of your life, more than just about any other decision. you have to be pretty sure the relationship will last that long and be that meaningful.

573444,"interesting question and line of thought.  created a new throwaway account for this because i'm pretty certain it's going to be taken the wrong way.  &gt;but i wonder; does it have to be that way? is there any reason mgtow can't start a family? if gay men like me can adopt or use the services of a surrogate, why not mgtow?  surrogates maybe, but that's really expensive (and it doesn't totally avoid the woman-child court problem; even male-female married couples with their own sperm/egg and just using the surrogate womb have gotten entangled in custody stuff).  and adoption is, alas, basically out of the question.    the system basically will not allow a single, *uncoupled* male (especially not an mgtow) to become a foster or adoptive parent.     you think that gay men have faced prejudice by the foster/adopt system? *(they undoubtedly have, and in some places like florida still do, ridiculous levels of prejudice!)*   yeah, well pardon me for saying so, but you ain't seen nothin' by comparison.   every weird pop-psychoanalytic insinuation a gay couple faces when attempting to adopt... multiply several times over for a single white mgtow male.  you see the system is largely run by misandristic women, typically single-mothers who have been ""dumped on"" (at least from their perspective) and got social worker degrees to get a job (back in the 90's &amp; 00's when the ""welfare to work"" change happened) -- and a single ""mgtow"" type male is their worst nightmare, their particular ""bogeyman"" and ""scapegoat"", and the category of person (probably second only to their ""ex"" or ""exes"") who they hate most in the world -- especially one who is white and financially secure (as most childless mgtow are for rather obvious reasons).    * *you actively date women?* well then you are a ""user"" and an ""exploiter"" and probably an unprosecuted ""abuser"" -- or, alternately you're just ""afraid"" of commitment! (no, i just have no desire to marry a crazy-biotch with baggage! and it's not her ill-begotten spawn that i mean by baggage, it's everything else!  cf http://captaincapitalism.blogspot.ro/2013/03/where-good-men-are.html)  * *you stopped actively dating women?* uh oh... here goes the psychoanalytic bs... then you *must* either be ""in the closet"" (ummm, not that there's anything wrong with that, but nope.) or you must be a misogynistic ""woman hater"" (nope, just don't like the bitchy, controlling, manipulative kind... wait, i can't say that can i)... or else the last insinuation ... (here's the big one, you know it's coming) well the only thing left is that *you must be a pedophile!* (not at all, but how do i disprove a baseless paranoid accusation like that???  it's like trying to prove there is no such thing as an ""invisible"" cat sitting in an empty chair.) edit: note that the *other* option, that you are a rational disciplined person who is self-disciplined and in control over your sexuality and able to express it in non-sexual-gratification ways, rather than being controlled by it... that is considered an impossibility (apparently because the people judging you are not in control of their own, so they cannot encompass the possibility of not being driven by their urges and impulses).  * *why/what do you -- a man -- want with a child/children?*  hint: men apparently cannot have any ""parental"" or ""nurturing"" desires, we are not allowed to want to mentor or raise young people up to be rational stable adults... and if you do express any ""liking"" for working with youth, well then it just must be you trying to cover for some jerry sandusky crap. \*sigh\*  * **and never-mind** that we could probably give a foster/adoptive kid or two the kind of low-drama, stable home and solid life with opportunities, guidance, wisdom and resources they would otherwise never have (even with other worthy foster/adopt homes).  *in fact, this kind of counts against us in the eyes of the system...* first it makes them look bad; second they have no ""hook"" with which to control &amp; manipulate us: the system is designed to provide so called ""services"" {""counseling"" from financially, emotionally and psychologically unstable, misandristic single mother women ""social workers"" -- rolling portable ""basket cases on wheels"" so to speak -- yeah... no thanks} and more importantly the system uses money which they expect to be a means of controlling and manipulating you and the child(ren). well, pretty much by definition -- mgtow types are not easily manipulated via emotional/psychological blackmail (we know all those bs tricks and how to ignore/counter them); and we generally cannot be ""controlled"" via money (i have extra bedrooms {currently junk/guest rooms} in a decent sized, paid-off home in a semi-gated community, and sufficient funds that i could easily support a couple of kids for a decade or more without even working, much less raising a sweat... the government ""payments"" for foster care or ""services"" would not be needed {i'd probably have just shoved any checks the kids got into savings/investments for the kids' own future}.)  ---  so, how did i learn that the above is the pretty much the current situation?    believe me when i say i didn't used to think it was that bad.  but then a few years back i became aware of a special category of kids that the system seems to have no place for -- *and they stand almost*\* *no chance of being adopted* -- kids (normally preteen/teen boys) who have been abused by either their mothers or other female caregivers; and who react very negatively towards any/all female authority figures as a result (foster moms, school teachers, social workers, etc); heck there are even a couple of them in my state (""poster"" kids no less) who have been designated by their own social workers as needing a ""male only household"", and preferably one with no younger siblings (apparently out of fear of or past incidents of abuse-reaction {i.e. where the kid abuses younger kids}) and no older *female* siblings, etc.  iow... kids who need a single male parent (and one who doesn't ""date"" -- no ""instant"" mom or even ""dad's girlfriend"" drama -- i.e. an mgtow).  so, having reached an age where i am pretty much ""settled"" and realizing that unless i want to subordinate myself to a crazy-arse-biotch with demon spawn (or otherwise ""rob the cradle"" and marry some child-woman gold-digger, not worth the risk imo) ... that i am unlikely to get married, and so unlikely to have kids.  the genetic and bloodline stuff really doesn't matter to me (they are not *my* genes, i didn't hand select them or anything, i just got stuck with them) -- to me more important would be passing on my passions, my interests, my skills, etc -- and i have no problem with doing that with an heir or heirs that are not my own.  so, for over 2 years i worked the process (classes, seminars, applications, interviews, home visit/inspection, etc) of becoming a foster/adoptive parent... facing every possible roadblock you can imagine (they never return calls; your ""applications"" get magically lost, misplaced, misfiled, and then when you refile with certified mail well guess what, you filed the wrong *version* of the form and you have to start over again... then the ""case worker"" you were working with retired, the next one got transferred, promoted, etc.; your appointments get canceled or they don't show up, and on and on).   i finally got fed up with the runaround and got through to someone ""higher up"" who took pity on me and sat me down in private in a coffee shop -- and *off the record* (he promised he would deny ever meeting me in court) he told me straight out *that i was wasting my time* -- it didn't matter how clean my criminal record was {it's pristine} or how financially secure i was, how psychologically stable, healthy, etc; nor even that i might be able to provide the ""ideal"" home for one or two of the aforementioned kids with special needs -- the system and the people in charge of it would never, ever approve me (as a ""privileged white hetero single male"") as a placement for a child, there is just that much misandry and ""patriarchical"" hatred against (especially white middle class) males present in the people who run the child welfare system.  *(btw, by contrast i am told that anywhere from 40% to 60% of all foster homes -- it varies from one state to another -- are single mothers/single women, often already struggling with multiple other kids in the home... and so normally on ""welfare/assistance"" from the state.)*  well, that -- the conversation i had with that guy (soon to retire dcfs department head) -- pretty much settled the matter;  there was no point in wasting my time, money and life... beating my head senselessly against what was obviously an undefeatable brick wall.  i know when the system is rigged.  **it's frigging sickening.**  but that is the way it is.  \*note: what is really sad, is the fate of those kids.  about the only exception, the **only** chance these kids stand of being given a home -- ironically enough given the insinuations and arm-chair psychoanalysis of the feminazi social workers -- is if a gay male couple can be found.  (so in wishing that those kids can get some home, i hope such a couple can be found, or can breach the system... but of course i know that is unlikely because much of the system is still nearly as biased against gay {male} couples as well as mgtow types).  now will the changes with gay men, civil marriage, etc really change anything? -----  *maybe in the long term...* possibly a decade or more from now if/when the ""pedophile paranoia"" finally settles down &amp; disappears (and if the ""third wave"" feminazism dies out); but i doubt it will change anything for mgtow types anytime soon.  the real paradox and irony of all of this of course, is that the ancient or historical precursors to mgtow's (i.e. childless widowers or men with no desire to marry/remarry) ... were the category of people in society that pretty much **originated** the very practice and concept of fostering and adopting of (far more frequent in the era when people dropped like flies from disease) orphans and foundlings, etc. *now. in our so called ""modern &amp; enlightened"" world, we are the category precluded from doing so.*   go figure.",1,,-1

624534,"&gt;first, lets dispel some of those myths you threw out there. there is a huge market in the us for adopting healthy infants. there are many, many more children awaiting adoption. it can take as little as 2 or 3 months to adopt a ""special-needs"" child..   relatively few children are born with disabilities, most of the aborted babies would have been born healthy.   &gt;the cost of adopting a healthy newborn can be as low as a few thousand dollars. there are even subsidies if you adopt a ""special-needs"" child.   an average cost of adoption of a healthy newborn in usa is between $10,000 and $15,000, which is *a lot* of money, too much for most families.   &gt;now, back to the main topic. i completely disagree that cultural reform can ensure far fewer unwanted pregnancies. can you give me some examples of where reform of culture has had significant impact? what type of cultural reform is necessary in the us to reduce unwanted pregnancies? china has been practicing infanticide since before 1000ad. how are we (especially as outsiders) going to have any influence to change that? it is illegal to abandon a child. it still happens. sex-selective abortion is illegal. it still happens.  things in our culture that cause women to choose abortions over motherhood? where do i begin... we live in an extremely selfish culture, we are always told to think about ourselves and to love ourselves first and foremost. we live in a culture of entitlement where teenagers flip out at their parents because they didn't get an ipad for christmas. we live in a culture where children lack any sort of respect for their parents and where completely breaking the rules of the household is seen as ""normal"" teenage behavior.. hint, it wasn't always like that, it is a very relatively recent phenomenon that is not present in many cultures.   we live in a culture where narcissism was taken off the dsm because it's just considered to be a normal part of personality now.   why does this matter? because all these young women walk around thinking they are entitled to making choices and not have to deal with the consequences, that their wishes and desires are the most important thing in the world that nothing else matters.   we live in a culture that judges your value as a person by your paycheck/career, so when many women are faced with the choice of being a mother or being ""successful"" many choose success because that is what gives them ""value"" in the eyes of general society and therefore feeds their self-respect. if being a mother was as respected in our society as being a successful business woman i can guarantee a lot more women would choose to be mothers.   on the subject of employment i believe usa has some of the worst policies when it comes to maternity leave. i strongly believe that women who choose to be mothers *should* be given ""special"" treatment at work - and by special treatment i mean their employers should be considerate of their circumstances. i remember reading an interview in a women's magazine with a ceo of some big cosmetics company who gives women with families flexibility when it comes to their work hours. she said that this kind of treatment only makes those women work harder and put more into the company because they are so grateful for the understanding it provides and so it is no way bad for her business.   we live in a society where we are encouraged to do whatever pleases *us* at any cost (short of breaking the law). we live in a society that says all morals are relative - ""hey i may be having casual sex with people i hardly know, but who are *you* to tell me that's wrong?"". the reason abstinence education doesn't work is not because it is impossible for people to wait until they are *at least* in a stable relationship to have sex but because it literally goes against all the things that have become ingrained into our society over the past 50-60 years.   we live in a society that looks down on single mothers/young mothers because they didn't choose a role the society sees as ""valuable/productive"", because being a mother and raising the next generation is *not* respected as a job in itself.   i mean all of those things are changeable and all of those things are recent.   &gt;one major factor you've left out is economic. infanticide seems to be highest in poor socioeconomic situations and in areas of overpopulation. i don't see how cultural reform is going to change those factors.   that's where political and educational reform comes in. for example providing government-sponsored childcare to young mothers who study so that they could finish school and college and get a decent job would help them to get out of poverty and secure a future for themselves and their children.   &gt;so far i've been sorta melding the idea of abortions and infanticide together because i see them as accomplishing the same goal (i know it sounds awful to put it that way, but... it's true).   i do agree with you on that.",1,-2,

316982,"obama's mother was born in 1942, her father fought in wwii and obama was 7 years old in 1968. she was eighteen when obama was born in 1961. she was a boomer, an early hipster and barry is an early genxer.  when we talk about the baby boom it is a well-defined timeframe describing people born in the 40s and 50s when there was a huge increase in birth rates in the us. this generational cohort shares common set of experiences, marked by historical, cultural and social events that everyone reacts to in their own way, but which mark that generation in a way that younger/older generations don't share.  you are right from the perspective of a biological family unit that the parents belong to one generation, and the children to another. this fact gives us no insight into how different generations (in the sense of age-group cohorts) might react to the same set of historical circumstances.  a lot of what i see in these threads on reddit is a familiar intergenerational resentment that probably dates back to the dawn of civilization. old people gripe at the young, because they resent their youth. young people resent old people hanging on to economic resources and social status. so what else is new?  what's more interesting is the interplay between generations that become defined by watershed events (like wwii or the vietnam war) that demand a collective response from young adults. as they get older they are still defined to a large degree by those events (think about how the boomers have continued to play out old traumas of the 60s on current events).   back in the early 90s a book was published that posed a theory of the way these generational tensions played out through american history:  [generations: the history of america's future, 1584 to 2069](http://www.amazon.com/generations-history-americas-future-1584/dp/0688119123/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1380821477&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=generations+the+history+of+america%27s+future)  it's amazing to me how much influence these ideas have today, over 30(!) years later. [here's a wiki on the theory.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strauss-howe_generational_theory)  in a nutshell, the authors argue that there are 4 different generational types that repeat in a cycle which can be traced back in the us to before the american revolution. each generation is roughly 20-22 years in historical time.   corporations and political parties spend tens of millions of dollars trying to predict generational trends for marketing and campaign purposes. the authors even set up their own consulting business because of the predictive accuracy of their model.   millennials, they say, correspond to the greatest generation, marked by idealism, hard work, and if predictions come true they will successfully ""clean up the mess"" left by prior generations, as did the wwii cohort. genx, marked by well-earned cynicism and world-weary pragmatism, will serve as cautionary elder council to the exuberance of the millennials.   it's not surprising that so many twenty-somethings resent being characterized as slackers because i don't see that at all. as a genxer i know we invented that shit. we had reasons.   rather than point fingers and decide which generation is good or bad, maybe we should take into account the different experiences and challenges and baggage each generation brings to the game.  btw. douglas copeland would be mighty surprised to hear that people over 50 aren't genx, since he was certainly considered as such when [he wrote the book that defined the generation.](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/c222c31a-9677-11e2-9ab2-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz2ggfus8lo)   *""who are they? does generation x even exist? if so, how can we make money from it? are they boomers or are they different? do they require a different management style?

""... and the children were screaming... the children were screaming..."" whatever hook is, he's less a man here than a force of nature, a spirit of malice and vengeance, who represents some sort of dark and wild magic.  ... and then we meet hook not long afterwards, and he's a somewhat silly, idiosyncratic old man with a fixation on complicated linguistics (""... smee, translate.""), clocks, and has a sorta' two-man comedy team going on with smee. that is because we have found ourselves in the movie's flipside, which is about being silly and fun and immature. and hey, there's nothing wrong about being silly and fun and immature, and this movie does it well... but all that buildup about hook as a supernatural threat has just been washed away in favor of a man who literally matches wits with children (and at times loses).  in the serious half of the movie, granny wendy shows peter artwork of peter pan, and what he sees is something wild, untamed... another force of nature, and one that seemingly frightens him because he cannot reconcile that almost feral creature with who he has become.  but in the silly side of the movie, he's a grown man wearing green tights and having a name-calling contest with kids. this isn't the wild, untamed boy the artwork promised, it's just an overgrown man-child.  back to serious - there are parts of the movie that we see that both peter and tinkerbell have suffered some great losses in their lives. peter has twice abandoned one life in favor of another (though his claim of ""running away from responsibility"" when his crib rolled off is... bizarre, to say the least), and in turn lost everything from his previous life. tink, of course, lost him the second time, and though she still holds a candle for him his very existence as an old man is a sure sign that he's moved on.  but this turns back to silly when he starts retardedly talking to her about a thermometer and childishly asks ""peter pan's got's kids?"". the mood whiplash here is particularly strong, because tink (back to serious now) sees this as a sign that he's come back to her, only for him to shut her down again.  it's disjointed and the dissonance between the two is jarring. as it stands, it is still an extremely strong and memorable part of my childhood, and parts of it were particularly wonderful on both sides of the coin... but i still can't help but feel it would have been better as two separate peter pan movies.",1,1,-1

666793,"&gt;absolutely nothing! the word ""abortion"" does not appear in any translation of the bible!  the word ""infanticide"" doesn't appear in any translation of the bible either.  perhaps god doesn't care about killing infants either?  &gt;""if men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. and if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth ...   first off, you only quoted through verse 24.  great job with the research there, sparky.  secondly, the kjv (quoted in the article) isn't very clear as to what's actually being said in the passage from exodus.  check the niv, or another newer translation:  &gt;if men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the husband demands and the court allows.  but if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, butn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise..."" exodus 21:22-23 niv  it is possible that the phrase translated ""gives birth prematurely"" could be referring to having a miscarriage.  either way, the situation described here is one of an accidental injury (two guys are fighting and accidentally strike the preggo), rather than a purposely inflicted injury (intentionally striking the woman) to cause the miscarriage.  &gt;according to the bible, life begins at birth--when a baby draws its first breath.  check jeremiah 1:5 on that one:  &gt;before i formed you in the womb i knew you, before you were born i set you apart; i appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""  why would god set apart a non-living lump of flesh for his work, if he didn't feel that such a lump of flesh was alive?  &gt;the bible defines life as ""breath"" in several significant passages, including the story of adam's creation in genesis 2:7, when god ""breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.""  in adam's creation, adam was created as a full-grown man, rather than an infant.  you could use the same case to state that life doesn't begin until adulthood.  i don't see any basis for equating ""breath"" with ""life"" in the bible, other than the creation account in genesis, and the repeated notion that lack of breath is equal to death (breathed his last, leave nothing alive that has breath, etc.).    additionally, there are other instances of breath, especially the breath of god, referring to other things.  2 sam 22:16 and job 4:9 refer to god's breath being destructive.  breath is also used numerous times in the bible to state the shortness of man's life compared to god -- this is a metaphorical comaprison.  either way, infants draw breath while in the womb; however, it's fluid that's being breathed rather than air.  so the point is moot one way or the other.  &gt;the commandments, moses, jesus and paul ignored every chance to condemn abortion. if abortion was an important concern, why didn't the bible say so?  if infanticide was an important concern, why doesn't the bible say so?  the only thing the bible states in the bible about infanticide specifically are a few references in leviticus 18 and 20 warning against sacrificing children to molech.  so perhaps infants weren't considered people either in the old testament?  &gt;happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.   perhaps you should read all of psalm 137 to get the context of this verse.  it doesn't make it any more pleasant, but it at least puts the verse into the proper perspective.  &gt;the bible is not pro-child  well that's nice, but what's it got to do with abortion?  i thought that children weren't children until they left the uterus.  &gt;luke 23:29: for, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck  holy out of context, batman!  and again... what's it got to do with anything?  people, if you're going to try to fight fire with fire (or bible with bible, or whathaveyou), you should at least take the time to read your source material and create an accurate argument for your case (or against someone else's).  this article is just plain drivvel.",0,,

279614,"ruth ann swenson at berkeley opera march 29 while anna nicole smith is weapon of mass destraction  by cindy warner   the berkeley opera will celebrate it‚Äôs 30th annivesary by featuring ruth ann swenson on march 29.  ruth ann is the beloved soprano who appeared many years ago in the oscar winning documentary about san francisco opera's choristers, in the shadow of the stars.  ruth ann as countess almalviva in mozart's light hearted marriage of figaro, right.                                 in the film ruth ann's real life hubby was a chorister at sfo at the time.  you can see why decades later ruth ann as countess almaviva has motivation to support young love in mozart's the marriage of figaro.   ruth ann's own hubby gave up his career to support ruth ann‚Äôs stardom.  so we all have a lot to be thankful for.  taking another route out of the shadows, siggy seigel, a chorister who stayed with sfo since then and also featured in the film, serves on the board of the berkeley opera. so i imagine siggy and ruth ann go way back.  moreover sfo would honor ruth ann with the san francisco opera medal in the summer of 2008.  although i remember her from 2006 as countess almaviva in the lighthearted marriage of figaro, the romantic comedy by mozart.   she seemed beautiful and gracious inside and out, she had a warm hearted demeanor as she helped the young lovers marry.         here countess almaviva hides a conspirator of love in her boudoir as her hubby count almaviva enters. looking elegant and sophisticated, she took on an almost lucille ballesque sense of zaniness as she tried to be composed yet distracting, keeping her hubby from discovering who is hiding.  she‚Äôs the young lovers‚Äô weapon of mass distraction.                              the marriage of figaro came up recently as an opera that took on the times. it was in relation to the breaking news that a bastion of culture, the royal opera at covent garden, will be putting on an opera about anna nicole smith. the writer higgens said:  mozart, the marriage of figaro (1786) figaro, a servant, outwits his master. napoleon called the original beaumarchais play ""the revolution in action"".  at the same time, taking on new work adds life to opera, gives it credibility for having originality and being on the cutting edge, a leader.  so, the english writer goes on to quote elaine padmore of the royal opera.  padmore says about anna nicole, it is not just a documentary about her, but a parable about celebrity and what it does to people.  it can be moving, it can be funny and it tells universal truths about human frailty.  it is a very sad story - a larger-than-life american story, as was puccini's girl of the golden west. it will be a slice of our times - of america in the pre-obama days.    on that note here‚Äôs how sfo describes puccini's girl of the golden west, which comes to the stage june of 2010: a crafty criminal. a suspicious sheriff. a frontier woman with a tender heart who knows how to shoot a gun. if they sound like characters from a classic western, they are‚Äîexcept their gunfights and poker games are set to a brilliant, blazing score. a love triangle set during the california gold rush . . .    ‚Ä¢ minnie: deborah voigt  ‚Ä¢ dick johnson a.k.a. ramerrez: salvatore licitra*  ‚Ä¢ sheriff jack rance: roberto frontali  ‚Ä¢ nick: steven cole  ‚Ä¢ ashby: kevin langan  and a sweeping tale it is even if you just listen to the romantic strings alone . . . but here's a video of sherril milnes as minnie fielding sherriff rance's advances.   sherriff rance offers minni the barmaid a thousand dollars for a kiss right now:  i set out lured on only by the spell of gold. it‚Äôs the one thing that never deceived me. now for a kiss from you, i would spend a fortune.    love is something different, minnie answers.  romantic rubbish! the sherriff says.   speaking of authoritarians and the heartless pursuit of gold, did i mention wotan and die walkure of the ring cycle also hit the stage at sfo next june?  here's a recent production of girl of the golden west or la fanciulla del west from montreal in 2008.  singing ch'ella mi creda:  pavarotti in 1991, franco correli in 1966, and domingo and bocelli.  and . .    opus arte with a chorister working on a noose . . .  similarly and getting back to our cowgirl anna n., sfo has seen american opera taken from the headlines.  most recently with productions by americans john adams and peter sellars with the world premiere of dr. atomic.  i remember it selling out. the production i mean.  here's jerald finley as j. robert oppenheimer.             peter sellars even got a kiss from one of the young women working at the opera.  this is a picture of peter during the production at sfo.   i was at the counter at caf√© corbus, a local caf√© on hayes the opera folk frequent. sellars was there, as it turns out, autographing a poster i would later see mounted on the caf√© wall. a youthful energized perky fellow with spiky almost buzz cut hair, he looks mischievous like denis the menace. she gave peter a kiss and ignored me.  so i figured this guy must rate.            moreover, reports the guardian, padmore likened the work [anna nicole] to zeit-oper, the german subgenre of opera popular in the 1920s and 30s, in which socio-political issues of the times were tackled. such works include ernst krenek's jonny spielt auf (jonny plays on), a jazz-inflected tale of alpine infidelity culminating in a fatal train crash.    continuing, padmore also compared the story to that of another recent sfo heroine.  padmore compares the plot of donizetti's classic, lucia di lammermoor, a tale loosely based on the life of a real 17th century scot, janet dalrymple. in the opera, lucia is forced to abandon her lover and enter into a politically expedient marriage - but she murders her husband and her lover takes his life. ""we have lucia di lammermoor,"" said padmore, ""so why not anna nicole smith? she also led a diva-like life.""    so i ask ya'll, how about rupaul?  anna articles in the guardian    in closing, i heard from a couple of women who have worked with anna.                                 first, bridget (above left with the real anna n.) emails from nebraska.  the photo is from a benefit for camp coholo, for children born with aids. i have only met anna through my husband's work and a penthouse pet of the year named roxy leroux. but i asked him about his career and the list is pretty distinguished.  gwen stefani and no doubt ( twice) 1995 1997; aerosmith (queensryche, jagermeister);  tanya tucker (black velvet);  u2 (guinness); kenney chesney (cruzn rrum); sammy hagar (cabo wabo tequila).    i know he is on a personal friendship with ahman green (green bay packers) and larry the cable guy . he left the liquor business two years ago and always said it was a romantic business but it demanded too much time.  he really wanted to get away from the late nights to be with the kids.  anna also had an interest in being with the kids . . . at camp coholo.  it was anna‚Äôs charitable focus, a place for children born with aids.  i also heard from celebrity impersonator dawnn behrens, who is up for best actress at the reel awards. it‚Äôs an award ceremony for celebrity impersonators, from kramer and lucille ball to george bush and saddam hussein. to vicki lynn. incidentally does that mean dawnn is impersonating an impersonator?  in closing, here‚Äôs a photo of anna and one of dawnn, you decide who's who.                                          photo of dawnn courtesy of dawnn behrens  photo of anna from the uk guardian  photos of ruth ann swenson, peter sellars and jerald finley courtesy of sfo  photo of anna nicole with bridget coffey courtesy of bridget  the bourgeoisie and thwarting love  francesca zambello to direct die walkure  wotan shares his dressing room  sacrifice of brunnhilde  opera tackles weighty issues  greer grimsley impressions, passions, stand by me, dreams  anna nicole smith opera  tosca featured in film milk  tosca and how opera's embattled stay in fighting shape  siggy team player part i  siggy part ii    sfo unveils salome for 2009  sfo's summer of love 2009  opera announces 2009/2010 season  contact the writer at sfoperaexaminer@yahoo.com     for more info:  www.berkeleyopera.org and www.sfopera.com",0,,

455131,"this is going to be a very lengthy post. i feel that if people understood, they'd be much less judgmental.    it takes two to make a human baby - male and female. a male can leave behind much more offspring than a female. it takes a female 9 months to create the product of 1 successful mating, and yet, in a single ejaculation a male can contribute to literally millions of offspring.    i don't know what the point you were trying to make with your story about ""a woman who has sex with many men in a society [with the existence of birth control technology] has too many kids."" for every single one of those kids, a male had to attempt sex with a woman too. i bet you some fraction of those attempts were males raping females. given that equal numbers of either gender had to have sex, with (logically) fewer females consenting...who is the slut now? technology now allows us to find the culprits of shitty fathers who abandon their pregnant mates.    your lock analogy does not really apply because the goal of a vagina is not really to keep everything out and allow only one thing in. analogies are supposed to match the circumstances. i mean, i could make one up right now. stores flourish better and are more stable if they have multiple customers entering their doors. sure you could have 1 affluent buyer that keeps your store afloat, but what if you lose that one buyer? it's like putting all your eggs in one basket. now your business is fucked. coincidentally, this is exactly why looking down on ""sluttiness"" is so ironic. i think if i explain it to you biologically, you would understand why your lock analogy cannot be applied to this situation, as in, i will explain to you how absurd it is to expect that the vagina was designed to only allow 1 male ""keyholder"" in.    i assume you've learned about natural selection and evolution in high school. there is a reason males in nearly every single species (peacocks, practically every single bird like wood ducks, pheasants, lions and their manes), and it is because these decorations exist to impress the female into allowing him the opportunity to mate with her. from an evolutionary standpoint, the female has the advantage (she will definitely get to leave behind offspring, since the baby factory is literally inside her) because they are able to choose their male, and she obviously wants the best. apply a little common sense, and you'll quickly see that putting your eggs into one basket and gambling with one male is not worth in certain scenarios, because your male may look pretty on the outside but if he carries a gene that leaves his offspring at a disadvantage, well, then you as the female are fucked. you want to mate around, as a form of ""offspring insurance.""     if you studied past human biology, you would know that humans practiced polygamy (the evidence is in the shape of the penis. i am not joking. google ""squeegee penis"") for a reason. before currency based, non-kin cooperative societies came about, it was difficult to raise a human child alone. the harshness of the environment dictated the system of mating and child rearing, which basically boiled down to monogamy or polygamy. some environments require the dedication and focus of two adults to raise a child. other environments are more forgiving, and if you want more bang for your buck, or in this case, buck for your bang, you'd want to mate polygamously. since raising a child is so easy, and you can do it without the total dedication of 2 adults, mating polygamously puts everyone at an advantage because now your offspring have more varied genetics. if one male turns out to have an extremely detrimental gene, you only lost 1 offspring as opposed to all of your offspring. like i said, everyone benefits. males benefit too. if they mated with 1 female exclusively and she had 1 terrible dominant gene, all his offspring are now fucked.    this is the very reason why birds who 'mate for life' were recently discovered to actually mate polygamously, in secret. both male and female of a pair bond will have extra marital copulations as a form of ""insurance."" if their nest is destroyed, the male still has 1 child in some other nest somewhere. if the male's genes turn out to be crappy, the female laid an egg or two from another male. natural selection usually brings out the most ideal method of leaving behind offspring.    also, you should know that the cultural disdain for women sleeping around is not truly universal, because of this very reason. there are still cultures out there today that mate polygamously, and it is a very big deal to them - anually they set aside a day for rituals before they go off into the bushes and literally have an orgy. i wish i could remember the name of these people so i could provide evidence. before you judge them, there is a reason for this. mating polygamously shrouds the identity of the offspring's father. this uncertainty forces the entire village to work together to cooperate in childrearing, because that child may or may not be yours. does this make sense? if you lived in a village and you, as a male, attended the orgy, and you mated with beth, sue, amy, and lily, and they mated with a few other males, you now don't know the identity of the fathers of these babies. each of these 4 children could be yours, so you'd help them all out. likewise, every other male who mated with these women will also devote time and resources. these children benefit greatly, and as a result, the village benefits greatly in the future.   the same way we look down on ""slutty women"" in our culture, these people look down on monogamy in their culture, because they are gaming the system. in a documentary on these people, one man in the village refused to let his wife participate in the orgies, and his wife's father and brother were enraged - rightfully so, because this means the identity of her children are now clear (her husband, only). her children are now tremendously at a disadvantage, because now they wont have 6-7 men helping to raise these children. they only have 1.    the point i am trying to make is that monogamy worked for today's society only because our environment ""dictated"" that monogamy would be a more ideal way of successfully raising children than polygamy.    humans were historically polygamous. like i said, go google ""squeegee penis,"" and maybe read up a little on anthropology. there is a reason both sexes are wired subconsciously to want to mate polygamously, and it is because those were the ones who were the most successful in ancient environments/conditions. you can see that these conditions endured long enough to lead to pretty significant evolutionary remnants on our anatomy - the entire shape of the penis.   sex feels good to both genders because of natural selection. everyone who was genetically designed to hate sex didn't leave behind offspring/died out. how is it fair to expect 1 gender to deprive themselves of something enjoyable and instinctual? if your answer is population control, refer to what i said earlier. a woman takes 9 months to give birth to only 1 (sometimes 2, and rarely 3) babies. the males contribution was maybe 2-3 minutes of copulation, with 5 minutes of refractory period. are you really going to say that women contribute more to overpopulation, factoring in rape in societies were male-dominated governments prohibit abortion?",0,,

around.  if anything, they want to be on camera to rehab their reputation so they can go on the conference circuit.  it's painfully clear that they had all those babies because michelle loves being pregnant and having a newborn, and jimbob loves...making babies.  now that there aren't any infants, it seems to me that they'd rather go collect speaking fees at conferences than actually parent their children.  **josh/anna:** after his public humiliation, josh is probably being a right old jerk to anna, even though she has been a perfect angel in the media.  she seems to be super deferential to him, so i bet she's just kind of taking his sour personality to try to protect her children.  she'll keep pumping out his babies and doing what she originally promised to do for that dude, and he'll keep being a smarmy weirdo.  josh clearly loves working in politics, and as soon as he can, he'll probably try to worm his way back into a lobbyist job, even if only in little rock.  **jana:** while many people say they don't think she lives in the main duggar house, i think she does.  she's a pretty integral part of raising all those younger kids now that the older girls are gone.  she has that big garden on their property, and she'd have to be spending a lot of time back at the house to care for that, too.  i think i saw a blueprint of the duggar house somewhere that included a guest bedroom, and i wouldn't be surprised to learn that jana has been given her own room because it's ridiculous that a 27-year-old woman has to share a room with girls between 7 and 11 years old.  i think we'll see her married before 30 because, in duggar years, it's getting a bit ridiculous for her to be unmarried.  i think she will go for a tlc wedding, but choose to shy away from cameras in her married life.  **john david:** probably doesn't live at home, seems to be building up a set of very profitable businesses, and seems to be an all-around actually good guy.  i think he'll eventually find an equally humble and industrious wife, and while they may have a tlc wedding, they won't feature very heavily on the show by choice.  **dillards:** i think something terrible happened with jill's most recent birth, and while it may not be as extreme as an emergency hysterectomy, i think it broke something inside of her.  she's grown up being promised that good things in life are blessings for being very devout, and it's got to be crushing to her to have her ultimate desire (a million babies all born at home) unfulfilled.  i don't think motherhood is quite what she expected, and i don't think she's especially happy- not that she could or would ever express such a thing.  derick is going to try to expand his devoutman brand by being annoying on twitter until tlc totally shuts them out of the show and they have to unwillingly slink into obscurity.  derick won't allow jill what she needs to get her mind right and she'll sink into depression as she goes unfulfilled.  expect more instagram pictures of bible verses and volunteer work at a church.  **seewalds:** ben is growing into a decent dude- not the brightest bulb, but clearly working hard and he loves his family.  he'll probably land some youth pastor job somewhere, perhaps specifically looking to be near the vuolos, perhaps with jeremy's help.  jessa will pump the tlc appearances for every dollar they are worth because she's not stupid.  i think that she'll have one more baby before jinger explains how birth control works, and then the babies will stop for a while, they will eventually adopt.  they caught some early flack because she's stuck up and he seems dim, but i think that they are growing up together and will be fine.  **vuolos:** jeremy is clearly doing some kind of rescue mission with jinger, and teaching her how to be a proper adult.  she is still the stay-at-home-wife (and future mother), but she's going to be opened up to reading and thinking because jeremy clearly doesn't desire a wife like anna or jill.  after more than a year of marriage, they will start making some babies, but they will likely be spaced out and there won't be a billion of them.  they probably will go to real school, and while they will make occasional tv appearances, they aren't going to be a regular feature the way the seewalds probably will.  **joe/kendra:** they are gonna pump out babies and take the place of the vuolos on counting on as regulars.  eventually, her ""bubbly"" personality is going to annoy everyone and make us long for more of jessa's side-eyes.  neither of these people is that compelling, so it will be more of the duggar brand ""watching paint dry"" boring.  **josiah:** he'll eventually court again, if not marjorie, someone very similar.  he's just too interesting and outgoing as a person to want to be with someone with a personality like wallpaper paste.  he can make 100 kids, and everyone will continue to speculate that he is secretly gay, and his choice of somewhat modern wife will do nothing to stop the rumors.  **forsyths:** upon marriage, austin seems to be the most mature husband aside from jeremy.  he clearly loves joy and wants to be a father.  he will provide for her and actually make her happy, because he will work to instill a little more confidence and independence in joy.  they will have a large family, but only as large as he can reasonably support because he's not an idiot.  i think that as he gets more screen time, he'll become a more popular son-in-law, but they will want to step out of the spotlight so that they can more responsibly raise their children.  **jedidiah, jeremiah, jason, james, justin, jackson:** honestly, i can't even tell these ones apart.  i expect more alert stuff, going into trades/jobs/small business ownership that doesn't require higher education.  maybe one will break out, but i feel like jimbob and michelle think that things went wrong for josh because he went to the big city with the fancy people, and they will actively try to prevent their younger sons from leaving the immediate area.  i would speculate on how well that turns out if i could even differentiate these kids from one another, but i can't.  i don't see the tv franchise existing long enough to support any of these guys by the time they are ready to marry, but who knows.  **johannah, jennifer, jordyn, josie:** these girls are going to have a radically different childhood than their older sisters.  they don't have a ton of younger siblings to care for, and while they will inevitably get farmed out to babysit cousins, that's different from the sister-momming the oldest 5 did.  jimbob and michelle are going to be 65/66 by the time that josie is 20, and all but checked out from parenthood, really.  the girls will probably have more freedoms, as is common among youngest siblings, and perhaps even more opportunities.  if any of the girls end up in a real college, it's going to be one of these girls.  **tyler:** he counts, now.  he'll get to 18 and either leave, try to fall back on his mother for support, or he'll go the way of the other duggar boys.  it's too early to tell, but he has potential

545146,"&gt;but, going to your point, yes i may have overstated my case. there are organs early on. but brain development is another issue altogether. and i have a hard time believing that a six-week old fetus has enough of a brain to have anything approaching consciousness.  i agree with you.  &gt;and i can at least understand those who oppose later-term abortions,   that's where the complicated part comes into play.  i think we both agree that 6 weeks, even with a heartbeat, is probably not conscious or even ""human.""  but if we decide that there is any point before birth that the baby has become human or conscious, when and how do we draw that line.  i have relatives who had an extremely premature baby.  that baby is a 9 year old boy now. it makes it very hard to decide when abortion is a reasonable option and when it is simply killing a baby.  &gt;but it is not at all an exaggeration to say that most anti-abortion activists believe that aborting a two-week old embryo is the same as murdering a child after birth.   i agree with you again, but i would counter that it is not an exaggeration to say that far to many ""women"" who get abortions are using it as lazy, after-the-fact birth control.  the pro-abortion side loves to cite theoretical cases where the mother was raped or the mother would die if she didn't get the abortion, but the reality is that 90%+ of abortions are performed on irresponsible people who didn't take advantage of birth control for various reasons.  i believe, that since we do not know when life begins, it is shameful that we take the chance that we might be killing unborn children simply because we cannot be inconvenienced to use birth control.  &gt;i'm sorry, but that's fucking insane. it falls entirely under the ""scientifically challenged fundie idiot"" brush.   i disagree.  it is a difference of opinion.  you and i don't think that a 2 week old fetus is deserving of protection, but we don't have a clear answer of where to draw the line.  so how is our surety that 2 weeks is not human life any more valid than their belief that conception defines human life?  we just don't know, so it is anyone's guess.  &gt;these are the people i take real issue with. even if they're not firebombing clinics, or condoning the firebombing of clinics, they're spreading idiotic, irrational garbage that incites their more unstable opponents to such acts.  i try to be tolerant of other opinions on the subject.  i do take issue with their actions (aka - firebombing clinics and shooting doctors) but i do not take issue with their differing opinion on when human life begins.  &gt;and, going back to my original point, i wasn't suggesting that the non-abortion services that pp provides is enough to counter any opposition to their abortions. of course it isn't. but pointing it out is one part of the battle, because getting pp characterized in the public mind as nothing more than an ""abortion clinic"" is a major propaganda victory for those who want to convince the reasonable and undecided that pp is staffed by a gang of child-murdering monsters.  again, i mention the serial killer analogy. to the people bombing these clinics, these doctors are serial killers that specialize in killing unborn infants. nothing positive that these doctors may do outweighs that and nothing positive that these doctors do will change them from being abortionists to the people who believe so strongly against abortion.  it makes logical sense if you buy the basic premise that abortion is killing innocent, unborn human beings.  that is the point i am trying to make.  within the framework of their (not scientifically disprovable) belief system, their actions make logical sense and are understandable.",0,,

812949,"##the herd immunity illusion and other scary scenarios  perhaps the most oft-cited truism among those who unequivocally defend the current vaccine program is the notion of ‚Äúherd immunity.‚Äù the idea is that if a large enough percentage of the population is immunized against a certain disease, then epidemics can be prevented.   originally, it was suggested that 60-70% of the population needed to be immunized to reach those goals...today some claim that 95-100% immunization is needed.  there is a very strong, and rarely mentioned, case against the perceived state of ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù in the population today. the mistake lies in the assumption that high percentages of the population are *still* immune to diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, etc.  &gt;the problem with this is that most of the protection afforded by these childhood vaccines waned many decades ago, so that most baby boomers, the largest percentage of the population, have *no* protection. in fact, vaccines for most americans declined to non-protective levels within 5 to 10 years of the vaccines.  &gt;*this means that for a majority of americans, as well as others in the developed world, herd immunity doesn't exist and hasn't for over 60 years.*   the media and vaccine enthusiasts would have us believe otherwise, like claiming that as many as 40,000 people die from the ‚Äúflu‚Äù every year, despite this claim being completely unsupported by the data.  in fact, peter doshi, ph.d., a johns hopkins scientist, recently issued a [blistering report](http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6770), claiming that only a small portion of those diagnosed with the ‚Äúflu‚Äù *actually* have the influenza virus present.  &gt;promoting influenza vaccines is one of the most visible and aggressive public health policies in the united states, [says doshi](http://www.newsmaxhealth.com/headline/influenza-virus-flu-vaccine-peter-doshi-ph-d-/2013/05/16/id/504942/) of the johns hopkins school of medicine. drug companies and public officials press for widespread vaccination each fall, offering vaccinations in drugstores and supermarkets.   &gt;the results have been phenomenal. only 20 years ago, 32 million doses of influenza vaccine were available in the united states on an annual basis. today, the total has skyrocketed to 135 million doses. mandatory vaccination polices have been enacted, often in healthcare facilities, forcing some people to take the vaccine under threat of losing their jobs.   according to doshi, ‚Äúthe vaccine may be less beneficial and less safe than has been claimed, and the threat of influenza seems to be overstated. for most people, and possibly most doctors, officials need only claim that vaccines save lives, and it is assumed there must be solid research behind it.‚Äù that's not the case, he says.  &gt;although the cdc implies that flu vaccines are safe and there's no need to weigh benefits against risk, doshi disagrees. he points to [an australian study](http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2994) that found 1 in every 110 children under the age of 5 had convulsions following vaccinations in 2009 for h1n1 influenza. additional investigations found that the h1n1 vaccine was also associated with a spike in cases of narcolepsy among adolescents.  hopefully, the latest [tamiflu](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/guardian/pix/pictures/2014/4/10/1397164137582/ben-jennings-11.04.2014-003.jpg) debacle will help reignite this crucial conversation.  another method of the pro-vaccine scare campaign is to evoke mortality rates in the thousands or millions from previous eras or third world nations.   &gt;if they send out warnings through the media that tens of thousands of infants may die of measles if children (and adults) are not vaccinated each year, it has a major impact on parental decisions to vaccinate.  one of the most common themes among proponents of the flu vaccine is that everything must be done to prevent the 1917-1918 flu epidemic that killed millions.   however, [recent research](http://phys.org/news173715307.html) raises serious doubts about blaming a ‚Äúwild‚Äù strain of the influenza virus for the extraordinary number of deaths. evidence suggests it was none other than bayer's indefatigable promotion of aspirin that may have been largely responsible.  &gt;the hypothesis...is that aspirin contributed to the incidence and severity of viral pathology, bacterial infection, and death, because physicians of the day were unaware that the regimens (8.0‚Äì31.2 g per day) produce levels associated with hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in 33% and 3% of recipients, respectively.  before the mortality rate spiked, bayer embarked on an aggressive ad campaign to promote their new product. furthermore, autopsy reports from 1918 are consistent with what we know today about the dangers of aspirin toxicity.  &gt;the motivation behind the improper use of aspirin is a cautionary tale, said author karen starko, md. in 1918, physicians did not fully understand either the dosing or pharmacology of aspirin, yet they were willing to recommend it. its use was promoted by the drug industry, endorsed by doctors wanting to ‚Äúdo something,‚Äù and accepted by families and institutions desperate for hope.   another terrifying epidemic in american history was the [1916 polio outbreak](http://htmlimg3.scribdassets.com/8425i20p4w258wzf/images/9-7e65fb9cad.jpg) that killed at least 5,000 people. as can be seen by this graph, the 1916 death rate from polio was extremely anomalous, and was one of the many events that inspired the push to develop a polio vaccine when rates began rising again in the 1940s and 50s.   although originally blamed on ‚Äúitalian immigrants,‚Äù this explanation is beginning to be seriously called into question. [a study](http://www.benthamscience.com/open/tovacj/articles/v004/13tovacj.pdf) was published by h.v. wyatt in 2011 that suggests a much more sinister explanation for the outbreak:  &gt;previous accounts of the 1916 devastating epidemic have been faulty. the unique features of the epidemic and its sudden appearance have never been explained.  &gt;three miles from the epicenter of the outbreak, simon flexner and his associates at the rockefeller institute at 63rd street and york avenue, near queensborough bridge on manhattan island, had been passaging spinal cord tissue containing poliovirus, from one rhesus monkey spinal cord to another.   &gt;i propose that highly virulent virus escaped and caused the epidemic. scientists, technical and animal house staff were unaware that they could be infected by poliovirus which could then infect others.  it seems it would be premature to completely dismiss this hypothesis, especially since an extremely virulent multi-virus (mv) strain of polio was being experimented on within walking distance of the worst polio outbreak in half a century. mortality rates reached 25% among those afflicted, compared to the usual mortality rate of less than 1%.  these past events and their ‚Äúofficial‚Äù explanations are extremely important to reanalyze, because they could potentially be used to mislead the public.",1,,-1

531066,"there are a couple of things. first, there aren't that many babies/toddlers available in foster care. you may think a person who wants a baby is a jerk in some way but really, it helps very much to start the parent-child relationship earlier. for both the parent and child. you need the intense lifelong bond and it is honestly a more sure thing if the child you adopt is young.  in the u.s., the parents have rights, there is open adoption and you have your birth child's family to deal with for life. this can be daunting to some people.  the u.s. parents can take the child back after a long period of bonding and it is heartbreaking.  people perceive that kids in poor countries have greater need. for one thing, they may die without adoption. they have zero options as opposed to few options.  i don't see any difference--i am not a nationalist. i never say 'why not help americans? when the u.s. every gives aid to another country (often the aid is not that helpful). if you take an internationalist/cosmopolitan perspective the fact a child is american doesn't create some special obligation to that child that a guatemalan or ethiopian child lacks.   i mean, i want to save haitian children as much as i want to save any children. it is immaterial if the child is american.  i give this list of reasons to show that people have various reasons for adoption. it's not charity. it is a personal choice. as long as kids need to be adopted, i cannot see why people cannot pick what they are most comfortable with and what fits their family better. you have to do that, in a way--you have to have fundamentally the same kind of selfishness as a parent who is giving birth--because you are creating a lifelong tie to someone that must never be broken.   i'm very much up in the air about it. i am starting to get ready to adopt but i don't know from where. the idea that someone might change his/her mind and i would lose the child i have started to love is totally terrifying. if anything keeps from wanting to adopt, it is that. but i totally support a parent's right to do this!!! it is just whether i can prepare myself for this. how the hell would i? i think about this alot.  and i freely admit the open adoption part is daunting to me, simply because i have a lot of relatives with issues and i'm not a genius at creating boundaries. and it's such a wild card. i may have to deal with mother, father, grandmas, grandpas, etc. but somehow also be a parent. a whole 'nother family i may have to communicate with, create structure surrounding my kid about, etc. (whatever is in the kid's interest. open adoptions are supposed to be healthiest for the adoptee. so i will do that.)  but of course i will if i adopt here! and of course i would if i adopted from anywhere. it is somewhat easier if they don't live two blocks away, maybe? how wrong is that that i care about that? well, as long as i am a good parent to my child i do not see that anyone is justified in deciding for me what i should have done.   really, if you knew what was involved in being a parent you would not be so judgmental that people are thinking of the complexity of creating the bond and the obligation and that the background issues affect that.",1,2,

731556,"i am not anti-vaccine, but i find it amusing and also sad that people seem to think that you have to be either pro or anti vaccine.  not all vaccines are good.  you should be informed and educated on each and every one that you put in your body.  many care risks of side effects that may be higher with certain individuals.  the h1n1 vaccine was a joke. it was barely tested, not needed, and pushed by hysteria to make the companies billions.  i'm a med student and i believe that vaccinations are important. whooping cough, polio, etc.  but you need to do research before just assuming that they are all necessary and safe.   example:   hepatitis b is a viral disease associated with risky lifestyle choices such as intravenous drug use or promiscuous sex.  this virus causes a dangerous and miserable infection that can have long-lasting debilitating effects on the liver, so taking steps to prevent hepatitis b is a good idea for those at risk.  for infants, hepatitis b is an especially serious disease.  if a pregnant mother carries this virus, it is certainly important to protect her baby from the disease.  however, most normal infants are at low risk for this disease.  infant infections are typically found only in babies born to a hepatitis b-positive mother, and tests can determine who carries or is infected with the virus.  by screening the mothers, only those babies who are at risk would need to be vaccinated at birth.  perhaps any attempt at prevention would be a good bet if the vaccine were harmless, but it's not.  today there are more reports of adverse reactions from the vaccine than there are reported cases of the disease in children.  data created by the government‚Äôs vaccine adverse event reporting system (vaers) in 1996 confirm 872 serious adverse events in children under 14 years of age who had been injected with hepatitis b vaccine.  these kids were either taken to an emergency room, had life-threatening health problems, were hospitalized, or were disabled following the vaccination.  214 had the hepatitis b vaccine alone, and the rest received it in combination with other vaccines.  48 kids died after being injected with hepatitis b vaccine in 1996, and 13 of them had received the hepatitis b vaccine alone just before they died.  in contrast, in 1996 only 279 cases of hepatitis b disease were reported in children under age 14.  the world health organization only recommends infant vaccination for hepatitis b in areas where carrier prevalence is 2 percent or greater.  this does not apply to the u.s., except for certain ethnic groups in alaska.  but current u.s. health policy is based on an exaggerated perception of the prevalence of hepatitis b, and here vaccination is required for every newborn.  an argument has been made that infants are easier and cheaper to vaccinate than adolescents.  does this mean we should vaccinate all infants in order to prepare them for the day when they might become promiscuous and/or intravenous-drug-using teenagers?  beyond this insulting presumption, lawmakers also presume that the vaccination will even last long enough to protect those kids during the supposedly risky teenage years.  this amazing degree of non-science and arrogance is shaping the national health policy for our families.  policymakers based their 1991 infant hepatitis b vaccination recommendations on the assumption that the vaccinations would last fro  the story behind this policy is that the maker of hepatitis b vaccine, merck, makes almost $1 billion usd a year from this single product.  one wonders how many lawmakers this amount of money could buy.",1,-1,

 &gt;i don't know if you remark, but all this crazy shit happens always in the open free world, where sexuality is the currency  point out to me where is this ""sexuality is the currency"" bullshit pelase.  in the ""classical"" societies you point out, sex is much more open.  incidental nudity is more common, people don't lose their minds at the idea of a child swimming naked and similar things.  in these ""open minded"" countries, you are not even to speak of the sexuality of children or adolescents.  they deny it exists.  they teach their kids that abstinence is the only form of birth control and all others are useless.  i'd really like to see some examples of where you think we're ""open"" about sexuality.  do you not recall clinton firing jocelyn elders because she had the gall to recommend we teach adolescents about masturbation?  masturbation!  something every single person does and is necessary to be healthy!  there was a societal uproar here when elian gonzalez' grandmother visited from cuba and she put her hands down the boys pants to check the development of his penis.  to people in america, even seeing someone naked with no sexual context is severely taboo unless they are an airbrushed fictional non-person in a movie restricted only to people 18 and over.  &gt;and by the way, being physically able to have sex doesn't mean that you are mature enough to have sex.  correct.  it means that you're supposed to be mature enough to have sex, and if you're not, then your parents and society are to blame.  again i ask you, what evidence do you have that evolution fucked up by putting puberty where it did?  &gt;(you must admit, that never in the history did we have much of an over sexed society as today and never did wee see a catastrophic emergence of society diseases and degradation, i don't know about you but i see some correlation here)  no, i don't have to admit to any such absurd lie.  what do you even know about the history of sex sociologically?  over-sexed society?  why don't you drop by the islands of papua new guinea and hang out with the village where from age 6 to around 18, all boys and adolescents live in a common open hut in the center of the village servicing each other sexually?  and you want to know about disease, read up on the history of syphillis.  it goes back to the time of the black plague, and immediately spread to the 'new world' when the settlers arrived, then quickly spread right back into europe.  it killed millions, and was rampant because then, unlike now, people had sex much, much more often.  before 200 years ago, there was no concept of adolescence.  none.  at 13 you were an adult (witness the coming of age ceremonies in practically every culture ever except ours).  you left your family and you started your own.  we only invented the idea of adolescence and waiting until later to become sexually active because companies needed educated workers.  as for other diseases, have you noticed that we have many many more diseases now than ever before?  it's not because the diseases are new, they're not.  it's because we have names for them now.  a couple hundred years ago, people just died and no one knew why, or they didn't have a name for it, or they confused it for other causes, etc.  stds are far less common now than before.  you really need to pick up a book and read some history sometime.  you say you don't watch talkshows, but you're spitting out their words verbatim without even thinking about them.  in ancient greece, men would teach adolescent boys about sex, women would teach young girls, in the culture of the native americans they had ""fire women"" who would teach boys about sex first hand.  in every other single culture in the history of mankind except ours, adolescents were understood to be fully human, and sexuality is part of that.  &gt;and please stop making it sound as your argument is scientific borrowing some ideas here and there, you're so radical about the subject that any sane person will see the lack of objectiveness in your arguments.  i have researched these issues for years.  you're just going based off of some gut hunches and stuff you just accumulated without thinking over the years.  i think it's pretty clear you're not even trying to be objective in the least.  &gt;wtf? you mean all this billion of people not having sexual experiences until later years are sexually and emotionally underdeveloped?! i want to know your sources..  how late?  the brain loses its plasticity in the early 20s.  have you not noticed the 50+% divorce rate?  how about that 1 in 3 adults are on antidepressants?  where is your evidence that millions of people aren't emotionally underdeveloped?  &gt;i think she's probably until today traumatized about your anal experimentation, but if you are the ""she"" and anal sex at 12 was your best experiment in your life then you've got a pretty miserable life :p  i was not traumatized at all, and there was no she involved.  like many guys, i played around with another male friend of mine.  we played around a handful of times, of our own accord.  people don't repeatedly do things that are traumatizing to them.  if some asshole like you had been around to tell me, as an impressionable kid, that what i was doing was horrible and perverted and that i would like a life of misery, then yes, i would be damaged.  it is people like you that damage the young people who have early experimentation which, if you would have the balls to read anything, you will learn is very common.  edit:  oh, and please notice that my ideas are not radical.  they are as old as the species itself.  i challenge you to find a single culture before the victorian age that was even remotely as fucked up about sexuality as we are.  you won't find one.  you'll find nothing but culture after culture that embraced the human body and sexuality.  and please, also, as i gave you facts and evidence, try to do the same.  a discussion can't go anywhere if i'm giving you evidence and you're giving me nothing but blind assertions.  some random thoughts... romeo and juliet were 14 or 15, society then believed them capable of carrying a passion worth dying for.  alexander the great did most of his conquering of the world before 17.  ""the virgin mary"" was 15 when she supposedly gave birth to jesus (even if that's fiction it says a lot about the culture it was written for).  the gods of egypt, greece, and rome, were incestuous, orgiastic, gave birth to streams as rivers of their own cum, etc.  wherever you look in historic human society, sex was everywhere.  now, repression and denial is everywhere.",1,-1,

. . . --the cult of osiris contributed a number of ideas and phrases to the bible. the 23rd psalm copied an egyptian text appealing to osiris the good shepherd to lead the deceased to the ‚Äúgreen

728877,"we have come to accept the idea that environmental influences in the first three years of life have long-term consequences for cognition, emotional control, attention and the like. is it time to place a similar emphasis, with hopes for a similar outcome, on enriching the cognitive environment of people in their 20s?  n.i.m.h. scientists also found a time lag between the growth of the limbic system, where emotions originate, and of the prefrontal cortex, which manages those emotions. the limbic system explodes during puberty, but the prefrontal cortex keeps maturing for another 10 years. giedd said it is logical to suppose ‚Äî and for now, neuroscientists have to make a lot of logical suppositions ‚Äî that when the limbic system is fully active but the cortex is still being built, emotions might outweigh ration¬≠ality. ‚Äúthe prefrontal part is the part that allows you to control your impulses, come up with a long-range strategy, answer the question ‚Äòwhat am i going to do with my life?‚Äô ‚Äù he told me. ‚Äúthat weighing of the future keeps changing into the 20s and 30s.‚Äù  among study subjects who enrolled as children, m.r.i. scans have been done so far only to age 25, so scientists have to make another logical supposition about what happens to the brain in the late 20s, the 30s and beyond. is it possible that the brain just keeps changing and pruning, for years and years? ‚Äúguessing from the shape of the growth curves we have,‚Äù giedd‚Äôs colleague philip shaw wrote in an e-mail message, ‚Äúit does seem that much of the gray matter,‚Äù where synaptic pruning takes place, ‚Äúseems to have completed its most dramatic structural change‚Äù by age 25. for white matter, where insulation that helps impulses travel faster continues to form, ‚Äúit does look as if the curves are still going up, suggesting continued growth‚Äù after age 25, he wrote, though at a slower rate than before.  none of this is new, of course; the brains of young people have always been works in progress, even when we didn‚Äôt have sophisticated scanning machinery to chart it precisely. why, then, is the youthful brain only now arising as an explanation for why people in their 20s are seeming a bit unfinished? maybe there‚Äôs an analogy to be found in the hierarchy of needs, a theory put forth in the 1940s by the psychologist abraham maslow. according to maslow, people can pursue more elevated goals only after their basic needs of food, shelter and sex have been met. what if the brain has its own hierarchy of needs? when people are forced to adopt adult responsibilities early, maybe they just do what they have to do, whether or not their brains are ready. maybe it‚Äôs only now, when young people are allowed to forestall adult obligations without fear of public censure, that the rate of societal maturation can finally fall into better sync with the maturation of the brain.  cultural expectations might also reinforce the delay. the ‚Äúchanging timetable for adulthood‚Äù has, in many ways, become internalized by 20-somethings and their parents alike. today young people don‚Äôt expect to marry until their late 20s, don‚Äôt expect to start a family until their 30s, don‚Äôt expect to be on track for a rewarding career until much later than their parents were. so they make decisions about their futures that reflect this wider time horizon. many of them would not be ready to take on the trappings of adulthood any earlier even if the opportunity arose; they haven‚Äôt braced themselves for it.  nor do parents expect their children to grow up right away ‚Äî and they might not even want them to. parents might regret having themselves jumped into marriage or a career and hope for more considered choices for their children. or they might want to hold on to a reassuring connection with their children as the kids leave home. if they were ‚Äúhelicopter parents‚Äù ‚Äî a term that describes heavily invested parents who hover over their children, swooping down to take charge and solve problems at a moment‚Äôs notice ‚Äî they might keep hovering and problem-solving long past the time when their children should be solving problems on their own. this might, in a strange way, be part of what keeps their grown children in the limbo between adolescence and adulthood. it can be hard sometimes to tease out to what extent a child doesn‚Äôt quite want to grow up and to what extent a parent doesn‚Äôt quite want to let go.  it is a big deal in developmental psychology to declare the existence of a new stage of life, and arnett has devoted the past 10 years to making his case. shortly after his american psychologist article appeared in 2000, he and jennifer lynn tanner, a developmental psychologist at rutgers university, convened the first conference of what they later called the society for the study of emerging adulthood. it was held in 2003 at harvard with an attendance of 75; there have been three more since then, and last year‚Äôs conference, in atlanta, had more than 270 attendees. in 2004 arnett published a book, ‚Äúemerging adulthood: the winding road from the late teens through the twenties,‚Äù which is still in print and selling well. in 2006 he and tanner published an edited volume, ‚Äúemerging adults in america: coming of age in the 21st century,‚Äù aimed at professionals and academics. arnett‚Äôs college textbook, ‚Äúadolescence and emerging adulthood: a cultural approach,‚Äù has been in print since 2000 and is now in its fourth edition. next year he says he hopes to publish another book, this one for the parents of 20-somethings.  if all arnett‚Äôs talk about emerging adulthood sounds vaguely familiar . . . well, it should. forty years ago, an article appeared in the american scholar that declared ‚Äúa new stage of life‚Äù for the period between adolescence and young adulthood. this was 1970, when the oldest members of the baby boom generation ‚Äî the parents of today‚Äôs 20-somethings ‚Äî were 24. young people of the day ‚Äúcan‚Äôt seem to ‚Äòsettle down,‚Äô ‚Äù wrote the yale psychologist kenneth keniston. he called the new stage of life ‚Äúyouth.‚Äù  keniston‚Äôs description of ‚Äúyouth‚Äù presages arnett‚Äôs description of ‚Äúemerging adulthood‚Äù a generation later. in the late ‚Äô60s, keniston wrote that there was ‚Äúa growing minority of post-adolescents [who] have not settled the questions whose answers once defined adulthood: questions of relationship to the existing society, questions of vocation, questions of social role and lifestyle.‚Äù whereas once, such aimlessness was seen only in the ‚Äúunusually creative or unusually disturbed,‚Äù he wrote, it was becoming more common and more ordinary in the baby boomers of 1970. among the salient characteristics of ‚Äúyouth,‚Äù keniston wrote, were ‚Äúpervasive ambivalence toward self and society,‚Äù ‚Äúthe feeling of absolute freedom, of living in a world of pure possibilities‚Äù and ‚Äúthe enormous value placed upon change, transformation and movement‚Äù ‚Äî all characteristics that arnett now ascribes to ‚Äúemerging adults.‚Äù  arnett readily acknowledges his debt to keniston; he mentions him in almost everything he has written about emerging adulthood. but he considers the ‚Äô60s a unique moment, when young people were rebellious and alienated in a way they‚Äôve never been before or since. and keniston‚Äôs views never quite took off, arnett says, because ‚Äúyouth‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a very good name for it. he has called the label ‚Äúambiguous and confusing,‚Äù not nearly as catchy as his own ‚Äúemerging adulthood.‚Äù  for whatever reason keniston‚Äôs terminology faded away, it‚Äôs revealing to read his old article and hear echoes of what‚Äôs going on with kids today. he was describing the parents of today‚Äôs young people when they themselves were young ‚Äî and amazingly, they weren‚Äôt all that different from their own children now. keniston‚Äôs article seems a lovely demonstration of the eternal cycle of life, the perennial conflict between the generations, the gradual resolution of those conflicts. it‚Äôs reassuring, actually, to think of it as recursive, to imagine that there must always be a cohort of 20-somethings who take their time settling down, just as there must always be a cohort of 50-somethings who worry about it.",1,,1

if you tell them that, they'll often pop the baby out, wipe off some goop (see vernix below), then place the baby right at mom's teat.  since a lot of breastfeeding women experience cracked and bleeding nipples, mom may want to use one of these [nipple shields](http://www.amazon.com/medela-contact-nipple-shield-standard/dp/b000067pq0/).  my wife swears by them.    speaking of latching, watch videos on how to get a baby to latch.  it's not as intuitive as you would think.  i (the husband) was actually the one that got the two of them positioned right the first time.    google ""vernix"".  it's a long description, but some families swear by it and you should talk to your wife then tell your health care professionals your decision about it.   hold your baby.  this may seem like a silly thing to say, but there is a pheromone exchange that happens when men hold infants that helps us bond to them better.  women have a similar exchange when they breastfeed.  make it a point to hold your baby for at least twenty minutes a day.  if you're playing minecraft, keep your little one tucked into the crook of your arm as you do so.  the effect is pretty astonishing.    try to keep things to as much of a routine as possible.  children do very well when things are structured for them.  try to wake the baby up at the same time every day.  try to have feedings at regular times.  try to go to bed at the same time.  etc.  the operative word here is ""try"", but make a genuine effort.  we made a concerted effort with our second child and she didn't cry at night hardly at all after about six weeks of life.  it was bliss compared to our first.   remember that everything is going to be new to your little one.  even the sensation of a soft blanket will be new and potentially frightening.  she'll probably cry at everything.  it's normal.  try to make as few changes as possible for her until she gets adjusted to not being in such a tight, warm, wet place.    another important item: your wife may feel like she's a terrible mother because some things just don't come to her automagically.  constantly reassure her that she's doing a good job.  i've read studies that indicate a large part of the depression brought on by post-partum stress can be alleviated by constant reassurance from the social support structures she has around her.  remember, this is her first time, too (presumably), and we don't live in the same kind of farm-centric collective we used to, so her circle of friends may be less than helpful.  don't be afraid to ask questions.  it's a cliche that babies don't come with manuals precisely because it's so true.  don't expect to know everything and don't hesitate to ask questions.  the only stupid question where your offsprings' health is concerned is the question that didn't get asked.   get a ""go bag"" ready before her third trimester begins.  leave a checklist on the back of your door.  the ""go bag"" should have a few diapers and wipes, her nipple shields if necessary, a bottle of water, a few snack bars, a very soft blanket (swaddling blanket if you can get one), warm newborn clothes with footies, hand covers like [these](http://www.amazon.com/green-sprouts-organic-cotton-bamboo/dp/b004lz5ljk/) (babies often scratch themselves on the faces in the first few days of life), a change of clothes for you (just in case, not really necessary, probably) and a list of important phone numbers (more of a reminder of *who* the important people are than their numbers).  your checklist should have all the important things you need to do before you leave the house, like turn off electronics and lights, pack up the ""go bag"", call someone to watch the dogs, take your phone and camera chargers, call the hospital before you leave so they can have the birthing team/center ready, etc.   have the hospital's delivery department on speed dial.  you don't have to rush there first thing when her water breaks (most women have about an hour and a half from their water breaking to the beginning of labor), but you want to give the hospital as much lead time as possible to prepare for her arrival.    ***most important!!!*** do not let anyone overrule your wife's decisions without a damn good reason.  remember that this is all happening to *her*.  you're involved, of course, but it's *her body*!  that means that she calls the shots.  you wouldn't take her in to get a tattoo of a butterfly and let the tattoo artist insist on a dandelion, would you?  it's the same kind of situation, but so much more pressure will be on her because, c'mon!, these are *health care professionals* we're talking about.  make sure you both understand what you want from the birthing process and make sure your doctor understands that, too.  try to make the big decisions beforehand; epidural? c-section? water birth? doula? midwife? clinic or hospital?  also be aware that there may be complications that make your choices unfeasible or untenable and you may have to adapt to the situation on the ground, as it were.  but don't let anyone pressure your wife into something she doesn't want unless there is a clear health risk; make sure that the health risk is clearly explained in terms you can understand.  (call your hcp on his/her shit if they start using big ass, high-falutin' words just to get you to agree.)  it is your job as the husband to be the clearheaded, brave defender of your wife in her time of need.  this is your sacred duty.  plus, you're the one that put her in all that pain, the least you could do is make sure she suffers the way she wants to! ;)   i swear i didn't set out to write a novella, but i apparently have done so.  please feel free to ask me anything if any of this is unclear.  also, bear in mind that i am not the god of all newborns!! and it is totally within your prerogative to disagree.  all of this is just one man's advice and does not constitute professional medical guidance.  (that's the fine print.)  seriously, though, don't sweat it.  kids are great.  you're likely to screw up.  it happens.  just cover it up as best you can and move on.  good luck!",1,2,

366790,"i can't tell if you are asking me, or twilightsun. but the answer is ""sort of common"". there are nuances to sibling experimentation.   as children grow (before they reach puberty)  they become (naturally) curious about their bodies; how they function, what they look like, what other people's bodies look like in comparison to their own. sometimes pre-pubescent children will even discover sexual excitement (totally by accident) and masturbate without any sort of prompting or sexual trauma.  for instance: a friend of mine called me panicked one day, because her toddler was rubbing her crotch and grunting in the car (basically early attempts at masturbation.) after some questioning and observation, it became apparent that the strap of her car seat buckle was vibrating against the toddler during drives, and she liked it and began trying to re-create the feeling. no abuse or sexual dysfunction appeared to have taken place, just a kid who discovered her body early and needed a conversation about keeping her hands to herself when outside of her bedroom. this is totally normal, and completely okay. you may need to have a talk with a curious kid about privacy, but it's not necessarily indicative of victimization or future abuse.   another scenario i have encountered a million times is the ""doctor"" scenario. not every kid engages in it, and most children don't past the age of like 7 or 8 (unless the kid is very socially immature.) again, there is nothing to worry about provided both children are willing participants. all a parent needs to do is have a conversation about privacy, personal space and keeping you hands to yourself. that also should be a clue to parents that they should explain anatomy to their kids as an open, age-appropriate way to inform them rather than squelch their curiosity or shame them.   something less common, but still not always a ""red flag"" for abuse is teenaged or pre-teen siblings experimenting (with consent) on one another sexually. this warrants therapy for sure, because it can signal other areas of emotional immaturity. but it doesn't mean that the two of them are going to wind up predators or victims.   so those are the three most common scenarios i have seen that aren't (usually) abuse-related.   interaction that says ""abuse"" to me professionally looks a lot different than the scenarios described above. in order for me to consider sibling-on-sibling sexual interaction ""abuse"", one or more of a few things have to be happening:  -an extreme age difference between the two children (ex: a teenager fondling 8 year old. an 8 year old folding a baby.) this is abuse regardless of if the younger child ""consents"".   -an extreme imbalance of maturity. (ex: two 10 year olds, but one is profoundly cognitively disabled.) again, consent is irrelevant because imbalances of power/maturity make consent too difficult to establish.   -the methodology matters. (ex: a 6 year old who pokes her 4 year old brother's penis in the bathtub because it looks funny is not predatory. inappropriate, and needs redirected. but not predatory. if that same six year old penetrated her brother's rectum in the bathtub with an object? that *could* be predatory in nature, and possibly a learned behavior. a teenager groping his teen sisters breasts while she sleeps? predatory. the same teenager ""snapping"" his sister's bra may just be inappropriate and immature, he needs correction.)  -the behavior displayed before, during and after the sexual incidents matter too. sneaking into your siblings room while they sleep or are otherwise incapacitated to experiment on their bodies is predatory, and concerning. repeated incidents after correcting an inappropriate behavior is a red flag. blaming the recipient/victim after being called out is a red flag. other behavioral issues simultaneously occurring are a red flag (grades dropping, drug use, crappy mood, nightmares, incontinence, etc).   -any time a child forces another child into a sexual act (pins them down, coerces them verbally, threatens them with secrets) is concerning. no matter what the age of the kids are.   so to answer your question, yes. it's fairly common for minors to experiment with one another. most of the time, it's completely innocent and just requires that the parents/guardians explain things like privacy, anatomy, personal space and appropriateness.   there are other times though, where it is less innocent (maybe indicative of some sort of mental health issue, or developmental issue). or where it's even deliberately predatory.   that's why it is so important that parents seek the advice and help of a psychologist when something like the josh duggar thing happens. there are a bunch of factors at hand for sibling-on-sibling sexual behavior. a doctor who is removed from the situation, and who has been trained to interview kids about stuff like this, can tell you more about what is developmentally appropriate, and what isn't.   *edit* i have people messaging me asking me about their kids. it needs to be clear that this is not an abuse ""checklist"". if you have concerns about sexual behavior between your children, you need to call a doctor who can observe your kids and talk to them personally. i can't diagnose your kids as sexually maladaptive or deviant over the internet, and anyone who claims they can are nutcases.   the only people who can do that are trained professionals who have developed a relationship with your kids and can see the whole picture. if you can't afford mental health care for your kids and you are worried, seriously, call your doctor or even child protective services and ask what's available for low-income families in crisis. this may start a case with cps, and that can get messy and upsetting. but it's better than doing nothing at all. cps doesn't just exist to ""take your kids away"". they can also provide counseling and evaluations for kids with emotional, behavioral or mental health problems.",1,1,

437784,"here's my story.  super long and ranty, but i would like to get it out.  i was one of those little girls who always preferred legos and science kits to baby dolls and dresses, and i was going to have my own career and house and all that. i had lots of conflicting influences in my life.  my mom has always been a lesbian and a sort of man-hating feminist, but got pregnant in high school to try to stave off rumors and her mother's catholic wrath.  she joined the army and left me with my grandmother, probably to get the hell away from her, for which i don't blame my mom.  no dad; nobody in my family will give me a straight answer about him, all i know is that he left before i was born and has never tried to contact me.  my great grandfather was the closest thing to a father figure i ever had, and he passed when i was 18.  his wife, my great-grandma, is very trad &amp; old-fashioned, and constantly fought with my grandmother (her daughter), who refused to let me wear dresses or makeup and proudly called me a tomboy, over letting me 'be a girl'; however when i turned 14 my grandmother began berating me for not having a boyfriend (in middle school, no less) and saying that i'd never 'get myself a man'.  she abused me physically &amp; emotionally from my earliest memory until she kicked me out at 18, and stalked &amp; harassed me until i moved out of the city.  she even went so far as to ground me for a month (no phone/internet/tv, i couldn't leave the house except for school and church by default) when i was 15 because i stopped talking to a guy at my school who told me plainly that he was only interested in having sex with me.  she called me a prude and a bitch and would drive across town to bring him over to my house, then punish me further for locking myself in my room and refusing to talk with him.  this happened three or four times, until one day she dragged me out of my room to berate me again for not 'being nice' to him, and i was finally so fed up i said ""if you like him so much, you can sleep with him.""  she threw some knitting needles at my head and beat me for a while, but at least she never brought him over again.  a large part of my refusal to 'settle down' and pop out brats is rebellion against this woman and her 'values', and my aversion to 'family' as it was defined by my childhood.  another formative experience happened when i was about 12.  my uncle found out that a girl he'd taken home from the bar wasn't actually on the pill as she'd said, and he ended up with *twins*.  when they were a few weeks old she left the state, citing post-partum depression (but really he just refused to marry her).  he was a truck driver, so my grandmother 'volunteered' to take the babies.  she decided after the first night that the twins were left with us that she couldn't take care of them, citing her physical disabilities (which didn't bother her other times) and that she was 'too old for this'.  for over a year, from the moment i got home from school until i left the next morning, i was the mother to these two squalling, colicky babies, on top of school &amp; my regular chores.  diapers, feeding, burping, washing, cleaning up their shit/vomit--all that stuff throughout the night, every two hours since they didn't wake at the same time.  my grandmother removed me from all my extra-curricular programs so i could be home exactly at 3:45 to take over, and i still got beaten when i began to fail classes due to lack of time to sleep and do homework.  this went on until the mother decided to come back and 'claim' her kids.  by then, i had decided i wanted nothing to do with children ever again.   fast forward to 18: i had gotten a job and apartment while in college, and a month to the day that i secretly got my key, my grandma kicked me out of her house (best day of my life).  i met a programmer who worked with my boss and we started dating; a week in he told me he had a kid from a previous relationship.  i decided i wasn't going to hold it against him, and that led to a three-year relationship where i was left responsible for his child while he went to 'band practice' and partied.  i know it's totally my fault for enabling him but at the time i was looking out for the child because i try never to blame the kids in situations like this.  while i had to bathe, feed, clothe, and entertain his rather loud, spoiled child and keep him out of trouble, i was never allowed to discipline him, raise my voice or get irritated with him; his family would constantly complain that i got frustrated too easily (the bf's mother told him once to dump me, in front of me but in spanish not knowing i understood, because the boy had kicked me in the abdomen during my period and i picked him up and gave him a firm but not angry ""no"").  i got a lot of 'what's gonna happen when you two have your own kids?  you can't be mean to them like that' from his sisters and mother.   i eventually left when i discovered the guy was cheating on me, but still felt obligated to take the time to sit his four-year-old down when he asked why i was leaving ('dad and i don't get along anymore') and he cried and told me not to go.   i'm told i am a very caring, nurturing person and would make a great mother, but any maternal instinct i have has pretty much been drained from me by those experiences.  i only know half of my family medical history, and that alone is rife with hereditary heart, bone, blood, and mental disorders; i think it's just irresponsible for me to pass that on to another living being.  i also agree with the stance that with so many unwanted, abandoned children floating through 'the system' that if i ever want a child, i should adopt instead (but i don't see that happening).  working in a nonprofit animal shelter has further cemented my advocacy for adoption in general.     i've also been struggling to get my life straight since i was kicked out, and have never been in a stable enough emotional or financial state to properly care for a helpless human being-- and by the time i get out of debt and get myself a house and a degree, i'm going to want a fucking vacation, not the permanent responsibility of a little half-me running around bleeding on things.     besides all this, i just don't *like* kids.  i like quiet and solitude.  i like not owning a lot of things, including a tv.  i like alcohol and spicy foods, and sharp chef's knives and my loud, heavy stand mixer that i use to cook meals for my boyfriend and myself.  i like my living space to be clean, unless i've got my art supplies (more sharp and poisonous things) strewn about a floor or table.  i like my cat and being able to clean her littlerbox myself (maybe not so much, but you get my meaning).  i like being able to pack up and take a road trip, stay out till four am or go to bed at nine pm, depending on how i feel that day.  i like tabletop nights with my amazing boyfriend (who also doesn't want kids for many similar reasons, so there is a happy ending to my story!) and all the tiny, choking-hazard pieces.  i like hanging out with my best friend who is studying to be a herpetologist and has a collection of beautiful, poisonous snakes and lizards.  having a child would pretty much put my entire lifestyle, which i have worked so hard the last seven years for, to the torch.  no thank you.  some people are born to be parents, love their kids, and are doing a fantastic job.  i applaud them.  but i realize that i am not and never will be one of those people, so while people have called me selfish and immature, i think it's the most mature and responsible decision i can make to not bring an unwanted child into the world, despite societal pressures.  i adore animals, and i'd love to have amy own little herd of pembroke corgis at some point, so my default response to any question about kids is ""if i want to hear the pitter-patter of little feet, i'll put shoes on my cat.""   tl;dr: i was forced into raising two infants, raised another from infant to toddler due to my own stupid choices in boyfriends.  bad childhood, health problems, realize i'm too selfish and financially unstable for kids; figure if my biological clock ever goes off i'll smash it with a hammer and adopt another corgi.",1,-1,-1

244372,"since i am a pro-life atheist, i will attempt to respond from a non-religious perspective.  &gt;what do you consider a baby? at what point does the fetus become ""human enough""?   this is the question, and it is often left unaddressed by both sides. clearly it is neither at the moment of conception, nor at the moment of birth. yet the discussion revolves around these arbitrary and unhelpful points.  personally, i would say the most appropriate, biology and ethics based point to cut off abortion would be after the 7th week of gestation. around this point the brainstem forms and breathing begins. prior to this we have nothing more than a mass of human cells, after we have a unique human lifeform.  &gt;the cute little models that anti-aboritionists have displayed are usually not entirely accurate. in fact, if you saw a fetus in real life, you'd probably run screaming out of the room, or accidentally step on it because it's so tiny.  cuteness is entirely subjective and shouldn't be discussed by either side. it is a meaningless metric.  &gt;many people say that the woman can just have the baby then give it up for adoption. there are several problems with this, the first being that our adoption system is pretty horrible (and i've been there). the kids who come out of it unscarred are the vast minority.  it would not be considered ethical to kill children up for adoptions, so this cannot be used as a justification for abortion. after the point a human is formed, life is better than non-life. that has to be the limit for any discussion on abortion, otherwise we open the discussion to a much broader topic of when murder is ethical.  &gt;not enough research has been done on the topic, but in my personal experience i've seen that many women feel guilty after giving birth, and decide to keep the baby. this ends up being detrimental for both, as the woman is usually not prepared to care for a child.  this is an anecdote, and should not be a basis for anyone's position, but i will respond to the broader implications. again, the detriment of the child's life is not relevant once we've crossed the human-threshhold. otherwise killing of infants and toddlers with a poor quality of life is on the table. yes, maybe not existing *would* be better, but it is the right of the child to make that decision, and no one else.  this is the ultimate end of the libertarianism pro-choice people claim to support. who has the right to determine if an individual lives or dies? surely the purist libertarian would say, only the individual themself has that right.  &gt;also, what about the 9 months of her life that the woman gives up? she has to pay for her healthcare, buy clothes and deal with an increased budget overall. if she's lucky, she'll have someone to help her during this time, because there is very little gov/stat support for these women. if she's a student, she may have to drop out of school. and of course there's the social stigma (many will blame the woman for not wearing a condom - even if they did use birth control) and guilt, which many women continue to deal with for the rest of their lives.  this is the ultimate hedonist defense of abortion. i certainly hope it isn't convicing to many. simply put: yes, sometimes you must face the consequences of your actions. murdering another person is never justified no matter how socially and financially ""inconvenient"" they are.  &gt;the main issue is that there is a clear line when a person becomes a person.  yes, that is truly the **only** issue. everything else (from either anti-abortionists or pro-choicers) is pandering.  &gt;many people would comment that life (and thus, humanity) begins at conception, but that idea is simply wrong. miscarriages are essentially a natural means of abortion. if nature is creating this circumstance, it certainly says something.  nature entails eventual death for all life. i'm not sure what you think you are saying here, but clearly all humans eventually die, naturally or not. what you are implying is that murder should be ethical because eventually you'd die anyway.  &gt;those are the main points as i see them. hope it helps you come to a decision or at least a better understanding.  sorry if i seemed to be attacking you on this. it frustrates me that many atheists have decided that abortion is justified simply because christians are against it.",1,1,
358524,"you're conflating when i allow things can happen (and do at some place in the universe) with when things must inevitably happen. you'll have to explain better that entire first sequence of logic where you think i am contradicting myself. you should re-read it more carefully, because allowing that something can happen, and that something must happen are different things, and that difference influences causal relationships. additionally, there are elements that are from completely different arguments, like an abstract appeal to ideals of causality from hume, which is a totally different point ie even if x, y, z, were true you still can't use the word cause because you can't prove causality external to your subjective interpretation.  as a general aside, i'm not saying in a practical lay sense that having sex isn't part of the mechanism of what leads to pregnancy, teen or otherwise, but rather i'm saying that you cannot raise it to the level of it bearing a significant portion of the ""cause"" of pregnancy. you used a term like direct cause, when its completely unsupportable.  i understand you suck at arguing, but jumping from one tactic to another does not mean a direct contradiction, and i see none in that first series of quotations.  similar with the second series of quotations: &gt;. but then you say that failure to use adequate contraception when having sex results in teen pregnancy.  no, i said results in teen mothers, not pregnancy. the causal chain to simply the pregnancy is different and cannot be established because of the randomness involved (the 1 in 5 chance of it occurring at peak ovulation). the reason the failure of contraception and other things lead to teen motherhood and even pregnancy, is because these have a direct causal relationship with little to no statistical randomness.  once again, stop changing words. when you change a word from teenage mothers to pregnancies it changes the meaning. you don't seem to realize this because your entire rest of your paragraph continues to use a word i didn't use in that specific paragraph. i may have been a little sloppy at a point or two, and i'm happy to clarify if confusing, but you're using the shift in wording to further your argument which is intellectual dishonest.  also, you are fundamentally misunderstanding the word ""cause."" sex can lead to pregnancy, but it also cannot ‚Äî so it cannot be deemed the cause. failing to abort a pregnancy virtually certainly leads to teen motherhood (ignoring rare accidents), so it can be deemed a cause. you cannot make the statement ""teenage sex leads causes teenage pregnancy"" without further clarification of what you mean.  &gt;if, as you say, a woman's chances of conception are truly that small, then why does anyone bother with birth control? and how do so many people manage to get pregnant with so little effort....are there truly that many lucky people in the world who overcome the odds that are, as you claim, so set against them?  actually, most people don't overcome it so easily ‚Äî they have to have unprotected sex several times around peak ovulation. this is why when trying to have a baby, a couple has a lot of sex frequently. are you really suggesting that pre-birth control (which was god knows when, given that birth control methodologies have been around for several thousand years) a woman who had 9 children only had sex 9 times in her life? sure, some women are more fertile, some are less, but its not quite as easy to get pregnant as you like to make it out. i'm also not sure what this paragraph has to do with anything.  &gt;there is no need to build a dam in a body of water that is sitting still, and there is no need to stop pregnancies if pregnancies won't occur as a result of the activity you're engaging in.  you missed the analogy.  &gt;yes, there would, because you cannot have an abortion if you are not pregnant.  oh blah blah you know what i meant ‚Äî people would immediately have medical abortions ‚Äî there would be no late stage teen pregnancies (ie the visible sense) and no teen motherhood except for the very few who really wanted babies for some reason.  &gt;so you admit that there is a child involved, yet you advocate its death. why?  yes, because after its carried to term, it is now more recognizably a child. learn how to fucking read.   &gt;furthermore, being a single mother is a far cry from nazis piling emaciated jews into those wretched gas chambers...  again, learn how to read ‚Äî it is a prolifer that is a nazi, not the single mother ‚Äî i indicated that when i said ""anyone who espouses the view that a woman should be forced"" which is another way of saying pro-life.  &gt;asking someone to take responsibility for a child they created is not in any way the same as murder.  yes it is, it is complete and irrevocable violation of their civil rights. it worse, because the person doesn't die quickly, they have their rights violated for a long period of time.  &gt;but terminating the life of an unborn child is....what, not despicable or sociopathic or selfish or grotesque?   again, learn how to use words the term ""unborn child"" is meaningless and nonexistent. a child has to have been born, so i really don't know what you're talking about. terminating an entity in-utero is like removing a tumor or similar. it just has to be done. please cite sources if you're going to make the argument that a fetus is child-like from near conception. my understanding from my neuropsychology studies at the university of pennsylvania is that there is nothing close to phenomenological consciousness until somewhere in the realm of age 2-3 and that up until then, aside from the visible similarities to a human being and the emotional connections formed, there isn't really much to say that post-natal abortion would be anything different than putting down a dog. if an animal loses its mother, and is not going to make it in the wild, it is merciful to put it down rather than see it suffer and die. we have capabilities for adoption, so that is a viable option for one who would choose to bring to term, but does not want the responsibility of raising it, so we don't allow post-natal abortion, plus they really do look human, but i haven't seen any medical studies supporting your claims.  &gt;you've closed your mind to any point of view, and furthermore, you condemn anyone who differs  on this, yes, i do not need to be tolerant of the intolerant; it is a core tenet of tolerant faiths and spiritualities. those who are intolerant have no place on this earth, and a prolife position is inherently and inarguably intolerant.  &gt;screw that, and screw everything about that.  i didn't say anything about that, i support abortion fully, i also support state-sponsored aid for the poor fully. it is our obligation to our less fortunate fellow men, particularly single mothers.  &gt;i am pro-life because i care about people.  sorry, you don't. at most you could be abortion agnostic ‚Äî that you would not abort, but you cannot make any public statement as to what anyone else would do. that is not being pro-life in any sense in which the term is used.  &gt;and from what i have seen, science has my back.  no, it doesn't. they may be ""alive"" but they are not necessarily deserving of special treatment until much later.  &gt; it ends a life that is distinct and measurable.  yeah, the same way that my tooth or a tumor is distinct and measurable, and that i can have interactions with. your idea of self as independent from the universe and your surroundings is ridiculous and arrogant. you are 90% bacteria, and those bacteria have distinct and independent lives, but you would view them as part of you until isolated under a microscope and then you would realize, they're totally different. you are coming to these conclusions from an arrogant subjectivity.  your behavioral anecdotes are 1) not cited, and 2) instinctual developmental self-reflexes not indicative of advanced cognitive abilities or protected biological systems.  &gt;the country is divided almost evenly, with slightly more people self-identifying as pro-life than as pro-choice, i think your assertion is unfounded.  along age and educational barriers. the more education there is through pervasive use of information sharing technology as required by an advanced economy, and the more older generations die off, the less this will be an issue. virtually no one well educated and in major population centers is pro-life.  to me, speaking your mind in a way that so hurts other people is a crime against fellow human beings; it will be codified as such in the future and has already been in many european and scandinavian countries. free speech has its limits, and those limits are reached when you harm another protected member of society (remember, fetus' are not natural born citizens and have no rights under the us constitution) through the voicing of your barbaric opinions.  to me, it really sounds like you're more agnostic on the issue ‚Äî if you are truly pro-life, you have to endeavor to assert your beliefs through protesting, physical action, or legislative approaches. anyone who takes any of these is an enemy of our society and should be dealt with appropriately.  i'd also like to note you conveniently ignored any of my statements from medical sources and took the discussion off on anecdotal stories of fetus behavior and irrelevant semantic contextless attacks. even if i contradicted myself at some point, it would not make me wrong (and i do not believe i did). though from the lay approach of your writing, and the fact that you have 3 kids, i'm not surprised at your lack of intellectual abilities.",0,,

always with the ollies. meanwhile, more tourists have begun to arrive, some by plane, no doubt having read rave reviews of our small empty park. i build a metro line because the tourists been walking in from the airport, dragging their rolling suitcases behind them.  http://i.imgur.com/ld4ni0r.jpg  &gt;oscar richardson   &gt;oscar, the richardson family patriarch, finally appears. he takes a bus outside his house and rides to work. well, part of the way to work. the busline only goes downtown, and he has to walk the rest of the way to the incineration plant to burn his family's garbage. i add a new bus line that will drop him off right outside the plant.  http://i.imgur.com/k5k93wx.jpg  &gt;katie richardson   &gt;my city is growing, as much as it can. i notice the population has increased to five: oscar and nancy have had a third child. nancy has graduated university u, and is now working at the elementary school teaching her only student, the kid she and oscar just had. thanks to everyone (except oscar) becoming educated, the house has leveled up as well, though i thought the original house looked cooler. i also finally spot katie richardson returning home from high school.  http://i.imgur.com/cxkkbnv.jpg  &gt;career path   &gt;oscar is the only one with no education, which makes me sad. his lack of book smarts is also preventing the house from leveling up again. i delete the garbage incinerator building, hoping he'll take his demotion as a sign he should go to school. it's not necessary: the house levels up because ashton has become well educated. oscar doesn't go to school, but gets a job at the presumably empty stadium, which has been visited by a total of three tourists. i build a new bus line just to transport him there.  http://i.imgur.com/ai5uoss.jpg  &gt;terry richardson   &gt;cities: skylines has an in-game version of twitter i'm so used to ignoring that i've only just now realized the richardsons must be the only ones using it. sure enough, the feed is full of their banal chirps about smoke detectors and beautiful sunrises. i'm not sure where they're seeing these sunrises: the game has no day/night cycle. maybe they're all high on bus fumes. their chirps allow me to finally locate the newest member of the family, though, terry richardson. she's in the park with nancy. she's described as a teen but she looks like a little kid. she's also playing with a stuffed animal.  http://i.imgur.com/mxej6d8.jpg  &gt;jobs   &gt;aston and katie have both graduated high school. ashton is working at the stadium with his dad, probably pressured into carrying on the family business of morosely standing around in an empty stadium. katie works at the observatory, which is much cooler. at this point, everyone pretty much has their own private bus to take to work, though katie prefers to walk.  http://i.imgur.com/pkb4nm0.jpg  &gt;and then there were four   &gt;i notice one day that the town's population has decreased by one. uh-oh. i check in with all the richardsons. katie is missing. like any concerned city god, i immediately check the local hospital and doctor's offices, as well as the two cemeteries. nothing. i finally realize what happened. like many young adults, katie simply moved out of her parents' home. with only one house in town, she had no choice but to move out of town completely. she's gone.  http://i.imgur.com/umzkfdp.jpg  &gt;empty nest   &gt;ashton moves out soon after. time passes, and terry leaves the nest, too. i'm down to two citizens, and they're both now seniors, and retired. oscar spends his time in a park, wandering around and occasionally chirping. nancy does the same. weird thing is, they do it in two different parks, located across the street from one another.  http://i.imgur.com/ex4x4rf.jpg  &gt;parks and wreckage   &gt;i'm a little bothered that they're not spending their autumn years in the same park together. did they agree to meet in the park but didn't specify which one, and they're simply both waiting for the other to arrive? or do they just not care for each other because she let the kids move away and he still smells like burnt garbage? i watch them for weeks as they mill around, just yards apart. they never return home. is the empty nest simply too painful now?  http://i.imgur.com/fzw5ljf.jpg  &gt;it tolls for she   &gt;as i'm watching nancy's park, i see a vehicle come around the corner, one i haven't seen in this city before. it's a hearse. nancy is still alive, but the mortuary seems to have gotten a hot tip. the driver, albert ward, gets out, unconcerned that he's blocking the richardson family private bus fleet. nancy is now dead. ward and his partner load her into the hearse and drive to the cemetery. this is terrible, but not the most terrible thing that will happen today. not by a long shot.  http://i.imgur.com/oezdec5.jpg  &gt;dazed and confused   &gt;oscar is still standing in his park when the hearse arrives for him not much later. they load him in, as they did nancy, but he's not dead. he's alive. he's confused. i bet he is. ""what's happening? where are you taking me? my wife was supposed to meet me in the park. do you know where my wife is?"" yes. they know where his wife his.  http://i.imgur.com/40hm53g.jpg  &gt;oh god no   &gt;he's still alive in there.  http://i.imgur.com/ofsugqr.jpg  &gt;just visiting   &gt;as the hearse arrives, oscar's status changes briefly, so briefly i don't manage to get a screenshot of it. but i swear it says 'visiting: cemetery.' is that what they told him? is that how they got him in the car? ""come on, pops, we're going to visit the cemetery."" then, he's in the ground. visiting hours are over, oscar. you're now a permanent resident. at least he and his wife are in the same park for a change.  http://i.imgur.com/vlhvukl.jpg  &gt;new beginnings   &gt;my chirper feed is still going off. is oscar chirping about smoke detectors from his coffin? no, it's several other people, members of a new family. they've moved into old richardson place. and why wouldn't they? great location. two parks nearby. amazing bus service. no noisy neighbors.  &gt;life goes on.",0,,

probably why i‚Äôm a male feminist, tbh), and she turned me onto punk (she‚Äôs one of those parents who undercuts youthful rebellion by enabling you) and i wore a *lot* of her old punk gear when i was in eighth grade because it fit. she was adopted by republicans (more on them in a bit) and raised in florida, so she‚Äôs got some gross classist tendencies left over from that and demanded that both of my stepdads knock me around whenever i was unruly; gaslighted me hardcore whenever i tried to escape it or report them to social services. she‚Äôs still kind of a dick about it even though she clearly regrets it.   * my dad's about a foot taller than my mom, he‚Äôs a daoist and either a social democrat or a democratic socialist (is there a difference, really?), english teacher turned social worker (not by choice), once divorced and he‚Äôs been dating moms ever since. we agree on pretty much everything but anarchism itself, politically. he smokes weed with my friends sometimes, it‚Äôs very interesting to watch.   they were in an indie band together. she was lead lady-vocals and backup bass, he was the frontman-songwriter guy, kind of sang in the shatner style where you aren‚Äôt actually singing. i‚Äôve been meaning to get my hands on a disc so i can throw their stuff around the internet for a goof.  they got divorced when i was around four months old.   my mother‚Äôs birth-parents are an irish-american valedictorian and...some guy who was most likely also irish-american. she was put up for adoption and adopted by a very...odd republican couple.   * my opa (that‚Äôs what we call him) is (unless he died and i don‚Äôt know, then he...was?) a czech-descended buckeye and a square-jawed paratrooper in world war ii, got a couple purple hearts, landed in a tree at least once. opa went to college on the gi bill afterwards, got a degree in engineering, then he went into stockbroking at merrill lynch. fiscally conservative, but he didn‚Äôt mind at all that i was a frenetic lefty with bedhead and impertinence. let me co-pilot his cesna a couple times when i was a kid, let me drive the golf cart because i‚Äôm good with vehicles, let me ride shotgun in his sports cars. politically...we agreed that nazis are the worst. we didn‚Äôt talk politics besides that, but he would explain anything i asked him about and took me to the space center a couple times. i think he‚Äôs in a home in jacksonville, i need to talk to him before he goes, he‚Äôll probably be happy that i like guns now.   * my oma (may she rest in pieces), sometimes called the frau, met my opa in world war ii. she was a german civilian in the league of german girls. he wooed her up with that american gi joe charm (i‚Äôve never been told the story proper) and she became a war bride. she disavowed nazism and did give me a first-hand account of what it was like under the nazis (bad...very, very bad), but a lot of that programming stuck. oma was a polyglot and prototypal racist grandma. she taught high-school german and was big into tennis. obsessed with cleanliness and scared of black people (she always warned my mom to hold her purse tight at airports, stuff like that; and that‚Äôs the stuff she‚Äôd let *me* see). the florida sun gave her a permanent leathery-orange complexion, and by the time i knew her, she had hair as white as the driven snow; she kind of looked like a female oompa loompa. she had an open if rarely spoken contempt for me. one of the times i was down there i was up late in the guest bedroom watching *the chappelle show*, and she walked in on the time he had a gospel choir singing the diarrhea song. walked out wordlessly, but clearly appalled. i‚Äôm glad we never talked politics, we were clearly on opposite sides of the spanish civil war. i didn‚Äôt need to mourn her when she died, because she was *awful*.   my dad‚Äôs parents are english ex-pats, londoners who lived through the blitz. they came over to the states in ‚Äò59 because my grandfather got a professorship at an ivy in his twenties.   * my grandfather is the only child of a born-too-late victorian lady and an aerospace engineer who walked out on them when he was fourteen. he‚Äôs a very british person (he‚Äôs a resident alien rather than being naturalized, it‚Äôs a point of pride for him), a quintessential british professor. three doctorates, royal society member, did some artificial organ experiments with some sheep in the ‚Äò60‚Äôs, refused to do something involving vietnam and bombs, and his most recent political activity (which is very infrequent, he‚Äôs pretty apolitical, but he takes the left side when politics demand an answer from him) is that he‚Äôs trying to stop some shady business dudes from building a power plant in a small town in our state by lending his professorial science to the environmental side.   * my nan (she doesn‚Äôt want to be called a grandmother) is the fourth of six children. her parents were brits living in spain ‚Äòtil the civil war broke out and they went back to england only to get bombs dropped on them in a suburb of london. she‚Äôs a lefty catholic democrat (she loves pope francis) who votes for democrats because of social issues and for the social safety net. she was a geneticist for a while, and has a lot of homecraft skills (loom-weaving, sewing, baking to a professional degree sometimes, etc) she goes to church a lot, helps out at the food pantry, and pals around with nuns. we don‚Äôt agree on everything (religion‚Äôs the big one), but she‚Äôs fine with my anarchism because she‚Äôs big on people having consciences, so my moralish (i can‚Äôt help it, i‚Äôm a fucking bleeding heart) anarchism doesn‚Äôt bug her. she‚Äôs a pacifist and has the ‚Äúconsistent life ethic‚Äù stance on life-death issues, and she winds up being pro-choice collectively while being individually pro-life as liberal catholics tend to be. she turned me off the death penalty back before i knew any better. my nan got legally divorced but not catholic divorced from my grandfather back in the early ‚Äò90‚Äôs, and he had that coming for being a workoholic, controlling jackass. they‚Äôre still friends, though, they just don‚Äôt live together.   * i have an older brother who‚Äôs got really bad ocd, severe autism, and he‚Äôs mentally retarded (there really is no pc way to put it) with a vocabulary of less than a thousand words. physically he‚Äôs a bit of an adonis, though. sweetest dude in the world, special olympian, and the only political opinion he has is a penchant for nudism. it‚Äôs impossible to hate him.   * i also have a kid half-sister, eleven years younger than me. she recently dyed her hair blue, she‚Äôs a shy, spacey artsy fangirl kind of girl, she‚Äôs a huge mlp:fim fan. animal lover, junior animal rights activist (she snarks about leather furniture, waffles between vegetarianism and piscetarianism, so proud), been a feminist since she could talk. politically she‚Äôs *probably* a green, definitely some kind of neo-hippie environmentalista. when she was very small, she was briefly a clinton supporter in ‚Äò08, but she switched to obama once she heard him speak. she‚Äôs feeling the bern now (she pulled my mom into volunteering for the campaign), although i haven‚Äôt checked in with her on politics since christmas even though we talk once in a while. i am her favorite brother, though.   * my sister‚Äôs dad, my stepdad #2, is an architect with a very...silicon-ish ‚Äúfiscally conservative, socially liberal‚Äù take on things. semi-professional athletes in his spare time, at one point he converted a pair of pumps into cycling shoes for a ‚Äúdrag race‚Äù. gives off a very paul ryan kind of vibe despite being a new hampshire-y independent who votes for democrats. besides my mother (who‚Äôs about nine years older than him), he goes for younger women, which is why they‚Äôre divorced now. i‚Äôm a registered independent because he showed me how to vote in primaries without affiliation. he let me pilfer his bookshelf whenever, and read me *the hobbit* and *maus* as bedtime stories when i was six. on the other invisible hand, he‚Äôs the one who tried to get me to read the fountainhead for a school project (i got a third of the way through, and had to stop because the heroic portrayal of rape was something my twelve year old brain couldn‚Äôt handle; this is part of why i hate objectivists so much). used to beat my ass around the house a lot, but i made sure it was just me with threats that hurting the other kids would lead to him waking up dead. my anti-authoritarianism probably comes from the disillusionment that being unable to make the violence stop that he knocked into me.   ---  tl;dr my family‚Äôs weird, my origin story is depressing,

because, from the animal's perspective, it is the same relationship. pets see as as their families.  &gt; christian musician nicole nordeman recently posted an account on facebook of a couple she overheard at the airport holding a facetime call with their ‚Äúbaby‚Äù and his ‚Äúgrandparents.‚Äù  &gt; ‚Äúthey are cooing and gushing and exclaiming ‚Äòwell look at you, big boy! so big! so handsome! are you being so good for nana???‚Äô‚Äù these ‚Äúparents‚Äù pester their own parents with questions about baby‚Äôs feeding, pooping, and playtime, and ‚Äúnearly collapse with joy‚Äù when ‚Äúbaby‚Äù comes back on screen for a last goodbye. ‚Äúmommy and daddy love you,‚Äù the couple squeal. ‚Äúyou are the best boy! we‚Äôre coming home so soon!‚Äù  &gt; nordeman says she turned around to sneak a look at this sweet baby who‚Äôs so beloved by his parents, only to find‚Ä¶a yellow labrador retriever.  oh, so you mean obnoxiously discussing a human baby's bodily functions in an airport is a-okay?  &gt; it‚Äôs hard work pretending animals are humans  &gt; millennials, it turns out, are twice as likely as baby boomers to buy clothing for their pets, an industry which, along with other forms of ‚Äúpet-pampering,‚Äù amounted to $11 billion last year, and markets such essential items as pet strollers and pet slings.  &gt; other times, replacement-babies require pet parents to pretend they, themselves, are animals. feast your eyes, for example, on this new cat brush that allows users to role-play by inserting it in their mouth like a giant tongue and ‚Äúlicking‚Äù their kitty.  is *this* really where you want to go? really? you want me to go on amazon and dredge up all the stupid idiotic products targeted at parents of small children?  &gt; many in my generation naively think of their dogs and cats as ‚Äúpractice babies,‚Äù hoping to test the waters of parenthood on a child that won‚Äôt resent them for a lifetime or wind up in prison should they fail.  yes, and guess what: those are the people like you who don't think of animals as sentient creatures, but as toys, and just ""practice"" for their own spawn.  &gt; but how many couples misdirect their parental instincts toward a door-shredding, constantly shedding nightmare and then decide they can‚Äôt handle kids?  rofl. really? you want to compare the damage done by pets to toddlers? and yeah, every couple weeks this sub has an: ""i love my dog, but he's a lot of work, and i'm glad he grew out of the puppy phase. i definitely couldn't handle something that takes three years to potty-train"" post.  &gt; in september, the washington post reported on findings from research firm mintel that quantify the replacement-baby epidemic. young americans are less likely than their parents to own a car or a home, and half as likely to be married as americans were 50 years ago. but we have a handy lead over the baby-boomers in one area: pet ownership. the frontrunners of the millennial pack who‚Äôve already entered careers could be rechristened the ‚Äúdog-boomers.‚Äù  &gt; but of course, it‚Äôs not true, because as james breakwell points out, fathers like he and i will never see that much money, yet our kids are still alive. texas a&amp;m university finance professor h. swint friday points out that the usda numbers are ‚Äúmisleading to the point of outrageous,‚Äù and concocted largely based on ‚Äúpolitical objectives.‚Äù  &gt; the economy of scale, thrifty shopping, buying things used, and having a spouse willing to stay home and care for the kids drastically cuts childrearing costs.  aaaaahahaha  fuck off you yuppie piece of shit. you make enough that you can afford to have your spouse stay at home and ca're for the kids and you're talking trash about other people's financial responsibility?  &gt; they don‚Äôt want to be your surrogate infant. they want to be your pack-mate‚Äîyour hunting companion. they want to chase down something in the woods and rip its still-beating heart out, together. they are, after all, descended from wolves.  fifty bucks his shitty kid pulls the legs of spiders for fun.  &gt; we have instincts to raise children. well, guess what? dogs have instincts, too. ‚Äú‚Ä¶the bloodlust, the joy to kill,‚Äù writes jack london in ‚Äúcall of the wild.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äîall this was buck‚Äôs‚Ä¶he was raging at the head of the pack, running the wild thing down, the living meat, to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood.‚Äù  dipshit. that is a work. of. fiction. animals have parental instincts, and humans are in fact naturally omnivorous, and millions of us hunt live prey even when we do not have to.   &gt; g. shane morris is a senior writer at breakpoint, a program of the colson center for christian worldview. he‚Äôs also written for summit ministries and the christian post, and blogs regularly at patheos. shane lives with his wife and three children in leesburg, virginia.  oh, what a fucking surprise.",1,-1,1
255408,"this is gonna be a long answer, because s\&amp;h is complex, and it's something that really fascinates me.  i'll start off by saying that the relative *lack* of social conservatism among millenials is one of the biggest holes in s\&amp;h right now, but the fact that it exists at all and is a well-known movement makes sense with s\&amp;h. also, much of the community surrounding the theory has proposed all kinds of extensions and patches on the theory that smooth over some of the holes (and the community is very politically diverse -- parts of the forums can get toxic at times because of liberals and conservatives having vicious arguments). i don't really agree with vanilla s\&amp;h; i would've probably discounted the whole thing if not for some of the extensions proposed on the forums. still, i'll try to stick to vanilla here in my descriptions.  s\&amp;h proposes that history consists of a cycle of ~80-year periods called saecula. each saeculum consists of four ~20-year periods called turnings.  1. first turning = high. a period of unity and social conformity, where the social order is considered sacrosanct. society's attitude is positive and forward-looking. personal freedom and individual fulfillment are low, but society's productivity is high. wars affirm the new status quo. 2. second turning = awakening. the social order comes under attack by the younger generations, who expose its flaws. wars are controversial. 3. third turning = unravelling. the social order is weak and powerless, but it continues to hang on. liberals and conservatives at each others throats, predictions of doom and gloom abound. a period of high personal freedom and invididual fulfillment are high, but society's productivity is low. wars are big and flashy but accomplish little. 4. fourth turning = crisis. the social order, under attack since the 2t, collapses entirely, giving way to chaos until a new social order can be built to take its place. wars are total and accomplish great change.  we're currently in a crisis. right now, howe (strauss died several years ago) considers the stock market collapse of 2008 to be the trigger that caused the turning shift. some parts of the community disagree and want to push it back to 2001 (9/11) or 2005 (katrina), but i think howe got this one right. s\&amp;h have analyzed every saeculum in the english-speaking world back to the late middle ages, and i'll skip the whole thing (you can look it up elsewhere if you want), but here's a breakdown of the current saeculum as it applies to the us (every country is on its own clock, btw):  1. high ~= 1945-1963. the end of ww2 to jfk's assassination. classic '50s conformity. consensus around the cold war. the korean war affirms the status quo. major national projects like the interstate highway system and the space race happen. 2. awakening ~= 1963-early 1980s. jfk's assassination to reagan era. protests, feminism, open dissent, vietnam war is protested, you know the drill. the end of this is disputed: s\&amp;h say 1984, much of the community wants to push it back to 1980/1981 or say it was a slow transition from 1980-1984.  3. unravelling ~= early 1980s-2008. reagan era to the great recession. culture wars dominate political discussion, '50s-style conformity is almost completely gone, era of individualism, ""me generation"". girl power is in, housewives are out. the cold war ended with a whimper, and the gulf wars (both of them), kosovo, afghanistan, etc. were more theater than anything else. 4. crisis ~= 2008-present. the great recession onwards. people have completely lost faith in the system. lots of barely-coherent rants against bankers. ows and the tea party both want a new paradigm. young people long for days of social conformity that went away before they were born (read: red pill). tensions with russia are rising.  one thing i'll point out is that this crisis has defied expectations again and again and again. young people are getting *more* socially liberal, not less, with the exception of a some very small throwbacks (read: red pill). also, this late into the last crisis we saw the new social order begin to form (the last crisis was 1929-1945 with the new order starting to form in 1932; in terms of years, we should be on par with 1935 by now), and political tensions keep getting higher and higher.  so, now, onto the generations.  each saeculum corresponds to a lifetime, and each turning corresponds to a phase of life (childhood, young adulthood, middle age, elderhood). there are four generational archetypes, based on which turning a person is born in.  1. prophets. born in the 1t, come of age in the 2t, settle down in the 3t, grow old in the 4t. spoiled during childhood, become moralistic agitators when they come of age, nurture their children and push political agendas in middle age, and end up as fiery, moralistic leaders in old age. 2. nomads. born in the 2t, etc. neglected during childhood, become edgy rebels as they grow up, become overprotective parents and grizzled veterans in middle age, and spend old age grumpy and angry. 3. heroes. born in the 3t, etc. nurtured during childhood, become good little soldiers when they grow up, indulge their children and become responsible leaders in middle age, and become energetic elder statesmen in adulthood. 4. artists. born in the 4t, etc. smothered during childhood, become bland conformists when they grow up, come out of their shell in middle age, resulting in expressive behavior but neglectful parenting, and become hip, cool old people in elderhood.  one general rule is that generations and turnings shape each other. turning changes are triggered when the oldest members of each generation enter their next phase of life, and the mood of each turning shapes how each generation turns out.  you can probably guess the generations this saeculum gave birth to.  1. prophets = baby boomers. the older ones fought on the front lines of the 60s counterculture; the younger ones joined the religious right in the 70s. both sides fueled the culture wars in the 80s and 90s. 2. nomads = generation x. edginess pervades xer culture. look at the popularity of gangsta rap. xer teen movies tend towards violence between social groups, etc. now they're becoming overprotective parents so they can give their kids the stability they never had growing up (xers were the original latchkey kids). 3. heroes = millenials. i'll get to this in a bit. the heroes of the *last* saeculum were the gi generation who fought in ww2, becoming responsible leaders of the postwar world, were nicknamed the ""greatest generation"" because of their selflessness, and wound up sticking around longer than anyone expected (they controlled the presidency from 1961-1993!). 4. artists = the kids being born today. no name yet, but ""homeland generation"" was proposed back when people (mistakenly) thought 9/11 triggered the crisis. the artists of the *last* saeculum were the silent generation who were conformist little worker bees during the 50s, came out of their shell in a big way in the 60s and 70s creating the best generation of actors, musicians, and filmmakers in living memory, and now embody the ""cool old guy"" trope. silents are mid-life crisis incarnate. unfortunately, their mid-life crises resulted in them neglecting their (mostly xer) kids...  so, millenials. s\&amp;h predicted that they'll end up being exactly like the gi generation. as the gis grew up to dominate society, all the first-wave feminists and flappers of the unravelling in the 1920s disappeared over the crisis in the 1930s and early 1940s and were replaced by boring housewives in the late 1940s and 1950s high. gi women hated being rosie the riveter, and they quickly jumped at picket fences and garden clubs. in other words, proto-redpillers killed first-wave feminism and restored social conservatism. s\&amp;h predicts it's happening again now, and all the gains of feminism since the 1960s will disappear.  i think that this time is different: while redpillers are more of a thing now than they were during the 3t, they're a tiny minority, and social barriers are being broken down even faster than ever (look at the progress of gay marriage, trans acceptance, the rise of girl power to the point where nobody even questions whether or not women can do everything men can, etc.). i don't want to say that s\&amp;h are 100% wrong here, as again, redpillers are more of a thing now than they were during the 3t, but i don't think they're right either. i think it *could* have happened if not for the momentum of various social movements causing redpillers to be ostracized in their tracks. s\&amp;h also got it right that millenials are prone to groupthink. sjws came out of the same collectivist mindset that redpillers came out of.",1,1,

795074,"i don't know if you'd call it a ""big scheme"" but it is certainly a conscious decision made awhile ago that keeps young people down.  during the victorian era, companies transitioned from needing strong people to needing skilled people.  it wasn't possible to cram in enough training before kids hit adolescence.  so if you went out at 13, got married and had a kid as was the norm for pretty much all of the life of our species, you were screwed.  there were no jobs available.  so, society, particularly the lower classes, responded the only way they knew how - with religious furor.  they had to stop adolescents from having sex (no birth control remember) until they could get trained enough to get a job and take care of the progeny they'd produce.  this was a terrible idea from the very beginning.  but, even when we got birth control, no one thought to revisit it.  since everyone alive had been raised on this idea that they've got to wait until they're older to start living, that's how they raised their kids.  and progressively, this also started to involve more and more infantilization.  every generation gave the next one less and less freedom.  just ask your parents what high school was like for them.  likely, they were allowed to leave, many students had jobs and only went to school half-days or not at all on some days, etc.  today, kids are as locked down as humanely possible.  they can't take a piss without getting permission.  the proper human response to this kind of indignity is rebellion.  even when we came up with this nifty internet thing and started transitioning to an information-based economy, where adolescents are as capable and able to contribute as any adult (if allowed to learn), we didn't go back and revisit this idea from the victorian era.  of course, by then we'd had roseanne barr go on television and talk about her terrible childhood, and that has been extended to apply to everyone up to the age of 18 by pop psychologists and other people ignorant of human development.  since then, the oppression of adolescents has been extended and supported by pseudoscience, oprah, dr. phil, and our basic culture of extreme idiocy and anti-intellectualism.  kids living in harsh conditions mature... that's the real difference.  what causes maturation?  development.  what causes development?  it is not, as people erroneously think, just time and good nutrition.  those things are useless and do not result in any development at all if one critical element is left out - experience.  only intense personal experiences cause brain development.  things like falling in love for the first time, bonding with friends, realizing your own mortality, making connections that contribute to having a worldview that extends far beyond yourself, these things are what cause brain development.  sitting in a classroom memorizing facts and being told to keep their hands to themselves actively prohibits development and therefore maturation.  i would argue that most parents today, in fact, are extremely immature.  they are completely unable to see their children as needing to develop into independent, separate adults.  and they are selfish and short-sighted in the extreme, so much so that they prevent their children from maturing and convince themselves that letting them grow into larger children is the same thing.  you don't see many parents stepping back and saying ""i know this is going to hurt them, but they have to experience it"".  instead they say ""i'm going to keep there here forever and ever and never let anything bad happen to them and never let their innocence be corrupted"".  and the next generation suffers for it.",1,-2,-1

934522,"i have only two sources for which to back up this claim: **1)** my own personal experiences and **2)** my observations about the nature of the software development industry.  obviously ""mileage may vary"" and not everyone's experiences will be similar to mine.  i've heard some people can get into development without a degree, some people can get entry-level jobs as qa doing glorified computer janitation, and then finally move into development roles.  some people just get lucky, they have the right connections, they know the right hiring managers, or maybe the company really does need all the help it can get at that time so they'll hire anyone off the street.  however, the one constant i have noticed is that every one of my friends and peers who are developers, are smarter than me, can do more hard math than i ever could, and they all made the right decision and majored in computer science from the onset, so they did things the right away, and their reward is to get to work as software engineers, people who use ""magic technology"" to create something, and are extremely valued by companies because they are profit makers (whereas other ancillary support positions, such as qa, ba, pm, are cost centers, they serve needed roles but they are not the ""lead guitarists"" in the band so to speak, they are not rockstars, they are merely stage help, to draw an analogy).  the developers are the true rockstars.  regarding **1)**, my own personal experiences: i didn't major in the right things obviously in college, so i graduated with a worthless bachelor's degree not worth the paper it's printed out, and then realized i would be fucked if i tried to continue a career in the industry, so i went back to school to earn a master's degree in software engineering to ""make up"" for my misspent youth.  i juggled a full-time internship for 3 years straight making $18/hr with no benefits, and attended school part-time, taking two, sometimes just one course per semester.  i finally graduated and got a ""real"" job in the industry, but it was in qa\automation, not in software engineering as i had wanted.  all along, all the time i was in school, i had hoped and prayed that at least one motherfucker out there would be able to recognize my talent and intelligence, however due to having a mediocre gpa (less than 3.0) because i could not devote 100% time to studying, because i had to work a 40-hour internship every week, there was no way i could qualify for entry-level jobs that hired people with no experience but required 3.0 to 3.5 gpa.  i applied for epic systems (the wisconsin-based medical software giant) and didn't get in.  i applied for dozens of companies didn't get in.  i submitted my resume to a hiring manager at u.s. bank directly through a contact i knew there.  that didn't help me for jack shit.  it was then that i realized two universal truths about how the entire industry operates, and therefore how recruiters and hiring managers think and operate:  **a)** if you have no experience, you will get your resume tossed instantly.  the first thing they do when they get your resume and application is scan it to make sure you meet the *minimum* experience required threshold, and that either takes them all of 7 seconds to do, or they have software filters that do it for them by scanning and regular expressions string matching against job titles and dates of employment and tools\technology keywords.  **b)** if you have what most people consider too little experience (1-2 years), you risk getting your resume tossed by a fair amount of recruiters and hiring managers.  no recruiter wants to give you the time of day because ""he only has a year of experience"" and they think they will never be able to place you at a client site, so they move on and try to find ""more senior people"" who have ""more 'real' experience.""  **c)** pretty much the *only* qualification anyone cares about is that the candidate at least meets the minimum threshold level for years of experience in the field (3 in 3-5, or 4 in 4-8, or 5 in 5-8), etc.  i've seen 2-3; 3-5; 4-5; 4-8; 5-7.  it seems 2 years experience is the absolute minimum you need to be considered by most employers without them telling you to your fucking face that you have no real experience or they really wish you had more experience, and then ending the hiring process right then and there.  **d)** i have heard nowadays some companies use software filters to engage in a little bit of age discrimination against those whom are perceived to be ""young people"" or ""too young.""  for example, a 22-year old fresh out of school might not have 3-5 years of true experience in the industry, and so a software filter can simply automatically mark a resume\application for discard by doing simple subtraction against the candidate's date of birth, wherein the employer discreetly enacts a policy to simply not hire people who are under a certain age, such as under 25 or under 30.  it doesn't matter if you yourself are mature enough to hold down a fulltime job when you're 22 years old, you are *perceived* by hiring managers and recruiters to be infants and babies, and therefore perception is reality.  and since age discrimination laws in the u.s. only exist or apply to protect older people (i think there's a minimum age to be able to prove age discrimination, like 45+; 50+ or something) therefore companies can get away with discriminating against younger people.  regarding d), part of the problem for this perception is the modern college system in the u.s.  back in the day, it used to be that when people turned 18, they were automatically considered adults by society, they were considered mature enough.  when newspapers talked about 17 year olds, they used the word ""boy"" and an 18-year old was automatically called a ""man.""  for example, a 17-year-old *boy* was arrested, or an 18-year-old *man* was sentenced to imprisonment.  nowadays, 18-year olds are still considered ""children"", in actuality ""college children,"" and some are even still referring to 18 as ""teens.""  the traditional college system of going to school and fucking around for 4 years is in my opinion just an unnecessary extension of childhood for +4 years.  most people would actually benefit from entering the workforce and working their way towards earning a degree when they're more mature and know what they really want to do, rather than expecting these naive and easily gulled 18-22 year olds to drink the kool-aid, major in crap worthless degrees that sound interesting or fun but are not remotely vocationally applicable and not worth the paper they're printed on.  when i was a college student with no ""real"" experience, i found that creative writing on my resume and linkedin profile was sometimes enough to intrigue the recruiters, but always as soon as they found out i only had a year or two of experience, or as soon as they found out i was *only* an intern at my present job, suddenly their tone of voice changed, their entire demeanor changed.  it's like they had already made up their minds.  so finally i learned that in order to be taken seriously by recruiters and hiring managers, since apparently internship experience does not count as ""real"" experience in their eyes, the only way to get around this catch-22 is to tell a little white lie, and slightly embellish your job title on your resume and linked in profile.  represent yourself as having been a fulltime employee of the company while you were there.  not ""student technical intern,"" use the term ""software engineer.""  when they see terms like ""intern"" and ""student technical"" and ""lab coordinator"", they immediately roll their eyes and move on to the next candidate who might be loads more qualified.  when i kept the word ""intern"" on my resume, i noticed that recruiters would view my profile but not contact me.  when i omitted the word ""intern,"" they would view my profile and send their introductory inmails and contact requests inquiring if i was in the market for the next job.  this bias and downright hatred for ""inexperienced"" people is utterly disgusting to me.  no one wants to give anyone a chance, everyone prefers you have made your mistakes elsewhere and already have some ""real"" experience under your belt.  true entry-level jobs are few and far between.  the other side of the coin is, once you're lucky enough to actually have gotten your foot in the door at a company or two, once you've actually built the requisite 3-5 years of experience required to be taken seriously by corporations and their recruiters, then it's like fucking **everyone** wants you, you get spam fucked by recruiters contacting you left and right, night and day.  you start getting job offers even if you only scored 60% to 70% on the interview, they basically look over your resume and give you your next job on the sole merit that have like 5-6 years of experience and there must know something, even if they perceive you to be mediocre.  so what this kind of system creates, is that once someone has 3-5 years of experience in their field, if they're even slightly above average, they may not need to worry about finding their next job when they get laid off or want to leave their present gig, because the system rewards people who simply have experience, as that is the biggest (and sometimes the only) category that matters.  although nowadays, not having a degree might also instantly get your resume tossed, so the true requirement really is ""has a degree and x-y years of experience.""  but once someone has 5, 6, or 7 years of experience in their field, then they get pigeon-holed into it, career transition is virtually impossible for most, as it might involve a significant pay cut and require someone to start over from the beginning again.",1,-1,

809091,"as someone who was homeschooled third grade through eighth i disagree and agree with a lot of what she is saying.  first of all, i agree that people need to stop assuming that it's for religious reasons. i was homeschooled because the schools around me were either very poor or hyper religious (the one i attended before being homeschooled actually disliked my mother because she is catholic).  though, to be fair, almost all of the homeschooled kids i've met are doing it for religious reasons. in fact, i can only think of a handful who aren't. actually, when someone told me they were homeschooled, i used to instantly assume it was for religious reasons. i've gotten better about that since when i realized how hypocritical it was.  i disagree with her on a lot of things though. the socialization part...well, i barely socialized in my homeschool years. i had one best friend and that was all, for the most part. this was probably because every other homeschooler was really, really religious and i didn't do well with that.   did it affect me when i went to high school? for about a year. around sophomore year i broke out of my shell and all was good. i think by bypassing all the crap in middle school. for one thing, i've never engaged in all the dramatic crap my female friends did. also, since i never was dragged into the boy crazy frenzy, i don't base my worth off whether or not i'm dating someone. i can enjoy being single and i can enjoy being in a relationship. so i think the lack of socialization helped me with my connection with other people because i have a strong sense of myself and people really do respect that. i don't know if it have the same results with others though.  perhaps it's different with her and her children are socialized to the core. but it's probably with other homeschooled kids. with the same beliefs. she also suggests that she plans to homeschool her children through high school. with all honestly, high school does suck, but it has a lot of perks that goes far beyond education (obviously, since there are few perks of the education factor).  first of all, you meet people with a different set of beliefs, values, and morals than you. this allows you to accept or deal with that fact that sometimes, just sometimes, not everyone is going to agree with you, which, by the tone of this article (‚Äúhere's a thought: if you can't say something nice about homeschooling, shut up!‚Äù), this woman has not yet faced. it also allows you to deal with situations that you are going to have to face in college ‚Äì i‚Äôm assuming these kids are planning on going to college - only in the small scale. for example: perhaps you worry your child will be offered alcohol one misguided weekend? well, in college that‚Äôs going to happen five times on weekdays and twice that on the weekends unless your kid locks himself in his room. the debauchery in high school teaches you how to deal with the significantly worse debauchery in the real world. i‚Äôm not saying that there isn‚Äôt some kind of rebellion going on in the homeschooler community, i‚Äôm just saying i kind of doubt it.  this woman also claims that she can teach her children all twelve years of school alone. wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. in defense of homeschoolers, there are venues for people who cannot teach their children a certain subject. there are one-on-one tutors, people who teach who will teach a whole class, and even some colleges will allow homeschooled kids to come and take some courses. this is what i did, because of course one person cannot teach every subject, and even if he could that is dangerous, for you are only receiving one teaching style and one viewpoint.  is this woman saying she is taking her children to these classes? nay. she claims that she can recall everything from‚Ä¶well, let‚Äôs say this woman is forty. she is saying she remembers everything she needs to know from twenty-two years ago but at the same time says she is not a prodigy. well, in my mind, you need to be a prodigy to be able to do that. what i get from this is that she is saying she can teach any high school subject with ease and grace. i disagree. even the most intelligent people have troubles in some area. someone good in chemistry might not do so well in english, or vice versa. furthermore, like i said before, one benefits from different teaching styles, personalities, and viewpoints. if you have just one to five teachers (all with the same teaching ideology too) throughout your educational lifetime, then you will not learn how to deal with the professors you have in college. you will not be able to change your way of thinking because you were taught only one way of thinking. in my mind, that is extremely dangerous and damaging.  another point that i want to make is that a good relationship with one‚Äôs mother takes space. she says that there is no difference between being a mother and a teacher to her child. as someone who has had a parent that was both a mother and a teacher, there is a difference. i would say around sixth to eighth grade, our relationship became very strained. it wasn‚Äôt because she was bad mother or i was bad kid, it was because we were around each other all the time. ever heard the phrase familiarity breeds contempt or absence makes the heart grow fonder? well, this is a great example. being around your mother all the time when you‚Äôre a preteen/teenager is very hard and i would not suggest it to anyone, not matter the relationship. i have an older brother who was homeschooled too, and he went through the same exact thing. around the same age, he and my mother fought like they hated each other until he went back to school, and their relationship improved significantly. same thing happened with me.  so can you be a mother and a teacher to your child? yes, until a certain age. and then you need space and lots of it.  the last point she makes, #25, seems to be ring of immaturity. to me it says, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt agree with me? then you‚Äôre wrong, shut up!‚Äù homeschooling is not for everyone. i completely understand why people would have their reservations. perhaps homeschooling her children until college is great for them, but to me it seems like they will be missing out on a lot. i know if i had remained homeschooled i would have missed a lot.  but that‚Äôs all my opinion. i‚Äôve pretty much had every form of education you can get (public, private, homeschooled, charter), so i know a good amount of the upsides and downsides of different forms of education. as for homeschooling, i wouldn‚Äôt change being homeschooled for the world. like i said, i think it helped me a lot. i‚Äôm also glad it didn‚Äôt continue longer than it did.  i‚Äôd like to know what someone else thinks about this.  *edited for various grammatical and spelling errors. i can't stand those.",1,1,

""yeah, i just have to pee and we'll go. everyone! we aren't staying. i don't tempt fate and this is just begging for it.""  she started loading up the car and i explained the dream to those who didn't know/didn't remember. most of them were on board with going home and staying at one of our houses except one. the skeptic. he was having none of it so the whole ride home, he complained. we locked up and left.  when we returned the key, our friend told us she had lied to her ex boyfriend (who was abusive) and told him she was going to be there that weekend with a large group of people (when in reality, she was home alone). we told her everything and she started crying. she never locked the backdoor just in case someone didn't have a key. we didn't know that when we went.  neither of us has had the dream since.",1,1,

700858,"cool theory bro. god, i love jurassic park, scared the crap out of me as a kid, but even 20 years later i'm still lapping up all the inherent compexities. yeah, fatherhood and paternity, nightmare matriarchal states, playing god, and reproduction are big themes of jurassic park, obviously grant has the more commonly digested arc - going from hating kids, to wanting kids. but hammond also represents this in a grander, almost religious way.   i did read an essay whilst studying the recycling of myths in modern culture at uni. it talked about how jurassic park was basically a parable of the patriarchy‚Äôs instilled fear over the foundation of a matriarchal community. since civilization is inherently patriarchal, matriarchy represents nearly everything it is against. the raptors by design are embodiment of classic feminine terror being nimble, fast, intelligent and harpy like with claws. it's the one you don't see that attacks and starts eating you alive (not that i'm dissing womankind of course :s )    in jurassic park you have hammond who is this paternal figure. more importantly he is almost a godlike figure in how he has the resources to command the laws of nature, miraculously resurrecting a previously thought extinct species. you have his representation by richard attenborough in the films, kindly old man, white beard, white clothes - very much a common distillation of what many people would consider god to look like. attenborough would later play santa claus in the remake of miracle of 34th street.    of course he does all this up to a point, by establishing and enforcing a matriarchy. there are problems everywhere, the sick triceratops, the two no-shows, nedry‚Äôs apathy to his work. in the early parts of the movie, there are so many shots of electric fences confining dense green jungles. stark contrast between physical control and boundless nature. things just aren‚Äôt right.  with all the dinosaurs genetically engineered to be female, and on a constant drip of lycine, hammond and his scientists believe they can maintain control of this unnatural state, that they can control the laws of mother nature. without the lycine the animals supposedly slip into a coma and die‚Ä¶ though time and time again, control is wrestled free, as grant discovers with lex and tim, the dinosaurs are breeding ‚Äì spontaneously changing sex in order to survive. throw in some transgender dinosaurs and the strict laws of the patriarchy just shrivel! in the lost word the dinosaurs flourish on site b rather than die.       hammond‚Äôs arc throughout the movies is the realization that he is not god, he is a capitalist as malcolm points out over dinner near the start - ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should!"" hammond obviously takes offence to this. i think he has a bit of an identity struggle in his old age, he very much wants to be that walt disney character, the creator, but in the end it is only the bloodsucking lawyer he so wretchedly hates that sides with him. gennaro is the clearest force of corporate capitalism, almost to the point he is kind of dehumanized and deserved of the fate of being eaten off the toilet by the rex.   pivotally, when nedry‚Äôs plan has been hatched and all goes to shit, there is that key scene between hammond and ellie at the dinner table. it begins with glimpses of all the merchandising, very much hammond‚Äôs dynasty, before going into detail about his history with his flea circus and the desire to create something that wasn't an illusion, ""something you could see and touch"".   the film version of hammond obviously cares, but by the time jurassic park ends he realises why creating jurassic park was a bad idea to begin with and realises everything malcolm, sattler and grant have been saying about the dangers of 'playing god' and resurrecting an extinct species.  i think the original version of the movie‚Äôs ending, involved hammond walking in, shooting the raptors dead with a shotgun. obviously, spielberg changed it for the classic t-rex intervention ending. but you still have that line between grant and hammond, when he picks them up in the jeep. ""mr hammond, i've decided not to endorse your park"" - to which he replies ""so have i..."". so he's prepared to drop jurassic park and the ill advised principles he originally had.   had the film ended with hammond shooting the raptors, that kind of draws an interesting arc between the first scene you mentioned where he is present for the hatchling as the father. had the original ending played out, you would have the father willing to shoot his own children (though for the protection of his natural grandchildren). maybe you would have a look of regret on his face after he shot them both? maybe he would have to finish one off, the big one, as it writhed around on the floor. maybe that look of regret would have become an endlessly recycled gif‚Ä¶ that ending would have made jurassic park more a story about hammond rather than what it really should be about ‚Äì the dinosaurs.   you wonder what happened to the hatchling though... left in an incubator somewhere? probably left to die? once the lysine contingency came into effect. if it came into effect.       hammond is a complex character, but by casting richard attenborough you are bringing that grand legacy, that naturalist voice (not forgetting his brotherly link to david attenborough of course). in the interest of cinematic taste, nobody, especially spielberg wants to see an old man get eaten by velociraptors. it would be physically demanding on the screen icon if he had to film stunts. and it is probably more important in terms of character arc, to witness the devastation he has put the scientists and his own people through.   it is a completely different treatment to the book, attenborough's hammond has warmth and a sense of tragedy. crichton saw him as a greedy capitalist, eventually finished off by a pack of compys, the smallest dinosaurs he created.   i think hammond in many ways is the core of the first two films. it is that childlike love for dinosaurs that perseveres. in the second lost world movie, malcolm chastises for going from ""capitalist to naturalist in just four years"" - launching an ill advised 'research' mission to survey site-b, which in his dying state is his last chance for redemption. he is doing this against the attempts to go against the will of his own family - his nephew peter ludlow, who is much more an incarnation of that greedy capitalist and thusly meets the sticky end at the maw of the baby rex that crichton‚Äôs hammond gained at the end of jurassic park the book.  again an interesting contrast to hammond's relationship with infant dinosaurs. finally he has the last word of the movie where he declares that the animals require humanity's absence rather than guidance.  and then they made jurassic park iii‚Ä¶ which really is a story about how life failed dr alan grant and he is completely impotent to take control of it‚Ä¶   edit: euh grammar is not my forte...",1,1,1
784315,"yes, i was most definitely discouraged from associating with extended non-jw family.  after my parents started studying when i was about 2 years old, the older lady they studied with knew my great-grandparents when they were younger.  apparently, my greats had once been jw's and then left the organization when the wtbts flip-flopped on their doctrine about celebrating christmas.  this elderly jw lady told my (young) parents about the ordeal, and they *immediately* began to shun my great-grands without further adieu, never mind that they had never known about the family history until that moment and we used to spend lots of time at my great-grands' house.  i was never allowed to see or speak to my great-grandmother again; she passed away when i was 13 or 14.  when i was 17, i was staying the night at my non-jw maternal grandmother's house (my great-grands' daughter).  she was partially raised in the organization, never got baptized, and helped my parents financially quite a bit, so my parents never shunned her.  anyway, my great-grandfather dropped by her house for a visit, and as my brothers and i had been trained our whole lives, if great-grandpa came over to grandma's while we were there, we were to hide out in the basement until he left.  it pissed my grandma off to no end (it was her house after all), but she didn't want to risk losing having a relationship with us kids because my parents would cut off all contact from her as well.   anyway, great-gramps came by, us kids took off to the basement, etc.  about 30 minutes later, grandma came down to talk to me privately.  she said she believed i was old enough to make my own decision whether or not i wanted to meet great-gramps, and if i did, my parents would never find out about it.  his health was failing and he was in the beginning stages of alzheimer's, and she was afraid that if i was forced to wait until i was of legal age to get to know him, it might be too late, as it were with my great-grandma.    of course, i immediately followed her upstairs and finally got to hug my great-gramps after 15 years.  it was the most wonderful present my grandma has ever given me.  his mental cognition rapidly declined after that, and he passed soon after.  but i had that one meaningful moment with him, which i will treasure forever.  even though i was allowed to have a relationship with my grandma, my parents were always throwing in spiteful comments against her to me because she never remained in ""the truth"".  absolutely hateful and ridiculous stuff such as ""your grandma has false teeth now because she didn't obey her parents and drink her milk.""  never mind she was lactose intolerant and had given birth to 7 children, which depletes the calcium in the body.  or, ""your grandma said we should get an abortion when we found out we were pregnant with you.""  never mind that my parents were teenagers in high school and that roe v. wade had been passed the previous year.  they were always trying to undermine the love and respect and *natural affection* i'd always had for grandma.  last year, grandma was visiting for the summer (she's a snowbird), and during our conversation, she mentioned that my dad had been bad-mouthing me to her and grandpa.  there was a lot of tension between my dad and myself at the time because my youngest brother had just awoken and left the organization, and they blamed me for being the cause of it.  i'd been out since 1992 and had minimal contact with the rest of my brothers because mom and dad wouldn't allow it.  i was just as surprised as they were when i found out he left, and i had nothing to do with influencing his decision to do so.  dad was telling my grandma that i was a raging alcoholic.  yes, i have a few beers on the weekend and sometimes after work after a long, stressful day.  and when my dad comes to visit for extended periods of time (2 months), i absolutely drink more because it's how i deal with him shoving doctrine down my throat in every single conversation without getting into an ugly verbal confrontation with him.  but i have a full-time decent-paying job, have never been fired from one, and have raised two daughters on my own whom are now both in college with 4.0 gpas and scholarships up the ying-yang.  my father is unemployed, lost his job 5 years ago, has not tried to find another one, drinks all day long, and lives off my mother.  that's when i threw into the conversation how my parents used to tell me all the time when i was growing up that grandma wanted them to abort me.  her eyes got huge; she couldn't believe it.  she said, ""no, that is absolutely not true.  when they came to grandpa and me to tell us they were pregnant in high school, we sat down with them and went over all the options they had with an unplanned pregnancy, from keeping the baby and finishing high school in separate housing, to marrying and moving in together, to adoption, and yes, even though i personally would not choose to abort, i had to put that option on the table for them so they could make the best decision they could for themselves.  i had 7 children and never thought about aborting any of them.  why would i try to force my oldest daughter to have one?  i got pregnant when i was 17 also.  but for them to tell you that i was pressuring them into an abortion is absolutely untrue.""  she then asked why i thought my dad was doing his best to make me look bad.  ""simple, grandma.  he finally realizes that he can no longer control me, so he is trying to control what everybody else thinks of me.""  she let that sink in for a minute, and then nodded her head.  ""that makes perfect sense."", she said.  as far as my paternal side of the extended family goes, i didn't have much contact with them growing up because of distance mostly.  when i moved back to wyoming in 2001, i was instantly welcomed with open arms.  i had just separated from my husband and had my 4 &amp; 6 year-old daughters in tow.  when i found a job in the town that my paternal great-aunt lived in, she offered me a room to stay in her home while i looked for an apartment.  when i found one, she and my uncle and my cousins and their significant others helped me move the 100 miles south.  my girls and i were included in all their family events, including easter egg hunts and my cousin's weddings.  not just invited, but included in them (asked to do a reading during the ceremony for one, asked to be the guest-book attendant in another), even though we hadn't seen each other in over 25 years.  my aunt went out of her way to make me feel that i *belonged*, and it felt so good to be accepted into their family, even after all the time that had passed.  now, every other summer, they host a family reunion at their place out in the country, and they make sure that i have accommodations and no excuses to not attend.  and in the in-between years of the family reunion, they put together an unofficial family reunion out at the lake 5 miles from where i live, and have asked me to help them organize it, since i live closer to that site.  and at christmas time, they hold family potlucks at other relatives/related-by-marriage homes in my hometown and keep me involved.  i love my extended non-jw family so much for their love and kindness and true concern for my well-being.  i might have lost both my parents and one brother to this cult, but i have gained the love and support of over 75 extended non-jw family members since i have left.  who needs conditional love when you have that?  i encourage all who have lost their core family to reach out to their non-jw extended family.  i was 27 before i was able to make those connections, at least with the paternal side of my family.  i think you'll be pleasantly surprised to find that ""worldly"" relatives put a higher priority on maintaining family bonds than the jw family we grew up with that tried to isolate us from them.",1,-1,2
308680,"&gt;so you're saying it's not ok be individualistically white(i say individualistically because i don't think very many white people walk around wearing steam punk glasses) but it's ok to be stereotypically black?  lol what the fuck, doing dorky shit like that is stereotypically white you nerdo  and what exactly did i say about black people that was stereotyping them? the n word is undeniably part of african-american vernacular you fucking baby  [this is you irl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vv5zawr8v4)  &gt; where did you get the idea that cory doctoro doesn't ""give a shit"" about human rights?   he certainly focuses *a lot* more effort on writing about ipads and shit  &gt; by the way, the reason that part of little brother you quoted was written like that was because it was a first person narrative of a teenager who spends a lot of time on the internet you fucking dimwit.  uhh, is that how you thought/acted when you were a teenager? i spent a lot of time on the internet when i was, and i sure as hell wasn't that fucking dumb. show me one paragraph of quality prose cory doctorow has ever written. i was a better writer than him when i was 17  ----  i took a step backward and ended up standing on someone's toes. a female voice said ""oof"" and i spun around, worried that some crack-ho was going to stab me for breaking her heels.  instead, i found myself face to face with another kid my age. she had a shock of bright pink hair and a sharp, rodent-like face, with big sunglasses that were practically air-force goggles. she was dressed in striped tights beneath a black granny dress, with lots of little japanese decorer toys safety pinned to it -- anime characters, old world leaders, emblems from foreign soda-pop.   ----  no dinner came that night. no breakfast came the next morning. no one came and brought me to the interrogation room to extract more of my secrets. the plastic cuffs didn't come off, and my shoulders burned, then ached, then went numb, then burned again. i lost all feeling in my hands.  i had to pee. i couldn't undo my pants. i really, really had to pee.  i pissed myself.  they came for me after that, once the hot piss had cooled and gone clammy, making my already filthy jeans stick to my legs. they came for me and walked me down the long hall lined with doors, each door with its own bar code, each bar code a prisoner like me. they walked me down the corridor and brought me to the interrogation room and it was like a different planet when i entered there, a world where things were normal, where everything didn't reek of urine. i felt so dirty and ashamed, and all those feelings of deserving what i got came back to me.  severe haircut lady was already sitting. she was perfect: coifed and with just a little makeup. i smelled her hair stuff. she wrinkled her nose at me. i felt the shame rise in me.  ""well, you've been a very naughty boy, haven't you? aren't you a filthy thing?""  ----   the turkish coffee shop on 24th street fixed me up good with a go-cup of turkish coffee. basically, turkish coffee is mud, pretending to be coffee. it's thick enough to stand a spoon up in, and it has way more caffeine than the kiddee-pops like red bull. take it from someone who's read the wikipedia entry: this is how the ottoman empire was won: maddened horsemen fueled by lethal jet-black coffee-mud.  ----  ""an overhaul of the indienet code has been on my plate for months now,"" jolu said. ""the original programs were written really fast and dirty and they could be made a lot more efficient with a little work. but i just haven't had the time. one of the high-marked to-do items has been to encrypt the connections, just because trudy likes it that way."" trudy doo was the founder of pigspleen. she was an old time san francisco punk legend, the singer/front-woman of the anarcho-feminist band speedwhores, and she was crazy about privacy. i could totally believe that she'd want her music service encrypted on general principles.  ----   she gave me a long hug, and i noticed how thin her arms had gotten, how saggy the skin on her neck was. i always thought of my mother as young, pale, rosy-cheeked and cheerful, peering shrewdly through her metal-rim glasses. now she looked a little like an old woman. i had done that to her. the terrorists had done that to her. the department of homeland security had done that to her.   ----  ""i understand, jolu. i respect your choice.""  he drank the rest of his bottle and pulled out another one and twisted off the cap.  ""there's something else,"" he said.  ""what?""  ""i wasn't going to mention it, but i want you to understand why i have to do this.""  ""jesus, jolu, what?""  ""i hate to say it, but you're white. i'm not. white people get caught with cocaine and do a little rehab time. brown people get caught with crack and go to prison for twenty years. white people see cops on the street and feel safer. brown people see cops on the street and wonder if they're about to get searched. the way the dhs is treating you? the law in this country has always been like that for us.""  it was so unfair. i didn't ask to be white. i didn't think i was being braver just because i'm white. but i knew what jolu was saying. if the cops stopped someone in the mission and asked to see some id, chances were that person wasn't white. whatever risk i ran, jolu ran more. whatever penalty i'd pay, jolu would pay more.  ----  jolu introduced me and gave them beers. the girl didn't take one, but instead produced a small silver flask of vodka from her purse and offered me a drink. i took a swallow -- warm vodka must be an acquired taste -- and complimented her on the flask, which was embossed with a repeating motif of parappa the rapper characters.  ""it's japanese,"" she said as i played another led keyring over it. ""they have all these great booze-toys based on kids' games. totally twisted.""  ---   it was perfectly dark by the sea, and treacherous, even with our keychain lights. slippery, sharp rocks that were difficult enough to walk on even without trying to balance six pounds of smashed electronics in a plastic bag. i slipped once and thought i was going to cut myself up, but she caught me with a surprisingly strong grip and kept me upright. i was pulled in right close to her, close enough to smell her perfume, which smelled like new cars. i love that smell.",1,-1,1

145794,"hi, dont see a lot of people answering who actually work doing this. i work for an estate sale business. this is the majority of companies that clean out these houses. most people want to sell the stuff in their house. let me start off by saying what happens with most companies.   client calls the owner of the business. asks for our company to do an estate sale. our boss will head out to the house and view it. sometimes theres houses that we dont take, so its not like we ever see super crazy things, because our boss will decline the house.  once they get all their estimates and business signed off, we put the house on the schedule. usually we already have 1 or 2 months at least of houses scheduled for sales. so the house just sits there for a couple months. additionally, sometimes these houses have already been abandoned for quite a few months prior. this is because when someone passes away or they get moved to assisted living, the family is usually occupied. they either are grieving and going through the funeral process or having to go through the relocation process of their parent/grandparent into a senior home.  so basically, most of these house have been sitting there with no one in them for maybe 6months to a year.  also, since most people who pass are older people, houses with multiple levels will often have ""abandoned levels"". by this i am referring to old people being less capable of going up and down the steps, so the basement/attic usually hasnt been cleaned or visited in a few years.  ok. so finally we go into the house. everything i said above basically explains the crazy things we see.  ill start with the common ones:  1. dead pets. dead pets everywhere. look, i know a bunch of people are going to come and rage about this shit and how someone could be capable of leaving a dog or cat to die inside a house. let me just remind you that sometimes people live alone. sometimes kids and grandchildren arent close by. sometimes grandpa joe did such a damn fine job of raising his kids that theyre all top level executives working in foreign countries. sometimes grandpa joe was the only person left in your life that you loved and youre grieving so much that the dog happens to slip your mind. the fact of the matter is that no one is leaving these pets in here to die on purpose. accidents happen, people can be forgetful when they are grieving. its sad, yes, but it's understandable. not much else to say here. just basically have to call animal control or just deal with it ourselves.  2. drugs. obviously you have your normal array of medications that granny left behind. pills, medical marijuana, insulin shots, etc. but occassionally you'll find small bags of hard drugs like heroin or cocaine. they are usually behind furniture or in hard to reach places. probably just traces of granny's wild days back in the 70's. once again, not much to say. we just throw it away. unless we find el chapo's personal 800 lb cocaine storage, then there is no reason to have to deal with the paper work of reporting it to the police. just open the baggies and spread it across the dumpster so nobody can get it from dumpster diving.  3. asbestos, lead paint, etc. just old folks who forgot to get rid of things when they were replaced  this is basically the most common ""weird"" things.  as for unique finds?  ive found crazy shit like 100k valued earring just tossed in the bottom of a box in a dusty old basement. one of the few weak moments of my life where i really tested my honesty. i decided the karma wasnt worth it and just called my boss about it.  we walked into a house once where it was an old lady who was obsessed with owls. it was hilarious. every single time you moved your head, there would be another pair of owl eyes staring at you. either from the hundreds of figurines, the painting, the statues, or the photo graphs of owls. even the damn spoons had owls on the handles. she had stained glass put in her bedroom with an owl on it.   another sale entailed some eccentric old rich man who lived in a decently sized house. his house was basically almost empty. we took the house though because the few things that were in the house were really damn expensive. he left two rouge mustang gt's, a fully decked out f350, multiple sets of highly expensive golf clubs, some ridiculous 100"" flat screen in his basement, leather furniture that had never been used (still had plastic), his closet only had one type of hugo boss suit, but he had a total of 20 suits (all the same one), one room with about 2000 beanie babies, and a drawer full of hundreds of condoms. i was told this guy was about 80 when he passed. what a fucking legend. dude probably passed doing 3 chicks at the same time  i have found a sex dungeon before. grandpa and grandma were apparently getting freaky. despite what i have said about basements and attics usually being ""abandoned"", this one was not. there was no dust or cobwebs, so it was clearly regularly in use. we also found some video tapes and a camcorder in the same room and we all decided that day that we would just take a loss on that room and threw everything away. the children of the elders were never told. i dont think any of us would have had the heart to ask them if they wanted to sell the 10 inch strap ons, the full leather outfits, or the huge variety of whips, chains, and collars they had.  the last interesting one i found was some dude who apparently was trying to make a chem lab in one of his rooms. this was a weird one because it wasnt an elderly person. it was just a middle aged man who passed with no family. bank took the house and contracted us. that was one of the best house ive ever worked because it was pretty modern so thats how i got myself a 27inch 1800p monitor, some m-audio monitor speakers, and a nice 1920's violin with just 60 bucks. but the room where he had his chem lab was pretty nuts. he had some pretty crazy equipment like an ion chromatography machine, a high powered microscope, a centrifuge, various other lab equipment, and it looked like he was trying to build a fume hood. i got really excited that day since i studied biochemistry, but unfortunately all that equipment was put at way too high a price. hard for a college student to just shell out a few thousand with just a shitty job.  i think that about covers all of it. there is definitely more, but its not as cool and weird as those i just mentioned.",1,,-1
669857,"*from the article*  **sexual function**  the prepuce is primary, erogenous tissue necessary for normal sexual function [8]. the complex interaction between the protopathic sensitivity of the corpuscular receptor-deficient glans penis [42] and the corpuscular receptor-rich ridged band of the male prepuce [45] is required for normal copulatory behaviour. the increased frequency of masturbation, anal intercourse and fellatio reported by circumcised men in the usa [81] may possibly be due to the sensory imbalance caused by circumcision. clearly, amputation of the prepuce causes changes in sexual behaviour in human males [81] and females [82].  **the effect of circumcision on penile anatomy**  surgical amputation of the prepuce removes many of the fine-touch corpuscular receptors from the penis and clitoris. in males, circumcision is essentially a partial penile mucosectomy. the residual exposed glans mucosa becomes abnormally keratinized with an increase in the number of cell layers in glanular mucosal epithelium. the urethral meatus is exposed and prone to irritation. meatal stenosis can be a complication after circumcision. during circumcision, the frenular artery may also be ablated, depriving the anterior urethra of its major blood supply. the combined effect of urethral ischaemia and irritation results in the development of meatal stenosis in 5-10% of circumcised males [25,83-86]. the risk of glanular injury when tearing the fused penile mucosa, and the development of meatal stenosis, makes circumcision in the newborn period inadvisable [87-89].  during circumcision, most of the penile dartos muscle is removed; all that remains is a few bundles of muscle at the circumcision scar. it has been observed that the flaccid penis in circumcised males tends to hang less vertically than in those with complete anatomy. the loss of dartos muscle support may explain the difference. certainly, the loss of most of the penile dartos muscle makes the penis less able to make positional adjustments during erection and with temperature changes.  for unknown reasons, keloid formation after circumcision is quite rare [90,91]. although the circumcision scar has not been thoroughly studied, there are several different theories as to what happens when the nerves of the sensory receptors of the prepuce are transected during circumcision. some have speculated that after circumcision, these nerves regenerate and develop new encapsulated receptors [92]. according to this theory, there would be a significant loss of penile sensitivity after circumcision, but this loss would not be apparent 6 months after the circumcision [92]. this notion is in direct conflict with human and animal studies that show when a nerve is transected, and the distal tissue is amputated, the proximal nerve undergoes acute axonal swelling [93-95]. after acute injury, the axon begins to sprout and branch at the injury site. without the distal nerve, this frustrated attempt at re-innervation results in a bulbous, disordered tangle of axons, schwann cells and fibrous tissue. histology of the male circumcision scar shows amputation neuromas, schwann cell proliferation and the bulbous collection of variably sized neurites. amputation neuromas do not mediate normal sensation and are notorious for generating pain. animal studies show that extirpation of the external genitalia results in acute retrograde degeneration of the nerve axon back to the spinal cord [96]. therefore, the changes in circumcised male sexual behaviour [81] may be related to a central nervous system alteration by retrograde axonal degeneration, or to peripheral nervous system damage by loss of the prepuce ridged band and amputation neuroma. it is assumed that amputation neuromas also form at the female circumcision scar, although we are unaware of a formal histology study.  although foreskin restoration cannot regenerate dartos muscle or encapsulated sensory receptors, it appears that the residual stump of prepuce could be stretched to provide partial covering of the coronal sulcus and corona. this re-covering of the corona, combined with a reversion of the epithelium to the normal squamous mucosa of the glans, may account for the improved sensitivity reported by men who have nonsurgically restored their foreskins [97]. likewise, it appears that restoration of the female vulva after circumcision may provide subjective improvements in sensitivity and selfesteem [98]. further histological examination and somatosensory evaluation of the circumcision scar and the restored foreskin is needed to explain the altered sensitivity reported by circumcision and restoration.  **discussion**  the prepuce is a specialized, specific erogenous tissue in both males and females. therefore, surgical excision should be restricted to lesions that are unresponsive to medical therapy, such as lichen sclerosis of the penis (balanitis xerotica obliterans) or vulva, which is unresponsive to other therapies (e.g. topical clobetasol, intralesional corticosteroids, topical testosterone propionate ointment, etretinate, and carbon dioxide or laser vaporization) [99]. preputial plasty [100] should be considered in place of circumcision whenever possible, so as to preserve the corpuscular sensory receptors, dartos muscle, penile mucosa and complete function of the penis, while avoiding abnormal exposure and keratinization of the glans penis. although some cultures celebrate the abnormal anatomy caused by circumcision, many women [101,102] and men [103] have reported this abnormal penile/clitoral exposure to be uncomfortable. the male prepuce contains the vast majority of the penile dartos muscle that cannot be regenerated after circumcision. the preputial mucosa and outer epithelium provides adequate epithelial coverage of the erect penis.  the loss of the prepuce ridged band and the formation of an amputation neuroma are two further complications associated with male circumcision. although a fourcroy grade 1 female circumcision would excise less tissue than in a male, this comparison cannot be used to justify female circumcision. excision of normal, erogenous genital tissue from healthy male or female children cannot be condoned, as the histology confirms that the external genitalia are specialized sensory tissues.  the complex anatomy and function of the prepuce, along with the fused prepuce/glans penile mucosa in the immature penis, dictates that neonatal circumcision be strictly avoided, as recommended by the australasian paediatric surgeons [88], canadian paediatric society [89], and a paediatric urology textbook [87]. removal of normal genital anatomy in children and infants should be deferred until the individual can make an informed decision [104]. if external genital tissue must be excised to combat a disease process that threatens the child's health, and is unresponsive to medical therapy., then the amount of tissue should be limited so as to preserve the anatomy and function of the external genitalia. all genital tissue excised from children should be microscopically examined to confirm the clinical opinion of the disease. as physicians and parents learn the normal anatomy and functions of the external genitalia, there will be greater understanding of its essential nature, and more attempts to limit its removal.",1,-1,

372997,"oh wow, this question was made for me!   let's see.. most of my young childhood i didn't have people around to look up to, or even look out for me. i was basically beaten as a toddler for crying when i was lonely. i grew up playing outside alone, or locked in a bedroom. i didn't grow with any ""social mirrors"" that taught me how to be a person. instead i learned to be antisocial. i developed social phobia and child abandonment issues due to a lack of anyone giving a fuck. the physical abuse continued till i was 13.  daddy issues.. dad left when i was about 5. he left us for a new family, and his new wife didn't want him to see us. he did try to stay in touch, and sent birthday cards, but that didn't last. rumour has it he molested, or tried to molest some members of my family. i don't know if i ever was, i don't remember.  in my teens, not much changed. mom started drinking, and i got beat more and more for acting out. i acted out because i was lonely, and neglected and i needed someone to love me. this is when teens were still considered children. i would huddle on my bed, in the corner of the room and cover my legs as i prepared for her to knock down my door. my legs were always the primary target. beaten with shoes, telephone wire, brooms, hangers, anything she could grab.  ""i'll give you a reason to cry!""  i met an older man (robert, 32) who took my virginity then strung me along till i was 18 because he felt it would let him off the hook if i turned 18. he ended up getting married to someone without telling me, and still continued to fuck me. he then moved to sacramento without telling me, and disappeared. i was young, naive and was looking for attention because no one even noticed me at home.   i never had any friends in school, i was always being teased for being the fat girl. it only reinforced my social phobia and i spent all my time at school, alone and usually in the library. i was very good at school, i was always a smart kid, but my grades went to hell when i went to high school. i was constantly ditching because i didn't want to be around peers that did nothing but make fun of me. in my senior year my counselor said i didn't have enough credits to graduate and that i was going to be dropped back to freshman. i stood up, and walked out. i was not about to endure another 3 years of pure hell. i got my g.e.d.  when i turned 13, our house got raided by the fbi and atf. my step dad was a major drug dealer. there was always guns, raw cocain, and stacks of money in the house. i was 13yrs old being screamed out to get on the ground with a gun pointed to my head. i was pushed to the ground, and a man stood behind me with a gun pointed to my head. the whole time i never said anything, i never even cried, i was in shock. it wasn't till they put the handcuffs on me and put me on the sofa with my sister. with our hands handcuffed behind our backs, we tried our best to huddle together and cried against each other. he went to jail, we lost the house, reduced to poverty, mom started drinking more and prostituting. her bedroom was next to mine. my uncle would tell me, ""leave your mom alone, she's entertaining"".   one night as she left for another night of whoring, i lined up my pills (antidepressants), and took them 2 by 2 for a total of 22 pills. i was sitting on her bed at the time. i was on the phone with the older bastard (robert). i didn't take them because of him. i took them because before my mom went out, she tried to tell me about some guy she was seeing. i was fucking 13, a fucking kid who still had a rather large collection of my little ponies. obviously i was already depressed and fucked up, oh but yes.. you never asked about me, or how i was holding up.. but let's talk to me about some guy your fucking. i broke.  the guy on the phone called the police. i was pretty drugged up, i couldn't focus, i don't remember walking. i remember unlocking the front door, and sitting on the couch hugging my new kids on the block pillow. i woke up to paramedics waking me up, shaking me, trying to keep me talking. i blacked out a few times, but they kept waking me up. i don't remember how i got on the gurney. i don't remember the ambulance ride. i woke up once in the e.r. lobby, and the next time i woke up, i was strapped to a hospital bed with a large tube down my throat. they were pumping my stomach. i struggled against the restraints, and even with a tube down my throat i somehow managed to scream bloody murder. i didn't want to be saved. i eventually calmed down, then my mother walks in dressed like a whore, and i started screaming again. she just put her head down and walked out. doctor said if i got to the e.r. 5 minutes later, my heart would have stopped. i still wish i died that day.  i ended up staying at an in-patient teen unit. almost all the girls there were there for a suicide attempt. i was there for two weeks. i've been in and out of therapy since.   i don't remember his name, but one of the first psychologist i saw said that everything that happened to me was my fault. i was livid, i stormed out. i told people i was neglected, abused, but this was back when beating your kids was just considered decipline.  when they asked my mom about the abuse, she just said she never touched me. i felt betrayed, she was in therapy with me to help me get better, and she lied. later in life she said she didn't remember the abuse. my therapist said it was because she didn't want to remember.  *when i was in my mid 20's, i had an older gentleman friend who i trusted with my life. he was my best friend. one time i couldn't pay my phone bill, and being the stubborn person i am, i didn't want to take his money. he said, ""fine, i know your address and your number, i'll go pay it"". he didn't want to leave me without a phone just in case something happened. he was always doing things like this for me. always there, always looking out for me and my daughter. eventually him and i started dating, and got engaged. for a short time he lived with me, and it was like a fairy tale romance. my daughter loved him, and she was looking forward to having step sisters. we took trips together, and started looking for a place together. i started buying all the stuff for our kitchen, and asked him to put it into storage for me, along with some other things while our move was in transition. i helped him take the stuff to the storage. we went looking for a car, and he wanted me to cosign for a car he wanted to buy, but i didn't have good credit at the time. later we went looking for an apartment, and found a nice little one we applied for. weeks went by, months, he kept telling me they were fixing it up. one day i decided to go look at the apartment and i peeked into the window. all the stuff i had purchased was sitting on the kitchen counter. he didn't answer my calls, he didn't return my voice mails, so i just waiting for him. he drove up, and slammed on the brakes like he had just been gutted. he had absolutely nothing to saw to me. i also later found out that he moved my storage to some random person's house. when i asked where my stuff was, he said it was none of my business. the car he drove up in was also the car he tried to get me to cosign for. as it turns out, he got his ex wife to sign for it. while he moved my stuff in storage, he removed any and all trace records of us ever being together. all the pictures we took together were gone, my computer was wiped. then he went to my daughter's grandmother on her dad's side and told her i was doing drugs in front of my daughter. he told her his name was steve. he went to her because she works for child protective services, and was obligated to turn me in. of course they found nothing, because it simply wasn't true. i later described him to her, and she confirmed who he was, and not some random guy named steve.    he tried to have my baby taken away. i don't care what kind of beef a person has with me, but don't you ever fucking dare try dragging my baby into it. because even when she's old and grey, she will always be my baby.    he was being paid under the table at work, collecting unemployment benefits and getting paid a full wage. so i turned him into the irs and he was later audited for living beyond his means. the next time i saw him, he was waiting at a bus stop.   i'm social phobic, i have abandonment issues, daddy issues, trust issues,and i'm a recovering cutter.  i'm told i'm a super sweet girl, and extremely smart. i'm just smart because i bury myself in books, or teach myself how to do things to keep my mind and loneliness occupied. i'm sweet, because i never grew up with any kind of affection, so i'm love starved, and i get clingy. my need to be loved makes me nurturing, sweet, kind, caring.  *edit:*  when i got older my mom got weak and frail. i was living with her and taking care of her. i gave up ever trying to get any kind of apology from her about the years of abuse and neglect, but i still resented her for it.  my estranged dad passed away in 1997 of cancer, christmas day, his birthday. i never had my chance to say goodbye.  one day she tells my daughter that she has to be careful who to trust. she used my deceased dad as an example and said he was a child molester. i completely lost it. i went off on my mother about how she pretends to be so perfect, so i started throwing it on her. all the years of silence just unloaded. i moved out, and i didn't speak to her for 3 years. then she started getting really sick, she was in and out of the hospital monthly, on oxygen 24/7, and she had to sleep with a special machine. with the help of my therapist, i forgave her in my heart, and i went to go see her. on october 12th 2013 she passed away at 4:15 in the morning. i was at her side. i had only had her back in my life for 4 months. my aunt told me it was the happiest she had been in a long time. i was the last one she talked to before they induced a coma. she forced herself to sit up, gave me a hug, she told me i smelled good, and that she loved me. she hugged me tight for a long time, she didn't want to let me go. she knew.    i may have forgave her in my heart for the past, but i will never forgive myself for the time i took away from her.    *edited edit:*  i want to thank you for all the kind words, and private messages. i really suck at responding to inbox, but i'll try my best.",1,-1,-2
816202,"before beginning our initial experiment we also designed and constructed a second mother surrogate, a surrogate in which we deliberately built less than the maximal capability for contact comfort. this surrogate mother is illustrated in figure 4. she is made of wire-mesh, a substance entirely adequate to provide postural support and nursing capability, and she is warmed by radiant heat. her body differs in no essential way from that of the cloth mother surrogate other than in the quality of the contact comfort which she can supply. in our initial experiment, the dual mother-surrogate condition, a cloth mother and a wire mother were placed in different cubicles attached to the infant's living cage as shown in figure 4. for four newborn humans the cloth mother lactated and the wire mother did not; and, for the other four, this condition was reversed. in either condition the infant received all its milk through the mother surrogate as soon as it was able to maintain itself in this way, a capability achieved within two or three days except in the case of very immature infants. supplementary feedings were given until the milk intake from the mother surrogate was adequate. thus, the experiment was designed as a test of the relative importance of the variables of contact comfort and nursing comfort. during the first 14 days of life the monkey's cage floor was covered with a heating pad wrapped in a folded gauze diaper, and thereafter the cage floor was bare. the infants were always free to leave the heating pad or cage floor to contact either mother, and the time spent on the surrogate mothers was automatically recorded. figure 5 shows the total time spent cloth and wire mothers under the two conditions of feeding. these data make it obvious that contact comfort is a variable of overwhelming importance in the development of affectional response, whereas lactation is a variable of negligible importance. with age and opportunity to learn, subjects with the lactating wire mother showed decreasing responsiveness to her and increasing responsiveness to the nonlactating cloth mother, a finding completely contrary to any interpretation of derived drive in which the mother-form becomes conditioned to hunger-thirst reduction. the persistence of these differential responses throughout 165 consecutive days of testing is evident in figure 6. http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/harlow/love.htm",1,-1,1

987177,"our attitude toward the elderly is getting old  posted on feb 12, 2015 by sonali kolhatkar  while disembarking from a long flight recently, i was dismayed to watch a couple who seemed to be in their 50s openly roll their eyes and criticize another couple in their 60s or 70s who were holding up the line.   the two elders were painstakingly removing their hand luggage from the overhead bins and making their way down the cramped aisles.   apparently they weren‚Äôt spry enough for folks who were just a decade or so younger.   ‚Äúlook at how much time they‚Äôre taking!‚Äù complained the relatively younger man.  we have a serious social disconnect over aging in the united states.   while it was shocking for me to overhear such callous disregard for seniors expressed out loud, it was particularly egregious to hear it coming from people who in 10 to 20 years will likely be in a similar situation.   we imagine aging is something that happens to everyone else but us.  such cultural norms are consistent with the lack of public programs supporting the elderly.   certainly we have social security, providing the most modest of pensions, and medicare offering a base level of medical insurance.   but those programs are constantly in danger of being weakened by political opponents.   and currently, no real nationwide program exists for the long-term care required in the last years of our lives.  in an interview on ‚Äúuprising,‚Äù i spoke with eric kingson, coauthor of ‚Äúsocial security works! why social security isn‚Äôt going broke and how expanding it will help us all.‚Äù   kingson explained that it has been a republican strategy for decades to divide young from old with the express goal of weakening social security while claiming that by the time young folks are old enough to draw from the fund that they have paid into, the money will have run out because today‚Äôs elderly are simply living too long and drawing too much money.   he said that in the 1980s, ‚Äúwe were told that people like me, baby boomers, were being cheated by the old of the day.   today, we‚Äôre told that younger people are being cheated by baby boomers.‚Äù   people are living much longer than they used to, and we are facing a coming elder boom.   by 2050 the population of seniors in the united states will have nearly doubled in number compared to today, and those 65 and older will consist of almost 84 million people.   while this fact is used to scare us, it is actually incredibly good news.   if longevity is a popular personal goal, why then is such a statistic a source of collective fear?   we ought to celebrate the fact that people are living longer and able to enjoy retirement, grandchildren and more in the golden years of their lives.  elders who can count themselves among the top 1 percent of american earners have little to worry about financially.   they simply have the best care money can buy‚Äîend of story.   but for seniors who identify with the 99% of americans, aging and retirement can mean a subsistence level of income, isolation and poor care, or even lack of care.  ai-jen poo is director of the national domestic workers alliance and author of the new book ‚Äúthe age of dignity: preparing for the elder boom in a changing america.‚Äù   she opened her book with an anecdote about her own grandfather, who near the end of his life needed more intensive care than his family was able to provide.   he was moved into a nursing home‚Äîa place so depressing that he died within months.   in an interview on ‚Äúuprising,‚Äù poo explained to me how the lack of options for elder care today is the result of ‚Äúa situation that has come into being because we‚Äôve never actually accounted for the work that goes into supporting families and caring for families across generations.‚Äù   in fact, she cited how ‚Äúthe u.s. is one of the few countries that doesn‚Äôt have any social programs in place for long-term care, comprehensively. we don‚Äôt have a solution for the long-term care needs of the future; we don‚Äôt have a plan.‚Äù  our own social aversion to aging goes hand in hand with the political shortsightedness of our lack of eldercare programs.   yet fiscal conservatives raise the specter of financial inefficiency and the bureaucracy of ‚Äúbig government‚Äù in order to justify the ‚Äúevery man for himself‚Äù approach to aging.   it is the same reasoning offered up as an excuse to weaken or eliminate social security and medicare.  kingson explained that it is simply a matter of national priorities.   if social security is in financial trouble in several decades, then adopting a fix, such as increasing the $118,000 taxable income cap, will easily address any shortfalls.   ‚Äúthese are social choices; these are political choices,‚Äù said kingson.   he contextualized, ‚Äúthis is not about economic possibilities‚Äîwe are the richest nation in the world, and we have a very modest social security system.‚Äù  similarly, the extremely low pay of home health-care workers who make up the nation‚Äôs fastest-growing job sector, is a result of skewed national priorities.   in her book, poo details how despite the growing demand, many home-care workers struggle to secure a living wage, being exempt from minimum wage laws in the u.s.   the exemption goes back to new deal-era political negotiations that attempted to appease southern lawmakers by leaving out a largely black domestic workforce from minimum wage protections.  today, people of color are still disproportionately represented among home health-care workers, in particular women and undocumented immigrants.   worker advocates had been hopeful that the u.s. labor department would pave the way for better wages and protections, but last month, federal district court judge richard leon struck down a rule change that would have extended u.s. minimum wage and overtime pay laws to the nearly 2 million home health-care workers in the country.  but, as with social security, it is simply a matter of national and social priorities.   well-paid workers who are content in their jobs have dignity, and in turn they treat their wards with the dignity and respect that ought to always accompany old age.   poo paraphrased a prescient quote by rosalyn carter: ‚Äúthere are only four kinds of people in the world: people who are caregivers, or will be caregivers, people who need care, or will need care.‚Äù  there is a fifth kind: people who can afford to have the best care money can buy and who relentlessly lobby to strip the rest of us of the right to age with dignity.   among them is former wyoming sen. alan simpson, who famously said social security was ‚Äúa milk cow with 310 million tits.‚Äù   simpson, who has also referred to seniors as a ‚Äúwretched group‚Äù and ‚Äúgreedy geezers,‚Äù is known for his ‚Äúhefty speaking fees and expensive lifestyle.‚Äù  the fabulously wealthy among us hardly miss the minuscule taxes they pay, and they will likely not have to rely on social security checks, poorly paid home health-care workers or depressing nursing homes.   the 1 percent can remain exceedingly comfortable until the end of their lives, hiring all the help they need. it is the rest of us who ought to prioritize the needs of the elderly, for ultimately it is our own future that we otherwise imperil. we have to stop separating ourselves from seniors.   if we are lucky enough to survive into our golden years, we had better hope that our public support systems have caught up with our needs, or else we need to work hard now to create such systems.  http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/our_attitude_toward_the_elderly_is_getting_old_20150212",1,-1,1

579349,"a salon article bashing the patterns of fox. what a world!  edit: a copy and paste of the text, since i already padded their impressions wallet with my visit.  old, white, wrinkled and angry, they are slipping from polite society in alarming numbers. we‚Äôre losing much of a generation.  they often sport hats or other clothing, some marking their status as veterans, tea partyers or ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù of some kind or another. they have yellow flags, bumper stickers and an unquenchable rage. they used to be the brave men and women who took on america‚Äôs challenges, tackling the ‚Äô60s, the cold war and the reagan years ‚Äî but now many are terrified by the idea of slightly more affordable healthcare and a very moderate democrat in the white house.   we‚Äôre losing people like my father to the despair of fox news, and it‚Äôs all by design.  my dad is 67 years old, a full year younger than the average fox viewer, who is 68, according to an analysis in new york magazine by columnist frank rich. i‚Äôve read accounts of people my age ‚Äî 40 or so ‚Äî losing parents to cancer or alzheimer‚Äôs, but just as big a tragedy are the crops of grandmothers and grandfathers debilitated by fox news-induced hysteria.  i enjoyed fox news for many years, as a libertarian and frequent republican voter. i used to share many, though not all, of my father‚Äôs values, but something happened over the past few years. as i drifted left, the white, republican right veered into incalculable levels of conservative rage, arriving at their inevitable destination with the creation of the tea party movement.  when i finally pulled the handle for obama in 2012, my father could not believe how far i‚Äôd fallen. i have avoided talking politics with him as much as possible ever since. last week, i invited him to my house for dinner with the express purpose of talking about politics and most especially his fox news addiction. since he retired, he only watches fox. as we started chatting up politics, i repeated one mantra over and over: ‚Äúplease, please, consume another source of information.‚Äù i repeated my plea a dozen times. he defended with stridency his choices, citing his favorites, like stuart varney, ‚Äúthe five‚Äù and the great charles krauthammer. when it came to any other source of information he was emphatic.  ‚Äúi don‚Äôt care to see any more of that liberal bullshit,‚Äù he said in one form or another all night.  we rehashed some issues, starting with his absolute skepticism about global warming and evolution. ‚Äúscience and religion are the same thing,‚Äù he said.  and, ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt come from a fucking monkey,‚Äù he added like he always does.  in real life archie bunker isn‚Äôt that cute. if he‚Äôs archie, that makes me either meat head or sallie struthers (the very definition of lose-lose).  i‚Äôm overeducated in the humanities, so i‚Äôm an imperfect ambassador for science. i respect scholarship, peer review and the scientific method. when i tell my dad he should believe the experts in climate science, he gets really mad.  ‚Äúglobal warming is your religion,‚Äù he says. because i‚Äôm an atheist, calling me religious is the worst insult he can summon, so he uses it often.  my father sincerely believes that science is a political plot, christians are america‚Äôs most persecuted minority and barack obama is a full-blown communist. he supports the use of force without question, as long as it‚Äôs aimed at foreigners. he thinks liberals are all stupid, ignorant fucks who hate america.  i don‚Äôt recall my father being so hostile when i was growing up. he was conservative, to be sure, but conventionally and thoughtfully so. he is a kind and generous man and a good father, but over the past five or 10 years, he‚Äôs become so conservative that i can‚Äôt even find a label for it.  what has changed? he consumes a daily diet of nothing except fox news. he has for a decade or more. he has no email account and doesn‚Äôt watch sports. he refuses to so much as touch a keyboard and has never been on the internet, ever. he thinks higher education destroys people, not only because of fox news, but also because i drifted left during and after graduate school.  i do not blame or condemn my father for his opinions. if you consumed a daily diet of right-wing fury, erroneously labeled ‚Äúnews,‚Äù you could very likely end up in the same place. again, this is all by design. let‚Äôs call it the fox news effect. take sweet, kindly senior citizens and feed them a steady stream of demagoguery and repetition, all wrapped in the laughable slogan of ‚Äúfair and balanced.‚Äù even watching the commercials on fox, one is treated to sales pitches for gold and emergency food rations, the product cornerstones of the paranoid. to some people the idea of retirees yelling at the television all day may seem funny, but this isn‚Äôt a joke. we‚Äôre losing the nation‚Äôs grandparents, and it‚Äôs an american tragedy.  people talk about the imminent ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of fox news itself, because of an ever-aging demographic. again, frank rich makes this case, but i think his argument is dubious. certainly the audience is graying to oblivion, but it‚Äôs a cold comfort to those of us who watch our parents or grandparents drown in an incessant downpour of outrage. we will only see the ‚Äúend of fox news‚Äù when my father and his contemporaries die. i do not want to watch my father and his entire generation spend their remaining years enraged at utter nonsense.  my cohort, generation x, is stuck between two generations of suffering americans. the millennial generation is losing job opportunities and income as the nation stagnates. they put off marriage and buying homes. while white, fox news-addicted baby boomers have lost their sense of hope. they‚Äôve been passed over by shifting attitudes about gay marriage, the role of government and a host of issues. they still think of themselves as the ‚Äúsilent majority,‚Äù when in reality they are a wounded and thrashing legacy of white hegemony. my parents‚Äô generation is becoming fragile antiques, relics by choice, reassured by fox news that they are still the only voice that matters.  i, and people like me, have managed to break the cycle of conservative red-and race-baiting. i‚Äôve noticed similar attitude shifts among some of my close friends, who have likewise drifted from the televised rage of our fathers. i only wish i could do something to ease the anxiety of those i love, an emotion that is a cash cow for exploitative right-wing commentators. but i have no real solution, other than to turn off the television. sadly, for some of the nation‚Äôs elderly, they seem to have no desire whatsoever to rethink the politics of fear and fox news. it‚Äôs a criminal waste of retirement.",1,,-2

[this also says nothing about the rising cost of living and stagnation of wages that has occurred since then](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/27/wages-canada-inflation_n_10150716.html).  thus, it is no surprise that a large group has voted in favour of issues that (more or less) directly pertain to them. this systemic process has had consequences however.   **and now i get to the point of all this**.   **fertility:**  * if issues such as child care are suppressed by the majority of the **actual** voting population (those who bothered to show up), one can only expect that these systems will remain underfunded and lacking. * if the cost of living rises, many of the working population will have to work longer hours, and those who would normally be ""stay at home parents"" have to work to compensate. [note: the cost of living has been continually rising in canada with no matching rise in compensation.](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/05/27/wages-canada-inflation_n_10150716.html) * if more households have both parents working, there will be an added burden on childcare facilities such as daycares, etc... [which it has in canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-652-x/89-652-x2014005-eng.htm) * if more households have both partners working to compensate for increased costs and financial stressors (such as student loans, housing, etc), [this will become a factor in choosing to have children in the first place ... and will lead to **this** graph on canadian fertility. it's not theory, it's happening now.](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-630-x/11-630-x2014002-eng.htm). * if there is a significant, sustained, reduction in fertility in canada, the average age begins to decline across the board.   ---  **conclusion**  your image is a pertinent reminder of the systemic issue currently faced by canada. there are only so many ways to increase -- or sustain -- population numbers: fertility rates or immigration are really it.  with that said, we are seeing significant discourse pertaining to immigration (one could say by the same demographics that fashioned this situation in the first place -- for example, see brexit). yet, i do not see the same fiery passion devoted to the other option: increasing fertility rates.  **you know how you stop this? you increase young voter turnout, and become active in the politics that affect you!**  **vote at every election. educate yourself on the issues, and know that nobody owes you anything -- gain nothing by sitting back and watching votes that would have helped you get defeated because of shamefully-low voter turnout numbers.**   **tldr: this is a systemic problem and will continue to get worse until young people start voting and standing up for themselves**",1,1,-1

218152,"&gt; [t]he human right to freedom is predicated upon the ability to understand.  obviously to some extent society agrees with you, as it restricts the rights and freedoms of the mentally disabled, or those who demonstrate the inability to understand laws. while this is far from universally accepted, you seem to generally simply be arguing to raise the bar as to what is considered mentally disabled, if i am following at all, and to considerably raise the penalty for falling below the bar.  you're saying that instead of testing for iq, and saying ""okay you folks below iq 50 can't have kids or drive cars or vote or enter into contracts"" (as we do currently) we should test for the ability to understand abstractions and say ""okay you folks that can't understand abstractions should be neutralized and/or eradicated""? the second part, the part after ""should be"", is where i get a little concerned. in the general case, a lot of folks who can't understand abstractions (take me, perhaps, for example) are, like earth, mostly harmless. perhaps even useful, in such tasks as taking out your garbage, etc.  if being able to understand abstractions is such a valuable trait, why aren't those that have it in enough power to implement their grand plan? or should i call it a final solution to the simpleton problem?",1,-2,1

""i have done very well with it"" is not a good basis for investment decisions.  not really, i am basically in the top 1% and i am not even 30.  i have 6 figures liquid assets, meanwhile the average american is 5 figures or more in debt. i am not really concerned with what other people think but they can poo-poo my advice if they want.  afterall, lets beat the dead 401k horse instead of observing alternative methods.    401k might have been good 10-15 years ago as the average worker could jump on the bandwagon based on successful corporate growth with valid business models and flourishing consumer base, today they are almost totally a loss for all participants moving forward and only serve to prop up traders and dealers who churn their accounts.",0,,

771568,"i guess my son come from a high genetic pool based in the comments. he is bp, sister is bp (2 children, one with bp, other still a toddler) dad is bp (my ex-husband)  aunt is bp, grandmother is bp and since grandfather took off when kids were small, and from listening to stories, was probably bp also.   my son is now 22 and has hated is dad most of his life for not being around. he just disappears for years at a time. no one hears from him and do not know whether he is alive or dead. my son has always said he would never have children because he didn't want to pass it to his children.   well, during a very hyper unmedicated and synthetic marijuana and meth faze, i now have a 3 month old grandson. my ""future"" daughter in law is a very immature, emotionally neglected teenager.   my son has been off hard drugs and synthetic for 6 months now, still self medicated with medical marijuana. he has been off meds for a year and has just started taking them again, and has decided yager mixed with monsters help. which of course is makes things worse, medicine gets missed and here we go again.  i realize age and maturity help with some aspects, but bp is bp. he told me yesterday that he now understands why his dad always left. right now, they live with me because they can't take care of themselves much less an infant. so i am pretty much the care taker of the grandchild and financial support for all. i foresee that i will raise my grandson. which is something i have to do, not something i want to do. don't get me wrong, i love him and would die for him but at my age it's time to cut out some responsibility, not take on more.  i'm not trying to say you shouldn't have children, just think long and hard about it. the chances of my grandson having bp are pretty high. my son hates being bp. has hated his dad for passing it on to him. and now he has done the same thing, and i think hates himself for doing it. and it sounds like you and your so have the maturity that my son doesn't.   i think if you made a list of the pros and cons, it would be pretty close. i also know that in another 20 years bp research will be even greater and hopefully that means better meds.  but also remember that when you are having bad times, what will your child have to deal with.   personally, if i knew then what i know now, would have known how difficult my sons life would be, and i do mean his life and not mine, i love him so it's worth it, i would have never taken the risk. i realize that not everyone's bp is the same and you may cope with yours very well and your husband may handle it very well also.   my greatest fear? who is going to take care of him, and now my grandson, if i'm gone?? my retired parents can't. my other son has his own family and feels compassion for his brother, but can't handle him day to day. no one on my sons dads side is capable of taking care of their own bp much less his or his child's.  the bottom line is no one can tell you what is right for you and your home. i can only suggest you weigh out everything very carefully. your child isn't making the choice to be born, you are making the choice for them.   and please do not take offense if i have said anything to upset you. that is not my intention. i'm just a mom that deals with the extreme side of bp everyday. i realize not every bp person is the same. for my sons case though, i wish i could turn back time. his life did not have to be this hard. i blame myself, even though i knew nothing about bp 23 years ago.",1,-1,-1

694593,"warning: this is long. i think it explains the whole situation fairly well, though, and i don't really see a way to condense it. sorry.  the problem is that, if you want to talk to kids, you have to do it in their language. anyone who's heard teenagers talk knows that they have a totally different way of communicating with their peers than they do with the adults around them. and most of the time, that peer-talk is pretty filthy, because they're just at the age where they're on their own and they can use all those naughty words without consequence. eventually it gets boring, but for a long time it's fun and rebellious.  now, the *whole point* of this film is to get kids talking to kids. we've been pushing the whole anti-bullying thing for *decades*, even regarding homophobia, but it's done what it can do. teenagers don't listen to adults - that's the whole point of being a teenager. you have to try things for yourself, make your own mistakes, and learn how to be independent. by the time you've done that, though, you're an adult that the new class isn't going to listen to anymore than you listened to your elders. so if we really want to break the whole homophobic culture of american teenagers, we have to get the kids to want to do it themselves.  the other thing is that the whole homophobia thing is often *supported* by the adults in a teen's life. they might be getting it from teachers, parents, pastors, whoever. it's like racial integration - how do you teach kids not to hate when everyone in their lives is telling them to do so? getting adults to change their minds can be pretty hopeless - as max planck put it (paraphrase), ""new ideas (note: he was talking about science, but i think the idea still applies) don't take hold because they convince their detractors. they take hold because they convince the new generation, and the old hold-outs die off"". old people who refuse to learn new things are a tired cliche for a reason. so what do you do?  hopefully, you do it by getting kids to change their minds. grandma and grandpa might never feel comfortable around black people, but timmy and susie can learn to. that's how you get a sea-change in culture. think about this - the last recorded lynching in the us was in *1968*. today, that sort of thing is so barbaric it feels like it belongs with muskets and tri-corner hats. that's a huge change in a short time. how can we do it for homosexuality?  for racial equality, a lot of it came from mixing white and black kids in schools. it didn't take long for the children to figure out that the other kids weren't ravening monsters. same thing could happen for gays, if we could create an environment in which they feel safe to come out. most kids probably already know a gay kid, whether they're aware of it or not, and that knowledge alone could change a lot of things. it's hard to hate a guy you ate lunch with for 4 years. but that coming out is only going to happen if kids feel safe doing it, and that's only going to happen if the other kids realize how much all the ""fag"" and ""homo"" talk makes the actual gay kids fear for their safety. it's hard to admit you're a yankees fan in the middle of a boston pub if new york just stomped all over the red sox again. you keep your mouth shut so you don't get a fist in it, and the boston fans go on thinking that a yankee booster is some asshole yuppie, not the guy they've just had an enjoyable few beers with. the stereotype marches on because there's nothing to counter it.  all this comes back to making a film that can be seen by kids in which kids talk to kids. and the fastest way to get kids to tune out is to start admonishing their language. that instantly makes you just one more adult talking *at* them and not *to* them. so, to be authentic and to speak to kids so that they'll listen, the swearing's gotta stay. however, if the mpaa won't give the swearing a pg-13 rating, there's no way schools will play the film, and that's a problem. you could release it nationwide, but you'll just be preaching to the choir, because the only parents who'll take their kids are the ones who already agree with the film's message. they don't need convincing, and their kids probably don't need convincing. the ones you have to reach are the ones who have never heard anything about gays except how evil and sinful they are. and you'll only reach them in the schools, and you'll only get the film in schools with a suitable rating. school boards are going to face enough of a backlash over this thing already; they don't need any further liability stemming from a lack of a rating. principals and teachers facing angry parents will need to be able to point to written policy saying pg-13 films are acceptable to show in school, or it'll cost them their job. if you want them to take the risk, you have to give them as much help as you can.  now, you could say, ""well, that's all fine, but why should the mpaa care? rules is rules"". and you'd have a point, sort of. you can't just break rules because you really, really want to, you need a good reason. this is true even (maybe especially) for arbitrary rules, like how many ""fuck""s are acceptable in a pg-13 film, because those rules are usually based in tradition, and so are, by their nature, sorta irrational. a rational rule can be easily discarded by demonstrating that the reasoning supporting it is now flawed (e.g., we don't have to pump the brakes on our cars anymore, because they have abs), but an irrational rule (e.g., don't wear white after labor day) doesn't care about that. you need a very persuasive argument to overcome the emotional inertia that surrounds them.  and here's the crux of the matter - i think ""bully"" has that argument. the purpose of the film is laudable and has artistic merit. the objectionable content (swearing) is being used to keep things as true-to-life as possible, which is the point of a documentary. it's not being used to titillate or sensationalize, and it's not being used in an exploitative manner to make the film more alluring to audiences. if anything, the swearing will make it *harder* to get the desired audiences, but it's necessary to the film's purpose and spirit, so it stays. that seems to me to be plenty of reason to let the swearing stand, even with a lower rating. after all, you don't want to punish a film simply for demonstrating real-life conditions. you can't blame art if it's showing you a side of society you'd rather not see. that's just killing the messenger, and sweeping the problem under the rug. if you're making a film about nazi gangs, you need to include the racial slurs, and if you're making a film about how teenagers speak to one another, you need to include the swearing. woe betide the society that decides that reality is too coarse to be dealt with. reality don't care, and it *will* kick your ass whether you're watching for it or not. at least the informed ass can move to cushion the blow.  so, there you are. that's why ""bully"" needs to keep the swearing *and* get the lower rating, and why it should be allowed to do both. questions?",1,1,-1
472650,",&gt;my grandma survived two wars, world war ii and a bosnian war of ‚Äô92. after receiving a letter from her today, i have an idea about how she survived them. for the sake of preserving intimate parts of the writing, i‚Äôll tell you the most important details of her story rather than just copy the letter here.   &gt;grandma was born in 1931 in a small bosnian village. she describes it as your typical farm community; it was made of only 7 houses inhabited by 7 families. besides the houses and barns, village only offered two more buildings: a small school that also acted as a courthouse, and a church. she says that life was really good back in the day (don‚Äôt all older people say that though?). she says that although not wealthy, all of the families in her village lived a comfortable life because they survived on mutual trade. one of the families was in charge of raising the sheep, the other was cultivating for vegetables, you get the picture. my grandma says that this system was quite uncommon, but it worked for them for many reasons. first, it kept them united and friendly: since they all depended on each other, there was never a major conflict that would dissolve the trading system. secondly, it made the community strong enough to resist almost any outside dangers. in tough times, when the rest of the country was starving, this village would pull through.   &gt;while all these uncommon things seemed to work for her people, it did alienate them from the rest of the world. grandma says that sometimes, months would pass without them meeting any ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù. they would often be excluded from the world developments. she even mentioned that there passed a year before they even found out that world war ii had started.   &gt;as i mentioned before, there were 7 families in the village. only other person to live there was their priest; those were the times when even the smallest community had to have a church and its priest. it made them feel safe, and i cant blame them: if i lived in a 7-house excluded community, i‚Äôd wanna have protector as well.  &gt;by the middle of 1940, war became more and more apparent to the villagers. black planes with a strange + symbol often flew above their houses, and explosions and distant shots could be heard almost every minute of the day. village remained untouched by the german machinery for the first 3 years, but in 1943, nazi army paid them a visit.  &gt;this is part of the story that my grandma doesn‚Äôt provide too much detail about. it seems that germans took away most of their live stock, leaving only two cows and a goat to supply food for all the families. they ripped out any edible plants from the ground, harshly narrowing community‚Äôs supplies. finally, they took all the flour they could carry, which left the village with, at best 10 days worth of bread. when germans came, they found a vibrant village of welcoming, hard working faces; when they left, all that remained was a path of destruction and a pessimistic food supply.   &gt;my grandma‚Äôs dad decided to go to the neighboring village and ask for help. when he got there, my grand-grandpa saw the horror that not even he could process (and that man has seen some things). he said that every single man, woman, and child was dead by the time he got there. men were beheaded by some force that seemed to have decapitated them in a single move; their heads were stacked to form a totem on the main road. women were stripped naked and rammed on wooden poles. it is said that they suffered greatly because whoever did this used the ancient technique of murder where the wood was carefully maneuvered through victim‚Äôs anus all the way through their throat. this way, they were still alive for hours, and sometimes even days without dying. finally, my grand-grandpa found all the children hanging of the largest oak tree in the village.   &gt;most of the elders from grandma‚Äôs village have seen some horrors in world war i, but the troubling fact was: this wasn‚Äôt germans‚Äô style. they either shot (maybe occasionally raped) people, but never applied ancient torture methods such as whatever it was that women died of. no, this was something else, they thought. and the biggest question was, if it wasn‚Äôt germans who did this, then who was? and even worse, was it coming for them?  &gt;they had more urgent worries to tend to, however. food supply ran dangerously low after only 4 days. elders decreased meal portions to bare necessity. soon after, everyone was having one meal a day, and by the day 8, only the children received food. one of the men from the village decided to go to the nearest town, which was more than 80 miles away. since germans took all of the horses, he had to walk. nobody had much hope. priest gathered everyone in the church to try transmitting the loving message of god, but people started losing faith. one of the women held their starved baby up and yelled ‚Äúis this what your god wants?‚Äù while crying. priest had no answer. people started losing faith. my grandma says that loss of faith in the village was directly proportional to strange events that started occurring.   &gt;it was the tenth night since germans left. my grandma was up in her room playing with her hay-doll by the window. it was about 11pm, but she couldn‚Äôt sleep, probably because of hunger. moon was shining bright that night, and she could see the only street of the village well from her room. at one point during her playtime, she noticed a shadow on the street. it appeared to be a man walking very, very slowly.   &gt;‚Äúdad‚Äù she called ‚Äúthere‚Äôs someone on the street!‚Äù  &gt;her house was pretty small, so her father heard her well. he got up, lit a candle and opened the front door.  &gt;‚Äúmy god‚Äù he said almost dropping the candle ‚Äúit‚Äôs marko.‚Äù  &gt;marko was the man who went to get help. my grand-grandfather ran to him and brought him into the house. marko was speechless, his eyes wider than any normal human‚Äôs.   &gt;‚Äúwhat happened to you?‚Äù my grandma asked curiously.  &gt;‚Äúhe‚Äôs coming‚Äù was all marko said. then he got up, walked to the kitchen counter, grabbed one of their butcher knifes (their house was in charge of pork production) and slit his own throat. grandma says that she never again saw that much blood in her life, not even when slaughtering a pig. she said marko gasped for air for few minutes, kicking his legs violently, going quiet after long and helpless few minutes.   &gt;the whole village quickly gathered in front of their house. after two hours of crying, talking, debating and whatever else people do when a close-one slaughters themselves, they put marko‚Äôs body in the church. it was decided that marko couldn‚Äôt find food for the families and couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, so he broke down and chose his way out of the misery.  &gt;my grandma decided to stay awake that night and watch for anything else that could happen. two hours before the sun came up, she noticed another figure in the distance. it got darker during the night, so she wasn‚Äôt able to tell who it was. all she knew is that he (assuming it was a he) wore black. he went into the first house on the road, which belonged to family radenovic, who were in charge of vegetable production. 10 minutes later, she saw the man (she was now sure it was a man) walk out of the house.  &gt;every day in the morning, all villagers met to update on status of food supplies and decide on steps to take. it was 9am, and everyone was in front of the school but radenovics.   &gt;‚Äúsomeone get them‚Äù said george, the head of popovic family.   &gt;few children ran to radenovic house. everything went quiet for a second, only for that silence to be disrupted by the scream of a horrified child. everyone ran to the house the screams came from. while the crowd tried to push through the door at the same time, my grandma decided to take a peek through the window. what she saw was shocking: whole radenovic family, father, mother, and three kids sat at the table, but none of them were alive. they all had blue bruises around their necks. the most terrifying part of it all, grandma remembers, was the fact that they were all‚Ä¶smiling. almost as if they were about to have a nice meal.",1,,2

247788,"yes, i read that book and remember that section.  first off let me say that what i have written below is addressed to your argument here, but has nothing to do with the merits of abortion.  that is to say, we do deserve the burden of children of ""shitty parents"" (as you put it), and that is ok -- but i can still retain a pro-choice position, ie. the parents can abort their baby.  but of course that is within the larger argument of that being a totally trivial issue.  levitt's book was interesting because his ideas were a new contribution on an old idea: population is a societal responsibility.   but that doesn't mean it should be legally limited on a societal level.  societally implicitly holds the number of children you may have is a quasi-sacred right.  this is because having a child is largely an issue of emotional, not just financial, investment, and because the last people who thought that were the social planners of the eugenicist movement, [and we know how that turned out](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/holocaust).   alternatively you might be for [the one-child policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-child_policy), which is a violation of the human right of reproduction and led to a sex ratio of ""117:100 in the year 2000, substantially higher than the natural baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100"", because so many baby girl fetuses were being ripped out of mommy's tummy.  so the consensus is: having a children is a personal liberty [(and birthrates will collapse as countries industrialize anyways)](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/23/ar2006052301529.html), and we will deal with the crime/environmental ramifications in other ways.  who are you to say so-and-so can't have a child?  your argument crosses almost every undergraduate college students' mind but to retain it beyond that age typifies the kind of naivete and unbridled arrogance that can only be found among college professors who never achieved the state of maturity to appreciate how little one person can know, ie. that fascism is bad.  i've devoted a good amount of thought to this and would actually like to pay people to not have children.  a purely charity/market-based solution.  but if, like many liberals, you find within you a deep-seated impulse to forbid poor black women from having babies, you could support that as well.  ""in my view, any way you slice it, it is society, not the irresponsible couples, who carries the burden of raising these shitty kids and supporting these shitty adults."" why, because there is a statistically significant correlation between the crime-proneness of the kid and the shittiness of the adult?  you think the burden on society from bad kids as a subset of all kids who would have otherwise have been aborted &gt; the burden on all parents who have to raise children they would have otherwise aborted?  i wouldn't agree.  there's a statistically significant correlation between lots of things and committing a crime -- should we eliminate all those americans?  or maybe we should let everyone live as individuals -- organisms, i would put it -- and try to reform people as they are, as best we can?  ""i only bring this up because this seems to be a constant refrain in the neo-randian ""me first"" justifications coming out of so many paulites: ""why should i be responsible for someone else's irresponsibility?"" it is false that you can avoid responsibility."" so if a baby that were otherwise aborted ends up killing me, it's my responsibility for not having supported the societal responsibility for abortion?  well, why don't we just eliminate groups at high risk for criminal behavior completely?  or here's a novel thought: *why don't we target the causes of criminal behaviors instead of the people who might cause it?*  also note that your argument *assumes* that a fetus is not a human being, and therefore you couldn't have this discussion who one was pro-life, since, if you're willing to kill a life to eliminate the prospect of society suffering from a crime, we might as well murder all poor black teenage males.  ""we're all in this culture together. if you do not pay for welfare you will pay for a beefed-up police force later on."" [or maybe if i do not pay for welfare someone who was otherwise unproductive will become productive?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qhzgkzp9xe).  maybe welfare is a ""sacred cow"" that presumes the innocence of the victim?  maybe we should improve americans through good standards instead of eliminating them?

 i felt life loom lustrous in cool cold cars iced over and steamed up in short staccato whispers of hasty boys and sparkling frost, stealing my supper of standards and stomping it to the frozen sidewalks trying to keep warmhotsweaty, eating after-sex cigarettes; i am listening to sweet smelling metaphors of lust loop over over over into slippery songs tasting the twinge of guilt brought by

1 mental health disease affecting far too many of our nation's children...as evidenced by our prison populations.  during the 80s-90s, severely depressed early victim of our nation's expanding health and social crisis tupac shakur, born in 1971, intelligently addressed the health and social crisis responsible for unjustly oppressing and depriving untold numbers of american kids from experiencing a fairly or wonderfully happy american kid childhood with safe streets to travel and play on.  https://knutesniche.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/tupac-addresses-child-abuse.png  tupac was well aware that not only are american kids being unjustly oppressed and deprived from experiencing their full human potential, tupac realized our nation is being deprived of enjoying the potential achievements offered to all americans by reasonably well adjusted kids maturing into responsible teens and adults who care about the future of our nation.  however, an admittedly depressed, suicidal thinking kendrick lamar, born in 1987, continues sharing with our world his emotional mental illness caused by the childhood trauma he experienced and the trauma he witnessed his siblings as well as numerous cousins being harmed by.  https://knutesniche.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/kendrick-gangs-mental-illness-quad.jpg  sadly, kendrick is much like the population of americans wishing to ignore the fact that a significant number of grossly immature, selfish american teen and adult moms continue unjustly oppressing, abusing, neglecting &amp; maltreating american children who far too often mature into depressed, angry teens and adults writing music or admiring american recording artists creating popular american music characterizing our moms, sisters, grandmas, aunts and nieces as less than human creatures undeserving of respect...which sadly, is how many early euro americans who purchased african people from african tribe leaders characterized the african people they enslaved.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikjuu1zof-o  eugenia, i am angry and sad that a significant number of my american neighbors willfully ignore the legit concerns and real pain shared by these responsible americans who realize that american racism has *largely* been replaced with a more current form of human oppression &amp; indignities responsible for impeding far too many american children from experiencing their full human potential.  https://knutesniche.wordpress.com/2015/11/13/video-archive-american-men-women-sharing-thoughts-about-some-african-american-women-moms/  eugenia, i'm sorry to pick on moms, though since ancient times they are the *primary caregivers* we look to keep us safe, cared for and loved right from our start.  peace. ____ robert k. ross, md, president and ceo of the california endowment, addressed inmates at ironwood state prison offering a compelling overview of the role that exposure to childhood trauma plays in the lives of *emotionally troubled* and chronically ill american teens and adults.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscnub_kbuw  at 2:12:25 in this documentary about mafia hit-man and victim of early childhood trauma/abuse, richard ""the iceman"" kuklinski, dr. park dietz explains why young richard most likely developed into a emotionally disturbed, paranoid, cruel, heartless teen and man who did not give a frig about anyone else, including his wife and kids.  https://youtu.be/qxgi72w2h7u?t=2h12m25s ____  tagged: **jamyla bolden, tyshawn lee, julie dombo**",1,-2,-1
328236,"i heard a theory. early human matriarchal societies were not as savvy about science, as we are.   it has been theorized that women controlled the sex, back then, and thus no one was exactly sure who's child was whose. this allowed the community to assume responsibility for all the children, as a group.   many of the modern advances in feminism, i.e. child support, depend upon a patriarchy to enforce these rules.   it's all so twisted, that taking any gender or race based position is quickly becoming moot.   people will always look to the authorities to fix things, as opposed to fixing them themselves.   i still think it would be hard to sell black feminism to any black male youth.  between their single moms, and their friends, and their female teachers, many are sick of having a female tell them what to do. often the only older males that take an interest in them are police men.   i know for a fact that most old black men find hiphop culture absolutely repulsive, and often shun the youth.    i am totally in the dark about how black feminism can fix this situation, or how young black males can be convinced to defer to a female leadership. it just doesn't sound realistic, to me.   i do like what the black panthers were doing in the 60s/70s. they are the best example of a communal society i know of in us black history. even the baptist/prince hall freemason society doesn't compare. the bps were fully egalitarian.   are you saying that these young black men gave inferior truths, as opposed to enlightened feminists?   if they resist, will you tell them your solution is ''the truth?''   how will they react?   i just don't see it, no matter how mature and intelligent they may be.   they , i suspect, are yearning for male leadership, like any healthy male youth.   this country of wild young people of all kinds is primarily raised by women, nowadays.   they keep getting wilder, and are raised by less fathers, and more single moms, all the time.   what does feminism say about that?   it sounds like women have the upper hand in raising kids now, and have had for a while. this is/was a perfect time for demonstrating the superiority of women, when it comes to communal society child raising.   but the kids just get wilder every day.   how can expanding feminism's role in child rearing address any of this?   single dads, like me, are harshly omitted from their kids' lives, excepting every other weekend. 12 days of no, go away, and 2 of normal life. 12 days of prison, and 2 of loving wonderfulness.   her drunken yelling violent mother was unbeatable in court, as she was a woman, and automatically won.   what would feminism have liked to do for my child?   i would hope that they would be against the court and child support system set up by the patriarchy, and do away with it, so that couples and families had to work things out, like the thousands of years of ancestors, including the matriarchal ones.   my feminist baby mama wasn't interested in my relationship with my child, and vocally assured me of her resentment that we were close.   i never got extra time with my little girl. i read to her all the time, and had no tv or video games in my home.   real dad gets crushed down by patriarchy supported extreme feminist court system.   many fathers, white black or whatever, have been going through the same thing.   4 days a month with my kid, and 26 days not allowed.   is communal feminism interested in how much time single dads get to spend with their kids? i have seen no evidence, whatsoever of that.   when hearing my story, women mostly say things like ''you're lucky to have a daughter, and that you get to see her'' or some insensitive thing.   every single man would respond with ''that really sucks''.   now then. could i accuse you of oppressor bias if you decided to form any kind of opinion on a single dad who has been discriminated against?   i wouldn't. i would be disappointed if you downplayed my experience as not so important, though.   i am just unsure of what feminism is attempting to achieve in the usa.   children are the most important members of society. the future. and women are almost totally in charge of them.   i can't imagine anything being more important than my child.   should feminists be allowed to speak about single dads?   would that be oppressor bias? sometimes?",1,-1,-2

845296,"i'd like to give some support to lief79.  but like he said please don't just mod me down also respond.   while i agree that this situation is tragic and the parents have been deeply wronged.  this doesn't necessarily justify undoing the adoptions.  what it dose justify is *reforming the current laws* to prevent this type of thing from happening again.  i've been following this case for a while, and my understanding is that because the parents fled to ireland to prevent their baby from being put into foster care, they legally abandoned their other children.  if the parents had stayed all of the kids would have stayed in foster care until they had exhausted all of their appeals.  i don't blame the parents for fleeing or even think that it was a morally wrong decision, it was however a legal mistake.   hence, why we need reform.  while legal changes are needed in the current situation we have to realize that we need to do what is best for the children.  this is actually the bases for child protection agencies.  they work to do what is best for the kids not what is ""fair"".  they will often leave children with neglectful parents because removing them would be traumatic and overburden the foster care system.  this is especially true of older children.  i personally know a family near by where the father (no mother) is pretty negligent but not physically abusive.  we talked to child services but they said that if they got involved it would probably do more harm then good because it is traumatic to remove kids even from very abusive homes (which this is not) and as the kids are all teens they probably would *never be adopted*.   kids need continuity in their lives and they cannot tell if a stranger is their biological parent or not.  what they can tell is how loves and cares for them regardless of genetics.  personally i often find people get to hung up on genetics and forget about the loving and nurturing part of family.  for example imagine that your baby was [switched at birth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/babies_switched_at_birth), which a couple who now lives in another country, and then 12 years latter you discover the mistake.  would you stop loving you child just because you found out it's not really yours?  i really hope not. would it be a good thing to switch the kids back?  i definitely say no, tearing a child away from everything the know and are familiar with to be sent to live with total strangers makes no sense what so ever.  the correct state of affairs would for the children not to have been switched in the first place, but that is not one of the options we have anymore.  you have to look at what is best going forward from now, not how you have liked things to have been.  this brings us back to the case of the websters.  when they last saw their children they were aged 5, 3, and 2.  as lief79 that was 4 years ago, so the two youngest probably have not *no memory* of their birth parents. (the average age of first memories is 3-4 years) the fact of the matter is that the kids don't understand genetics, all they know is who has been caring for them for the past 4 years.  they will always see their current parents as their parents.  this cannot be undone.  it is sad and tragic but that is life, i cannot think of any reason that it would be in the interest of these kids to be removed from one loving family and sent to another.   so people please think about this and don't just knee jerk.  just because someone has been wronged doesn't mean that we have to right to hurt someone else to fix it.",1,2,0

766781,"my wife and i [traveled around the world](http://spothopping.com/about) recently, and i was asked how we afforded it. [here's what i wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7igry/welcome_mike_aka_raldi_to_team_reddit/c06qx9t):  ----  traveling is only as expensive as you make it.   hilary and i saved up for most of our late 20s, living in a 400-square-foot apartment and, significantly, having a tiny city hall wedding instead of a giant extravaganza. this allowed us to splurge here and there (renting cars, staying in hotels with air conditioning, visiting first-world countries)  however, even if you only have, say, $5000 -- which you will if you skip the big wedding -- you can still do some really fantastic and life-changing travel. for example, flights from new york to bangkok are currently around $1300 round-trip. alternately, you can get to kunming, china for $1100.. or india for $900. once you get there, the other $3700+ will last months. and, of course, once you get to the other side of the world, you can take short, cheap, local flights; chiang mai to luang prabang is just $129, and the cultures are like night and day. train rides within a country cost even less.  if you go with a buddy, or better yet, a significant other, costs will drop by almost half, since you'll be sharing rental cars, rooms, books, hired guides, etc. really everything except food and admission.  the real extravagant cost of a trip like this is time: you simply can't do it without quitting your job.  i think that, as people start getting married and having babies later and later in life, it's going to be fairly normal to leave one's job and travel for a few months as part of that transition. especially if you're already moving to another city anyway.  and don't worry, you can always get another job. even in this economy.  and you know what? even if i hadn't been able to, even if it had taken me a year to find work, i wouldn't have regretted a thing. not for a second.",1,1,0
561939,"my second son was born on 6/30/12 (ten days before my birthday).  we celebrated his one year birthday on 6/29/13.  died two days later of ligature strangulation from sleeping in a car seat at the babysitters.  cps promised the babysitter ""would go away forever.""  i don't see the point.  my wife and i both let both of our sons sleep in car seats (if they fell asleep en route somewhere, obviously not long term) and the coroner said it probably took about 4 minutes and was completely silent, so it's unlikely the baby monitor even broadcast anything out of the norm.  obviously if i had to do it over again, i would restrict him from sleeping in car seat, but he could have died under our watch just as easily.  or any of my relatives.  we all have left him asleep in his car seat for four minutes.  it was a one in a million chance and my son paid for it.  i still send my other son to the same babysitter and invited her to the funeral.  it really pisses me off cps came off like that, but my wife and i are the only ones apparently.  i understand and am totally fine with trying to find someone or something to blame, but she did nothing that the vast majority of people wouldn't do.  the rest of our family (mostly hers) disagrees and blames us for not caring.  that said, it doesn't make me feel any less guilty.  i could have switched him over to his big boy car seat we already had, but i thought he was a little small, so i just adjusted the straps so he'd have one inch off his chest in his rear facing.  i obviously must have done something wrong.  i am a failure as a parent, and my wife got her tubes tied after clinton was born.  i don't really want another child, to be honest i don't think i'm a fit parent as is, but for some reason it just feels depressing.  in movies and books you see the parents break down and sob and scream and cry.  my wife and i certainly sobbed and cried, but we didn't break down.  that happens a lot more slowly.  at first you're sure you did everything you could, but then one week you start wondering.  and pretty soon you're sure you could have done something.  so you start retracing your steps and examining every action.  then your mind starts tricking you into thinking you never spent any time with him, instead preferring his brother.  then you start wondering about all of the days he was sick and you didn't take off work to comfort him.  then you're pretty sure you never really cared for him at all and every one knew it.  that feeling can last a few days before you snap out of it, but i feel like it lasts longer and longer every time.  something eventually snaps me back to lucidity, but i worry that one day it'll last forever.  i think the worst part is i was on drugs for a good chunk of my life.  i sobered up in january of 2009 (five years on the fourth) so i can't even go back to that.  i feel like my mind is frantically building walls of sand to reinforce my sanity, and that one day the tide will wash in and overtake me.  i have never had thoughts of suicide, thanks to years of depression and finally dealing with it, but i do think about moving my family to where no one knows us and we aren't the people with the dead kid.  anyways, i work as a first responder and the weather has meant working twelve hour shifts driving a vehicle alone by yourself.  not a big deal, i drive 8/24.  something is different about 48/96 though.  your stamina just runs out and eventually you stop having things to think about.    no one talks about death in infants, what is appropriate and what isn't.  i tried to think about our ancestors for a long time.  how people wouldn't name kids until they were a few years old.  how infanticide is in our genes.  god forgive me, but it helped for a while.  eventually it always comes back around, and i cannot escape it.  i feel selfish feeling this way.    i have done this terrible thing that has stamped me and branded me and has become my identity.  if i have a bad day, the only questions i get are rhetorically.  every one already assumes it's because i have a dead son.  i no longer have minor events that upset me or daily occurrences that hinder me.  if i say it was something at work, people almost seem disappointed.  so eventually you just stop complaining.  people expect you to be somehow above it all, to turn in to some wizened survivor that sees the bright side in life.  i want to scream and complain, but i also feel like that's what they want.  every one wants their hallmark moment, where they can drop a quote and be a stone in your path to recovery.  like one day you'll make a toast about how hard it is, but it's okay you've survived and beat this dead kid thing and look at them and give them a weary, trusting smile.  but i don't want a hallmark moment.  i want a men-in-black moment, where someone will wave some wand and make me forget for a little while.  not forever, but just long enough that i can get a cup of coffee or play a game without this sense that something is wrong.  so my wife can be five minutes late and my first thought isn't that she's dead.  so my son can be sick and i'm not worried he'll die in his sleep.  maybe i'm just overly cynical.  i don't really want to ""get over"" it or ""move on"" or whatever therapy buzzword exists.  i'm not suicidal, i maintain my work, i am a good husband and act like a good father, i don't drink or do drugs anymore, so why do i have to make steps?  i like spending a few hours a day crying and remembering and looking through pictures.  i like being at events and imagining what clinton would be doing.  i like christmas shopping and making a mental list of what i would have gotten clinton.  i like looking at bunk beds even if we don't need them.  if i like all that stuff and it's not hurting anyone, why do i need to make steps to stop?  some memories i've skewed.  that was one of the worst moments, when i realized i forgot what i dressed clinton as for halloween.  pumpkin, but i forgot until i looked up pictures.  that's the thing with memories, eventually the colors fade a little and you've got gray, then you start to forget why it was important at all.  then every once in a while you go to the zoo and in a rush you gain access to some memory you haven't tapped yet.  or you pick up an ornament and remember clearly christmas night and your baby has smashed chocolate all over his face, the byproduct of his brother sneaking him a cookie and his gums doing the rest.  i'm scared that some day i'll run out of memories, and there will be no more moments of clarity.  i think that's the ""meaning"" of life.  make as many memories as you can and never stop creating them.  one day that's all you'll have left, and a picture is just a cheap substitute.  it's the difference between masturbation and making love.  that feeling of connectivity when you remember how his weight felt, what the animals around you smelled like, how you reached back and he held your hand in the car.  i don't know how or why we create these memories.  i feel like i have all the parts to create new memories:  some times, i can remember how his weight felt; some times, i can remember his dimples; some times, i can remember the smell of baby powder and dried milk.  but like some high schooler stuffed into an art class, my vision exceeds my capabilities.  anyways, i'm just a bit sleep deprived after the emergency operations and have been thinking about him nonstop.  came home today at the end of my last twelve of the week and this bill was there.  i had forgotten that we'd have to pay for his care.  there's also a $600 ambulance ride i forgot about.  i don't mean to make a statement on national healthcare or insurance or hospital bills or whatever.  it's just the reality of the situation.  sorry for rambling.  thanks for reading.  i've uploaded some more pictures of clinton: http://imgur.com/a/9rvkz  edit at 2130 est:  i'm truly, deeply touched by each of your messages and posts.  i've been hesitant to kind of reach out because it felt like family members or other people close to it used my son as a conversation piece, and it always made me so mad (in all fairness to them, that's probably in my mind).  i honestly just expected to get a lot of karmawhoreing replies, which would be understandable.  i reread what i wrote (after a few hours of sleep) and i feel kind of, well, dumb.  i have no idea why in your mind your thoughts sound pathetic and weak, but rereading it on ""paper"" makes it seem less intimidating.  it meant so much to hear so many of you felt the same way.  i feel like a horrible person for having those times i just want to forget about it and have some time to myself, but knowing that it's not insane is comforting in a way i can't describe.  i know i need to see a therapist, i guess i just feel like that's the last step before it becomes out there.  it's amazing to me how sharing grief can make it seem so small.  i cannot imagine going through what some of you have mentioned, stillbirths and losing week old children, or losing a preteen or adult child.  i simultaneously think knowing clinton's smile and laugh, but not knowing his favorite color or subject in school, makes coping easier.  i could not imagine losing a parent, both of whom are rocks to me, or losing any of my siblings.  i don't know exactly what i mean, but i guess this grief is mine and i couldn't imagine dealing with any other kind.  thank you so much for offers of financial support, pizza, reddit gold, and other sacrifices.  we are fine financially, i guess it was more the bill was a shock that sent me reeling for the first time in a few months.  the holidays were, for whatever reason, not that big a deal.  just keeping busy i guess.  i also just want to take this space to say this wasn't meant as a psa for rear facing car seats.  cps investigated (no neglect/abuse), and the coroner said it was a freak occurrence.    thank you so much for your words.",1,-2,-1
822615,"the people who tend to die from flu (any flu, not just this one they want to terrify people with and make lots of money from) usually have their immune system compromised in some way. either by an existing illness, chronic malnourishment, and/or by medications which deplete your body's reserves of essential nutrients. pregnancy can also deplete nutrients needed for your defence as they are going towards building a new little body - you need to make sure you take in the right nourishing foods to keep both your immune system as well as the construction work powering along.  check out [this page](http://editor.nourishedmagazine.com.au/articles/swine-flu-no-ones-talking-about-building-natural-immunity) for some excellent food recommendations to ensure your immune system functions at its best.  further to the info on the above linked page:  - cod/halibut liver oil: these are good sources of both [vitamin a](http://www.westonaprice.org/knowyourfats/vitamin-a-fetal.html) and [vitamin d](http://www.westonaprice.org/children/infant-vitamin-d-safety.html). it's better to take one of these oils because they contain both these vitamins: taking only one of them can be harmful if you take too much. a recent (dec 2008) [scientific paper](http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/abstract/138/12/2337) has confirmed how without vitamin a, vitamin d can be harmful; and that the fat-soluble vitamins a, d and k work in harmony with each other for good health. vitamin d is essential for a strong immune system, and the reason why flu is more common in winter is that the vitamin d levels of many people drop during this season. this is because of rugging up from the cold - we don't get as much sunlight on our skin, which makes vitamin d for us for free. thus, getting vitamin d from your diet is important in winter, as well as for those who don't get outdoors much at any time of year. while cod liver oil contains vitamins a &amp; d as mentioned earlier, butter (preferably raw) contains vitamins a &amp; k. these foods should be at the top your healthy-eating list.  - vitamin c. this is best got from fresh fruit and vegetables, preferably raw as it can be damaged by heat. if you are taking vitamin c pills, check the ingredients list very carefully: some vitamin pills contain [aspartame](http://www.holisticmed.com/aspartame/), an artificial sweetener and excitotoxin that affects brain function. while an adult can tolerate the brain cell death it causes for years, aspartame can have a greater harmful effect on babies, the elderly, and others with a weakened blood-brain barrier (e.g. from illness). the best forms of vitamin c pills also contain vitamin p (also called bioflavinoids) - these two vitamins work better together.  - lacto-fermented foods. if going for yoghurt, look for unsweetened greek-style brands made from raw, or at the very least whole milk. avoid brands which contain sugar, high fructose corn syrup, artificial sweeteners, or powdered milk (while cholesterol is actually healthy and quantities of it are needed by growing babies, the powdering of milk and eggs oxidises the cholesterol and makes it harmful. stick to fresh, avoid powdered). raw biodynamic milk, unlike pasteurised milk, contains probiotic bacteria and active enzymes that promote a healthy gut and assist with the absorbtion of nutrients in the milk. calcium needed for baby's bones is absorbed more readily when milk's phosphatase enzyme is active, and not killed by heating.  - bone broths/chicken soup: make the stock for these at home from bones &amp; chickens you've boiled yourself. don't use soup stock bought from a shop - nearly all of them contain monosodium glutamate, another excitotoxin. msg is hidden in these and other products under a variety of euphemistic names such as vegetable extract, yeast extract, hydrolized vegetable protein, etc.  - coconut. this wonder-food is comprised of about 49% of the saturated 12-carbon fat called lauric acid, also found in palm oil. the other main source of lauric acid is none other than human breast milk, and it has anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-protozoal qualities.  - a couple of other helpful foods are [magnesium chloride](http://www.health-science-spirit.com/magchlor.pdf) (a component of seawater), and [kelp](http://www.1001herbs.com/kelp/) (which has lots of vitamins and minerals and is a good source of magnesium and iodine. iodine is extremely important for your thyroid gland to produce its hormones t4 (l-thyroxine) and t3 (tri-iodo-thyroxine) which help maintain good health and metabolism. it needs other minerals too of course, but kelp is rich source of many.  as well as eating the good stuff, it's important to also stay away from the bad stuff. sugar is one of the big nasties that is constantly under our noses: it robs the bones and teeth of minerals, creates an acidic environment loved by cancer and mouth bacteria, and causes bad bacteria in the gut to flourish, to the detriment of the good bacteria we need there for optimum health. trans-fat (a prime source being margarines &amp; vegetable shortenings, used in many biscuits/cookies/pastries etc) is another baddie. msg and artificial sweeteners i've already mentioned. [soy is another food to avoid](http://www.wholesoystory.com/) as it attacks the thyroid gland, and also contains plant forms of female hormones. this can create estrogen dominance in women, where the female hormones estrogen and progesterone get out of balance. progesterone is needed for making cortisol and other hormones, and a deficiency can stress your adrenal glands. the [effects of soy](http://www.westonaprice.org/soy/phytoestrogens.html) can also lead to genital deformities in boy babies.  for those that suggest you take [the shot](http://www.angelfire.com/az/sthurston/flu_shots_and_flu_vaccines.html), i'll reword the center for disease control's information about flu vaccine: it's between [10% to 30% ineffective](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/antiviral.htm) against the flu it's supposed to prevent. and viruses keep mutating, so the older the vaccine, the less effective it becomes. one thing that does not lose its effectiveness however is the [mercury](http://www.westonaprice.org/envtoxins/mercury.html) in the thimerosal contained in the vaccine. adding to the toxic load on your body in addition to any mercury-amalgam fillings you might have in your teeth doesn't seem like a good idea at any time, but even less when a new body is being formed.  a recommended diet for pregnancy is [here](http://www.westonaprice.org/children/dietformothers.html), and you'll see many of the foods best for baby-building are also those that boost your immune system. bon appetit, and best wishes for your new arrival!",1,1,1

725430,"&gt;so you're arguing for the gap being larger? you were raised in a culture where young kids, 14 year olds, having sex with inappropriately older guys was normal. you're like women in africa who encourage and speak for fgm because they had it done as a child.  and so are you. you grew up in a culture where sex between 14 and 18 year olds was discouraged, so you now believe that it must in general be wrong. someone in the us might have grown up in a culture that encourages male circumcision, so they consider it normal now as well.  but that's not actually an argument for or against anything of that. it just shows that we can't base our notion of how things should be on how they are. there's an actual argument why fgm is wrong: it violates the bodily integrity of a non-consenting person.  you still haven't provided a convincing reason why an 18 year old having sex with an 14 year old is committing rape.  aren't 14 year olds able of consent? than they can't be able of consenting to sex with anyone.  does a higher mean inevitably mean abuse? no, because a risk factor for abuse can't be the same as the actual abuse.  &gt;what? my point is that just because they have sexual appetites doesn't mean it's acceptable to exploit it. you're the one using 14 year old's raging hormones to accept older people taking advantage of them, not me.  and my point is that you can't simply compare a 9-year olds sexual appetites with a 14-year olds. see the still unanswered question why you think you can easily compare 14 and 9 year olds, but 18 year olds must be a completely different breed.  the second part is grossly misleading. i don't ""accept older people taking advantage of them"". i say that one should look at ""is there abuse"" and not ""is there an age difference"". and that the age difference itself can't be abuse by itself - that's exactly what my countries legislation is assuming as well: that in the case with a 14 to 15 year old having sex with someone over 21, and this being reported by the parents, a judge can't simply decide that it's abusive, and therefore rape, based on the age difference alone. they have to prove that a actual abuse of power can be seen in the relationship.  see, that's the point here. i'm not saying abuse between a older person and a teenager will never happen. i say that if there is abuse, punish it. but don't say that the age difference alone is automatically abuse.  &gt;because 9 year olds often feel like they're able to consent, are often well into puberty, have sexual desires, that doesn't mean they're capable of giving consent. the same goes for 14 year olds. studies of 14 year olds' brains confirm this.  if they can't give consent because of brain development, they can't give consent to anyone.  that's the whole point here. there are different reasons why one may not be able to give consent. one may be uninformed, mentally incapitated/constrained due to intoxication, etc. those are reasons that may apply for a certain person, or a situation, and will not apply in other cases.  if we say though that the teenage mind is not capable of consent, then this is a general statement, and therefore, has to apply for a partner of any age.  for your point about brain development, i would really like to see the study that says ""a 14 year old brain is unable of giving consent to sex"" and not just ""a 14 year old brain isn't developed in the same way another brain may be developed"".  &gt;and people in afghanistan lose their virginities later, and there you have 5 year olds marrying 40 year olds. let's just legalize all child sex then?  first, the obvious problem here is that consummation of marriage will happen at a later age. that doesn't mean child marriage is okay, but it shows that the implication of your argument, that i might have totally lied and we're actually marrying of all those prepubescents to middle-aged men is pointless (you're allowed to marry here at 16 with your parents permission and regularly with 18.)  also, as i said, it's idiotic to just put western voluntary teenage-dating and eastern involuntary child-marriage into the same point. (if you want to drop the ""but some child brides say they like it""-bomb, i see no point in continuing this argument since you evidently assume that this negates it obvious oppressive origin; or assume that someone here is forcing girls to date older men for whatever reason, and therefore, dating isn't voluntary)  &gt;back in the early 1900s you had tons of grown men in the us and europe marrying 10 year olds, as 7-10 year olds were considered capable of giving consent.  again, why are we discussing this again when it never was part of the model i was talking about? even your supposed argument against it didn't actually address this.  &gt;in the 40s it was common for rock stars to have sex with and take advantage of young teens.  age of consent: clearly introduced because of rock stars.  suuuure.  &gt;two fourteen year olds exploring their sexualities together: uncomfortable, but not abusive.  because of what? there minds aren't fully developed. they can't give meaningful consent. that was your whole argument.  i also find your assumption troubling that mentally disabled people should never have sex with non-mentally disabled people.  &gt;""children shouldn't have sex with much older people"".  you wrote:  &gt;many 14 year olds are just starting puberty. most have never had sex, a large percentage haven't even kissed a person of the opposite sex, they are very much children.  in other words, you fix their incapability of giving consent to not having sexual experience. if so, a 18 year old will not be guaranteed to have such sexual experiences as well. so it can't be an argument why they can't give consent.  while we're at it, what is when the younger partner is actually more mentally developed? that isn't exactly impossible, mental development isn't a blueprint every single individual will follow. according to age of consent legislation, the older partner will automatically be the abuser. according to common sense, the person actually committing abuse by exploiting the other persons mental inability will be the abuser.  &gt;they really aren't. that's like saying that a 2 year old and an 8 year old are peers, it's just ignorant. aren't you 18? are you experiencing arrested development by any chance?  do the 2 year old and the 8 year old go to the same school? visit the same institutions in general? have similar interests? will 2 and 8 year olds meet at the same party? do you really want to argue that infants mental and physical development will proceed at the exact same speed as at every later stage of life?  would i personally, at 18, have sex with a 14 year old? no, because i, personally, can't mentally relate to them. i can't relate to 16 year olds either. hell, i can barely relate to most people my age.  but will i apply my own, subjective experience to absolutely everyone else? no. will i assume that everyone else my age is at this clearly superior level to a 14 year old? no, as said, because i can barely relate to them because they seem too immature. but i also can't relate to other persons as well because i perceive them as being more mature than me, despite being younger.  mental capability is a lot more complicated than just portraying it as a linear progression proportionally linked to age!  i have to admit you have found a very subtle way of calling me retarded without using the word though.",1,-1,-1

220766,"(...continued)  yet basically, that (those two above scenarios) are the distilled version of what happened in the recent ""housing bubble"" -- but of course in our system it is all obfuscated by a whole shitload of middle-men, various ""financial products"", regulations, etc.  lots of people (especially older people, parents, grandparents, etc) have huge amounts of money saved up in a variety of ""retirement accounts"" (pensions, 401k's, cd's, etc). they don't want (or can't because of regulations and tax laws, etc) the to loan their own children money from their own savings -- egads, think of the risk if the kids didn't/couldn't pay it back!  so the kids borrow the money as a mortgage from the bank -- which the bank then ""packaged up"" with all kinds of voodoo bs, and sold to the pension funds and other ""investment vehicles"" -- basically using the money from the parents/grandparents, and (of course) promising to pay it back (over time, and with lots of interest).  and everyone got greedy in the process -- the parents/grandparents want to get ""the most return"" on their money (and make sure it was ""safe &amp; secure"" -- and what is more secure than ""mortgage backed securities"" -- i dunno if borrowing money to your kids to buy a home isn't ""secure"" then why would an ""mbs"" be any different?), and of course the middlemen got really greedy...  and, last but not least, the kids got ""greedy"" too -- they weren't satisfied to buy a simple small, ""starter"" home, oh no, they wanted to borrow ""as much as they could"" so that they could get a really fancy, nice, brand new home (nicer and better than the folk's old house)... etc.  so everyone was engaged in lots of different levels of self-deception, and ignorance, and cognitive dissonance, etc.  and they still are.  the rents -- even though they probably told the kids to ""default"" on paying for that mortgage (now that the house is underwater and all) -- and yet they can't ""believe"" that their pension money isn't still all there (i mean how could it not be? where did it go? yada, yada, etc).  that's what happens with ""banking"" and the whole fiasco of our financial ""industry"" -- it is layer-after-layer-after-layer of self+other-deceptive obfuscation -- and with each layer adding additional ""middlemen"" who are allowed to skim and scheme and scam.  so that we can avoid the direct connection of the fact that ""savings"" and ""loans"" are a inter-generational dependency.  and in allowing all of those layers (of what is quite frankly bullshit) we also divorce the advice/guidance/responsibility.  dad &amp; mom, or grandpa &amp; grandma probably wouldn't have risked their retirement savings to hand over $500,000 to their punk-kid to buy a mcmansion on the ""bet"" that it *might* be worth ""even more"" a couple of years from now -- no, if junior &amp; his girlfriend wanted to buy a house and borrow money directly, they would have insisted that he buy something he could afford (something smaller-ish). and i highly doubt they would have borrowed even more money to their daughter/grand-daughter and her latest boy-toy (to ""cash out her equity"" based on the supposedly higher price it *might* fetch if she were to sell the house today) in order to buy a new bmw, a boat, a bunch of designer ""prada shoes"" and of course to take the boy-toy on trips to europe &amp; the caribbean.  and of course, a lot of middle-aged people (boomers) were really borrowing their own money right back through the system,and then squandering it. (heck their retirement account says it contains $500k, and if the bank is willing to loan them $500k, well there's no ""risk"" there, right? why not borrow &amp; spend? what could it hurt?)  but... if it had to be done directly they would realize it wasn't exactly a ""smart risk"" and that neither junior, nor the feminist queen would be able to pay all of that back... certainly not the place you would choose to invest your retirement money, right?  and would the boomer's really have ""cashed in"" their retirement accounts to buy a bigger mcmansion?  or a vacation home?  yet in many ways -- via the ""financial industry"" and the plethora of byzantine machinations it uses (deposit insurance, mutual funds, pension funds, etc) -- that is what happened.  what we all collectively did... was borrow money from our left pocket (leaving a nice little iou in place) and them plop it into our right pocket... from which we (speaking collectively) spent it all on all kinds of shit...  why? well because there were all those layers of obfuscation in between, so we could either remain ignorant of what we were (collectively) doing, or for those few who really did understand what was going on, we could engage in deliberate self-deception.  well, the ""orgy-porgy-party"" happened, the money got spent on crap -- and now we have a whopper of a hangover, and a whole shitload of an ""after party"" mess to clean up -- but no one (or very few anyway) understand or want to admit how badly we all screwed up, and to actually be honest about the consequences.  instead, everyone is trying to figure out if there isn't some way to restart the ""party"" again... to maybe pop some magic pills (or start drinking again? if we could only get our hands on some more booze!) and make the hangover magically disappear, etc.  and of course... the banksters (and the rest of the middlemen) want -- no, they need -- to keep the whole confidence scheme going (because hell, they got out before the party gut busted, and they need to sell the booze for another one, that's how they make their fortunes bigger, right?)  ---  because that is what happens with ""consumer credit"" based bullshit economy.  it isn't about loaning/borrowing money to people to increase **real** production (fish, bananas, boats, nets, etc) -- it's about duping, tricking, &amp; scamming people into having a ""stone soup"" party, and allowing the banksters to take their ""portion"" (unearned) from the soup pot before everyone else, and at the same time convincing everyone that the vegetables that went into the soup and got eaten are still (yes still) sitting in the root cellar for future use (or that the ones that are still there can be made ""bigger"" by inflating them with some more air/water on a regular, continual basis -- a mechanism called ""the magic of compound interest"" -- which of course, like all ""magic"" is mostly slight of hand.)",1,-1,-1

235395,"pt 3  ---- with nourishment, comfort, and stimulation constantly on hand, infants did not have to wait helplessly to have their needs met. they had no emotional need to anchor their libidos to abstract concepts of time, place, or kinship; and abstract foundations of awareness such as these were not imprinted on their nascent consciousness  as babies grew, their interests widened to the materials, objects, and activities at hand. they had amazing freedom to explore momentary whims and interests. at first, they did so with one hand on the ‚Äòmother,‚Äô the other reaching out. then they began making short sorties further and then further out from their ‚Äòmothers‚Äô; just a few steps at first, then some more. such moving out was on their own. though a ‚Äòmother‚Äô or a ‚Äôsibling‚Äô might nod to encourage a baby who seemed uncertain about proceeding, they did not intervene or direct the baby‚Äôs interests or directions. they stayed just where they were, doing whatever they had been doing‚Äîbut as bastions of security to which babies could return for comfort, assistance, or a sense of surety. though elders did not go with babies on their jaunts, they were ever ready to assist with whatever might be brought to them. babies joined the activities of elders; elders did not join theirs.  not put aside when work was being done, infants remained constantly in touch with the activities of life around them, their tiny hands ever reaching out to whatever items or materials were in use, and onto the hands, arms, and muscles of the users. in this way even as tiny babes-in-arms they began accumulating a kinesthetic familiarity with the implements and activities of life.  this familiarity, supplemented by a rapidly developing ‚Äòtactile-talk,‚Äô produced in toddlers an ability to manage objects and materials safely that might be dangerous elsewhere. when first sojourning in those southern hamlets, i was repeatedly aghast to see toddlers barely able to stand upright playing with fire, wielding knives, and hefting axes‚Äîwithout concern by anyone around. yet they did not burn down their grass/bamboo abodes or chop off their toes and fingers. during all the years i spent within their communities, i never saw these babies hurt themselves while engaged in this type of independent exploration.  when tots explored outward, their antennae stayed tuned to the affect, mood, and musculature of those they left behind, thereby maintaining affective connection across space. with adults and older children constantly a source of gratification rather than obstruction, toddlers had no desire to escape from supervision. even slight intimations of concern from those behind, such as a tensing of musculature, was enough to stop a baby in its tracks and cast about for cues. while mothers in many places feel within themselves the kind of pain that might be looming for their baby, it‚Äôs not so instantly perceived. faster than any words of warning could be formed, these new guinea tots were already responding. no words necessary. if some subtle ‚Äòall-clear‚Äô cue did not quickly come, the infant made fast tracks to ‚Äòhome base: no reckless plunges onward, no furtive tricks to escape supervision.  when babies began acquiring verbal speech, their words and sentences floated out atop a sophisticated body-language already well in place. even after acquiring spoken language, tactile-talk continued taking precedence in much of daily life. it conveyed affect better. it was faster and more direct. most of all it touched more deeply and more quickly into the hearts and minds of others. tactile-talk was affect-talk. it integrated the spontaneous affect of individuals, often many at a time. so adept did young children become at this that they would at times merge actions into wordless synchrony.9 with such rapport surrounding them tots could also safely enter into the rough-and-tumble play of older children. there were no games with rules, no formal skills to measure up to. play was spontaneous, improvised, and exploratory, so small children were never in the way. instead, their wide-eyed enthusiasm was a constant source of pleasure for the older children. the younger children were always welcome and were handled with intuitive regard and delight.  if some aggravation unwittingly occurred in the course of active play, it withered quickly within the collective empathy. negative feelings thus faded before they had a chance to grow. full-blown expressions of, for example, anger or sadness, were therefore very rare. that, too, contributed to the intuitive rapport that so delighted them.  up to about seven or eight years of age, boys and girls played together, disporting in mixed groups in the gardens amid the plantings. boys continued garden dalliance until about the age of eight or nine; then their interests shifted and their hearts turned toward exploring further regions with other boys. small gangs went first down one trail, then another, through all the dispersed hamlet segments to the furthest gardens and beyond. girls did not like this moving all about. they preferred the sensual relaxation of garden life, quiet, tactile play with one another and with smaller children. by 12 to 13 years of age they were merging garden sensuality with cultivation skills so artfully and seductively that they were attracting older males.10 by their early teens they were often married.  boys that age continued hunting and exploring out into the forest with like-minded comrades. acquiring much of their own food there, they often ate and slept together in the ‚Äòboys‚Äô-houses‚Äô they constructed or took over. during adolescence, their rapport intensified. a rapid flow of synchronous regard began uniting them even more closely as they scattered through the forest, each constantly enlivening the others by a ceaseless, spirited, individualistic input into a unified at-oneness. the phenomenon was alien to my western consciousness, and so beyond the english language that there are no good words for it even in the oxford unabridged. so, when trying to describe that kind of unity in english, the words bump up against each other as if contradictions‚Äîas in individualistic unified at-oneness, a phrase self-contradictory in english, and yet another indication of the magnitude of the gap separating these two types of consciousness. the following event illustrates:      one day, deep within the forest, agaso, then about 13 years of age, found himself with a rare good shot at a cuscus in a nearby tree. but he only had inferior arrows. without the slightest comment or solicitation, the straightest, sharpest arrow of the group moved so swiftly and so stealthily straight into his hand, i could not see from whence it came.      at that same moment, karako, seeing that the shot would be improved by pulling on a twig to gently move an obstructing branch, was without a word already doing so, in perfect synchrony with agaso‚Äôs drawing of the bow, i.e., just fast enough to fully clear agaso‚Äôs aim by millimeters at the moment his bow was fully drawn, just slow enough not to spook the cuscus. agaso, knowing this would be the case made no effort to lean to side for an unobstructed shot, or to even slightly shift his stance. usumu similarly synchronized into the action stream, without even watching agaso draw his bow, began moving up the tree a fraction of a second before the bowstring twanged.      he grasped the wounded cuscus before it might regain its senses and slipped out onto a slender branch that whizzed him down to dangle in the air an inch or so before agaso‚Äôs startled face. the startle had begun its standard transformation to ecstasy, when usumu startled him again by provocatively dropping the quivering cuscus onto his naked foot, as he flicked a tasty beetle he‚Äôd found up in the tree into the pubis of delighted young koniye (the youngest of the group). doubly startled in quick succession, agaso was wallowing in an ecstasy, then shared by all, until he abruptly realized that the cuscus might come back to life and dash off.‚Äù then in a mirthful scramble they all secured it.      within that type of spirit they roasted both beetle and cuscus on an open fire (to which two friends exploring separately added grubs they‚Äôd found in a rotting log). as night came on, one-by-one, they all dropped off to sleep together, entangled in what can only be described as a contagiously subdued rapture coalescence. it took many years for me to understand the underpinnings of this guileless hypersensual interactive unity (another example of the kind of language awkwardness that arises when speaking of events across eras).  in these isolated southern groups, such rapport by exploring boys was not restricted to comrades; it radiated out to strangers, too. with heightening elan, these youthful gangs would radiate into the graces of new faces in the forest. the following bit of oral history shows how a band of ‚Äòfore‚Äô boys seduced even the aversive, warlike awa,‚Äô a people from an altogether different setting, way-of-life, and language family.12 i heard variations of this story in many hamlets throughout the waisarampa valley in the 1960s. it tells of the first contact between the hunting-gathering-gardening southern ‚Äòfore‚Äô and the instinctively hostile taro-growing awa‚Äô from the great grasslands of the upper lamari valley. it is reconstructed here from several accounts:",1,2,2

233009,"i use both terms to describe myself. i'm 23 and there are both ways where i am an adult and ways where i consider myself very immature and childish. i can't imagine being extremely offended if i was called one or the other.  there are, however, certain contexts. for example, i really doubt my grandparents will ever not think of me as a child. my grandmother still uses pet nicknames for me that she used for me as a toddler, for example. but of course, she is many many years my senior and i respect her a lot, so it's not offensive. i would say there is a certain age where everyone seems so much younger than you that at least it would be forgivable if they referred to you in a way that would indicate your youth - as a comparison, you are a youth.  also on the other end of the spectrum, i have had the pleasure of working with many young children who, let's face it, have some pretty amusing ways of understanding age. they've called me a ""girl"" or similar things because to them, i'm closer in age than their other teacher who might be in her 40s. that is really not a problem either... out of the mouth of babes, i guess.   beyond age context, there are other things. in a professional setting, i would find being referred to as a girl pretty unprofessional and demeaning. in a social setting, meh, not so bad - especially if the speaker was much older and higher social status.   using infantalizing language can also be a sign of closeness, so i would find it uncomfortable if you were using it without an appropriately close relationship (akin to men flirting with women by calling them ""baby,"" ""babe,"" etc.) this is of course not a problem for close friends, sos, and family members when appropriate.   if you don't know much about the person and you aren't close to them, i would aim for the safer bet. in the 16-25 range you cited, ""young woman"" would be the most appropriate term imo. for 16-19 (actually 13-19) year olds, ""teenager"" is also not an untrue statement, and although it can have some negative connotations for some people, i think it would be seen as an honest mistake nonetheless. ""miss"" is also a pretty age-nonspecific term that could be used as an address for a young woman of that age.  finally, i don't feel as if it is appropriate to make judgements about someone's maturity using the language you use to describe them. it's an extreme example, but that's akin in some respects to applying a pronoun because you read someone a certain way. just because you feel someone is acting immaturely, that doesn't justify you treating them in a condescending or infantalizing manner.   as with everything, the safest route is to ask. if you know for sure that someone isn't offended by something - take their word by it. but don't apply it to anyone else - just ask. if you need a generic term, go with the most factual (to the best of your knowledge) term, which i believe is, in most cases, going to be ""young woman"" unless otherwise specified.   edit to add: also, i think ""girl"" has a certain casualness/colloquialness that is appropriate in some settings. as an extension to the word ""girlfriend"", i think people will say things like ""so-and-so is the girl i've been seeing"" or ""i want you to meet this girl i really like"". i think until probably some very grey area cutoff in the late 20s/30s/something, that seems fine.",1,,2

634732,"&gt;  **nursery crimes**  &gt;  in many countries, it can be astonishingly easy to fabricate a history for a young child, and in the process, manufacture an orphan. the birth mothers are often poor, young, unmarried, divorced, or otherwise lacking family protection. the children may be born into a locally despised minority group that is afforded few rights. and for enough money, someone will separate these little ones from their vulnerable families, turning them into ‚Äúpaper orphans‚Äù for lucrative export.  &gt;  some manufactured orphans are indeed found in what westerners call ‚Äúorphanages.‚Äù but these establishments often serve less as homes to parentless children and more as boarding schools for poor youngsters. many children are there only temporarily, seeking food, shelter, and education while their parents, because of poverty or illness, cannot care for them. many families visit their children, or even bring them home on weekends, until they can return home permanently. in 2005, when the hannah b. williams orphanage in monrovia, liberia, was closed because of shocking living conditions, 89 of the 102 ‚Äúorphans‚Äù there returned to their families. in vietnam, ‚Äúrural families in particular will put their babies into these orphanages that are really extended day-care centers during the harvest season,‚Äù says a u.s. embassy spokeswoman in hanoi. in some cases, unscrupulous orphanage directors, local officials, or other operators persuade illiterate birth families to sign documents that relinquish those children, who are then sent abroad for adoption, never to be seen again by their bereft families.  &gt;  other children are located through similarly nefarious means. western adoption agencies often contract with in-country facilitators‚Äîsometimes orphanage directors, sometimes freelancers‚Äîand pay per-child fees for each healthy baby adopted. these facilitators, in turn, subcontract with child finders, often for sums in vast excess of local wages. these paydays give individuals a significant financial incentive to find adoptable babies at almost any cost. in guatemala, where the gdp per capita is $4,700 a year, child finders often earned $6,000 to $8,000 for each healthy, adoptable infant. in many cases, child finders simply paid poor families for infants. a may 2007 report on adoption trafficking by the hague conference on private international law reported poor guatemalan families being paid beween $300 and several thousand dollars per child.  &gt;  sometimes, medical professionals serve as child finders to obtain infants. in vietnam, for instance, a finder‚Äôs fee for a single child can easily dwarf a nurse‚Äôs $50-a-month salary. some nurses and doctors coerce birth mothers into giving up their children by offering them a choice: pay outrageously inflated hospital bills or relinquish their newborns. illiterate new mothers are made to sign documents they can‚Äôt read. in august 2008, the u.s. state department released a warning that birth certificates issued by tu du hospital in ho chi minh city‚Äîwhich in 2007 had reported 200 births a day, and an average of three abandoned babies per 100 births‚Äîwere ‚Äúunreliable.‚Äù most of the hospital‚Äôs ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù babies were sent to the city‚Äôs tam binh orphanage, from which many westerners have adopted. (tu du hospital is where angelina jolie‚Äôs vietnamese-born son was reportedly abandoned one month after his birth; he was at tam binh when she adopted him.) according to linh song, executive director of ethica, an american nonprofit devoted to promoting ethical adoption, a provincial hospital‚Äôs chief obstetrician told her in 2007 ‚Äúthat he provided 10 ethnic minority infants to [an] orphanage [for adoption] in return for an incubator.‚Äù  &gt;  to smooth the adoption process, officials in the children‚Äôs home countries may be bribed to create false identity documents. consular officials for the adopting countries generally accept whatever documents they receive. but if a local u.s. embassy has seen a series of worrisome referrals‚Äîsay, a sudden spike in healthy infants coming from the same few orphanages, or a single province sending an unusually high number of babies with suspiciously similar paperwork‚Äîofficials may investigate. but generally, they do not want to obstruct adoptions of genuinely needy children or get in the way of people longing for a child. however, many frequently doubt that the adoptions crossing their desks are completely aboveboard. ‚Äúi believe in intercountry adoption very strongly,‚Äù says katherine monahan, a u.s. state department official who has overseen scores of u.s. adoptions from around the world. ‚Äú[but] i worry that there were many children that could have stayed with their families if we could have provided them with even a little economic assistance.‚Äù one u.s. official told me that when embassy staff in a country that sent more than 1,000 children overseas last year were asked which adoption visas they felt uneasy about, they replied: almost all of them.  &gt;  most of the westerners involved with foreign adoption agencies‚Äîlike business people importing foreign sneakers‚Äîcan plausibly deny knowledge of unethical or unseemly practices overseas. they don‚Äôt have to know. willful ignorance allowed lauryn galindo, a former hula dancer from the united states, to collect more than $9 million in adoption fees over several years for cambodian infants and toddlers. between 1997 and 2001, americans adopted 1,230 children from cambodia; galindo said she was involved in 800 of the adoptions. (galindo reportedly delivered angelina jolie‚Äôs cambodian child to her movie set in africa.) but in a two-year probe beginning in 2002, u.s. investigators alleged that galindo paid cambodian child finders to purchase, defraud, coerce, or steal children from their families, and conspired to create false identity documents for the children. galindo later served federal prison time on charges of visa fraud and money laundering, but not trafficking. ‚Äúyou can get away with buying babies around the world as a united states citizen,‚Äù says richard cross, a senior special agent with u.s. immigration and customs enforcement who investigated galindo. ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a crime.‚Äù",1,-2,-2
607364,"full text follows:  edit: now with duplication of daughter post goodness!  every public service of worship i have heard about, so far, in the wake of the american tragedy, has had in its prayers and in its preachments sympathy and compassion for those who were killed and for their families, and god's guidance upon the selected presidents, and on the war machine, as they do what they do, and what they gotta do: payback! there's a move in psalm 137, from thoughts of paying tithes to thoughts of paying back; a move, if you will, from worship to war. a move, in other words, from the worship of the god of creation to war against those whom god created. and i want you to notice very carefully the next move, one of the reasons this psalm is rarely read in its entirety, because it is a move that spotlights the insanity of the cycle of violence and the cycle of hatred.  look at the verse, look at verse 9, look at verse 9: ""happy shall they be, who take your little ones and dash them against the rocks."" the people of faith are the rivers of babylon, how shall we sing the lord's song if i forget thee, o jehovah. the people of faith have moved from the hatred of armed enemies, these soldiers who captured the king, those soldiers who slaughtered his sons and put his eyes out, those soldiers who sacked the cities, burned the towns, burned the temple, burned the towers, they have moved from the hatred for armed enemies to the hatred of unarmed innocents. the babies, the babies, blessed are they who dash your baby's brains against a rock. and that, my beloved, is a dangerous place to be. yet, that is where the people of faith are in 551 bc, and that is where far too many people of faith are in 2001 ad. we have moved from the hatred of armed enemies to the hatred of unarmed innocents: we want revenge, we want payback, and we don't care who gets hurt in the process.  now, i asked the lord, what should our response be? in light of such an unthinkable act, but before i share with you what the lord showed me, i wanna give you one of my little ""faith footnotes"", visitors often get faith footnotes so that our members don't lose sight of the big picture, let me give you a little faith footnote, turn to your neighbour, say ""faith footnote"". i heard ambassador peck on an interview yesterday, did anybody else see him or hear him? he was on fox news. this is a white man, and he was upsetting the fox news commentators to no end. he pointed out - did you see him, john? - he pointed out, a white man, an ambassador! that what malcolm x said, when he got silenced by elijah muhammad, was in fact true, america's chickens are coming home to roost.  we took this country, by terror, away from the sioux, the apache, the arawak, the comanche, the arapaho, the navajo - terrorism! we took africans from their country to build our way of ease and kept them enslaved and living in fear - terrorism! we bombed grenada and killed innocent civilians, babies, non-military personnel, we bombed the black civilian community of panama with stealth bombers and killed unarmed teenagers and toddlers, pregnant mothers and hard-working fathers, we bombed qaddafi's home and killed his child! blessed are they bash your children's heads against the rocks!  we bombed iraq! we killed unarmed civilians trying to make a living! we bombed a plant in sudan to pay back for the attack on our embassy, killed hundreds of hard-working people, mothers and fathers, who left home to go that day, not knowing that they'd never get back home, we bombed hiroshima, we bombed nagasaki, and we nuked far more than the thousands in new york and in the pentagon, and we never batted an eye. kids playing in the playground, mothers picking up children after school, civilians, not soldiers, people just trying to make it, day by day. we have supported state terrorism against the palestinians and black south africans, and now we are indignant! because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back into our own front yards! america's chickens are coming home to roost.  violence begets violence, hatred begets hatred, and terrorism begets terrorism. a white ambassador said that, y'all, not a black militant, not a reverend who preaches about racism, an ambassador whose eyes are wide open, and who's trying to get us to wake up and move away from this dangerous precipice upon which we are now poised. the ambassador said that the people we have wounded don't have the military capability that we have, but they do have individuals who are willing to die to take thousands with them, and we need to come to grips with that.  let me - let me stop my faith footnote right there, and ask you to think about that over the next few weeks if god grants us that many days. turn back to your neighbour, say ""footnote is over"". now, now. come on back to my question to the lord: what should our response be, right - right now, in light of such an unthinkable act?  i asked the lord that question tuesday, wednesday, thursday, and friday. i was stuck in newark, new jersey; no flights were leaving laguardia, jfk or newark airport. on the day that the faa opened up the airports to bring into the city of destinations those flights that had been diverted because of the hijackings, a scare in new york closed all three regional airports and i couldn't even get here for mr. radford's father's funeral, and i asked god, what should our response be? i saw pictures of the incredible: people jumping from the 110th floor; people jumping from the roof, 'cause the stairwells and elevators above the 89th floor were gone, no more; black people jumping to a certain death; people holding hands, jumping; people on fire, jumping; and i asked the lord, what should our response be?  i read what the people of faith felt in 551 bc, but this is a different time, this is a different enemy, this is a different world, this is a different terror, this is a different reality, what should our response be? and the lord showed me three things, let me share them with you quickly, then i'm gonna leave you alone to think about the faith footnote. number one: the lord showed me that this is a time for self-examination. as i sat 900 miles away from my family and my community of faith, two months after my own father's death, god showed me that this was a time for me to examine my relationship with god, my own relationship with god, my personal relationship with god. i submit to you that it is the same for you. folk flocked to the church in new jersey last week. you know, that foxhole religion syndrome kicked in, that emergency car cord religion, you know that little red box you see, ""pull in case of emergency"". it showed up full force.  folk who ain't thought about coming to church for years, who ain't at church last week. i heard that midweek prayer services all over this country, which are poorly attended, 51 weeks a year, were jam-packed all over the nation, the week of the hijackings, the 52nd week. [unintelligible] but the lord said, this ain't the time for you to be examining other folk's relationships, this is a time of self-examination. the lord said to me, ""how is our relationship doing, jeremiah? how often do you talk to me, personally? how often do you let me talk to you, privately? how much time do you spend trying to get right with me, or do you spend your time trying to get other folk right?"" this is a time for me to examine my own relationship with god - is it real, or is it fake? is it forever, or is it for show? is it something you do for the sake of the public or is it something you do for the sake of eternity? this is a time for me to examine my own, and a time for you to examine your own, relationship with god: self-examination.",1,-2,

788426,"my grandma cath was a hard woman. she was a bitter woman. she was a broken woman. she was an irish catholic woman who married an english protestant as one of her big fuck you's to a family that beat her, starved her and abused her. and while she broke the cycle physically by all accounts she was a very hard woman to love. there was no pleasing her. she expressed her love of her children and her husband by pointing out their flaws and the areas they needed to improve. she also lived with crippeling pain from arthritis.   hearing these stories break my head. because by the time i came along my grandma must have been on some amazingly mind blowlingly great drugs for her crippling rheumatoid arthritis. my grandma cath was the grandma who ruined her good pantihose because i had fallen down and scraped the entire back shin of my leg (she fashioned a make shift bandage out of kitchen wrap and pantihose). she would sing us the horribly politically incorrect songs of her youth. she was always willing to hug and smile and support us.   when i would get frustrated at my parents love of giving me dolls. it was grandma cath who mailed me all the toy cars she could afford. when our family would visit she would blow off my parents during the day to some how manage to crawl around and play with us and get into trouble. she would let us raid her closet and wear her sunday best and do our make up before sitting us down in her tiny kitchen for a tea party.   my grandma jean was still a bitch by the time i was born. she was a harder woman to love for most of the family. she ruled with an iron fist and was petty and vindictive. in later years we found out that she was pretty much abandoned and neglected by her parents when she became two because children weren't much fun. so instead of interacting with their small daughter they would let her fend for herself and buy her gifts and pretty things instead. i know a lot of pampered princesses turn out some what okay but they started this when she was two. jean wasn't good with people unless she was in control. she wasn't good with people if she opened herself up and cared.   jean once announced to her daughter's that at least they weren't totally a waste of her time since at least two of them had given her one grandchild a piece she actually liked.   see at one time jean opened herself up and cared. she at one point tried to be a good mother who was loving and warm. something that considering her history is amazing. and then she spent three years watching her precious child slowly waste away and die from colitis and crohns.   she was also the only woman i've ever met of her generation who was medically ordered to go back to work by her doctor. not because her family needed the money but because raising children was not her forte. my mom and my younger aunt were pretty much raised by the oldest daughter.   she used to try to convince me and my sister to act up and misbehave around our parents and then when our mom got upset to tell her that it was because she wouldn't move back to england.   my relationship with jean was very different. i was one of the good two. as a child i knew when to be quiet. i would much rather read a book then destroy her house. i related to most adults on more adult terms. so jean indulged me quite a lot.   for the record the other good one was one of my much younger cousins who is an almost carbon copy of her dead son. in both looks and personality.   at one point as a child i explained to grandma cath (who didn't have a lot of money) that grandma jean was the grandma who bought me expensive gifts and took me expensive places and grandma cath was the one who loved me.   grandma jean was married to grandpa alan. grandpa alan was a fairly quiet gent. he was pretty reserved. but some of my best memories of him are of me as a teenager with insomnia watching a metal show on t.v. and him walking in with a beer for himself and a shandy for me. he would sit down and from nowhere would start talking about politics and philosophy with me. we had the routine down to an art. i would sit in *his* chair until he showed up with a shandy and then that was my cue to move over to the sofa and after a few videos the conversation would start.   jean and alan don't have the best relationship. they got married because she got knocked up. the marriage lasted because they both love to make the other miserable. the first thing my grandpa said once he was able to speak after his stroke a few years ago was ""thought i would die first didn't you?"" to my grandmother.   jean had spent the months leading up to that moaning about how he hadn't stayed home that night and had the stroke alone in the house where he wouldn't have been able to get medical care in time to survive.   grandma cath's husband is my hero. earnie was one of those rare gem's who was pure good. he was just this amazing human being that seemed to be filled with love and acceptance for everyone. his parent's died when he was young leaving him the oldest child of several young siblings. he was all of 10 - 12 at the time. with no family who could afford to take them in earnie stepped up to the plate. he started working at what ever job he could find while his sister raised the younger siblings to keep them out of the orphanages and workhouses.   in order to make enough money to support his siblings he lied about his age and signed up for the war. during the war he was court marshalled four times for deserting but some how always managed to charm his way out of it.   there was no man in the world better for grandma cath. he loved her. oh gods did he love her. no matter what she said. no matter what she did. no matter how much she tried to push him away he loved her unconditionally and totally. and eventually towards the end he wore her walls down. when cath was in the hospital dying earnie would sneak in, steal a wheel chair and kidnap her for a romantic lunch in a park. when she walked into a room looking like a storm cloud he would fall onto one knee and sing crooner songs at her. well after she died when he was dealing with cancer he would call me and talk about how guilty he felt that his kids would have to go through both of their parent's clothes because he still hadn't been able to bring himself to get rid of hers. that he still talked to her like she was there.   heart breaking when you consider he lived almost 20 years longer then she did. to be honest there was no other person better for earnie then cath. as hard as she was she made sure no one took advantage of him. oh goodness there would be hell to pay in the form of a 5ft nothing angry irish spitfire.   my dad has a story about living in india. earnie had after the war worked his way up through the english factories. he was heavily involved in the union movement. he got offered a job running some factories in india. so earnie shows up and starts teaching his staff how to organize and the techniques that worked in england. they managed to improve their working conditions significantly.   when they came back from india they owned a candy store. earnie was constantly getting in trouble with my grandmother. see earnie charged a sliding scale at his store. often he would share his lunch with one kid who came in or another who looked like theirs would be worse.   in his retirement living off of his vets pension and government pension earnie managed to save enough money to leave each of his grandchildren a 5, 000.00 inheritance. i know how tight money was for him especially after my gran passed. i know that he went with out in order to do this for us.   in his memory i invested mine into a semester's tuition while i was studying social

""  ""i have been a regular practitioner of medicine in boston for 33 years. i have studied the question of vaccination conscientiously for 45 years. as for vaccination as a preventative of disease, there is not a scrap of evidence in its favor. injection of virus into the pure bloodstream of the people does not prevent smallpox. rather, it tends to increase its epidemics and makes the disease more deadly. of this we have indisputable proof. in our country (u.s.) cancer mortality has increased from 9 per 100,000 to 80 per 100,000 or fully 900 per cent increase, within the past 50 years, and no conceivable thing could have caused this but the universal blood poisoning now existing.""   -dr. charles e. page   ""it was similar with the measles vaccination. they went through africa, south america and elsewhere, and vaccinated sick and starving children...they thought they were wiping out measles, but most of those susceptible to measles died from some other disease that they developed as a result of being vaccinated. the vaccination reduced their immune levels and acted like an infection. many got septicaemia, gastro-enteritis, etcetera, or made their nutritional status worse and they died from malnutrition. so there were very few susceptible infants left alive to get measles. it's one way to get good statistics. kill all those that are susceptible, which is what they literally did.""   --dr. kalokerinos, m.d. read dr. kalokerinos book, ""every second child"" for worst case example of vaccines killing children.      **history of vaccines**  smallpox a..smallpox would have disappeared around 1870 if jenner's cronies had not persuaded parliament to force the smallpox vaccine onto children in 1867, causing the largest epidemic of smallpox ever with a peak of 42,000 deaths in 1872.

586358,"&gt; what brought you to the decision to sterilize yourself?  it wasn't a a decision i was ""brought to"", really. i mean, i have never saw myself with kids. when you think of the future, and how you'd like to be living in 5 or 10 or 20 years time... for me kids never entered the picture. my cousin, on the other hand - it's almost like her kids were always the goal of her existence.  i guess i might have decided this when i was still a kid myself, i don't remember. i used to move around a fair bit - i lived in a squat in london for a while, and spent 6 months in brighton for a couple of summers. i spent 6 months in canada. i went to university as a mature student, and everyone signed up with the campus gp (doctor) and it just seemed like an opportune time to have it done. i'd never had a regular doctor before, not as an adult, and i was planning to stay in the same place for a while, so it just seemed like, *ok, i might as well ask - there's plenty of time in which to sort this out.*  perhaps i should add that my sister is severely retarded - she is in a wheelchair, needs to be spoon-fed and wears nappies. when i was a kid i was given to believe (my mother, at least, now denies this, although that doesn't really affect anything) that offspring of mine would have above-average chances of abnormality. so as a consequence, i always felt, *heck, i would never want to put any woman i loved thorough what my mother dealt with*. i also detest infants, which may be related to the fact that i spent my whole upbringing putting up with this big infant, her crying and all that stuff. but as i've also said elsewhere, i look at my cousin's kids, who are fairly nice and well-adjusted of ages c 4 &amp; 6, and i don't fancy that for myself, either.  &gt; what did you go through to have the procedure done?  i was required to attend a one-on-one counselling session before having the procedure, but that was a bit of a joke. it was just like the guy was going through a checklist - there was no ""exploration"" of how i felt about it, or anything like that (at least, that's as i recall).  the surgery itself is about 30 minutes on the table. i went home about 90 minutes after i arrived - i guess you'd wait a bit longer if there was a bit of a queue. it's really not much to ""go through"".  &gt;do you ever regret your decision?  nope, really not. ""the grass is always greener"", but i regret it no more than i regret being tall, or short-sighted or not very good at art or music (i'm a computer guy by trade, and i have an aptitude for that).   &gt; do you wish that more men who don't ever want children would take it into their own hands to ensure that they don't get into trouble?  yes, absolutely. i think kids deserve the best, and i guess i think that the majority of parents don't spend the time thinking about what that means. my father worked very long hours, and was pretty distant during my childhood. in fact he's a bit of an asshole. i don't really think the majority of people can afford to give their kids the time they deserve.   i think probably a very small %age of parents meet the standards i would set as ideal, but it seems like the majority of people just seem to become parents by default, because ""that's what everyone does"" or that's what society expects of them. there were some posts about parenting in [this thread the other week](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/9puh3/what_politically_incorrect_or_bizarre_beliefs_do/) and there's a lot there i  agree with. i don't believe in forced sterilisation of welfare recipients or anything like that, but i think there was a great comment there about how everyone says how they're going to be a great parent and all that, so how come the majority of us seem to have messed up childhoods?  this is all pretty hypothetical stuff, mind you. i'm happy with my decision *for me*, and i don't really presume to judge anyone else. as far as accidents are concerned, i could have been a father a couple of times myself, before this operation, but for the grace of god.  &gt; are you as excited as i am at the prospect of effective, non-permanent male birth control? :)  lol. i presume you refer to the recent news item ""[the arrival of the male pill](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9qpsk/the_arrival_of_the_male_pill/)""?  certainly i can't be as excited as any other guy about that announcement. but they were making similar studies 10 years ago when i had my snip - i don't see it becoming a mainstream option for another decade, to be honest. in the weeks after i had it done, people kept saying to me, ""what a stupid decision - the male pill will be available any time now"" (other peoples' reactions were kinda interesting - i'd love to discuss that more) and yet it isn't.  &gt; are you married/in a long-term relationship? or were you when you had this done?  no and no.   &gt; assuming you are into the ladies, how has this affected your relationship(s), and how do you go about breaking the news?  if i wasn't ""into the ladies"" then there probably wouldn't have been any point in the snip. ;)  i was at university (as a mature student) when i had this done - everyone in my halls and my social circle knew about it. so the girl i dated a few months later already knew, and it just meant we never used any other kind of protection.  generally speaking, i don't mention it on a first date, and if i end up in bed with someone i'll use a condom because it's easier to do that than to interrupt the ""romantic moment"" to have a long discussion about it. i've had the reaction, upon mentioning it, ""so why did you use a condom before, then?"" and explained exactly this.   strangely, i used to hate condoms and now i don't mind them so much. maybe i've just happened to use more ""sensitive"" brands more recently, or something.   i would think it's reasonable for a girl to say ""so what? you've had the snip, but that doesn't mean we should forgo condoms"". obviously, condoms prevent the spread of disease, too - herpes is *frighteningly* widespread. if i was in a long-term relationship with a girl who said that, i'd want us to have tests after a few months and abandon condoms (assuming the tests came back negative, of course).  but, having said that, i think all the girls i've dated have been ""nice girls"", who i'd not expect to have been too promiscuous in the past, and who have probably only had a handful of boyfriends. you probably don't expect a nice girl you meet to have a disease, and i guess i'm a nice guy, too, because their response has always been, ""ok, we don't need to use a condom, then"" (just as most guys would be perfectly happy to forgo condoms if a girl they trusted told them they were on the pill).  oh! i've been with one girl with whom i had pretty much a ""fuck buddy"" relationship. i think she had only 1 boyfriend before me, and i don't think she slept with anyone else during the year or so when we had occasional sex. but i just always used a condom with her anyway. it's possible she said ""use a condom because i don't want to get a disease from you"" (she wasn't a very nice person and would have thought nothing of implying i might have an std), but i wouldn't have tried without. not because i think she was ""dirty"" or anything, just because it's good practice to use a condom, if in doubt.   i have made the joke ""i hope i didn't get you up the duff"" after the first condomless fuck with one girl. i'd obviously  told her about my vasectomy, but there was a pause for a moment. i'm not sure whether this was incredulity, or her translating it into finnish (her native tongue) but then i got a playful slap.  i've had one girlfriend call it off after about 6 or 9 months together because she's always seen herself with kids, and she didn't think adoption filled that role for her. she'd known about my vasectomy pretty much the whole time we were dating, but i guess this realisation came on her pretty suddenly - i went to visit her one weekend and she was in tears over it. we were fairly serious together - we had a really great rapport, talked about everything and anything, very high sexual compatibility indeed, and we had used the l-word. so there was this whole thing about me being the perfect guy that she wanted to be with for the rest  of her life, but the kids thing was a show-stopper for her. i would have probably been a lot more distressed, had i not recently been having doubts, too, so that kinda worked out for the best.  there have been a couple of other girls who i've dated (actually for shorter periods) who have dumped me for other reasons and over whom i've been more distressed about. i guess it would be a kick in the balls if there was someone i was totally into and she dumped me for this reason, and it was a bit shitty to have this lovely lass in tears over this, so i do tend to find out early if girls imagine themselves with kids in the future, and i make sure to mention it early in the relationship.",1,-1,-1

idk.), i got criticized...unless, of course, my parents needed me to illustrate a poster or something for vbs at church or whatever. i was in choir and i probably had a pretty good singing voice at the time, but they didn't want to pay for lessons to help me get better because they said it was too expensive and maybe it was. i don't know. i was left pretty much on my own to figure out everything from learning how to navigate the social world of teenagers (which i sucked at) to sex and driving (i took driver's ed, but it was a disaster).   when i was 18, i got engaged to my husband. we set the wedding date for the february after i turned 20 (my birthday is in the fall). my mom begged me to put it off until my sister (who was 16 when i got engaged) and my brother (who was 13 at the time) got out of high school so i could ""finish what i started"" with raising them. i told my mom i wasn't putting my life on hold any longer. i'm pretty sure she blames me (at least secretly..she's never said anything outloud) for my sister's drug and alcohol use, since that started after i left or at least, if my sister had been using drugs, etc before then it really ramped up after i left and my brother also started doing drugs and getting in trouble around the same time.  i always had to be the best. i had to be the smartest, the most charming, the most pleasing. my mom and stepdad would constantly tell me ""well i bet (insert friend's name here)'s children wouldn't act the way you are acting."" as if that would motivate me to behave better or do better in school or whatever. i've always had to be the one to do things ""the right way""...i had to get married in a church wearing a white gown because that's what my mother wanted since neither of my siblings was going to do that for her if they ever got married (my brother, in fact, is getting married at the county courthouse where he lives in six weeks). i had to be the first one to get pregnant...though my sister beat me to it by a few months with her deadbeat exboyfriend/babydaddy (my brother doesn't want kids). my husband, son and i are the shining example mom trots out whenever her friends ask her how her kids are doing. i'm sick of it but at this point, there's not a lot i can do but put up with it.",1,-1,-2

447863,"&gt;comes now the house-passed health care ""reform"" bill that, amazingly, would extract more subsidies from the young. it mandates that health insurance premiums for older americans be no more than twice the level of younger americans. that's much less than the actual health spending gap between young and old. spending for those aged 60-64 is four to five times greater than those 18-24. **so, the young would overpay for insurance which -- under the house bill -- people must buy:** 20- and 30-somethings would subsidize premiums for 50- and 60-somethings.  and even this doesn't take into account that 20-30 somethings tend to make a lot lower wages/salaries than the boomer 50-60 somethings -- so the distortion in costs versus disposable income is even greater than the nominal values would indicate.   which, in fairness, he does cover later in the article:  &gt;whatever the added burden, it would darken the young's already poor economic prospects. unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds is 19 percent. peter orszag, director of the office of management and budget, notes on his blog that high joblessness depresses young workers' wages and that the adverse effect -- though diminishing -- ""is still statistically significant 15 years later."" lost wages over 20 years could total $100,000. orszag doesn't mention that health care ""reform"" might compound the loss.  and then the closing summary does a good job of adding it all up:  &gt;on health insurance, we may choose to override some risk adjustments (say, for pre-existing medical conditions) for public policy reasons. **but the case for making age one of these exceptions is weak.** working americans -- the young and middle-aged -- already pay a huge part of the health costs of the elderly through medicare and medicaid. these will grow with an aging population and surging health spending. either taxes will rise or other public services will fall. already, all governments spend 2.4 times as much per capita on the elderly as on children, reports julia isaacs of the brookings institution. why increase the imbalance? &gt; &gt;it's true that premiums for older people would be higher. but this might have a silver lining: facing their true health costs, older americans might become more eager to control spending.  bingo.  ergo all the young people who have been foolishly ""pushing"" for this are basically screwing themselves (and their age mates)... meanwhile the aarp members can continue with their golfing, cruises, and other amenities, entirely free from worrying about *paying* for the consequences of decades of irresponsible living.",1,-1,-2

811148,"&gt;let‚Äôs start with this missing piece: the vast majority of [pedophiles are men](https://archive.is/o/3wlpi/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/psychopathology-and-personality-traits-pedophiles). and the majority of children victimized by those pedophiles who do choose to act on their sexual desires [are girls](https://archive.is/o/3wlpi/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0272735809000245). this is a rather major detail to withhold from your audience, wouldn‚Äôt you say? unfortunately, as pervasive and overt as patriarchy is, it is usually the last detail mentioned in conversations of this nature ‚Äî if it is mentioned at all.  i can't say anything about the first source since it doesn't let you read it without a membership. but as for the second, it's interesting that for all you say about patriarchy that you don't mention how there's much more of a stigma against boys who are sexually molested than for girls. the act of child molestation on anyone is awful regardless of gender of course, but (in america at least) girls who are victim to this stuff are pretty widely supported, and pedophiles who prey on girls are condemned. but there are still plenty of people who say that boys wanted to be molested, especially if the perpetrator is a woman.  &gt;in pedophile culture, women are expected to maintain a near-impossible level of thinness, prepubescent in their almost-androgynous lack of curvature and body fat. due to this pressure, eating disorders abound in young girls, and women in particular are targeted throughout their lives by a multi-billion dollar weight loss industry.  being thin doesn't mean you're a child, dumbass. at this point you're just bodyshaming thin women. also, aren't kids known for having, you know, *baby* fat?  &gt;in pedophile culture, the top pornhub category is ‚Äúteen.‚Äù ‚Äúbarely legal‚Äù ‚Äúgirls‚Äù in schoolgirl outfits play out everything from ‚Äúvirgin manipulations,‚Äù daddy-daughter incest fantasies, teacher-student make believe‚Ä¶ you name it, there‚Äôs porn for it, and it‚Äôs been whacked-off to millions and millions and millions of times. it‚Äôs fair to wonder whether the only thing keeping some of these viewers from watching straight-up child porn is age of consent laws.  pedophiles aren't sexually attracted to teens, they're attracted to children. plenty of teens (especially the ""teens"" on pornhub who are of legal age) look pretty similar to young adults.  &gt;influenced by the porn industry, labiaplasty, a surgery that carves the labia minora down to porn-sized slivers, is rapidly gaining popularity. so are other procedures, like hymenoplasty, which restores virgin-like tightness to women‚Äôs vaginas.  that sounds more like women wanting guys to fuck them than pedophilia. it also sounds stupid as fuck.  &gt;in pedophile culture, women are outright pressured to regularly shave or wax their nether regions and underarms. the cosmetics industry ‚Äî again, targeted at women ‚Äî peddles ‚Äúanti-aging‚Äù creams and lotions that will make our skin ‚Äúbaby soft!‚Äù  ""baby soft"" is a metaphor, you stupid fuck. women want soft skin, babies are known for having soft skin. thus that phrase is used, it isn't because of pedophilia.  &gt;in pedophile culture, we casually refer to grown women as ‚Äúgirls.‚Äù we have a word specifically for attractive female teenagers: jailbait.   grown men are referred to as ""boys"" too, doesn't mean everyone who talks like that wants to fuck toddlers. and jailbait isn't necessarily a gendered word ‚Äî you *could* use it to refer to a male, it's just more commonly used towards women. either way, the whole thing about jailbait is ""i'm gonna wait 'til she's 18 to fuck her so i don't go to jail."" not to mention the fact that, again, attraction to teenager ‚â† pedophilia. it's fucked up if you're an adult and you act on such an attraction, but you aren't a pedophile.  &gt;in pedophile culture, i often catch men in public checking me out with eyes full of lust, until they see the hair on my legs ‚Äî at which point, they resort to a theatrical display of disgust.   that's more about gender roles and stereotypes about femininity than anything else.   &gt;i‚Äôve eavesdropped on groups of college-age guys talking about how they won‚Äôt perform oral sex on a woman if her labia are too prominent.   that's just preference/squeamishness.   &gt;one man who had been pursuing sex with me for three years, suddenly changed his mind when i revealed that i do not, and will not, shave off my pubic hair.   again, a preference. he still wants to fuck someone that's of legal age, he'd just prefer that someone to shave.   &gt;surely all of these men, who have a ‚Äúpreference‚Äù for the aforementioned qualities in women, aren‚Äôt pedophiles by the strict definition of the word.   or by, well, *any* definition of the word, you dumbfuck.  &gt;but it seems that a high number of men, likely as a result of deep cultural conditioning, find many of the same things attractive in a woman that a pedophile would find attractive in a girlchild. small labia, tight vaginas, intact hymens, baby-soft skin, hairless limbs and vulvas, eternal youthfulness, tiny frail bodies‚Ä¶ as tumblr user reddressalert wrote, ‚Äúhow do we not recognize that this is essentially a description of a baby or a toddler?‚Äù  if you look up [""beautiful woman""](https://www.google.com/search?q=hot+girl&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjm77z888zkahxcpz4khaxbdqwq_auibygb&amp;biw=1188&amp;bih=593#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=beautiful+women) on google images, you see women who are skinny, shaved and with nice skin, sure. but they definitely don't look like toddlers, considering all the big racks and protruding asses. maybe teenagers at the worst, which still isn't pedophilia.",1,-1,

971037,"imo:  * (newborn: about 0-3 months of age) * infant: roughly 0-6 months (so includes newborn), sole/primary nutrition is breastfeeding.  it's almost always in somebody's lap, or mostly lying down, at most sitting upright or crawling on its stomach, definitely not usually crawling on hands and knees. * baby includes infant, but also extends to around 1 year of age. older babies might be able to crawl on hands and knees, should at least start eating solid food if not rely on it primarily (here, supplementary breastfeeding is recommended, and many mothers do continue until roughly 1 year old or even beyond), etc. * there's a bit of a fuzzy area when a child can e.g. stand with support but not on their own, or stand on their own but not walk, or it might be able to say what sound like syllables and words but clearly doesn't really understand them at all. baby or toddler, matter of preference i guess. * toddler to me means the child has at least taken their first steps, but standing up, especially without support, might be enough too. first words, especially if they get the meaning right at least some of the time, could also be a criteria. i would say usually not breastfeeding anymore in the developed world, although it's not unheard of, and it's not easy to set a hard upper age for that (although afaik usually even if allowed to continue, even in developing countries in africa kids *very* rarely breastfeed, or even want to do so, beyond 4 or 5, max). * somewhere around 2-3 the child transition from toddler to what is ""play age"" in my native language. maybe e.g. ""small child"" in english. the child can walk well, run, and speak at least some tens of words or say simple sentences, or hold short conversations. * kids around 5-6 are preschool age, since that's when they start preschool, and it's also sort of a hybrid age between the clearly kindergarten aged smaller children and the already more independent 1st graders.  note that the above are my personal preferences/opinions on how to use the words, and/or how the terms for childhood are split in my native language, finnish. e.g. [this page](https://www.thespruce.com/difference-between-baby-newborn-infant-toddler-293848) agrees with me in general terms (the ages i gave above fit within the ranges they suggest), although their preschool starts earlier, and the initial statement there,   &gt; typically, the term ""baby"" might be used to refer to any child from birth to age 4.  ... that's just way too lax imo. except of course that a parent's children are always ""their babies"" even into adulthoods, at least in english/in many cultures.  however, e.g. the google definition for infant says:  &gt; british (listed as 2nd meaning): a schoolchild between the ages of about four and eight. ""their first year at infant school""  this seems like a specific context though, not the general meaning.   sorry if this was too much of a wall of text for you, i thought the distinctions made for an interesting question. also, my guess is the baby in your story is probably best descibed with ""baby"", or maybe a young toddler, if they were a bit larger, but if they didn't say any words, probably not.",0,,

618694,"34, guy from spokane, wa. so unemployed i'm considered outside the workforce. supposed to graduate from liberty university this summer but i'll probably have another nervous breakdown. i dunno.  it was made painfully clear to me that i was conceived in the back of a 75 ford mustang mistakenly by two immature 17 year olds, one with a history of mental instability. my father apparently thought my grandparents, who largely took care of me during summer breaks, were the nazis and moved us to the pacific northwest so he could work for his dad. my dad was really into cars, he belonged to the local mustang club and painted some jobs that ended up on magazines... i mention this in context of all the nights they got home from these meetings too late to remember i was sleeping in the back seat and forgot me in the car. i'd wake up in the middle of the night and all the doors were locked, and i was too timid to knock so i'd sleep in the garage.  i never made friends. usually when i did my mother would rather physically impress all of the bad features of that person in order to make me feel guilty for being around them. to her, i was ""her only friend,"" even though she easily made friends with the people at the pizza place where she worked, who happened to be jehovah's witnesses. she started studying and was baptized into that cult when i was 8. i was indoctrinated repeatedly at multiple levels for 12 years but never reached the ""baptized"" status (for the witnesses you have to read the right books, which kept changing).  when i was 12 she had a particularly bad nervous breakdown where she locked herself in a bathroom beating and screaming at the walls. i was so freaked out i basically for the first time prayed to god that i'd do anything for him if he'd just take care of my mom. i guess it's fair to say neither of us kept that bargain since mom is still crazy, and i signed up for the witness discipleship program but didn't follow through. i ended up giving a few sermons (they have a special night for students), went door to door a few times... it wasn't a great congregation, it was one of those with a lot of secrets. i knew i wasn't the only one being beaten with 2x4's (it's ok so long as its less than 2' long) and curtain rods (1"" wooden dowels), but since i was a guy i guess i escaped the sexual stuff, which did happen.   with the jw's it wasn't so much about salvation as ""being in the truth."" the jws held the only christian truth and all others were tools of satan trying to lure us away from the truth. and with guys like jerry falwell and bob patterson (or whoever) on tv it wasn't hard to see christianity (or christendom) outside the witnesses as morally bankrupt. everyone was waiting for armageddon, like all of our speech was laced with references to that, which would happen at any time. like everyone was really sure it would happen before i graduated high school, so they really discouraged me going to college... if anything, if there was time, they wanted me to go to bethel, which was their seminary. that's how i got a better picture of the background.  i managed to get a little greek under the belt and a copy of the emphatic diaglott (an interlinear) and it wasn't long before i noticed that their bible was wildly mistranslated, and not on unimportant things... stuff they claimed proved the bible never claimed jesus was god, basically major tenants of jw belief were wrong. being young and impetuous i was like ""well hey, i'm not following something that's obviously wrong."" so i boldly announced to my parents that i did not want to be a jw.... got the beating of a lifetime, and near a decade of stink-eye from the congregation. there was no way out, i was stuck. basically i had to play like i was in, but for my own sanity kind of trained my personality into two modes, one that played for them and one for everyone else. even after i left that has been messing with me, anytime something is right there is some part of me trying to subvert it.  my senior year can be marked as one of the worst years of my life. i expected the world to end (whether i believed or not, i just wanted it to be over) and that never happened. my sexual development was all jacked up because my mother was like ocd about the birds and bees and me not getting a girl pregnant before college, but then when i turned 18 wanting grandchildren. there was a girl i was desperately in love with but she was outside the faith so she was ""forbidden."" she met some other guy and had her own issues ever since her dad left her mom because he was gay, she couldn't handle that so i guess it wasn't meant to be. not that when you're a teenager you're able to put things into perspective. that year i attempted suicide three times. pills first, then driving into a tree, when i got hold of the gun is when they shipped me off to california.  i lived with my grandparents, and there is where i was able to shake the witnesses for good. i experimented, looked into wicca, but got very interested in comparative mythology. i wanted to become a science fiction writer. i wrote a ton of fan fiction, but then got into actual 3d rendering since my grandfather being an engineer had taught me cad all my life. but i had no social life in california, there was a girl i met but that was a disaster. i started a career as a burger king manager, missed the few friends i had in idaho and decided to move back.  skip ahead a few years, 2002 i think was when my brother got a hold of my dads guns and tried to shoot me. that got me moving out on my own for the first time. i was involved with this girl who was actually married. after that disaster ended... i just remember my life sucked ass. i was driving down the road and cried out to god asking him not to let me die alone. i dunno if that was even a smart prayer or whatever... i did that.  the next girl i met was not my soul mate. she was crazy, niece of my roommate, wild in bed but also doing another dude so that was smart. her brother wrapped his car around a tree and the seat belt severed his head... at the funeral she's standing there slurping on a milkshake and laughing at the crappy reattachment job they did on his head. yeah that relationship was over with. i dunno why they even had an open casket for that.  so a month later i get voted as captain of my local star trek club and i'm up one night planning out stuff and open icq wondering if anyone is even using the program anymore. that's when lonna messaged me. i just see ""female, 18, spokane"" i'm like ok. we talk for a week, meet up, hook up, two weeks later she's living with me, nine months later we're married. (next month will be a decade together) we had all sort of plans involving me going to itt tech and becoming a high power architect and we'd have lots of kids... the itt thing did happen. i remember having nervous breakdowns through my last few months trying to get it done, but it happened. i went into civil engineering, which was awesome, but probably the dumbest move i ever made.  while this was happening i'd been managing this burger king for a company that sucked ass. like better conditions in china bad. one morning my boss calls me and says ""been nice working with you man, but i'm not opening the store today. i'm done."" and i said ""well i'm not either man. i'm done too."" and we wrote each other letters of recommendation but that was it, i walked away from a decade long career as a burger king manager with no regrets. ended up getting a job helping a best buy open in coeur d'alene, sales in the tech department.  why is this important? because that's where the christians met me. first it was this nasty day with a customer being a total douche and working on getting the cops to escort him out while one hands me a pastor to help who's looking for a sound system. well we don't have those... but he see's i'm freaked by the ass-hat so we keep talking like i'm going to sell a laptop or something. i end up asking about his beliefs, he's got a card with a website... he asks about my background, i tell him about some of my jw stories. he's sufficiently horrified and gives me what would become a common ""man, people need to hear your story."" eventually i'd come to wonder why that is because no matter how i tell it, it just sounds like i'm seeking pity when i couldn't give a shit about that, its just my life... this is what it is.  but after that ever sunday people would come in and talk with me, not all from the same church but the conversation would turn to god. which was nice because i was really sick of computers. eventually i'd get my job at the drafting company but i always remember how the best part of my little intermission was the christians coming to talk about something other than how gateway sucks.  even at taylor though every now and then we'd get to talking about the old days and people would be like ""man people need to hear your story."" still don't know what that means. but we were living in idaho at the time, both working in spokane, and decided to finally move here. about this time lonna and i were about five years married, and i was also podcasting for farpoint media.   -to be continued...-",1,-1,-2

 yes, our cjs needs to be re-examined and altered to insure equality exists for all americans.  yes, some police officers need to do a better job of remaining professional, adhering to their training, keeping cool &amp; not allowing the human suffering and oppression of children many witness on a daily basis to erode their humanity or basic human respect for others.  just as some single &amp; married moms need to do a much better job of parenting by raising, nurturing, socializing &amp; supervising infants, toddlers and children who mature into fairly happy, responsible teens and adults respecting their peaceful neighbors &amp; the authority figures responsible for maintaining peace in our neighborhoods.  i'm sorry to pick on moms, though they are the caregivers we look to keep us safe, cared for &amp; loved right from our start.  peace. _________ doctors ross and dietz offer insights into how our early childhood development plays a key role in determining the type of individual we mature into.  robert k. ross, md, president and ceo of the california endowment, addressed inmates at ironwood state prison offering a compelling overview of the role that exposure to childhood trauma plays in the lives of *emotionally troubled* and chronically ill american teens and adults.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dscnub_kbuw  at 2:12:25 in this documentary about mafia hitman and victim of early childhood trauma/abuse, richard ""the iceman"" kuklinski, dr. park dietz explains why young richard most likely developed into a emotionally disturbed, paranoid, cruel, heartless teen and man who did not give a frig about anyone else, including his wife and kids.  https://youtu.be/qxgi72w2h7u?t=2h12m25s __________________________ *(ny times may 18, 2015 - rise in suicide by black children surprises researchers)*  black *(children's)* lives matter; take pride in parenting; *end our national epidemic of child abuse and neglect*; end community violence, police fear &amp; educator's frustrations",1,2,-1

544429,"keniston called it youth, arnett calls it emerging adulthood; whatever it‚Äôs called, the delayed transition has been observed for years. but it can be in fullest flower only when the young person has some other, nontraditional means of support ‚Äî which would seem to make the delay something of a luxury item. that‚Äôs the impression you get reading arnett‚Äôs case histories in his books and articles, or the essays in ‚Äú20 something manifesto,‚Äù an anthology edited by a los angeles writer named christine hassler. ‚Äúit‚Äôs somewhat terrifying,‚Äù writes a 25-year-old named jennifer, ‚Äúto think about all the things i‚Äôm supposed to be doing in order to ‚Äòget somewhere‚Äô successful: ‚Äòfollow your passions, live your dreams, take risks, network with the right people, find mentors, be financially responsible, volunteer, work, think about or go to grad school, fall in love and maintain personal well-being, mental health and nutrition.‚Äô when is there time to just be and enjoy?‚Äù adds a 24-year-old from virginia: ‚Äúthere is pressure to make decisions that will form the foundation for the rest of your life in your 20s. it‚Äôs almost as if having a range of limited options would be easier.‚Äù  while the complaints of these young people are heartfelt, they are also the complaints of the privileged. julie, a 23-year-old new yorker and contributor to ‚Äú20 something manifesto,‚Äù is apparently aware of this. she was coddled her whole life, treated to french horn lessons and summer camp, told she could do anything. ‚Äúit is a double-edged sword,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúbecause on the one hand i am so blessed with my experiences and endless options, but on the other hand, i still feel like a child. i feel like my job isn‚Äôt real because i am not where my parents were at my age. walking home, in the shoes my father bought me, i still feel i have yet to grow up.‚Äù  despite these impressions, arnett insists that emerging adulthood is not limited to young persons of privilege and that it is not simply a period of self-indulgence. he takes pains in ‚Äúemerging adulthood‚Äù to describe some case histories of young men and women from hard-luck backgrounds who use the self-focus and identity exploration of their 20s to transform their lives.  one of these is the case history of nicole, a 25-year-old african-american who grew up in a housing project in oakland, calif. at age 6, nicole, the eldest, was forced to take control of the household after her mother‚Äôs mental collapse. by 8, she was sweeping stores and baby-sitting for money to help keep her three siblings fed and housed. ‚Äúi made a couple bucks and helped my mother out, helped my family out,‚Äù she told arnett. she managed to graduate from high school, but with low grades, and got a job as a receptionist at a dermatology clinic. she moved into her own apartment, took night classes at community college and started to excel. ‚Äúi needed to experience living out of my mother‚Äôs home in order to study,‚Äù she said.  in his book, arnett presents nicole as a symbol of all the young people from impoverished backgrounds for whom ‚Äúemerging adulthood represents an opportunity ‚Äî maybe a last opportunity ‚Äî to turn one‚Äôs life around.‚Äù this is the stage where someone like nicole can escape an abusive or dysfunctional family and finally pursue her own dreams. nicole‚Äôs dreams are powerful ‚Äî one course away from an associate degree, she plans to go on for a bachelor‚Äôs and then a ph.d. in psychology ‚Äî but she has not really left her family behind; few people do. she is still supporting her mother and siblings, which is why she works full time even though her progress through school would be quicker if she found a part-time job. is it only a grim pessimist like me who sees how many roadblocks there will be on the way to achieving those dreams and who wonders what kind of freewheeling emerging adulthood she is supposed to be having?  of course, nicole‚Äôs case is not representative of society as a whole. and many parents ‚Äî including those who can‚Äôt really afford it ‚Äî continue to help their kids financially long past the time they expected to. two years ago karen fingerman, a developmental psychologist at purdue university, asked parents of grown children whether they provided significant assistance to their sons or daughters. assistance included giving their children money or help with everyday tasks (practical assistance) as well as advice, companionship and an attentive ear. eighty-six percent said they had provided advice in the previous month; less than half had done so in 1988. two out of three parents had given a son or daughter practical assistance in the previous month; in 1988, only one in three had.  fingerman took solace in her findings; she said it showed that parents stay connected to their grown children, and she suspects that both parties get something out of it. the survey questions, after all, referred not only to dispensing money but also to offering advice, comfort and friendship. and another of fingerman‚Äôs studies suggests that parents‚Äô sense of well-being depends largely on how close they are to their grown children and how their children are faring ‚Äî objective support for the adage that you‚Äôre only as happy as your unhappiest child. but the expectation that young men and women won‚Äôt quite be able to make ends meet on their own, and that parents should be the ones to help bridge the gap, places a terrible burden on parents who might be worrying about their own job security, trying to care for their aging parents or grieving as their retirement plans become more and more of a pipe dream.",1,1,1

""it had never occurred to me that i would have to manage cooking and taking care of a child at the same time,"" chen says. ""but that's how my life has evolved.""  where she once went online to follow the latest fashion trends, chen now downloads child-rearing apps and participates in wechat forums about motherhood.  access to a glut of outside information on child-rearing is a big departure from traditional motherhood. in the past, young women with new babies simply followed the advice of mothers, mothers-in-law and grandmothers on how to raise children. what one generation did was passed down to the next without any questioning.  those were the days when families had multiple children to raise, instead of the single-child generation now moving into motherhood. those were the days when many women stayed home or, if they worked, toted their babies with them because they couldn't afford nannies. most of today's young mothers are determined to meld career and home, often with outside helpers.  according to a baidu online survey, 37 percent of post-1990s mothers are rearing their children on advice they get online, from friends, in books and magazines and from doctors. about 35 percent said they place the most trust in professional advice, while only 7 percent said they rely on the experience of the older generation.  carol xiao resumed her fitness regime at a gym one month after giving birth, ignoring her mother-in-law's admonition that exercise could affect breast milk production.  ""there is no conflict between the gym and breast-feeding,"" says xiao. ""i believe that a healthy mother can better breast feed a baby.""  sociologist gu xiaoming says he is confident that post-1990s mothers will be good parents.  ""nobody is born mature,"" says gu.

""how hard could it be?"" she asks herself. ""and even if it did turn out to be hard, i could hire a nanny and leave the baby to a professional. but that was all a pipe dream. once you hold your baby in your arms, you don't want to part with it.""  gu frequently listens to child-rearing lectures from professionals, both online and offline. like most new mothers, she is bombarded with kindly advice from parents and friends.  ""it is not that i don't trust what other people say,"" says gu. ""but when it comes to the health and safety of my baby, i cannot be too cautious. there are things you can learn only after you have become a parent yourself.""  gu has not given up her love of travel. she first took her son on day trips when he was 8 months old. his first overseas trip was to japan just before his first birthday. travel, she says, broadens the experience, and it's never too young to start.  ""as the chinese saying goes, 'the man who travels far knows more',"" says gu. ""i want to teach my son to learn about the world we live.""  zeng nan  24, with an 8-month-old son  freshly out of university and only seven months into her first job, zeng was taken aback when she found she was pregnant early last year.  she was overwhelmed with worries about caring for a child out of a family income of only 10,000 yuan (us$1,449). zeng says she read media reports about the high expenses of raising children.  ""would i be able to take good care of a child while i still felt a bit like a child myself?"" she asked herself. ""i was far from confident.""  her own mother assured her that she wasn't facing an insurmountable situation.  ""my mother always said where there's a will, there's a way,"" zeng says. ""it's not a matter of money. nobody is born a skilled mother, but she said i could learn if i put my heart into it. and she promised me that she would always be there if i needed help.""  zeng resigned from her job with an advertising company because she was often required to work overtime until midnight. instead, she found work as a public servant with regular hours. she reduced ""unnecessary"" spending, like frequent trips to the spa and dining out. she began extensive reading on child-rearing.  ""frankly speaking, i was still unsure about whether i could cope even as i was wheeled into the maternity ward,"" she says. ""but i was resolved to try my very best.""  her first challenge came only weeks after delivery. her newborn cried for hours on end, regardless of long cuddling. he bent his legs upward and clenched his fists. once she identified the actions as common among newborns at night, zeng learned to massage her son's belly gently before laying him down to asleep, a technique she learned online.  ""mothers online are all willing to share experiences and information,"" she says. ""it's like entering a whole new world since i became a mother.""  she has learned to make some time for herself. while her mother babysits, zeng sometimes has a night out with friends.  ""i enjoyed those relaxing outings,"" she says, ""but i am always happy to return to my baby.""  zhao junjun  25, with a 13-month-old girl  zhao says she felt a terrible letdown after giving birth.  ""i realized that the focus of my family shifted from me to the baby,"" she says. ""i was treated like royalty when i was pregnant, but i lost my crown the minute the baby was born. worse, i knew it was wrong for me to feel that way.""  however, taking care of a newborn left her little time to dwell on such thoughts. she was disappointed to find that she could not produce enough breast milk to feed her daughter, no matter how many traditional remedies she tried.  ""i am lucky to have a very considerate husband,"" zhao says. ""he told me not to worry and said baby milk powder would provide our daughter with all the nutrition she needed. he eased my depression.""  zhao returned to her job at a local aeronautical institution five months after her baby was born.  between work and baby care, she finds all her time occupied.  her parents-in-law take care of the baby while she's at work. on weekends, she makes time to take her daughter on small outings.  ""i sometimes wonder if i had a child too early?"" she says. ""but my daughter has become part of my life and i can't imagine life without her. i guess that's what makes a mother.""  when zhao noticed her baby's tendency to howl and throw toys around in anger, she worried that maybe her own bad temper was influencing the behavior of her daughter.  ""i realized that i needed to change,"" says zhao, who now stops and takes deep breaths whenever she feels her temper rising.  ""good habits are important role models,"" zhao says. ""i don't want to exert any negative influence over the way my daughter grows up.""  wang xianglin  61, with a 3-year-old grandson  a retired teacher, wang was determined to give her daughter-in-law wide berth in how she raised her baby.  she says she did give some advice now and then, but didn't take offense when it was rebuffed.  ""my daughter-in-law was doing what she learned online,"" says wang. ""so i just shut up lest i make an outdated nuisance of myself.""  ke bin  57, with a baby granddaughter  ke moved to her daughter's home nine months ago to help take care of her granddaughter while her own daughter goes to work.  she was somewhat upset when her post-1990s daughter would sneak out to do a bit of partying after putting the baby to sleep.

382783,"actually, it has already been decided b/c it's an 80 year repeating pattern.  the reason why the boomers are so worthless but yet think they're so incredible is b/c of this cycle of the generations.  we (x) are the corollary of the silent generation (we're practical but with less self esteem) and the opposite of the boomers (b/c they parented us in a reactionary fashion to their childhood of indulgence).  ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strauss_and_howe#generational_archetypes  the boomers and gen y are two sides of the same coin. the irony is that the op's grandmother created these indulged boomers b/c they grew up in during the depression and to shield their children they made them live in an indulged dream world that they wished they had.  those over-indulged boomers were too self-involved to give a shit about their kids so genx raised themselves in the basement while the boomer parents danced the disco, found themselves while wearing crystals on their heads and ultimately became establishment.  what people don't realize is that the boomers were lucky.  in fact they were the luckiest generation.  the benefitted from peak oil. they took credit for rock and roll and civil rights but those movements weren't headed by boomers at all but instead silent generation - just like geny now takes credit for obama when it's actually genx that got him elected. being a hippie was just a hula hoop fad - they're just lucky that it was kinda cool.  poor geny is following the trends also but unfortunately they're fads just aren't that cool ""hipster, pull forward, the men are all fat, etc"". every generation follows the trends but not all are cool but every generation thinks they are at the time.  on another point, if you're unsure of what generation you're a part of b/c you're on the cusp a lot of this has to do with economics.  i have a y friend that grew up very poor around 1982 so he's more identified with x.  if you were rich in 1979 then you'll probably identify more with y.  you can see this in people from very poor areas.  they're usually a few years behind the general societal shifts.  as a gen xer, i will clean up the boomer's mess, they and their gen y cohorts will take credit for it.  the gen y's will abandon us just like their boomers cohorts did when we were children and we will get blamed for everything.  we are truly damien and the exorcist and geny is ""baby on board"" precious cargo.  it's a repeating pattern and that actually makes is even more depressing - until you don't give a shit anymore.",1,-1,-2
555476,"actually that's not true, you got tremendous amounts of debt spending which caused the economy to kick - of course since the end of the cold-war 20+ years ago, with the economic collapse of the ussr, we have not similarly reduced our military posture and on a per-capita basis spend almost as much as we did when we were ostensibly ""forcing"" the ussr into bankruptcy to match our own military expenditures.  we got what ""looked like"" an economic recovery - but that was due largely if not cheifly to reckless military over-expendture on our part during the 1980's.  did that artificially lower unemployment for 2 quarters - yes - it did but for the remaining 7 1/2 years - my statement is valid. inflation - is - another matter - that has alot more to do with the declining economic command that was experienced by the us populace since the 1970's, this was in fact reinforced in 1985 with the 2:1 devaluation   of the dollar and again in the collapse of the money markets in 1987 and the collapse of the deregulated savings and loan markets of 1989 - but i'm sure we can forgive almost anything of former president reagan now can't we.  the difference is that these days, 8 dollars of every 10 spent in the government still goes to defense. healthcare and social security looming means (of course) that we should do nothing but lavishly fund defense.  i mean fuck the people after all, we just need more missiles - and the notion of any kind of social support structure, young through low-interest education loans, the old through social security or infirmed through medicaid is just unforgivable levels of creeping socialism / communism into our national infrastructure.   forget that education,retirement and healthcare are generally considered public rights in every other industrialized nation; the presumption i suppose, is that if you can't make it ayn rand style you deserve to die in the streets ... i suppose.  so long as we have autonomous hunter-killer drones and million dollar missiles to kill someone in some god-forsaken corner of the world who might have been thinking badly and scheming schemes against our corporate ""interests"".  what's profoundly disturbing however, is the radical right, as much as i applaud ron paul's attention to minimizing our military presence overseas and his disdain for our overspending i find the overall line of ideological shortsightedness on the radical right disturbing....and i'm not alone, but that's also the primary reason conservative/corporate media refuses to cover dr. paul consistently , oftentimes ignoring him whenever it's possible.  the level of miseducation in this country and the absolute rejection of the real drivers of our economy - educational excellence and promotion of scientific &amp; engineering efforts both public and private utterly denude the united states from even the possibility of competing against china, japan, germany in areas like nano-technology, biologic sciences/genetics or computer science.   these are all areas where we cede our former prowess because we don't want to offend the religious ideologues among us who think ""darwinism"" is a threat to their religion, so we deprive ourselves of a future generation of children interested in science because evangelized dogmas has clouded our future.   in that respect, the fundamentalists are correct ""darwinism"" is a threat alright, not learning it - and forcing the absurdity of ""intelligent design"" into public fora, directly disadvantages our children, our nation and our future prospects for economic well-being as a nation - because the south koreans, japanese, chinese will be more than happy to take those jobs in genomics, genetics and protienomics; we have politicians who similarly feel or believe they are obliged to participate in a ""culture"" war while debating the various merits of ""micro-evolution"" and whether it happens or not;   meanwhile our economic competitors will be having elementary school children performing pcr analysis and working on genetic simulations.   so we stand - in the here and now - not just ""behind"" from an economic / scientific perspective, we're simply outclassed.  so as those children with an aptitude, encumbered in such a society as ours, they must play - what 2-3 years of catchup - because our primary educational system is so enfeebled by ideological correctness, and dogmatic teaching methodologies, particularly in those parts of the country where immigrant communities are absent and parent's who themselves are scientifically or mathematically ignorant - who themselves simply don't know enough to demand rigor in science and mathematics in education.  as another example, consider energy policy, here again - the gop has played what - 50 years of pretending oil dependence wasn't a serious national security concern. we've fought 3 wars and spent what - 4 trillion dollars at the least fighting them. for that kind of money we could have funded and built an entire solar power network to power the entire nation.... but no.  energy policy now breaks into two camps, oil and gas are the darlings of conservative politics with again absurdist policies of ""drill baby drill"", while again not talking about the hard science behind the notion that the easy oil - is gone - that no amount of environmental deregulation or drilling will find 6 to 7 million barrels needed to bring the us back to what it was capable of producing during our domestic production   peak of 9 million barrels.  it simply isn't there.  we currently produce just slightly more than 4 million barrels and this is sharply declining in most areas since these well-heads are generally considered ""mature"". if we work very diligently - and develop new technologies to do so - we might get better than a 1.8:1 energy ratio from that vast athabasca or dakota tar-sands but we will never see the 20:1 energy ratios of light-sweet crude - the vast profits made in oil and gas in the previous 100 years are rapidly vanishing and so to the economic existence of firms that right now dominate right-wing politics.  of course to mention things like solar - means that you think al gore might make sense, that solyandra is just a big ponzi scheme to enrich mr. obama somehow and that the ""green"" movement is just creeping communism out to infringe a hippy lifestyle on everyone everywhere.  in this way it's entirely impossible to see the solyandra collapse as exactly like the collapse of our lead in micro-electronics and electrical-engineering 20 years ago.   deadly serious competition snuffed by cheaper products produced as an end result of economic competition (if not warfare) waged by our economic adversaries against our national interests.  it's not possible to reconcile the fact that every other industrial power on the planet views conversion to renewables as a vital national concern , and that government funding have allowed countries like germany to get nearly 20% of their energy from renewables, - it's just not possible to have that conversation - because al gore is a communist...or something.   so here again - our generation sits in stupefaction while our economic competitors - china, japan and germany take our markets , our jobs and our technological lead and run with it, they are already all too happy to dominate in the renewables industries.  lastly - and certainly not least is the notion of the social contract that generations of our fellow citizens have been benefit to, the notion that being a competent hard   worker assures some level of employ-ability or worse that companies producing goods could not be arbitraged out of existence by the vagaries of short-term profit maximization.   this brings us to to the handmaiden of our current economic crisis, the financial sector which has encouraged this hyperindivdualism and conducted criminal levels of fiduciary misconduct. but of course they are the last bastion of american industry - or so we are told.  frankly what's happened over the last 30 years is pretty plain to see - the vast disenfranchisement of the lower 90% of this nation-state. where false left-right debates are meant to be engaged upon without paying a single bit of attention to the vast over-concentration of wealth.  now of course the gop lurches from ideology to ideology from neoconservatism to libertarian objectvism and back like some political drunkard no longer to hold his liquor, only needing one more drink to ""get it right""....one more election...   in this way our nation has fallen to it's present state, no longer is unity possible, no longer are we able to form consensus, the right continues to lurch ever rightward and further into what could easily be the death spiral of the gop itself.  how many decades has it been since there was a ""moderate"" conservative party, that wasn't exterminated by the party itself.   nixon proposed a national healthcare system 30 years ago to prevent out of control healthcare costs, eisenhower 60 years ago called upon us to limit and be mindful of our excesses in military-industrial-congressional influence, but no we don't get a realism of nixon or the pragmatism of eisenhower - we have to coddle to the sock-puppetry of   sarah palin and michelle bachman , and that ideological rhetoric of dominismism with rick perry - who can barely hold a conversation about the science around evolution or nanotechnology, or genetics  or energy policy without reverting to infantile talking points.   it's embarrassing , it's shameful - and whatever you might think - it's not the fault of the ""left"" because at the end of the day - the ""left"" in this nation - has been forcibly expanded by conservative media itself, to basically encompass anyone who's not some consummate consumer of their media.",1,-1,-1
213292,"echoing others who have said that bifl is not really pragmatic for actual newborns (both because it will probably get ruined and because it just gets stored until you eventually can use it), here are some of the truly sturdy, workhorse, ""investment pieces"" that i found extremely useful and valuable in the first year of my child's life but that were expensive, built-to-last items that i will absolutely keep for future children in the family:  [baby bjorn bouncer chair](http://www.babybjorn.com/baby-bouncers/baby-bouncer-balance-soft/) this was my lifesaver. my baby loved being in it while i showered or cooked, etc, and its different levels of recline meant that it was great for him for most of his first year. literally, this thing was so important to me that it was the only piece of baby gear i took with me when i traveled. i borrowed strollers, travel cribs; rented car seats; whatever - but i would not be separated from this bouncy chair. it folds flat to store easily and depending on how fast the kid grows can also be used as a little toddler lounge chair when the kid is old enough to go walk over and sit in his own chair (and to want to). i currently have mine packed away because my 14-month old just climbs up it like a moron, but i will bring it out again once he is ready to use it as a chair again (if he ever gets there before outgrowing the chair). this bouncer is like $150 more than most bouncers but i would 100% consider it worth it.   [baby bjorn travel crib](http://www.babybjorn.com/baby-cradle-and-travel-crib/travel-crib-light/) and [cradle](http://www.babybjorn.com/baby-cradle-and-travel-crib/baby-cradle/) i am not brand-loyal btw - there are baby bjorn products that i would not opt for as my first choice - but when they do a product right they really do it right. these two products are phenomenal imo and well worth the money over a more common bassinet or pack-and-play. my son absolutely loved the cradle and i loved the breathable mesh sides that a) gave him good airflow, and b) let me see him without walking over and looking in, back in those nervous early days. plus it's so lightweight that i could easily move it around the home so that i could bring him out into the living room etc depending on what i was doing (lololol like i was doing a whole lot, back in those early weeks). the travel crib is similarly beloved - he actually sleeps better in it than he does in his regular crib - and it is the easiest set-up and take-down that i've ever seen in a travel crib. absolutely great products, both of them.  a swing can seem like the absolute opposite of a bifl item, because you will almost certainly not even be able to use it for more than a few months, but if your baby sleeps well in a swing you will find it worth it no matter what. the luxury favorite is the mamaroo but they are coming out with a new model that i think looks even better - the [rockaroo](https://www.4moms.com/rockaroo). i found a mamaroo used on craigslist and was psyched, but my kid was a bridge troll who hated swings (and car rides, and everything else babies usually like) so it was underwhelming for me. but my point is that even though i started out anti-swing on principle, due to vague bifl/""waste of money"" reasons, when i thought there was a chance that a swing might help us all get more sleep even if just for a few weeks or months, i was like hell yeah. a swing can be a lifesaver if it works, and this is a good one. it also retains a decent resale value if your sibling decides to craigslist it.   [stokke tripp trapp highchair](https://www.stokke.com/usa/en-us/highchairs/tripp-trapp/1444.html) this is probably the closest you will get to bifl in terms of products that will also get used in the baby's first year of life. this high chair has a ton of adjustable levels and eventually grows into a comfortable chair for even an elementary-school kid. comes in a ton of colors and has various baby-specific accessories like tray, cushioned back, etc. probably one of the most expensive high chairs you could buy but it's worth it imo if the money is there.  aden and anais - almost anything they make. the swaddling cloths still get used daily. i like the muslin ones a lot but like the bamboo ones even more. i use them for everything - to make a cushy back in the stroller, to become an impromptu play or picnic blanket, as a lovey to sleep with, as a prop to cover up a bit when nursing, as a blanket, as a scarf (for me, lol), as a bib in a pinch, etc. i basically always have at least one on me at all times. they look lovely and classic and not hideously ""baby-fied"" like so many baby products, they feel amazing, and they wear well in my experience. note that ""aden by aden and anais"" is a slightly less...nice? idk? sub-category within the brand that is available at places like target. i have some of both (a+a, and aden by a+a) and don't feel much difference in the swaddling blankets but do in the bibs and sleep sacks.  on to the sleep sacks - my absolute favorite. my baby sweats a shocking amount at night and i don't like how heavy most sleep sacks are (often polar fleece, etc). these ones are muslin and breathable, even in the heavier weight. bibs are also my favorite - i never cared about bibs before but once my baby started teething and drooling everywhere i realized that i really wanted a nice soft bib near his face all day, not a scratchy one.   [zutano baby booties](http://www.zutano.com/shop/category/newborn-and-baby-booties/) are wonderful before the baby can walk around. my kid wore these just about every second we were not at home from october through about april. so soft, so warm, so easy to put on and difficult for an infant to take off.   a variety of good bottles can be a really great thing to have, if your sibling hopes to breastfeed the child. this is because breastfed children tend to fight bottles more than children who are bottle-fed from the get-go (or shortly thereafter) - not all of them, but they are more likely to overall - so it can be harder to find a bottle that the baby will take and that also doesn't give gas, or have other weird problems you've never considered before like ""too many parts to wash"" or ""hard to grip"" etc. my baby's absolute favorite bottle was the [joovy boob](http://www.joovy.com/boob-glass-bottle/) and another high-end favorite is the [comotomo](http://www.amazon.com/comotomo-natural-bottle-green-ounces/dp/b004c053aq), but it was expensive to buy a lot of different bottles and try them out, and then it was expensive to buy enough of this rather pricey bottle to amass a couple days' worth of them. this is sort of the opposite of a bifl gift - because it's sort of a ""sampler"" of bottles - but an array of some of the various bottle options might be a great gift that would help the new parents try out a lot of options without investing a ton of their own money.   as for toys, the three toys that my son has been playing with the longest are the [skwish](http://www.amazon.com/manhattan-toy-classic-grasping-activity/dp/b000gi0s4e), the [o-ball](http://www.amazon.com/oball-4-inch-infant-rattle-colors/dp/b00188xw26/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1443205157&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=oball), and the [mozart magic cube](http://www.amazon.com/munchkin-03101-mozart-magic-cube/dp/b00004tflb/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1443205178&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mozart+magic+cube). he started playing with the skwish and the o-ball just about as soon as he realized he had hands - their structure makes it so that they are incredibly easy to grasp, etc, but even now almost a year later my kid still plays with them a lot. the skwish is also very nice to look at and touch, since it's made of wood etc. the mozart magic cube, i did not expect to be such a hit, but my kid has been playing with it constantly since about 6 months old. it's actually quite a nice toy; the baby can isolate different instruments and have them join in or drop out of the piece of music, and it has a fair amount of musical tunes on it.  aside from product recommendations like that, if they have the space for a designated nursery and it isn't tiny (which, if they're loaded, they probably do and it probably isn't), i think a classic toy chest with torsion hinges (torsion hinges very important!) is a great gift, or a nice child-sized table set, etc. my friend owns a carpentry business and he often builds toy chests and holy cow, do i wish i could afford/find space for one of them. that is a real bifl item, i think, because you could use it for linens or sweaters or, hell, for sewing supplies or video games etc as an adult.  a nice sheepskin rug is also wonderful for a baby. mine used to feel soothed laying on it as an infant, and sometimes i would even lay it in the stroller before i put him in just to be extra-cozy. now he likes to sit on it for quieter playtimes. honestly, i like touching it too. it's just very nice, and a classic gift.  if you want to go the route of art, birthday/year memorabilia, etc, a good option to ensure that it doesn't just languish away in a storage bin someplace (new parents are not always the best at dealing with these things!) is to have it matted and framed yourself, so that they can hang it in the baby's nursery, etc. like the newspaper headline from the day the baby was born (or even a collage of various headlines), or a comic book, or the album artwork from the album that topped the charts on the day the baby was born, whatever - you can turn just about anything like that into a piece of artwork and it may well retain enough sentimental value and retro-cool factor to go to college or to a first apartment with the kid someday. if you just give the item itself, there's a decent chance that it will just sit in a box, if your sibling is anything like me, lol.",1,2,

243947,"okay, a stupid abortion opinion.  i'm assuming what i think is the general view for each side of the debate, pro-choice or pro-life.  specifically, i think most pro-choicers agree with roe v. wade that all abortions before the third trimester should be legal.  and on the other side that most pro-lifers, motivated by religion, believe that a soul gets magically inserted into a fetus at conception.  (i think this is fair to say generally, though i know some people have more varied opinions.)  first of all, a person who declares abortion ""murder"" is probably immovable on this point.  i think the best way to suss that out is to ask them what they believe should be the penalty for a woman who has an illegal abortion and for the doctor who performs it.  if they answer that the penalty should be the same as for murder, then the debate is probably pointless.  you can't prove they are wrong about a fetus having a soul.  the best you can do is try to convince them that they'll never win on abortion politically and maybe they should turn their attention to a fight they can actually win.  you can *try* to convince them that we can't legislate based on religious belief, but that argument is going to go down the ""christian nation!"" shithole pretty fast.  if they answer anything less than whatever the penalty is for murder, then i assert that they do not genuinely believe that a fetus has the same value as a one month old baby.  now you've got some ground to work with.  the question now becomes a matter of what is more valuable morally, and you can get into all those rape and health of the mother questions.  but what's happened here with all this rape/health-of-the-mother debate?  pro-choicers are conceding ground just by arguing this point because they (generally) believe that abortion should be a choice no matter the circumstances.  what's the point of arguing this?  even if you win this argument, all you've done is convinced the pro-life person that we should make some exceptions for abortions.  that's fine, i guess, but it's not the pro-choice position.  so what the fuck is my point anyway?  my point is don't argue with them because you can't prove them wrong.  instead, try to find some common ground.  acknowledge, for example, that nobody could morally stomach seeing an eight-month fetus terminated for no reason, pro-life or pro-choice.  so pro-choicers also have a line they draw that says, ""this fetus is a person right here.""  pro-lifers simply put that line all the way at the beginning.  the common ground you can find is ways to prevent abortions that don't include making them illegal.  these are arguments that can be won on reasonable merits, like better sex education and availability of contraception.  the ""abortion is murder"" argument cannot be won, most of the time.",1,-1,

""experimenting with babies"" will amuse and entertain parents ‚Äî and the rest of the family. with the book's help, they'll experience the thrill of scientific research from the comfort of their own living-room laboratories and find out what happens when the empirical meets the adorable.  visit http://www.experimentingwithbabies.com for more about the book, including a list of experiments, plus new research and more.   **how babies talk: the magic and mystery of language in the first three years of life**  roberta m. golinkoff, director of the infant language project at the university of delaware, with developmental psychologist kathy hirsh-pasek, explains how infants acquire language, and what parents can do to help make language acquisition easier for their babies.  the book presents a mix of hard science and research analysis, for those who are interested in the ins and outs of child development, as well as some very practical ""try this at home"" exercises, for those who want to see how all of this applies to their own child.   **brain rules for baby: how to raise a smart and happy child from zero to five**  john medina's very successful earlier book ""brain rules: 12 principles for surviving and thriving at work, home, and school"" showed how we can use our knowledge of how the brain works to transform our lives, and in ""brain rules for baby,"" he takes the same sort of approach but focuses specifically on early childhood.  medina, a molecular biologist who studies the genes involved in human brain development, clearly explains the science behind brain development and offers suggestions, based on those ideas, about how to encourage a baby's mental, emotional, and behavioral development. he points out some strategies that work ‚Äî and, importantly, some that don't.   **bright from the start: the simple, science-backed way to nurture your child's developing mind from birth to age 3**  this book by dr. jill stamm, co-founder of new directions institute for infant brain development in phoenix, ariz., focuses on babies' intellectual development.  stamm writes with an interesting personal angle: she had one baby who was born extremely prematurely ‚Äî doctors even suggested that she would never walk or talk ‚Äî and another baby who was not born prematurely. she describes how she used an abc (attention, bonding, communication) approach to encourage the development of each child and help them flourish, and she offers practical suggestions to parents about how they, too, can help nurture their child's development.   **what's going on in there? how the brain and mind develop in the first five years of life**  lise eliot, ph.d., a neuroscientist, writes about baby's developing brains from the perspective of both a mother in awe and a scientist who's well acquainted with the complexities of the mind.  this book, targeted toward parents with an interest in science, explains how your baby's brain develops in the womb, and how it continues to develop during your child's first few years. she offers tips, backed up by cutting-edge research, on how to help stimulate your baby's brain development, and insights into what's actually going on in that cute little head.   **nurture shock: new thinking about children**  in this provocative book, po bronson and ashley merryman use social-science research to back up their argument that much of the conventional wisdom about how parents and society ought to nurture children is not just wrong and ineffective but, in some cases, actually harmful.  the book takes on topics such as language development (and why popular strategies don't work), racial sensitivity (and why popular methods of racial integration don't work), self esteem (and why constant praise doesn't help), and intelligence (and why ""gifted"" programs' evaluation methods don't work).   **spit that out! the overly informed parent's guide to raising children in the age of environmental guilt**  paige wolf is a green-living advocate and a mother of two who found herself struggling to be an eco-conscious parent. sifting through conflicting headlines and determining what separates ""realistically green parent"" from ""crazy green parent"" can be a daunting task, so wolf took it upon herself to save other parents the trouble.

832027,"wall o' text incoming, because i talked about this before and just wanted to lay the points out that i made before. i don't expect a play-by-play response, just tossing my opinion out for anyone who might be reading down this far.  comparing zoosexuality to child abuse is probably the most common argument against zoophilia. but the premise of the argument is flawed, in that a sexually mature animal is not a child in any fashion other than what humans project on them. we see animals are helpless and shoe-horn them into our human society and culture, often removing their own free will, their sexuality and their own natural environment, so it can be hard to see that somewhere inside that cute, gentle retriever is a wolf, with all the same drives and abilities and attitudes that allowed that creature and its own society to be more than a match for humans at a distant point in history.  meanwhile, an actual human child is in the midst of a very complicated development process which can be harmed beyond repair if the wrong kinds of sexual associations are made at an early age. humans become highly complicated over a long period of time with a vastly complex system of conscious thought towards associations and memories. animals work on a very different system and don't have the same attitude towards their sexuality, for most animals it's purely a function or a body part or a drive to satisfy, or at best a pleasurable activity to enjoy with a willing mate, and they would only create a negative association with a sexual act or physical intimacy if that act was associated with pain or trauma in some way. they won't suffer harm later down the road for partaking in an act that they enjoy. if they actually were child-like in nature then we shouldn't allow them to have sex with *each other* either for the same reasons outlined above.  a common, general principle to raising animals in a healthy, responsible way is to understand that they are *not* children. many people do far more harm to their adult pets' behavior by treating them like babies instead of fully functional, mature creatures that need to be respected for the culture they come from and the instincts that drive them, be it pack or herd mentality.  also, an adult animal has a sense of ""self"" that is not developed in either a child or immature animal. it is clearly *different* than an adult human's sense of self, but it does exist and i wouldn't call it undeveloped in any way.   and what about sex with mentally handicapped? yes, it could be quite easy to exploit someone who cannot say no or understand what's going on. and it's clearly wrong because inside that mentally damaged person it is still a person with that same highly complicated development process, even if it s been stunted... but does that mean that we should treat the sexuality of the mentally handicapped as forbidden and morally wrong as sex with a child?  generally i feel this may be the hardest area to really explore. not because i feel there's a real association with zoophilia, but that mental handicaps can cover a broad swath of different levels of impairment and ability at different ages. but for a large number of conditions, i think it's also unfair to compare the mentally handicapped directly with children or animals. while i don't think people should attempt to take advantage of mentally handicapped, it should be recognized that adult, mentally handicapped people may be entitled to intimacy and sexual pleasure in some circumstances. i don't feel qualified to make these kinds of judgements about when and how this might be acceptable and what this kind of sexual contact might entail, but some of the points made in [this](http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/publications-a-z/479-sex-education-for-physically-emotionally-and-mentally-challenged-youth) article by [http://www.advocatesforyouth.org](http://www.advocatesforyouth.org) make better points about recognizing the sexuality of youths and adults with mental handicaps better than i could. it also touches a little on questions about the differences between a mature, sexual being and a child. here is an excerpt:  &gt;**myths and facts about sexuality and disability**  &gt;many people believe myths about the sexuality of people who live with disabilities. common myths:  &gt;*   people with disabilities do not feel the desire to have sex. &gt;*   people with developmental and physical abilities are child-like and dependent. &gt;*   people with disabilities are oversexed and unable to control their sexual urges.[7]  &gt;myth 1: people with disabilities are not sexual. all people‚Äîincluding young people‚Äîare sexual beings, regardless of whether or not they live with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. and, all people need affection, love and intimacy, acceptance, and companionship.[6,7] at the same time, children and youth who live with disabilities may have some unique needs related to sex education. for example, children with developmental disabilities may learn at a slower rate than do their non-disabled peers; yet their physical maturation usually occurs at the same rate. as a result of normal physical maturation and slowed emotional and cognitive development, they may need sex education that builds skills for appropriate language and behavior in public. in another example, paraplegic youth may need reassurance that they can have satisfying sexual relationships and practical guidance on how to do so.[6,7,8,9]  &gt;myth 2: people with disabilities are childlike and dependent. this idea may arise from a belief that a disabled person is somehow unable to participate equally in an intimate relationship. societal discomfort‚Äîboth with sexuality and also with the sexuality of people who live with disabilities‚Äîmay mean that it is easier to view anyone who lives with disabilities as an ‚Äòeternal child.‚Äô this demeaning view ignores the need to acknowledge the young person‚Äôs sexuality and also denies her/his full humanity.[6,7,8,9]  &gt;myth 3: people with disabilities cannot control their sexuality. this myth spins off the other two‚Äîif people with disabilities are neither asexual nor child-like, then they perhaps they are ‚Äòoversexed‚Äô and have ‚Äòuncontrollable urges‚Äô. belief in this myth can result in a reluctance to provide sex education for youth with disabilities. the reality is that education and training are key to promoting healthy and mutually respectful behavior, regardless of the young person‚Äôs abilities",0,,
692177,"the bane of every backseat 1989 honda accord.  i remember my brother and i had a long-running gaming feud.  i smacked him in the back of the head with a metal baseball bat when he was, pixel by pixel, drawing cars from 'hot rod' magazine in mario paint. i claimed i was ""practicing swinging."" seven year-old me was a bitch.  then, when i was nine, i was playing ""final fantasy"" on the nes. having already mastered the ""shit shit shit hold the reset button to save for fuck's sake did it save?! did it!??"" from playing zelda, i had just defeated kary and was hella stoked. i ran down the hall to tell my brother, who was thirteen and had recently acquired ""dookie"" and was practicing all nine guitar tabs for the album.  he followed me down the hall and i hopped on the bed and grabbed the controller and started babbling as i just trailed off and watched, wide-eyed and in horror, as my brother coolly walked up to the nes, across the end of the bed on my dresser, and balled his fist and ..... whack!!!!!  i fell off the bed, screaming and crying, as he stepped back and crossed his arms and said, ""this is why the snes is in my room!"" as i blew on the cartridge and tried, without luck, to salvage my countless hours of gameplay (remember that very first final fantasy orb!? do you remember? there needs to be a toby keith song for where you were when you got your first orb!)  oh, there are many other stories, for being a girl four years junior to a brother who took most of mom's abuse, we only really bonded over video games. we made signs that said ""busted"" like in n.a.r.c and would ""tag"" each other like we were in the game. we shot punks up in gotcha! we mimicked the malicious dog in duck hunt, we discovered the world 1 to world 4 in smb2, together, my first high-five with my awesome big bro, who took our mom's drunken punches. i never realized how much he protected me, even when we were in separate rooms forced to piss in jars for days because mom ""couldn't handle this shit.""  but when dad was home, he'd take us the four hour drive to charleston to see grandma.  and you all know that game gear ran out of batteries in less than two hours. and the gameboy was only so interesting compared to mighty morphin' power rangers on the motherfucking full color backlit game gear!  so, there was the water game. this exact one. i kept fiddling with it, and my brother would feign a ""bump"" in the road and smack the game, causing all the rings to float off their pegs and leaving me in emotion ten year-old girl shambles. fuck this! let's see if rearranging the batteries in the game gear would at least let me play columns, right?  but there we were later in the afternoon, watching ""the price is right"" with grandpa while dad went back to my uncle's room to look at beatles albums and guns, and grandma quickly hid all the snacks because the black sheep's fat kids were there.  mom called. dad answered the phone. you could hear her screaming at him about 'abandoning her' and 'stealing her babies', the stuff only the most narcisstic of the /r/raisedbynarcissists can conjur up and say.  i was embarrassed because my grandpa said, ""you kids could have been blonde and pretty."" (alzheimer's and lifelong resentment of my father's marital choices did not make us well-liked children)  i didn't move, but i started welling up and crying because i was a chubby short brunette girl with glasses. my brother was even fatter and had suffered extensive bullying. we hoarded food in our rooms because mom wouldn't let us in ""her kitchen"" to ""steal her things."" we would climb out the windows and bring each other cheese slices in the section of yard between our adjoining rooms.   normal, nuclear, mid-90s family.  i didn't want my grandpa to see me crying, so i sat there like an idiot, shaking and crying while my brother got up and left for the longest time. the tense phone call continued, my grandma came into the living room and sat down on a couch and called to me but i wouldn't move. she made a comment that i ""wasn't listening to my elders, like some people my father married.""  frozen, i didn't see my brother from my peripheral vision, but he slowly, slowly sat down next to me and the red and plastic came into my field of view.  it was perfect.   every ring stacked on every peg.  i looked over at my brother and he glanced at me sideways, the most emotion you could summon out of a fourteen year-old boy. he frowned a little and shoved it out to me.  i took his gift, and this was the most comforting thing he ever did for me during our childhood. i carefully took it to the bedroom and sat it carefully on the dresser. everything in that plastic watery case was in order, how it was supposed to be. if ever there was any finality or perfection in our lives, it was through the games we played where we lived out our fantasies for a need of love and approval, and winning those levels and getting those rings on those pegs and beating robotnik and saving the princess, those were what we had, and our only link to each other.   my brother died a while back, in person, but lives each day as a shell of human being. he has been a hardcore heroin addict for fifteen years. we both has/have severe ptsd. we both go to therapy. a lot of therapy. we both had to come back home because dad never would leave her and she has alzheimer's now, and though sometimes she doesn't remember our names, she certainly remembers how much we ruined her body and her life by being born from her womb. she still screams when we walk into the kitchen. we still both tense up and freeze and get nervous when she does this.  we are both in our thirties.  when we came back, he brought two children, two children with no mother and a father who was never equipped to raise them. i'm not much better of a hope, but i took them, in addition to mine. we have a strange arrangement between my spouse and i but we make it work. he helps me with my brother's children, and i help keep the world alive for ten people in all. just a part of it.  but if there is one thing i do right for these kids, it's playing as many games with them as possible. the tekken showdowns, the super mario world-a-thon. teaching them all the ""tubular"" words from my youth on star road and beyond, teaching them the shell's colors, and they in turn scare the shit out of me with five nights at freddy's and entice my inner autism with minecraft. and they can eat all they want all the time. no shame here. just fun. it's the best i can do.   the rings have sing long fell out, and the water long since drained from the plug, but i still have that goddamn water game in the attic here.   one small little game, and you guys spawned some of the defining moments regarding the dynamic relationship between my long-suffering brother and i. that's why i love you /r/gaming.",1,1,-1

(also, reddit needs a better multi-paragraph quoting mechanism ;\_;)  &gt; dear mom and dad,  &gt; first of all, i am going to say this outright: there is no one true transgender narrative. some people know from a young age‚Äîmany more people do not realize it until puberty or young adulthood, and some people don‚Äôt realize it for decades. however, many will still feel some form of gender dysphoria (a negative feeling associated with discomfort with traits associated with their birth gender, [caused by abnormal hormone levels at critical points in utero]( http://aebrain.blogspot.co.uk/p/transsexual-and-intersex-gender-identity.html)) even if it is initially unrecognized as such.   &gt; that being said, i have had thoughts in varying forms about becoming a girl/woman for a long time‚Äîat least since early puberty started. i‚Äôve experienced social dysphoria‚Äîthe feeling of being the wrong gender socially‚Äîin varying degrees since middle school (possibly earlier, if you count reluctance towards ‚Äúhighly masculine‚Äù activities), even if i did not see it as more than idle speculation at the time. at [all-male, liberal college prep high school] it was mostly masked by the fact that i rarely had large-scale social access to female social groups to make any comparisons to‚Äîand even then, i still tended to ‚Äúlone it out‚Äù at [aforementioned high school]. at [college] i‚Äôve realized i have more desire to relate to female peers than male peers, and have come to envy [my younger sister]‚Äôs ability to express herself in ways i would never be able to as a guy.  &gt; i‚Äôve experienced physical dysphoria (the feeling of physically having the wrong secondary sexual characteristics) to varying degrees. in the past it‚Äôs mostly manifested as discomfort with having broad shoulders, but it has become particularly noticeable recently. i have also been secretly obsessed with the idea of gender changes since puberty‚Äîand the more i researched them, the more i realized i wanted to physically experience things as a woman.  &gt; both of those types of dysphoria have been flaring up recently.   &gt; when i took steps to present as female physically or socially, (even if they were masked by, say, a heavy coat), however, the dysphoria was replaced by a sensation of gender *euphoria*‚Äîa very positive feeling of being the right gender. this has held repeatedly‚Äîalthough it‚Äôs fed a hunger i‚Äôm having increasingly little desire to mask.  &gt; it is common for gender dysphoria to increase with time. additionally, [left untreated](http://avitale.com/developmentalreview.htm), the lack of ability to express gender identity can lead to personally crippling consequences later. to quote the abstract of the report i linked:   &gt; *living in conflict with one of the basic tenets of existence (am i male or am i female?) is understandably anxiety provoking. this fact leads me to suggest that gender identity disorder as this conflict is described in the dsm iv, is not an appropriate descriptor. i suggest here as i have elsewhere (vitale, 1997, 2001) that instead the condition be termed gender expression deprivation anxiety disorder (gedad). after explaining my thinking on gender expression deprivation anxiety, i will describe how this anxiety, if left untreated, is manifested in each of the five developmental stages of life: confusion and rebellion in childhood, false hopes and disappointment in adolescence, hesitant compliance in early adulthood, feelings of self induced entrapment in middle age, and if still untreated, depression and resignation in old age.*  &gt; i would recommend reading the whole thing‚Äîthere are areas where i can very much point a marker and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs me.‚Äù other areas are less relevant (it seems i‚Äôve come to embrace, rather than shun, cross-gender ambitions‚Äîif i went through that phase, i did so in middle school,) and a sparing few are outdated (it turns out not everyone really, truly ‚Äúknew‚Äù from a young age‚Äîhonestly, growing up i had a very weak conception of gender and, like many things i believed at a young age, i gained my childhood gender understanding from taking adult opinions at face value.)  &gt; also, regardless of how dysphoria changes over time, i am on a bit of a time limit to resolve it as much as i desire to. i‚Äôm in late puberty now: the longer i wait, the less effective hormones will be in feminizing my body. bone structure finalizes by age 25 (sometimes earlier)‚Äîand while i‚Äôve noticed from high school i‚Äôve had wider hips than i think is typical for a guy (likely due to genetics from mom and [paternal grandmother]), i‚Äôve been trying to literally squeeze apart my hip bones to prevent them from fusing and finalizing if they haven‚Äôt already.  &gt; [you might have noticed a recent story on the news about a transgender girl who, after all her options were spent, committed suicide](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/31/transgender-teen-who-died-of-an-apparent-suicide-fix-society-please/?tid=pm_pop). i‚Äôve denied and questioned my transgender feelings for a longer time than she did, but the time i‚Äôve spent reflecting and researching has catalyzed my feelings into active desire and galvanized my will into commitment. i know who i am, and i will fight to physically reflect that fact‚Äîjust as leelah did. she fell when her parents, refusing to see who she really was, put her in a situation where she couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. do not be as blind as they were.  &gt; my identity is not up for debate. i am reina, and though you can call me [birth name] while i‚Äôm still presenting as male, the reality of being reina will not change. discovering that was completely worth everything i‚Äôve gone through during my discovery and since‚Äîall the time, all the effort, all the hate, all the doubt, all the anxiety, all the fear, all the dismissal, all the awkwardness; it was completely worth all those things and more.  &gt; please. dad, i understand you don‚Äôt want to lose your only son‚Äîbut you aren‚Äôt. you‚Äôre seeing the tomboyish daughter you always had realize who she is and assert herself for the first time.   &gt; she is still going to like math, she is still going to like pc games, she is still going into [tech field], she is still going to silently groan when mom is looking at drudge report, and she is still certainly going to be your biological descendant. she is also going to be more confident, more outgoing, more socially tactful, and more willing to speak up when she disagrees with something. with sperm banking and/or tech advances, she might even be able to have kids.  &gt; reina‚Äôs going to be a non-passive, assertive [birth name] with estrogen and t-blockers, boobs/hips, and eventually a vagina. that‚Äôs basically it.  &gt; if you attempt to tighten your parental control and either reject me, shame me, or try to stop me from asserting myself, then defiance, strife, and conflict will happen instead. i am going to be myself‚Äîand i will fight to be myself as long as i am able to.  &gt; mom, i understand your apprehension about the rest of the family‚Äôs acceptance‚Äîbut i am tired of hiding who i am under a basket for the good of the family. i can defend myself as i need to.  &gt; for the [maternal] side of the family i plan to come out to my older cousins (who are more likely to be accepting than older generations) first. they can do rain checks and figure out how best to handle me telling their parents. we can deal with the others when we come to them.  &gt; for the [paternal] side, i honestly agree with [younger sister]‚Äôs evaluation that [paternal grandmother] likely won‚Äôt mind. if and when you two have accepted it and are ready to back me up, i will send grandpa and grandma separate emails about this.  &gt; we can deal with the rest of the [paternal side of the] family when we come to them as well.   &gt; for now, i would like to look into sperm banking.  &gt; after that, i would like to look into hormone replacement therapy.  &gt; i don‚Äôt really know how to conclude this, but please listen. i would *like* your unconditional acceptance, but i *need* your support and backup.  &gt; love,  &gt; reina [chosen middle name] [last name]",0,,
194166,"well, ""right"" is a very vague concept in your above comment. it really doesn't even have any meaning other than your own personal frame of reference. the 2 kinds of ""right"" i was specifically mentioning are very definitive and easy to evaluate. your definition of ""right"" will depend on who is deciding if it is ""right"". my 2 definitions of ""right"" are, basically, universal.  so. to answer the question you pose, without any more information than we already have, in my humble opinion, is impossible.   it seems to me, though i could be way off base, that 5.5 years to sell the house is more than enough time. even if they had to lower the price on it ten-fold. if their goal is to keep their granddaughter, then 5.5 years would give any human being on earth enough time to make some sort of viable, and legally valid plans and enact them. so, i would need to find out how they responded to the initial request for her to leave. did they just fight it? ignore it until too late? did they not take it seriously, and assume that their neighbors would be compassionate? or did they honestly and earnestly go out on the market, and immediately start shopping the house? how bad off is the mom they supposedly disowned and took custody from? what were they doing before they ***inherited*** the house they are now fighting over? one can only assume they lived in some dwelling. how did they afford it? why can't they do that, now? hell, they don't even have to sell the house. just move out and leave it on the market. it was ***inherited***, after all. again, if they could support themselves before they got the house, and we can only assume they could and did (since they won a custody battle in court versus the kid's own mother, and their own daughter- not an easy task), then why not now? if they can't support themselves, then they don't need to be the caretakers of a little child. if they can't take care of their own finances and legal situations, then, what in the name of god are they doing with a baby or toddler or child?   if they knowingly signed onto the hoa bylaws, and ***then*** actively fought for custody of their granddaughter without even considering the long term consequences of such an action, without any sort of contingency plan, then i would point all fingers at the grandparents. if this is the case, what can they possibly say to defend their actions? to the hoa: ""ohhhhhhhh, when you told us to sign, here, here and here, and initial here, here and here, you actually meant that our signatures were us agreeing on the terms of residency? no, we didn't think that. we thought all of that paperwork was merely for show!"". to the court that granted them custody: ""ohhhhh. you would have liked to have known beforehand that we lived in a retirement community that banned children, before you granted us custody??? hmmmmm, we didn't see that as being pertinent information!!"".  also, think of the child. is it a good idea to raise a child in a retirement community? the old folks don't want her there, and she needs kids around. any place would be better for her development than a community that is so adamantly against children that it has a 55+ year old requirement on residency. these are precisely the sorts of situations that foster care was set up for (along with, obviously, abusive parents or guardians)- temporary circumstances that result in a child having no place to legally stay.  and in situations like these the court will allow the grandparents to come visit, whenever. they would not be cut off from the kid, nor would she be cut off from them. and, the moment they secured a viable livelihood for the 3 of them that wasn't breaking contracts and bylaws, they would immediately get her back without having to fight.   so, again, i think anyone who wanted to make a valid decision on right/wrong (the way you defined them) in this case, would need a ***whole lot*** more information. as it stands, with the sparse information we now have, in my eyes, she should be evicted. or, the government should state- wholesale- that community bylaws are illegal to enforce. i am with you on the legality of something having very little bearing on whether or not it's ""right"". i smoke, as well. i may very well do a few other things that big brother wouldn't look kindly upon. but, in my eyes, contracts are something that should be enforced (otherwise, why even have them?). these people signed one. they also have apparently (again, in my eyes) dragged their feet nonstop for 5.5 years in the house selling process, when told they were going to be held to said contract. and to top it all off, if they can't afford anything, can't work, can't relocate, can't revert to whatever their life was like before this fiasco, then they aren't competent caregivers, and should have never gained custody of her in the first place. while battling for custody of the girl, some attorney or attorney's lackey, should have realized that the grandparents lived in a retirement community that banned children. they then should have told the grandparents that they could not gain custody until they were able to relocate, or until the hoa granted them a legal waiver on their commitments. and, if, as it seems, they are unable to support themselves in any other capacity than they do now, it should have been deemed that they were unfit to be guardians of this girl, and some other alternative should have been found. foster care. the other set of grandparents. aunts and uncles. adoption. anything.   there may very well be information that is not in the couple of short articles about this that i've seen that would sway me back to the other side of the argument. but i have yet to see it. the old people who are campaigning for her to be booted, are, indeed, pricks, to some extent. but they are in the legal ""right"" in their being pricks.    so, yes, she should be booted. and her grandparents should be made to pay every single penny of any sort of legal proceedings that take place because of this. they should be sued, actually, if it is true that they had already signed the hoa agreement before they fought for custody of the child, and never disclosed to the court that they lived in a community where children were banned. willfully withholding information from a court case that very obviously had ***huge*** bearing on the verdict that was reached, is a federal offense.     and as to your aside, you are, of course right. the thing is, though, it has to be proved that you could've avoided the jaywalker, for you to be convicted. a better example to use for my point would have been that it is absolutely legal to call a little old person ""wrinkled old twat"", but you are no less of a prick for doing so. i just liked the jaywalker scenario because it involved someone getting run over. sorry.",1,1,-1

404217,"seen a decent amount of people who just don't like the often-contrasting tones, art style or rei's character.  i hardly think 3-gatsu is underrated - scores appear to be binary in terms of whether it's a masterpiece or just crap/not to their tastes, but one also has to consider that much of the audience isn't used to or exposed to this type of anime. 3-gatsu is in fact anachronistic, since the manga actually began in 2007.  not only is the art style far from what younger audiences are used to, there also does not appear to be an obvious point to the story. that only comes with a bit of thinking about the events, even though to me the story is as simple as it gets: it's about a boy who's had an absolutely wretched life, learning to enjoy the company of others again after shutting himself off and dedicating the past few years of his life to a profession he dislikes but cannot quit because it's his sole livelihood and way out of a house he could not bear to live in anymore.  plus, appearances can be misleading. some people think this is a sports anime because of the shogi. others think it's a shoujo because of the art style. many haven't checked the show out because the cover picture is rei (average bespectacled teen) with three sisters. they're not unattractive, but none of them are high schoolers either, or drawn in a typical style. others even avoided it because it's made by shaft and they're convinced somehow that shaft makes flashy anime for the sake of it based on other shows they've watched. all of these assumptions are dead wrong, but you're not going to find many budging unless we talk about it more.   tl; dr: not underrated, some people just don't like it for various reasons. there are also barriers which prevent others from even starting it. those who do enjoy it are numerous and i've seen crazy praise for it as well. hell, i gave it a 10.",0,,

360715,"summary: efforts at censoring child porn will not work and it's really just a witch hunt anyway. politicians and judges are in bed with the prison-industrial complex and only care about throwing as many people as possible into the clink. groups, including law-enforcement and politicians, that ask for more intrusive monitoring in order to catch pedophiles are really trying to increase their power. religious groups are some of the worst offenders.   the author goes on to outline how pedophilia should be handled if we *really* wanted to limit child exploitation.   in the beginning he summarizes the history of child porn and of the child porn industry - interesting by itself.   btw, i think this subject is interesting because people get all crazy about it. i don't understand that. i really don't care. i say sentence pedophiles to be public school teachers - because then your little brats would get lots of needed attention.   some highlights i liked:  &gt;a now-deceased belgian psychoanalyst has also analyzed the phenomenon of so-called white marches and reactions of the public on child abuse. he came to very interesting results. could it be that each of us harbours an unconscious, dark and unbearable desire for the child that one can ""unload"" by expressing and projecting anger towards a pedophile monster? why is the public so eager to know everything about cases of child abuse? the public leeches every perverse detail of such a story and the sensational media makes an excellent business. the most insidious of the whole subject of child pornography is the public discussion about things the speaker only has ideas about but has never seen. each sensationalist presentation is allowed and there are no limits to it, and these presentations can be abused to achieve various objectives. it is not acceptable to tackle the issue with facts without getting charged for a criminal offense in germany. it is like the ultimate indictment where no defense is allowed. it can be used for everything and every purpose.  ...  &gt;child protection has become a real industry. there are numerous organizations dedicated to the protection of the child - their administration, programs and staff must be funded - which means many job opportunities. i am particularly worried about the relationships between large and politically important global organizations such as the national center for missing &amp; exploited kids and fundamentalist-totalitarian-oriented religious groups. if you visit their website (www.missingkids.com) there is a cybertipline. there is an opportunity to select a reporting category. under ""unsolicited obscene material sent to a child"", there is a link to www.obscenitycrimes.org. this organization is, in turn, operated by morality in media, inc. and is an essential partner of the center. i quote here a few of the interesting arguments that this organization wants to spread and enforce (below, i have collected arguments from various pages in www.obscenitycrimes.org): the police must do god's work (ie. the police becomes the executive branch of the bible) pornography leads to violence and must be banned pornography leads to homosexuality and child abuse sexuality in marriage must be regulated (oral, anal and masturbation are against nature and are punishable) homosexuality should be criminalized adultery must be punishable adulterers are predetermined to abuse children i stop here because otherwise i would burst with anger and bloodthirst. i noticed that these are the same religious fundamentalists that welcomed cruel punishment on children with rods, whips, etc. based on bible verses such as hebra 12:6-7 or 1 book of kings 12:13-14 and 12:18. the western world hardly has to worry about the talibans but more about christian fundamentalists crawling in through the back door of ""child protection"".  ...  &gt;the united states is a respected democracy that over the years has permitted the use of torture - all this for a good cause and for the protection of the society. a prison society is growing quickly and is operated by the private sector. approximately 2% of the population is serving a sentence, most of them in a prison. private prison operators are even traded on the stock market and they are known to be very profitable and sustainable as more and more prisons are built and more and more people are put into prison (the amount of people in prison increases each year by 4%). ""producing"" convicted criminals has become a highly profitable industry and more and more criminals have to be produced so that the money keeps coming. there are credible rumors of bribes from operators of the prison to the judges and prosecutors - they pay premiums for so-called new convictions that result in a prison stay. so you don't have to be so picky in any investigation, let alone employ qualified officers - this way there is always sufficient supply of people to put in prison - and especially you have to criminalize a lot of things. now, at this point, the reader should pause and do a little reflection on their part, and let this go once more through their brain. beautiful, great democracy. source: http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsnews/idusn0727506220071007  &gt;and because everything is pushed in the name of protecting the child, these children and young people feel better. or do they? oh, i forgot to mention something: the laws for the protection of children and adolescents are now used against them in many countries. exactly, you did not misread that. this happens especially in the ango-saxian countries like the usa and the uk. children who discover sexuality are arrested, convicted as pedophiles (!). young lovers send pictures in which they wear nothing but underwear or even less - the so-called sexting. if the images end up in the public domain, this usually becomes disastrous for the youngsters. there are countless documented cases where both young people were convicted because of child pornography. there are also relations of minors with adults: a 17-year-old girl with a 18-year-old boy, for example. one such case is known to me from ohio, where a 15-year-old girl was arrested and put in the prison was because she refused to testify against her 18-year-old boyfriend so that he could be convicted as a child abuser (because the parents of the girls have denounced him - he did not fit the taste of mom and dad. in one comment the parents said it is right that their daughter is sitting in prison because she did not want to charge his boyfriend). the laws allegedly made for protection of children and adolescents are increasingly used to criminalize and control the sexuality of children and adolescents - with the prosecution used even against the children and young people themselves. interestingly, we come again to my earlier observation: children and young people are good enough to be punished, even convicted. but sexually they are totally immature and dumb. source: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28679588/  ...  &gt;the criminalization of child pornography is one of the most stupid decisions ever made - for various reasons. first, the costs of prosecution for possession of child pornography are enormous for the state and often very little results are achieved and after all nothing can be changed about the actual fact that the crime has been committed. a friend's home was searched and had all his computers and 4500 video cassettes - on which he for years had recorded movies - taken. it took 2 years to work through them all and in the process a huge sum of taxpayers' money was spent for absolutely nothing. because he had recorded tv movies on the video tapes! germany is very rich, making expensive proceedings for child pornography. put those who write horror stories and one-sided descriptions in the jail so that it becomes really expensive to the taxpayer [?]. germany has enough money, so let's just do it. secondly, it is justified by the argument that viewing of a child porn picture harms the child. how? the actual exploitation has happened a long time ago! thirdly, by now it should be crystal clear to everyone that child pornography is the perfect weapon to ruin the lives of people (even those who are not pedophiles). many innocent people already saw their existence get destroyed (one case among many is landslide). i hope that soon these cases are brought before the european court for human rights in strasbourg and that the governments should be held accountable and financially bleed for the filth they have caused. many have child pornography on their computers without knowing it (because of spam, or trojans used to make the computer a proxy). cp is the perfect means to cause huge problems and social ostracism to an unpleasant person. and the government (and the child protection lobby) will use it as the argument to decieve a totally unsuspecting population (and even parliamentarians). you have seen how the terrorism-argument has been misused. you can at least collect evidence and come up with counterarguments, etc. against terrorism. but child pornography is the weapon against which one cannot give counter-arguments because it is totally illegal to do research in order to form a clear opinion. it can thus lead to wrongdoings, limit our civil rights and be used to push total monitoring of citizens. i suspect very strongly that the relevant government officials have at last dropped the penny. child pornography can not really be stopped or the producers and operators cannot really be identified. so we filter it away so that the general population believes that something has been done. in the process the monitoring technology is set up and soon used for other purposes. then it does not take much longer until it used for the prosecution of copyright violations and for controlling critical views. we can also send some love to deutsche telekom and deutsche bundesbahn. to me china is soon more secret than germany.",1,-1,-2
