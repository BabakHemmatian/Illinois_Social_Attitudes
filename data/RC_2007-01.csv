there's a great series of articles by a beginning beekeeper [here](http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/xc0000005/stories) which i think gives a description of acquiring a new queen at one point.  its worth reading through the whole series if you're at all interested in bees, and there are some more details in his [diaries](http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/xc0000005/diary) as well.",Brian,2006-12-31 18:20:31,reddit.com,1,"gay: queen, gay: queen, gay: queen, gay: queen"

decorators replace three, or at most four, entire lines of python. whoop de freaking do, who cares?

but those three or four lines are ""accidental"" complexity, in fred brook's terminology. the more of that you can cut away, the better your programming gets because you can concentrate more on the essential issues. and, perhaps counterintuitively, the most import bits of accidental complexity to remove are the final bits, not the first bits.

it turns out that by cutting that last little bit away, we went from ""classmethod"" and ""staticmethod"" being the only examples of decorators, to all kinds of examples. not because it was more _possible_ than before, but because it was _easier_ enough that people did it.

(closures, incidentally, are a different story entirely; clever use of closures _does_ make things possible that weren't without them, or were at the very least fiendishly difficult and impractical, not just three lines of code. the best way to get started with them is to find places in your code that are starting to grow a bajillion options, especially ones related to collections, that all boil down to ways of manipulating the data or summarizing the data. instead, allow things to pass in closures. it's also really useful for flow-reversal; i have some code that generates the shells of html tables based on certain sql searches, and you pass in closures that explain how to render the cells. these closures get to do anything they want with the rendering, in the context of the calling code that ""knows"" the most about the rendered objects, and the table part of the renderer doesn't have to care. without closures you'll end up with code that is both less capable and more tightly bound.)",jerf,2006-12-31 22:51:36,programming,3,gay: boi

cwm5g,t3_wjrz,"truth, damn lies and execution

three hundred years ago, courts of justice could be blinded by superstition. in those dark times, people in positions of power could snuff out the light from any candle of hope that the condemned still held for life. innumerable falsely accused victims were burned at the stake, ignited by the flames of flourishing injustice, and fanned by the falsehoods spoke by their peers. sadly, no joyous sunrise would come to end their tortured nights of captivity.

but three hundred years later, courts remain hoodwinked by dishonesty. three hundred years later, lives are still tossed to the proverbial pit of fire. three hundred years later, people in positions of power demonstrate that they are impossibly all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-hearing by summarily judging the actions of others and then doling out executions with omnipotent strength. and so i share with you today a reiteration that acts can be neither omniscient nor omnipotent, that we all have faults, and by extension so do our governments and judicial conditions.

in a sense, capital punishment is like writing a cheque to purchase the life of a criminal. a payment, some argue, that is cheaper than supporting lifelong imprisonment. yet the laws of australia, canada, the united states of america, and numerous others guarantee the ""unalienable rights"" of life and liberty. our past actions liberated slaves and all but abolished slavery. our present actions show that we believe the authority to limit the life of a human being belongs to no one. but coldheartedly, these representative cheques continue to be cashed at banks of justice, even though banks of life and liberty would return them marked ""insufficient funds""!

we must refuse to endorse banks of justice that continue to honour such cheques. we refuse to believe that money can indemnify human lives, regardless of the crimes in question. these deplorable bank drafts must be nullified to redeem our courts of justice and our humanity.

every moment that our voices remain silent widens the gap between being human and being humane. there is an urgency that cannot, must not, be ignored. every hour of apathy lends credence to legalized vengeance. now is the time to speak out for those lost voices smothered behind iron. now is the time to turn our backs on barbaric states. now is the time to tell the people in power that killing is wrong. now is the time to teach compassion to all of our children.

lives are lost forever by ignoring the fierce urgency of now. the dark winter veil of cold-blooded murder will not be lifted until the springtime infusion of life is guaranteed throughout our societies. and those who believe that tomorrow will be just another day will have a rude awakening if the executions continue. there will be neither rest nor tranquility in the world until unconditional life is granted to all its citizens. the snowstorm of revolution will not end until the clear dawn of humble justice emerges.

and to the people united on the peaceful threshold of merciful justice: do not embark in wrongful deeds. life cannot be sanctioned by vengeful actions or riotous demonstrations. no, the right to life will not be chartered by outbursts of physical violence. our actions must embody this monumental goal; we must segregate villainous force from moral force.

when light from our morality is used to judge the shadows cast by criminals, we must appraise ourselves and our laws by the same rays of ethics. to do otherwise places governments and judicial systems beyond the reach of mediated introspection, beyond the grasp of justice itself. by this beam of self-inspection, when a death sentence is dispatched we lift the offender to the moral equality of societal norms, and find ourselves standing deep inside the shadows of criminals.

we shall not walk in those shadows.

we will walk without the spectre of hypocrisy to haunt our footfalls. and as we walk, our steps bring us closer to a golden era that waits ahead.

we cannot turn back.

there are those who oppose the progression toward leniency. they raise statistics like a stoic hammer, driving the belief that executing murderers will reduce homicides. however, this interpretation does not a nail in the coffin make. numbers are tools to add weight to debates; debates that must be continually cross-examined for applicability and accountability. yet statistics are also the claw to the hammer's head, pulling out deterrence arguments by suggesting that legitimising murder through the death penalty actually raises the rate of homicides!

so we will not be satisfied by statistics. we can never be satisfied as long as the guiltless are slaughtered. we cannot be satisfied when fallible humans are the judge and the jury to deadly trials. we can never be satisfied while the press pilots our opinions with sensationalized stigma. no, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until tolerance towers like the tallest of trees and forgiveness flowers like an endless forest.

let us be mindful that forgetfulness is not a bedfellow of forgiveness. to forget that many death row inmates committed terrible crimes would let befall a grave injustice. by the same token, to overlook that the dead can only be exonerated posthumously defiles the memory of innocent victims. instead of incapacitation, let criminals atone for their crimes with positive contributions to society. instead of martyrs, make them educators. instead of miscreants, fashion them material makers. instead of misfits, mold them as missionaries. instead of being slain for malevolence, give them the chance to change.

even though we face the turmoil of retribution, we can see the tenets of redemption. within these tenets, i, too, have a dream.

i dream of a day when no human will have the right to revoke the life from another.

i dream of a day when miscarriage of justice does not result in fresh flowers to a solitary grave, but in the freedom of an unjustly accused prisoner.

i dream of a day when even the ghosts of salem massachusetts, whose deaths were inconceivably shackled to ""spectral evidence"", and whose memories still mock modern justice, may finally find peace.

i dream of a people who understand that no heated crime warrants a cold resolution by death; that death is unjustly everlasting when pit against both fleeting and permanent transgressions; and that humane disciplines can meet the needs of society while being a fair reproach for felonies.

i have a dream today!

i dream of a world where we can judge our justice systems as though they were individuals: not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. where at the highest courts of international law we find that justice is morally, ethically, and logically consistent across all countries.

i have a dream today!

i dream of a world in which mercy opens the door of knowledge to reveal that the real truth in any situation can never be known entirely. a world in which we are keenly aware that the whirlwind of motives, emotions, psyche, and actions behind a trial cannot be judged and punished with absolute conviction. a world that has cast off the rattling chains of death to embrace the foundations of life.

i dream of a world without injustice buried within injustice. a world where the poverty line does not foreshadow a flatline. a world where the accused wealthy and the convicted poor face their fates with equal outcomes and equal opportunities. a world where the concept of just justice is not an ironic fairytale, but a practical reality.

this is our dream, a dream inspired by an extraordinary man.

in the spirit of dr martin luther king jr, a man who made an enormous march for liberty, these words strive to be an extension of his ideas, a continuation to his ideals. but this time the walk is for life. and along the road to the global abolishment of capital punishment sits a world that is one small step closer to unity. it is only through this journey will our collective conscience truly be free at last.",[deleted],2007-01-01 04:21:25,reddit.com,3,"gay: flower, gay: flower, gay: fairy"

cwm94,t1_cwm82,"quick follow-up. on digg someone posted the un-obfuscated code: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~achille/contacts-source.txt

how it works

the code is pretty straightforward. basically, google docs has an embedded script that will run a callback function, passing the function your contact list as an object. the embedded script presumably checks a cookie to ensure you are logged into a google account before handing over the list.

unfortunately, the script doesn’t check what page is making the request. so, if you are logged in on window 1, window 2 (an evil site) can make the function call. since you are logged in somewhere, the cookie is valid and the request goes through.

also, if you check the object that is returned, you see fields for the contact’s name, email and “affinity”. presumably, a higher affinity means a more-emailed contact, so it may be possible to know the relative weight of links.

possible solutions

google is run by smart people and i’m sure they’ll have this fixed soon. a few suggestions appear to be popping up, all centered on making sure the user is on a google.com page and not a random site:

* referrer blocking: block all requests from sites not in the google.com domain. however, some people run referrer-blocking software. it may be the price they have to pay for security, but there could be other consequences.

* script checks: an idea i had was to check the window.location (just like you check the cookie) to make sure it’s coming from a google.com domain. this is another way to see what page is making the request.

* challenge-response: google pages (like gmail) can have some token or unique, computed data that they submit with their requests. random pages won’t have access to this token when they make the function call.

* (from jrf, below): include part of cookie in the request url as a unique token that only a ""real"" google page would know. need to watch out for proxies/browser history (accessible from other pages) being able to access this unique data. may need to seed or salt it in a challenge-response system.

i wrote a quick post about this:

http://betterexplained.com/articles/gmail-contacts-flaw-overview-and-suggestions/

cwmdr,t3_wliu,"the article's quite poor.

it doesn't give any information about how pi would actually be computed to so many decimal places.  it could easily have talked about how to compute pi using the arctan series, arctan(x) = x - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 + x^9/9, ... and identities such as pi/4 = 4 arctan(1/5) - arctan(1/239).  with this formula, and an extended-precision arithmetic package, one can easily compute pi to thousands of decimal places.   

see, for example, http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath373.htm

another method for computing pi is the ""arithmetic-geometric mean"" iteration -- see the book by the borweins, ""pi and the agm"".  

yet another method computes the n'th binary digit of pi using very small space (informally:  ""without computing all the previous digits"").  see, for example, http://crd.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/ .   the small space bound is dependent on an unproved conjecture, however.

the article also doesn't mention why one would want to compute so many digits.  there are at least two reasons:

it is still an unsolved problem whether pi is ""normal"", that is, whether every block of k digits appears with a limiting frequency that one would expect from a random sequence.  it is even unknown whether every block of digits appears somewhere in the decimal expansion of pi (popular claims to the contrary notwithstanding).  most mathematicians believe the answer to both problems is ""yes"".   it is at least conceivable that computing huge numbers of digits of pi could suggest whether these conjectures are true.

the second reason is that computing large numbers of digits of pi, since they intensively use various arithmetic operations, could reveal problems with new computer chips -- you can compare the results of your calculation to previous ones.

atheism: disbelief in the existence of god; the state of godlessness. atheism: unbelief in or denial of god or any supernaturalism; to ancient greek it meant denial and lack of recognition of state gods. in 18th cent. it was a protest against religious hypocrisy; in 19th cent. it was any system not recognizing the idea of a personal creator or any one supreme being. it sees marter, not spirit, as sole universal principle; its history one of opposition. term often loosely used in referring to agnostics who neither deny nor admit the existence of god, or in regard to others who disagree with current theological doctrine.

disbelief: lack of belief, unbelief.

unlike most dictionaries, this one traces the course of how the term ""atheism"" has been used over the centuries, leading us to the more modern usage which incorporates anything which simply does not bother believing in any gods.

stack-copying retains too much memory (this is a much bigger problem than raw speed)

iirc, gambit uses the same approach as chez (but implements it's own stack)

cps does indeed depend on allocation speed, but that itself doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the compiler, but the architecture of the runtime system. chicken's allocation speed is competitive with those of highly tuned native-code compilers (like larceny and chez) for example.

whether the approach described in the pettyjohn paper really is worthwhile can only be shown through an actual implementation, as too many factors contribute to the final performance. and that is exactly the reason why simple ""this-approach-is-generally-faster-than-that-one""-type comparisons are pointless.

what is important is whether an implementation of continuations retains unneeded storage in the chain of activation frames stored in the continuation. afaik, only cps and a decent closure representation can guarantee minimal storage requirements. without such a guarantee, even a fast implementation of continuations will break down under certain usage patterns, or even just if you capture lots of ""deep"" continuations.",bunny351,2007-01-01 16:31:16,programming,4,"straight: het, straight: het"

yes, actually people do choose to go uninsured. medicare healthcare programs can provide free or limited-premium coverage to anyone up to 300% of the federal poverty level. indeed, my mother, who is the cio of just such a plan, says they have to convince people to sign up. the biggest complaint prospective customers have? ""too much paperwork"", just ahead of ""i could use the money elsewhere"". and with the fact that critical healthcare needs are guaranteed by law to get treated by any hospital in the united states, that's just about all the healthcare the uninsured want. the healthcare situation in the us is not so simple as ""thousands of people are desperate for healthcare, but nobody will give it to them"". the reality is more complex than that.

the only sector of the medical industry that has seen its prices decline over the past ten years is elective surgery, and it's no surprise that this is because just about every insurance company in the country does not offer coverage for what is considered to be medically unnecessary. this is not just boob jobs and facelifts; it's also lasik for improving eyesight; orthopedic surgery for arthritis and joint problems not considered medically significant, and experimental procedures that have not been approved by insurance or medical organizations as legitimate treatment.

krugman talks about how the administrative costs of our system jack the overall costs up, and he's right - but his solution will only increase that administrative load. and instead of offering realistic solutions, and realistic assessments of single payer systems elsewhere that aren't simply based on statistics like infant mortality that have little coupling to the actual performance of the medical industry, krugman just offers more politicization of the issue with this notion that the republicans are beholden to special interests in the insurance industry and the democrats need to buck up and attack that evil. single payer systems are not completely broken, but they don't work spectacularly either; what normally happens is you replace one set of problems with another, and in the case of single payer systems, the result tends to drive down quality across the board. even in canada's system there is still private insurance and a private health care industry that people utilize when the state-administered system fails to meet their needs.

what the us medical industry needs is realistic evaluations of its faults and its strengths, not political arguments about who are the big meanies looking to stick it to poor people and who are their saviors and defenders. unfortunately from submitters like this, it seems like people are more interested in using it as a political football for their own selfish rhetorical games than actually finding solutions to the problems.",rafuzo2,2007-01-01 17:28:21,reddit.com,-1,straight: het

even if you have good insurance, plenty fo doctors will take the easy option of amputation even if there's a chance to save the limb, simply because it's easier.  it's not necessarily just about the money.

the doctors just don't care because they get paid whether you live or die.  they have no reason to go out and find current information.

good insurance doesn't mean that the damned moron intern doctor doesn't misdiagnos your pneumonia as a cold, and send you home because he didn't read the xray properly.

cwom3,t1_cwok3,"&gt; if we don't pay our judges a sufficient amount of money to judge impartially, then someone else will pay them more to judge in a particular direction.

and the flip side of that is, by allowing this argument to have any weight, you let the judges as a whole hold justice hostage until they become more like the kings of old who used to hold court.

we're talking about amounts of money in the sum of $1 million over a 5-6 year period. we're talking about giving them raises that amount to what a normal working person makes in a year, and has to survive on. 

there is no reasonable lifestyle that requires this. current salaries are more than enough for them to still buy their million dollar homes, put a boat out at the marina, and dally around with the yuppies and noveau riche when they feel like it.

$200,000 a year is an income absurdly unattainable for the vast majority of citizens. it further seperates them from those who hand down decisions that affect them. and since we're already talking about that being the actual current salary, and not some future proposal, it's doubly sad that the decisions handed down so often ream the common man.

all intertwined. legislator's salaries. president's. federal judges. ceos. the only comparisons that aren't frequently made in an attempt to boost someone else's, is with entertainers/athletes. i suppose they don't want to let everyone in on how vaccuous and genuinely useless their sorry lives are.

cwpe0,t1_cwnne,"growing up i doubt i had very much scepticism. however, the ""brand"" of christianity i was raised in is significantly different than what i presently believe. when i became an adult i had much scepticism, and i researched it deeply. so what convinced me? there is no easy answer to this. 

there is a major foundation that goes along with this, the nature of god, the history which preceded jesus, along with understanding the depth of what jesus said, his claims, his works -- the claims of those who knew him. the earliest members of the early church *died* professing all of this to be true knowing full well they were about to die, and having been told that if they merely recanted and claimed it was false, they would be spared. what is curious is that these men *knew* whether the claims were true or not, since they either saw them happen or they didn't. simply put, the grand sum of everything including prophecies about jesus (most notably psalm 22, which was written over 500 years before jesus, which jesus *quoted* while dying on the cross (my god my god, why have you forsaken me? .... they have surrounded me, cast lots for my clothing... they have pierced my hands and my feet...) -- there are just too many things to mention in a quick reddit chat. 

another major consideration is that i find too many flaws in other worldviews including atheism. it is said that science tends to stick with one theory unless a better one comes along, for me christianity is at present that theory. i stick with christianity if and until someone can present me a more solid worldview -- and to that i am all ears.",CarlH,2007-01-02 02:52:56,reddit.com,2,straight: het

cwpy9,t3_wpgm,"i used to think a language like this would be cool, but i don't totally understand the desire for it. i was reading through comments on another story at slashdot, and someone made the statement 'the fact that people are still making strange mutated versions of c and c++ decades after their creation baffles me'. and i guess it is true. i mean, really, c and c++ have their uses for low-level programming, but even 20 years ago they weren't perfect, and they are even less impressive now with the advances in programming. why would you build upon something that really isn't fundamentally sound for this day and age?

why not just use c and c++ for the performance-intensive parts of your program, and lua, ruby, python, perl, tcl, or any other number of dynamic languages for everything else? they are arguably better than d or c++ at everything other than straight-up performance and very low-level access to the os. they are just c libraries anyway, there shouldn't be a fear of using them.

i'm sure this is a naive way of looking at things, or i am missing something. i really do understand the desire for a modern language that can be efficiently compiled, but i think something like ocaml is far more interesting and a much bigger step in the direction the industry needs to be heading. things like d seem to be more out of convenience (most programmers don't want to learn anything new) or corporate pressures.

here is a comment i found interesting:

&gt; i don't understand why these people keep designing c-like languages that are nothing like c. by the time they are done, the resulting language has so many more features than c, the surface similarity is more of a boondogle than a benefit. while not perfect, c syntax is great for what c is, ""human-readable assembly language"". when you try to extend it to object oriented systems, the end result is a confusing mess.

sure. it's an infuriating habit on both sides. ironically this is something dawkins works quite hard to avoid - he does decry even moderate religionists, but for quite specific (imo insufficient) reasons.

&gt;as to dawkins' mainstream-ness, i might have to think about this[...]i'm going to have to redefine mainstream to include bill o'reilly.

i think o'reilly is (lamentably) mainstream. :) but i'm not interested in chasing that - my point is really that 'extreme' and 'mainstream' are in this sense such question-begging labels that you're really saying no more than 'his opinions differ sharply from some other opinions'.

&gt; (i was admittedly argumentative, but please understand my frustration as there were at least 4 or 5 pro-atheist posts on the front page that day.

i'm afraid it is and remains a hot topic, and frankly it should be. america is not a theocracy, it's not entering a new dark age and it's not saudi arabia with different hats. but it is astonishing that there's not one professing atheist in congress, and the new atheism is making waves as a result. there are also important and useful arguments to be had about the basis or need for or causes or effects of atheism and religion, and i've seen some good ones on reddit. unfortunately a lot of it does get submerged in 'teh crusades==evil'

&gt;you already mentioned that most criticisms of dawkins tend to focus on his lack of diplomacy. as such, he uses a tone that can be disrepectful of beliefs that he doesn't share. i fully understand and respect his reasons for not having a civilized conversation with them (if someone told you that the moon was made out of cheese, would you try to civilly tell them otherwise?), i just don't think that christians are so undeserving of his respect. 

returning to my point above - dawkins is quite hygienic about distinguishing supernaturalists (the creation, literal resurrection, answered prayers, eternal damnation, etc.) from the larger category of people who say 'i believe in god'. many literal supernaturalist beliefs are, when you lose some of the cultural habituation, exactly as sensible as a cheese moon. even the less extreme ones are accorded an uncommon respect not given to equally irrational ones that simply don't have an organised religion behind them (eg astrology). where dawkins and co. are providing a valuable service is in demanding that religious beliefs be required to compete equally in debate, not be given special status, and this is where the shock tactics are often necessary - christian and islamic beliefs are too often unexamined.

&gt; you're taking one of the best debaters representing the atheists, and doing either one of two things: stating that all of his opponents are incapable of admitting when they're wrong, or stating that there exists at least one opponent that won't admit he's wrong. 
    
i'm really not aware that he's saying that everyone who professes a religion is unreasonable. as i understand his position, it's rather that consistent profession of a religion requires you to stick to your guns in the face of the evidence. if you're a religionist who relies on holy writ, and if you're consistent in your belief, then there is a point beyond which you will not accept correction. christian theology is quite explicit about this. faith is a virtue. faith in the face of contrary evidence is a greater virtue.
    
contrariwise, if you sincerely consider evidence and argument to be the only foundation for belief, then you can be persuaded you're wrong with sufficiently persuasive evidence. of course this doesn't mean that everyone who *claims* to consider evidence and argument, yadda, is reasonable. let alone every atheist: there are as many stupid reasons for a disbelief in god as there are good reasons. come to that i'm sure everyone on the planet has at least one belief that they're emotionally committed to to the point of irrationality, even if it's only 'sting is/n't rubbish'.

but there's still a huge difference in principle and practice from espousing a belief that explicitly states: i can't be wrong about this. especially when there are dozens of other beliefs that say the same thing *and are incompatible*.

thought experiment. we discover compelling evidence that the viking gods exist. our new crust probes show that the world was actually formed from the frozen body of a giant. the gods demonstrate how, yes, they can carve people out of driftwood (and admit that monkeys were an inspiration). we see a dramatic correlation between 'being rude about thor' and 'being incinerated by a lightning strike'. and so on. the evidence, all told, is at least as strong and consistent as that for evolution and for current thinking on geology.

possibly dawkins would cling to the idea it's all a hoax, but would he actually say 'i'm sorry, i don't care about the evidence, i know what's true'? how many atheists would become thorists? how many christians or muslims would?
    
&gt;it implicitly declares a basis for proving what's right, and what's wrong. dawkins believes that the scientific method is right. if he does something or says something that conflicts with the scientific method, and it's shown that he's done so, he will most definitely apologize. but if he says something or does something that is inconsistent with the bible, then he will definitely not admit that he's ""wrong"". 
 
i see where you're coming from, but this is a category mistake. the comparison would be between the scientific method and an unconditional trust in authority as means of getting to the truth. 'science' just means 'doing things in a controlled way, seeing what happens, and finding explanations that will predict successfully what else will happen'. if you make correct predictions, that demonstrates your correctness in a very concrete way. 

it's simply not satisfactory to say: any one reason for belief is as firm as any other. i could base my beliefs - using the tool of unconditional belief in authority - on what the crazy guy down the street tells me, even if i don't then see the alien spacecraft that he claims are landing at the palace of westminster. i could then claim that you are as biased as i am - you're biased towards the general consensus on aliens, or the bible, or whatever, i happen to be biased towards crazy guy. in a trivial sense i'd be correct, but it's not a useful or interesting argument. i'm not, of course, saying that the bible - an influential work by dozens of writers, some of the very skilled - is the same as the crazy guy - simply that not all reasons for belief are equal. we can argue about whether some are better than others - we have to - and at that point i start pointing out that the bible *was* written by dozens of people, had chunks excised arbitrarily, is internally inconsistent, all that.

&gt; i subscribe to the scientific method (i don't think that it necessarily conflicts with religion), 

the scientific method doesn't - this is another category mistake, like saying 'the sense of smell doesn't conflict with a belief in market fundamentalism'. however, at some point we have to say: did jesus get up and walk around, or didn't he? the answer is always either 'no, it's a myth', 'yes, in the sense that he lived on in his followers,it's a poetic truth, yadda' or 'yes, he did. science is wrong if it says he couldn't.' there is common ground to argue over.

i've crossed that bridge before.  there are some huge problems with that approach:

1.  you now have code in two (or more) different languages.  this makes it difficult to find people with the required skills to work on the code.

2.  build system becomes a mess.  many of the dynamic languages are cross platform, but the compiled languages need compiled based on the platform.

3.  bugs are extremely difficult to track down.  you might as well throw away your favorite debugger because it will be useless in the cases where something goes wrong in your native code.

cwrns,t1_cwqbv,"i don't think it does make dawkins look stupid. eagle looks stupid for not seeing, that if you boil down his beliefs, they come to nothing more than blind faith in a supernatural being. the only evidence there is for god is the feeling you get when praying or some similar activity. it's well known though, that you can induce these feelings via natural, dare i say, scientific means.

""dawkins considers that all faith is blind faith, and that christian and muslim children are brought up to believe unquestioningly.""

eagle doesn't question whether god exists, he just debates the nature of god's existence. at best he has just done what every other clever theologian in history has done, he has thought, ""hey, maybe god doesn't exist."", felt worried then thought up reasons why god does exist. most of the reasons just at the point considered mysteriously tentative, yet still solid in some way.  

""for mainstream christianity, reason, argument and honest doubt have always played an integral role in belief.""

i was a mainstream christian for many years, have read the bible and attended many church services. by the time any of those thoughts came into play i was leaning towards other philosophies and could be considered agnostic (still am).

if you have doubts about god's existence then you don't truly believe. you can't say doubt is a part of belief, it's an oxymoron or whatever you might call it. if you do believe, then for what reason? it's not quite, but very close to blind faith.

""god is not a celestial super-object or divine ufo, about whose existence we must remain agnostic until all the evidence is in. theologians do not believe that he is either inside or outside the universe, as dawkins thinks they do. his transcendence and invisibility are part of what he is, which is not the case with the loch ness monster.""

this is complete nonsense, very clever nonsense, but none the less; absurd. it doesn't matter whether theologians think god is incomprehensible, out side all logic and reason, or whatever. dawkin's argument that there is no or limited evidence still stands. regardless of the alleged nature of god, if there is hardly any evidence, then there is hardly any evidence.

dawkin's and atheists in general don't share in eagle's feelings of god so why should they believe? if you can prove god exists via the theories themselves then i will believe, but that hasn't been done and i don't see how it could. it's almost as if belief requires belief.  

""dawkins holds that the existence or non-existence of god is a scientific hypothesis which is open to rational demonstration.""

no dawkins says god is completely un-scientific and there is no reason why it should be treated any different as any other none scientific and un-testable theory. the philosophy behind eagle's idea of god is highly persuasive and quite beautiful, yet is based on nothing more than mere conjecture and feelings within ones self, rather than solid observation of the outside world.

god is an idea, one with power and life of it's own. yet it doesn't exist outside of one's head. the feelings of awe, like that inspired by an epiphany, aren't experienced because they reflect the actual nature of reality (all inclusive), but instead because, for whatever reason, the brain enjoys the idea of god and of course intellectual advancement. it enjoys it just in the same way it enjoys sex or even more relevant love, friendship, affection. eagle even says as much himself.

""indeed, friendship is the word aquinas uses to characterise the relation between god and humanity.""

cwrqd,t3_wq4z,"there's several things wrong with this article.  the first is that they are (intentionally?) confusing the difference between what the average ceo makes and what the average ceo out of the ""top 100"" makes.  it's misleading to pick the highest-paid and then call it average.

second, it's very questionable whether high ceo pay causes lower pay for the average employee.  if the ceo does his job well, then the company has more income as a whole, and can therefore potentially offer higher salaries to the rest of its employees as well.  good ceos are typically good for everyone at the company.

how many of those ceos are running corporations with thousands of employees?  with payroll in the hundreds of millions?  presumably the top-paid ceos are working for massive corporations.  the more employees the company has, the more it makes sense to have the ceo getting extremely high pay.  if a manager with only, say 3 people under him is making 38000 (average pay), is it so obscene that the average ceo with perhaps 3000 people under him is making 237 times as much?  he's managing 1000 times as many people.

it's entirely possible, even likely, that some of those ceos are making more that they are worth.  but it's also likely that many of them are worth what they are paid.  it's possible that the average ""top 100"" ceo really is worth 237 times as much as the average employee.

if the people complaining about high ceo compensation are so sure the job's required skills don't justify the pay, why don't they get into the business?  for the same reason they aren't top athletes or actors.  they simply don't have the skills to do the job.  if they did, they'd do the job and get paid well to do so.

tom cruise made around 100 million usd from war of the worlds (according to wikipedia).  thats 13 times as much as the average ""top 100"" ceo in canada.  it doesn't matter if he's completely crazy or certain people don't like him.  he's worth the money to the hollywood studios who hire him, because he's proven to provide a good return on investment.  the fact that he gets paid so much doesn't mean the camera man gets paid less.  the camera man gets paid the going rate, regardless of what tom cruise makes.  likewise with ceos.  the receptionist isn't going to get a 50% pay raise if the ceo takes a 50% pay cut.  the receptionist isn't likely to see another dime, because his pay is based on the going rate.  his pay isn't dependent on the ceo's pay.",dpark,2007-01-02 14:46:45,reddit.com,13,straight: het

so, let's see -- the nyt published an multi-page *mea culpa* about one aspect of its story. this was a mere one month after an anti-abortion site brought the issue to the attention of the world - allowable time to verify the facts of an old story.

&gt; byron calame, public editor of the new york times, has laid out a carefully worded exposé of the utter breakdown of editorial standards at the new york times.  .... this is major journalistic scandal, not so much for the initial error (bad as it is, especially the reliance on advocates for basic translation services) but for the stonewalling which has followed revelations of the lie. it is one thing to be sloppy, even unethical in journalistic practice, using biased sources as translators. it is quite another to stonewall in the face of facts. the new york times has hit bottom, and continues digging.

so the nyt made a mistake, a couple of editors briefly defended the article, and then the nyt published an acknowledgment that article was in error. admitting you're wrong a month after an article is called into question? major journalistic scandal?

the above link is the list of 4488 genes that e. coli, probably the most well understood cellular organism in the world, has in its genome.  many of these genes have not been characterized and are referred to as ""hypothetical"" or ""conserved hypothetical"", however you will find any number of genes that have been successfully characterized.  lets choose an arbitrary example:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene&amp;cmd=retrieve&amp;dopt=full_report&amp;list_uids=946344

this gene mediates the formation of disulfide bonds between two cysteine's in the folded structure of proteins.  proteins that have these disulfide bonds often require them for either stability or function or both.  keeping the dsbb gene is a drain upon e. coli.  like every gene, it requires time, material resources, and energy to synthesize the dna necessary to encode the dsbb gene every time the cell replicates.  it costs more resources to synthesize the dsbb mrna, and still more to synthesize, from the mrna, the dsbb protein which is the active form of the gene.  keeping dsbb is advantageous for e. coli. relative to those real, measurable, costs.  therefore the reason for retaining the dsbb gene over the course of e. coli's evolution is for it to achieve that relative advantage.  that there is a purpose for a given trait does not require that the be a purposer, the way a thought requires a thinker!  purpose is merely the other have of need.",Lucretius,2007-01-02 16:11:53,reddit.com,1,"straight: het, straight: het"

as for television, it isn't that television ""is evil or immoral."" television has specific effects on the human mind. these effects combined with the inherent monopolistic nature of broadcast signals causes measurable harm to the humans subjected to the system. if you research the effects on television introduction in early adopter versus late adopter cities, you find that after about 20 years of television usage, the rate of violent crimes dramatically increases. if you add on the political effects of having a broadcast provider of information, you end up being able to see the television broadcast system itself as a system that causes harm to people.",entropyfails,2007-01-02 16:59:02,reddit.com,1,straight: het

cwsoh,t1_cwk6t,"'guns have no legitimate purpose' is an argument that gun-ban proponents often fall back on when their constitutional arguments, won't-someone-think-of-the-children arguments, and so forth have been dismissed. 

but this argument rests on several faulty premises:

1. ""a gun's only purpose is to kill people.""

2. ""people only own guns for hurting people.""

3. ""hurting people is never a legitimate purpose.""

all of these are easily dismissed.

1. a gun doesn't have, in and of itself, a purpose. it's just a hunk of metal. left to itself, it doesn't kill or hurt anyone. and so what if it did have a purpose (other than things like hunting or target shooting)? it is the act of killing, not the ability to do so, that we have any legitimate interest in deterring. 

2. a few examples of other purposes of a gun: sport shooting, hunting, deterence of violence in others, peace of mind, some people just like to collect them. there are many others.

3. this one is so obviously wrong that stating it explicitly is enough to refute it. 

the real reason most people who want to ban guns feel this way is that they fear them. they've rarely seen one except on television, never handled one, don't really know what they are about. 

they believe that there ""is no positive use"" for a gun, because they, personally, have never seen a gun being positively used. but they, personally, have never seen a gun being used at all. they have only seen actors firing fake prop weapons, in staged murders.

but if we judged things only by what we saw on television, we would believe that all black people were violent crack-dealing thugs, that all corporations were greedy soul-crushing monoliths, and so on. 

and so we are back around to where we started. in any nation that wishes to fling the word ""freedom"" about as a propaganda tool, that word had better mean something. and what it means in this context is that if i want to do x, *i* don't need to give you a reason why i should be allowed to. instead, *you* need to give a reason why i shouldn't. 

and ""there's no positive use"" is not a reason. it's just another way of trying to put on onus on me to prove i need freedom, instead of where it belongs - on you, to prove that you have a legitmate reason for making me less free.

in the case of gun bans, there is no positive use for them, no legitimate reason to justify their existence. a gun ban is designed for one purpose, and one purpose only: to disempower people. tell me, who should legitimately be disempowered? what demographic groups? blacks? poor people? young people? old people? atheists? muslims? christians? gays? everyone except the government? 

do you trust the police that much? why is it that the left wing of politics in this country thinks that police and other government agents are corruptible, potentially dangerous individuals who should be carefully watched and not trusted with too much power...until we are talking about the power to kill, when suddenly they are fine upstanding fellows who are the only ones trustworthy enough to be armed?

it's an exercise in doublethink that can only be rooted in fear. i don't fear guns because i don't fear my neighbors. my neighbors need not fear my guns because they need not fear me. unless we learn to trust each other instead of fearing, our future as a unified society is grim indeed.",Whisper,2007-01-02 18:40:53,reddit.com,3,gay: gay

i saw the enron film, smartest guys in the room, and apparently a lot of employees had their retirement funds tied up in the company or something. this implies that they simply couldn't have clicked a button on etrade to sell, even if they had read the 1998 report and wanted to.

as for the shareholders that had an opportunity to sell but didn't, they shouldn't complain - it was a risky investment (criminal misleading aside). as gladwell shows us, there was plenty of information on the public record to make a ""ball-park"" decision (risky or not risky).

i'm oversimplifying matters and being rather un-compassionate. but there's a lesson in this story for shareholders (be aware of risks and diversify) and management (disclose and explain the risks).

cwtk2,t1_cwsw7,"you said ""some people without insurance will go without care, because the other ers won't take them, and they won't get care in time from the ones willing to take them.""

basically your point is that sometimes hospitals get so busy that they can't provide care to everyone, and the ones without insurance are the first ones to go.  is that right?

well, i don't believe you. i think people without insurance are just as likely to get care as someone with insurance.

the fact that a hospital might go extra lengths in some cases to try to save limbs doesn't really mean much.  you can't really make the claim that two guys had identical injuries but the one with insurance had his thumb saved and the other didn't.  aside from being a fallacious argument (basing your entire argument on two individuals), you don't really know that the hospital could have saved the other guy's thumb even if he had insurance.   the fact that the accidents were similar doesn't mean the injury and thumbs were equally salvagable.

if you are making the case that people who have money can more easily get better doctors and better care, then i quite agree with you.  i never said they couldn't.  merely the fact that they have money gives them the option to search out better doctors is important.  someone with money can fly to a city with a specialist, for example.

but someone just with insurance can't necessarily do much.  he's usually stuck with the same doctors that someone without insurance is stuck with using.

my point is that anyone who needs care in the us can get it.

regarding livers and transplants, money helps, but seriously there's such a long wait that money won't guarantee anything.  a man with crappy insurance is just as likely to beat out a rich man for that liver for any number of reasons.  legally a hospital can't choose whom to give their transpants to based on money or insurance.

of course alcoholism would be a factor on whether someone is going to get a liver.  do you really think, with the waiting lists on healthly livers, that an alcoholic should be given priority over someone dying from a bad liver but no other health issues?

that's not a matter of withholding care.  your argument is just idiotic.  it's a matter of having a very few livers and deciding which of the most urgent patients need them the most.  some of them are going to die because they don't get a liver, because there aren't enough, not because of lack of care.",nosoupforyou,2007-01-02 23:05:58,reddit.com,1,straight: het

p16:  i'll tell you how crazy- it's a ""a rather nasty brand of neo-liberalism.""

p17:  dawkins refuses to credit the millions of ways religion has helped and inspired humanity!

p18:  dawkins isn't just an ""atheist"".  he's an extra-smarmy one.  with double-scoops of mediocre.

p19:  dawkins is a one-trick pony, all he can talk about is religion!

as punishments go, the death penalty has got to be the most idiotic i have ever heard of. once you are dead it isn't like you will suffer any consequences of your actions.

i know that if i knew i was guilty and i could never prove my innocence, i would rather die than spend the rest of my life rotting in jail.


&gt; i won't argue that innocent people have probably been executed in the past, but to ban the practice all together is throwing the baby out with the bath water.

that *many* innocent people have been executed is a well documented fact, not an hypothetical assumption.


&gt; in cases like dalhmer or gracey or rudolph- cases where people are undeniably guilty and even proud of their acts, the death penalty is completely justified.
&gt;
&gt; most people totally against anything have usually never had any experience with it.

has anyone you know been executed?


&gt; imagine your family brutally killed by someone and it was well proven he was guilty beyond any reasonable doubt. would you really want him to live at taxpayer expense for the rest of his nautral life or to get a shot in the arm? that's much more pleasant than his victims got.

i thought justice was about doing what is right from a logical and moral point of view, not about doing what someone who is very emotionally involved feels is right.

and for the record, even if someone killed all the people i love most, i would not wish that person to be executed, the execution would not bring my loved ones back, and would only lower myself to the same level as the murderer.


&gt; if so, i'm sorry to say you're in the minority- maybe not on reddit, but in the overall population you are vastly outnumbered. that is why the us is not going to recognize any international ban on the death penalty.

cwvl9,t3_wvl1,"it’s common to consider your website’s design solely in terms of the look and feel visible from outside. i can understand it entirely. a concept like ‘modularity’ or ‘standards-compliance’ is more abstract than specifying colours and text, and difficult to verify without strong technical knowledge. it’s easier to think in terms of look and feel and hope the backend works itself out.


but would say to your auto dealer “i don’t care if it’s all welded solid on the inside, as long as it’s red?” you’re going to be spending a lot of money on your website—both directly on development and marketing, and indirectly by investing your company’s image and future in it. by looking beyond the visible design of the site, you can not only improve your site’s chances in the search engines, but save money over the short and long terms.
search engines are blind
i’m sure over the years you’ve seen many gorgeous sites. odds are, you’ll reference some of them as models when you ask for professional web development. but if your dream site is an all-flash package with translucent menus and graphical text only slightly less elaborate than a stained-glass window, i’ll bet you didn’t find it via google. often, look-driven sites make heavy use of content wrapped in graphics or as flash or java applets. these are completely unreadable to a search engine, so when it comes time to promote your site, you’re at a disadvantage from day one. in addition, these plugins tend to also cause problems for users with limited-capability web browsers, like mobile phones, game consoles and webtv units, screen readers for the blind, and even regular users on slow connections who won’t sit and wait for video or flash. while some developers honestly believe they’re showing a compelling image for their clients by overusing these tricks, they’re neglecting the true audience of the site: the customer you’re trying to attract.
needs change
few websites are static, yet many website designs seem to assume they are. over the course of a website’s life, the company it represents will usually expand its product lines and contact methods. they may wish to go from simply catching user feedback to actively selling online or maintaining a user-community forum. there are smart ways to handle change, but they need to be built in from the beginning.

designing pages in a modular fashion will allow you to add extra pages in minutes instead of hours, and reduce wasted effort keeping repeated page components like navigation bars and headers in synch.

there’s also a matter of choosing the right underlying technology. coldfusion based sites, for example, will require special support from the hosting company, often at an extra cost, and specially trained developers, who are in shorter supply, compared with a similar php-based site. those additional hassles over the long term have to be weighed against the benefits the technology provides.
standards shift
the late 2006 release of internet explorer 7 and the continued growth of mozilla firefox have clearly deliniated one fact: the browser marketplace isn’t homogenous anymore. while it would take a psychic developer to figure out how the next browser coming along will break your site, good back-end design can keep it from becoming a crisis. modular pages can ensure that you only have to fix a single copy of problematic code, even if it appears on many pages. reasonable coding practices can avoid the use of browser-specific features and ‘legalities’ of specifications. clear, ‘self-documenting’ code can be fixed later without having to decipher the last developer’s twisted logic. these are not exceptional features to ask, and can actually help your developer save time and money on the initial product. but even innocuous requests—like deliberately making the code difficult to read to make it difficult to copy—can stymie these practices.
do it yourself
even if you’ve got a professional web-development team on hire, there are times when it makes sense to do some light tending of your site yourself. setting a sale in your shop area? adding a new “latest news” blurb? why pay a professional $150 an hour? if you design the backend right, you can make those changes right from the browser. but if you don’t, you may be saddled with having to upload modified files, or worse yet, prying apart balls of flash or manually hacking databases. some developers may see bad design as a way to ensure future maintenance business. we see it as a scam.
let someone else do it
odds are, you really don’t want a completely custom web site, but you don’t realise it now. many of the complicated parts of modern websites, such as shopping carts and forums, can be implemented with ready-made components. by doing this, you achieve several major benefits:


   1. cost savings through rapid implementation

   2. a proven, robust product from day 1, avoiding embarrassing bugs on your brand-new site

   3. a widely-used package will have the customer base necessary for support and add-on development. even if you want something special, there’s a chance someone has already developed or fixed it for his needs.

   4. a familiar look-and-feel which may be comforting to easily confused or mistrusting customers


in many cases, the off-the-shelf solutions can be customized to look and feel exactly how you want, or with a few compromises. a smart web developer will ask you “is it worth $20,000 in development to built 100% of what you want from scratch, or will 98 percent of the features with an $300 off-the-shelf product do?”.
smart choices
so how should sites be designed? simple: remember all sites have both a front and a back.


    * decide what you’ll want to change and include later. everything from site layout to what type of server gets used will depend on this, so there’s honestly no benefit in not mentioning your plans ahead of time

    * think modular. rearranging the navigation on every page may look cool, but it’s going to significantly increase maintenance costs

    * plan to use industry standard tools and languages. don’t just pick a technology because it sounds impressive, or comes from a favoured vendor. check wether it floats in the real world.

    * research what problems have already been solved by off-the-shelf components",webop,2007-01-03 10:42:51,reddit.com,-2,gay: homo
cwvn2,t1_cwucw,"what you are describing is a caricature.  it may be you really believe that this is the way things are, but if so you are not using all the data.

religion has been abused terribly, and will be abused for as long as it exists.  but it has also been an effective transmitter of positive change.  the civil rights movement of the 60s was started by churches and by and large its successes were because of church participation.

if you are a gay person while you have every reason to distrust religious conservatives, there are many liberal churches that are open to gays in their congregations and accept gays not as oddities but as humans.  all of the wrongs that you listed are wrongs that were decried by some churches (i'm using ""church"" here as a generic term for ""organized religious body"").  you can't honestly generalize that all religious groups are inherently corrupt and bad, for if you look at the real world, that's just not the way things are.  many churches reach out to communities and offer charity for those who society has forgotten (including support for those with aids).  not all churches oppose stem cell research (or even abortion).  many churches have never had an incident of violence committed in their names.  if you want to be sincere about the nature and effects of religion, your description has to include the unitarians and buddhists as much as it includes the southern babtists.

the deeper roots of the problems are the manipulation of fear, hate, and greed by the leaders within churches.  those  three are really at the root of the wrongs committed by people against other people.  

if you removed religion altogether from the world those who would abuse those three would still ensure evils in the world would occur.  fear, hatred, and greed can only be overcome by love, understanding, and acceptance.  many religions try to teach love, understanding, and acceptance as central messages, even if there are far too many religious followers who don't get the message.  the civil rights leaders actually had an easy job making the case for their position using religion, the hard job was having the courage to stand up to the ignorance and wrongs of their day, and they drew courage from their beliefs. 

quite honestly painting all religion as fundamentalism just empowers the fundamentalists.  stereotyping any group of people only empowers the worst elements in society to abuse those stereotypes.  just keep in mind that despite their potential ugly side, most religions exists to offer hope and charity to the desperate, and to teach and share love, understanding, and acceptance.",[deleted],2007-01-03 10:59:25,reddit.com,1,"gay: gay, gay: gay, gay: gay"

cwx7b,t1_cwx38,"&gt; he probably thinks of himself in those exact terms.

doubtful. he likely goes through mental gymnastics to avoid thinking of himself in those terms.

&gt;belief that god does not exist is a belief.

and yet, i don't believe in santa claus. is it then a given that it's only my belief that he doesn't exist?

there are too many emotional-sociological connotations to the word belief, for it to be of much use. i tend to only use it in the context of religion, and in a way that would not be appropriate for the ""belief of atheism"".

let's use it everywhere, which you seem to prefer to do. i do *believe* my car is parked out front. there are good reasons to believe this to be the case, but there are enough  plausible scenarios where it is no longer there. i consider such a belief to be rather rational all the same, and certainly it would be difficult for someone to accuse me of being superstitious if i claimed it was out there, despite the fact that i can't see it.

most religious people, if they aren't on the defensive, would not object to my opinion that this sort of belief has a fundamental (though difficult to articulate) quality that is completely different from another's *belief in god*. i could sit here and list what that quality is not, and i don't believe it would help to pin down just what that quality is.

another example, there is this woman that i love. we've not spoken in weeks, and realistically, it is difficult to contend that we will ever speak again, let alone on good terms. yet, i believe we will end up together. this belief does have its superstitious elements. it does have a quality closer to religious belief, in my opinion.

i think that because i can come up with more examples other than just religion alone, that the case is good that such a quality does exist. and also that beliefs of the type that do not have it are many, and different from the former.

religious people tend to have trouble realizing that there are two sorts of beliefs (if not more). they assume that all who claim that they are atheists have *beliefs in the non-existence of god* have the same quality of belief as they do about the existence of god.

no one cares whether my belief that *my car is parked out front* is correct or not. whether it's rational or superstitious seems to be unimportant to all involved, including myself. and no matter what the quality of that belief, it's a useful belief. let's me make plans on how to get to work, how to get to the grocery store.

i think there is such a fuss, because the class of beliefs that atheism, science and christianity comprise seeks to answer what many consider the ultimate questions. how did the universe arise? how did we?

until relatively recently, religions had this playground all to themselves. they bickered among each other. but now, they have to share it with atheistic science, and guess what? though imperfect and in need of revision, it explains things better. that's the reason these religions are now more tolerant of other *faiths*... they have this superior enemy that will require they all gang up and fight it together if they are to survive.

but what's your opinion? is one belief the same as any other? how do you choose between mutually exclusive beliefs? in which cases does rationality choose for you, and in which cases do you let your emotions and habits do so?",NoMoreNicksLeft,2007-01-03 16:11:06,reddit.com,8,"straight: het, straight: het"

there is one particular comment that is exceedingly fallacious as well - ""too much blood has been spilled in this country, by this country for you to say that you are still an american if you spout thoughts like you have above"". assume hypothetically that tomorrow, every scientologist in the nation went to war with germany for denouncing their ""religion"". if the majority were killed, does that mean that we must accept them? note that the ethnicity of native americans is bordering on becoming extinct. are we to grant massive reparations just because one has died for a cause? many serial killers in history have ""spilled blood"" for a particular reason, should we follow up with what they are doing?

the answer to all of these is no. that argument is a particular type of logical fallacy called an ""appeal to force"".

you have considerable difficulty understanding that parts of america can be viewed as a seperate country, different from the other parts of america. this is exemplified in the california secessionist movement, where they view california as its own entity. i am not certain if the concept of secession can be understood by you. 

moving to another country implies that there is another country that exists that would suit the critic better than america.

the critic believes that his location in america is anchored down by other states. therefor, the critic does not believe that they are a legitimate part of america. the critic wants to get away from those citizens; he wants &lt;b&gt;those&lt;/b&gt; citizens to let him secede, i.e., remove the area that the critic resides in from america, becoming its own country. the area would stay the same and the critic would not ""move"", but he would be in another country. you have embedded the concept that the land in america is permanent in to your brain, and you have embedded options a and b in your head:

a) agree with me
b) move to x location which is not in the area that america currently occupies

you have forgotten option c) secede, taking the land in which you primarily occupy with you while staying in the same location.

obviously i am patronizing you, but you have worded your argument in such a way that i have had to restate the same concept several times in different forms so that i hope you will grasp it. by conceiving parts of america as an ""anchor"" one realizes that 2/3 of america is hindering 1/3 of america. 1/3 of america wants to break off from 2/3, becoming an entirely different 3/3; from there, two 3/3s exist. it is likely that other 3/3s will break off from those 3/3s, forming a large body of nations, much like the continent of europe. by having less of a political anchor, the nation quarrels with itself less and can implement policies infinitely easier, especially with a reduced land area.

there are likely more options than these three as well; you have asserted that your two options are the only two options. from here, you can deny the third option i have created and assert that your two are the only viable options, or state that it would be better if one like myself would move because you feel as if you could progress at a much faster pace without me. the first is not true due to subjectivity, and a black/white scenario is refuted by simply introducing a third option. the second is not true due to the fact that many of the republican, conservative states are the states that implement bills involving social issues, while the progressive, liberal states are the ones that ultimately pay for them. the liberal states can sustain themselves, while many of the conservative states can not.",enkapa,2007-01-03 19:52:23,reddit.com,5,straight: het

cwyse,t3_wysd,"breast cancer awareness and prevention tips
october is breast cancer awareness month. men and women can take preventative steps for avoiding breast cancer and staying healthy. essentials within your control, include:

? aerobic exercise 3-4 times a week
? maintaining a positive mental attitude
? breathwork and deepening body-awareness (yoga is great) 
? expressing your feelings to keep your energy flowing
? eating healthy foods and taking the ""right"" supplements
? avoiding toxicity.

some things to avoid:

? any medication containing acetaminophen. products such as tylenol, sudafid, bromo seltzer,vicodin, and many others drive down the glutathione levels in the body. glutathione is an essential antioxidant and detoxifier.

? aspartame (not to be confused with aspertate) has been proven to cause cancer in rats. it is a common ingredients in many no-sugar products such as yogurt, ice cream, desserts and carbonated beverages. splenda is also harmful.

? toxins. use toxin-free, organic products. wash all fruits and vegetables thoroughly with soapy water to remove chemical residues. better yet, buy only organic products and non-gmo (non-genetically modified) foods. read labels (veggies and fruit will have an 9 to indicate organic and an 8 for non-gmo).

? active computer screens should be at least 18 inches away from your body. you need to be at least 36 inches from your active television screens.

breast self exams are the number one method for detecting changes in breast health. finding any symptoms does not mean you have cancer. early detection means your survival, and thriver rate, is very high. very high! it also means you have a broad range of alternative and complementary treatment options. so learn the signs.

no one knows your body as well as you do. that's why it's essential to exam your breasts at the same time every month - so you can detect any changes that might occur. when you do the self-exam, you are reassuring yourself that your body is still in great condition.

there are numerous websites that now offer  
instruction in self-exams. one i prefer is the komen foundation, (www.komen.org) which offers an interactive video you can watch on your home computer, while doing your exam.

many women find it helpful to have a buddy to call each month to remind or be reminded to conduct the self-exam. it's never to late to begin a good habit, so invite a yoga buddy to be your breast health buddy now.

the signs to pay attention to include the following:

a lump, hard knot or thickening
swelling, warmth
redness or darkening
change in size or shape
dimpling or puckering of the skin
rash

cwz5f,t3_wz5e,"dating tool: confidence 101
i'm over it. ""there's plenty of fish in the sea,"" they say. well, apparently i have been using the wrong bait. nobody said dating would be easy, but hollywood sure likes to paint it that way, doesn't it? ""there's someone for everyone,"" they say. maybe that ought to translate to, ""there's someone for everyone?.as long as you're a muscled pretty boy with washboard abs, and at least 6 feet tall.""

so how does one get by this unsettling dating stipulation? are we actually to believe that love will find us when we're not looking? i think people who say that are normally in happy relationships when they say it. can we ""buy"" outer beauty from an online store to match our own inner beauty? somebody is buying pheromones and weight-loss pills and liposuction and facial restructuring. hell, now people even get plastic surgery to make them look like a celebrity. huh??? and you know what? i bet these things work for people. as long as it can build the confidence up in someone, it also strengthens the attraction. so how can we build up that confidence without spending tons of money to people who know how the game works? sounds like a question for the shrink.

i suppose its all part of why i started up a matchmaking service with a friend of mine in los angeles. it can be so frustrating out there. and being ""alone"" can only make your work day more stressful, it seems. so if i had someone to do the dirty work for me?.get me the dating connections, counsel me on why i might not be getting that second date, maybe my frustration level would decrease. so i went into the business?.pretty much as a means to find out what can be done to find the perfect one.

ok, so nobody's perfect, but at least maybe i can find a decent one who happens to have similar ethics as myself. oh, and a killer sense of humour is mandatory. but looking around, nobody was going to help me, a fact that made me feel even more alone! so i  
i had to do it myself. such is life, right? part of it might be that i feel a need to always be in control of my own destiny. as long as i am actively pursuing something, i am a success. yea, that sounds right! so i joined forced with my cohort and we started let's meet here. now i'm gonna' find the one, right?

wrong!

as it seems unethical to date my own clients (damn, i knew i'd run into some roadblock!), i figured?.at least pass on any information i can gather to those who need it (and baby, we all need it!). granted, i am learning about all this stuff now. it seems every date and every relationship is completely unique. there is no list of do's and don'ts that applies. but i do know that going into the business has allowed me an increase in confidence that is apparent in me without my even having to think about it. i am starting to really believe that success comes from the active pursuit of a goal, whether or not the goal is achieved. the process in itself builds character?and character is attractive.

so while i learn as i go, i will show as i go too. it is absolutely within my own power to be a success. and the pursuit of achievements is an achievement of its own. however, i have also learned that a little is never enough. and to settle after one's success is no success at all. maybe now i'm fishing with the right bait!

cwzb3,t1_cwyyu,"if 15"" display and ""reasonable performance"" (whetever that means) are your only criteria, then your comparison is useful only to you.

when i bought my 15"" powerbook, i compared it to a 15"" hp 3000zt, both for sale at the same time.  i'm an engineer and a former a printed circuit board designer for intel based motherboards, so i'd like to think that i'm qualified to make a fair comparison between 2 laptops.  i configured both laptops to be identical (and they were, save for the fact that the mac was a powerpc processor).  the rest was identical (or very close to it).

here are the factors i considered:  cpu speed (relative), fsb bandwidth, ram (quantity and speed), graphics card, graphics ram, display size, display resolution, hdd size, hdd speed, cd/dvd reader / writer and speed, wireless internet support, modem, ethernet speed, video out ports, number of usb ports, size, weight, battery capacity, battery duration, os media included (y/n), bundled software (both came bundled with equivalents), etc.

the result was that the mac was 10% more expensive, but it slightly exceeded the pc in many specs.  for example, the pc had a 10/100 ethernet, while the mac has 10/100/1000.  any factor that i could configure identically (ram for example) was configured identically. 

so i call total bs on your $2000 vs $600 figure.  

as far as ""they tend to break"", i'm also gonna have to call bs.  apple's reliability is demonstrably better than other manufacturers; at least i can provide facts rather than ""impressions"".  consumer reports conducts a survey of their readers annually; in my 2007 buying guide, based on 50000 responses, apple was tied with tohsiba for second place in best reliability; ahead of hp, dell, compaq and gateway.  

and all manufacturers like to push their extended warranty programs.  that's not unique to apple.  it means nothing w.r.t. their reliability (which, btw, for desktops hits #1 by a margin according to the same survey).

as for anecdotal evidence, i've never had trouble with my mac in the 2 years that i've owned it.  i joined a company recently and out of ~20 employees well over half use macbook pros.  the only return we had was when somebody slipped on the ice and fell on top of his macbook pro, bending the aluminum frame and giving it a taco shape.  it still *worked* mind you, even after we bent it back.",khammack,2007-01-04 03:01:23,reddit.com,1,"straight: het, gay: bent"

no, they really don't, sorry.  they show little understanding to some minorities, often harshly oppress women, and consider flaky religious doctrine more important than lives (the stance on condoms).

cwzoe,t1_cwyhn,"sure you can, but then you will also need to worry about things that are a pain in the ass for even experienced linux users: no or crappy fonts, jumping through hoops to use multi-media, worrying about whether you have the correct versions of the libraries depended upon every time you want to compile new software (if you want to have the latest and greatest software), being left with little recourse but emulation if you have to be completely .doc compatible with co-workers, putting up with the sometimes extremely idiosyncratic design decisions of foss software developers and their poisonous hatred of providing reasonable documentation for their work, etc... everyone who uses linux knows these annoyances. you can limit them if you constrain the way you do things carefully, but this requires knowing what you're doing better than 95% of the population or accepting doing less than 95% of the computer-using population. 

using a mac, you do get the best of both worlds. a visual navigation experience that is at the very least regular (whatever your opinions of the ""beauty"" of aqua -- personally i think the brushed metal look is awful), access to unix software on the command line, excellent multi-media capabilities, a developer community that cares about creating software that has users and designs with that in mind (rather than designing software as if it were a political manifesto- ""my way or the highway!""). 

it does have drawbacks. linux is often better integrated into workplace networks. apple computer depends far too much on security through obscurity at the moment. service for computers usually involves a long wait without your computer if you need a part and if you live outside the us, canada, uk, france or japan. while apple spreads the drm virus on their vertical platform, itunes does allow you to make undrmed copies of your itunes purchases, at a slight quality reduction which is barely noticeable with the music most people listen to.

in all cases, i am probably forgetting advantages and drawbacks, but that's what you get for just waking up. i'll assume the memory lapses are evenly distributed.

i am personally more productive on a mac but ymmv. i switched over to a mac two years ago after a year of using linux and freebsd and using windows before that. the whole package that apple provides is flexible and provides all the functionality i need. as i see it, it really depends on what your priorities are. for me, its worth paying the extra money (in comparison to linux) for the nice features and convenience macs offer (especially the **choice** to interact with the system as a plain user or a power-user, depending on your needs). if money is a problem, (and macs are not as expensive as they used to be) choose linux or a bsd. if politics is a problem, choose linux. if you're forced to, choose windows.",[deleted],2007-01-04 05:56:03,reddit.com,3,straight: het

cwzqp,t3_wzqo,"how to choose a dating service
there are so many dating sites out there, hundreds if not thousands, how do you even begin to decide where to register and start your online dating experience?

you could just pick one at random, create a profile, and sit back and wait for the other members to beat a path to your email inbox. who knows, you could get lucky and it might work out first time. but even a tiny bit of investigation beforehand could save a lot of time and frustration!

the trick is to be prepared. you probably wouldn't go off to buy a new car and start by trawling around dealerships at random, you would already have an idea as to what sort of car you want - how big, how fast, how much money you had to spend, and so forth. based on these criteria you would have a good idea of which car showrooms to visit to find the right sort of vehicle for your particular needs. so the first question to ask yourself, is what do you want out of a dating site? sounds obvious - a date! but what sort of date? are you looking for a serious relationship possibly leading to marriage? or are you after a casual partner and you'll see where it leads? or perhaps you just want some uncomplicated fun. the good news is that among the myriad of services out there on the web, there is something to cater for every requirement. some sites will suit all tastes, but there are many that specialise, and the more specific you are about what you want, the better your chances of finding it.

before looking at  
at the sites on offer, think about how you will write your personal profile. jot down a paragraph or two about yourself, your interests, and your hopes for a partner. then write a few words about what you are looking for in a potential dating match. doing this offline will help you structure in your own mind what sort of date you are looking for, and then when you go and look at some dating sites, you'll easily be able to pick out those that offer the best chance of providing what you want. the added benefit of course is that when it comes to filling in your profile online, you will be prepared and wont be sat in front of your screen lost for words. instead your profile will read in a very natural and honest way.

i would always recommend choosing at least two sites to register with and put your profile on, after all, they are almost all free to start with - you only need decide if you want to pay when and if someone of interest turns up and you want to make contact.

websites like the dating webreview can also save you time. the reviews will quickly give you an idea about the services each dating site offers, and whether they specialise. 

choosing an internet dating site isn't difficult. in the end it comes down to finding one that you enjoy using. after all, if it appeals to your taste, then you already have something in common with the other members.

cx0bc,t3_x0bb,"20 easy ways to get people to link to your web site

first off all let's define what is a link exchange? a link exchange internet marketing campaign is the process of exchanging hyperlinks with a quality site that is somehow related to a company's product or service.

it is easy to get link exchange partners when you have a website that is getting alot of traffic and has a high page rank with google. what proves to be a little harder is getting a quality link partner to link with your site when you have little or no page rank and little or no traffic.

i have found that giving incentives will help get the link exchanges flowing and as your page rank increases so will links with websites that have a higher page rank.

here are 20 things you can do to get people to link to your website.

1. when you visit a web site you've enjoyed a lot, write a review for the site. write about the benefits you gain from the web site. tell them they can publish it on their web site if they link to your web site.

2. market your web site as a free web book. design your web site with a title page, table of contents, chapters, etc. just allow other people to give away the web book by linking to your web site.

3. offer other web sites free content to post on their web site. include your link on all of your content. the content should related to your web site because it will be in front of your target audience.

4. allow other people to publish your e-zine on their web site. include your web site's ad and link in each issue you publish. this may also help you increase the number of people that subscribe to your e-zine.

5. give your visitors an instant article directory. tell your visitors they can instantly add a free article directory to their web site by linking to yours. just place your ad or banner ad on top of the article directory for your main web site.

cx0dx,t1_cwxj3,"why? first i could use my generic visitor class (using reflection) and the above is all which is needed (but less fast and a bit more error prone).

or i could simple add the really simple boilerplate code:

    interface visitor {

        ...
    }

and add

   void visit(visitor v) { v.accept(this); }

to each expr class. 

it that this difficult? if you look at this small example: yes, it seems ugly. but in real code it simply doesn't matters because its so simple that it takes only a little part of the time to implement the whole. if i write a real compiler i have to write the boilerplate code only once and use it often in multiple visitor implementations. there the boilerplate code simply doesn't matter.

but languages like haskell really shine for short examples. if you only write short programs i would really recommend to use haskell. but for longer programs i'm not sure if haskell would really work that good too.

cx1l6,t1_cx145,"one major problem with this line of argument is that it assumes the gospels are something like an objective reporting of christ's ministry.

for instance, the use of the term ""messiah"" is the primary symptom of christ's jewish environment, and the importance to the writers of the gospels to connect jesus with the jewish concept of ""messiah."" speaking hypothetically, this would require the writers to look through jewish scripture, find out what was prophesied about the messiah, and then write about things like a virgin birth, or lineal descent from david, without necessarily having concrete evidence to back it up.

for another example, the debate over whether converts had to submit to jewish dietary laws and circumcision, or whether christianity is for both jews and gentiles. if you want to spread christ to the gentiles, the fact that he may be the jewish messiah can be decoupled from ""saving the jewish people from their earthly oppressors"" to ""equality for the poor and oppressed and sinful before god"" and ""eternal life and the forgiveness of sins"", and you suppress the stuff about the jewish scripture and laws and prophesy, which don't make any difference to the average hellenic gentile. 

similarly the fact that jerusalem gets burned to the ground without any apparent divine intervention means that the ""messiah"" is not about the jewish people in the first century ad, but rather about a more timeless, universal truth, about the kingdom of god in heaven.
 
with an open mind, it is possible to come up with many interpretations of jesus's nature and purpose. for instance, you can lean toward a gnostic approach, where jesus had insight into hidden knowledge about god and the nature of reality. you can have debates about whether jesus was mortal, or divine, or both, and about the nature of the trinity. however, the early church fathers fought ruthlessly against these ""heresies"", in favor of an orthodox interpretation that might or might not be truthful to jesus's actual goals.",sickofthisshit,2007-01-04 14:05:39,reddit.com,11,"straight: het, straight: het, straight: het, straight: het"

jesus was the perfect sacrifice. by accepting his crucifixion as our own sacrifice to god, we as christians are made right with god. it's an amazing gift. one of the many lessons to be drawn from this is the need for self sacrifice to achieve righteousness.

bullshit.  how do you get that out of anything i've said? you said see my previous comments but you can't actually point to anything, can you?  i never suggested that racism by americans is ok or that racism by americans shouldn't be mentioned everywhere it occurs.  in fact, if you had actually read my posts, you'd see i suggest the opposite.

you've chosen to read my posts based on your opinion rather than based on what i actually said.

----------------
"" 'you even took my statements and reworked them'

can you please give me an example of when i did this?""
----------------
sure.  i did already but you ignored it, just as you ignored much of what i said that wasn't convenient for you.

remember this part? ""your interpretation makes no sense: she has already been abused, so how can he now wish that she be abused.""  you took two statements, the original posters and my post, and reworked it to claim that i was saying that the op wanted the woman to be abused again.  since that was illogical, you claimed, obviously what i said must have been completely wrong.   

--------------
""'you totally ignored the fact that your argument was a logical fallacy.'

my point - it is so simple that it hardly justifies the term argument - is that you should be able to see different perspectives. this is the point of the book i referred to earlier. it explains how hard it was for whites to understand what racism to blacks was like.

my point is really an appeal for understanding. how is that a logical fallacy?""
---------------

claiming that a point is simply, and therefore must be obvious, is another jump.  ""everyone knows something to be true"" is basically a form of bullshit.

fallacious arguments, such as building a logical extension to one possible end result and showing that that end result is impossible therefore the argument must be wrong, is a classic fallacy.

every argument can be considered an appeal for understanding.  wrapping it up in pretty words doesn't make it correct.  my own original post that you disagreed with was an appeal for understanding as well.

you have no idea of what race this woman is.  she could be black.  you don't know.  you're assuming she must be white.  i've asked you repeatedly why you assume this.

what if she turned out to be black?  would you then feel it was ok for the article to make the reddit front page?

-----------------
""'now you claim, somehow, that i'm saying racism is ok if not against americans. where the fuck did you get that from?'

from exactly the same place that your accusations of me being a racist came from. if you read the words you will see that they were actually your words. you may remember those sentences where you accused me of being racist. i copied them back to you since they made more sense directed at you and i figured that's what you meant.""
---------------

there's very little sense in your argument here.  the fact is that you have no basis to suspect that i might be a racist.  you're the one who is arguing that there aren't enough black outrages on the front page and too many white outrages, when you don't even know the color of the skin of the woman in question.

you're the one arguing the issue based on race, not i.  i'm the one that says that it's the outrage, not the color of skin.

if you base your arguments on whether something is right or wrong on the color of skin, that's racism.

what possible ""subtle points"" does it require to explain why you believe the woman must be white?   you insist on my being reasonably polite before explain your assumption?  that pretty much says to me that you have no reason to assume she's white.  you just assumed it.

you can't defend your arguments because your argument has no logical basis.  every time i show that, you step back and try another tactic.  either discuss it or go away, but stop trying to hide behind bullshit.

it renders the same in every browser -- regardless of whether i'm on a mac and want aqua form controls, or whether i'm using an lcd screen and want subpixel font rendering, or whether my eyesight is poor and i need larger fonts.

when focused, it captures all keyboard and mouse events, so i can't use my browser's shortcuts like ctrl+tab to switch tabs, alt to access the menu, and the mouse scroll wheel to scroll the page. well, this is a problem with all browser plug-ins, but it's a problem nonetheless.

what we have is the most accurately established work in the whole of western literature, that has been preserved across languages, nations, and cultures for thousands of years. do you think that's an accident? you think a religion continues to exist for that long with nothing behind it? how can you explain christianity's untouched reign and record in the west, as a religion. it has a long history of being co-opted  from within and without to serve temporal worldly powers to ill effect, but ultimately the core essence of righteousness  returns to redeem and restore.

it has survived massive schism over the last 500 years alone! what western nation state or philosophy can claim a similar level of success? oh yeah judaism and the muslim faith. unsurprisingly all on the same branch of belief.

the north koreans can run that cult only as long as the family has heirs and remains in power. it won't survive the dynasty. christ's words did. i don't see too many people jumping onto the north korean state religion bandwagon, do you? it's because there's nothing behind it. as for the halle-boppers that you seem to be alluding to. they're dead and their religion has come to an end much as thousands of other cults some claiming christian roots, others not, also end.

for instance, i bought mrk ([**chart**](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mrk)) $45.00 call options on 22 december when it plunged to 42.83, 10 contracts at $0.45 each (450 dollars invested).  yesterday, my research paid off and merk was upgraded to $55 and also happened to sell its german assets.  yesterday, the stock got up to 44.87 (1.27 or 2.9%), and then i saw it pause in its escalation, i quickly sold all ten contracts for $0.95 or 111%, for a profit of $500.

then it tanked, along w/ the rest of the market, some 10 minutes later.  at the end of hte day, when it was at 44.02 (down 1.89%), i rebought 10 more options at 0.55, or 550.  today, it went up to 45.37 (3.1% or 5.93% of when i first got into it) at the very last 10 minutes of the day.  my contracts were bought up for a staggering 1.05 or $500/90% profit.

all in all, one stock, with an initial investment of $450, over the course of 2 weeks and two very powerful trading days, i made $1000 profit, or 122% returns.  that offset the $30 calls on yhoo that turned *worthless*, costing me $90 for both.

[how it works:  12 million shares of mrk exchanged hands today.  there's no way you or i could affect that.  the huge investment firms would (and do) take us to lunch.  however, only 3,182 contracts of mrk ai were traded today.  since i was personally responsible for 30 transactions (sell, buy, sell * 10), i affected 0.94% of the total market demand.  in effect, i *moved markets* several times by pricing below competitors to sell, even tho i had no intention of selling at that point.  i would wait w/ my 1 share for the other big boys to panic and lower their's down to my level (it's all done by software), then i would do that again next time the stock started going lower.  i'd get it off by 0.10 cents, or 20-30% and then price my buying shares at 0.05 higher than the other buyers, and mine would get immediately snapped up. you simply cannot do that with normal stocks.]",hopeseekr,2007-01-04 19:48:47,reddit.com,-1,gay: trade

as for textual concordance, in addition to what moom mentions about specific problems within the new testament as we have it, there is more than one way you can get uniformity without divine providence:

1) simply verbatim copying or borrowing, so that separate texts are not actually independent. xeroxing a document 100 times does not make it 100 times more trustworthy. this includes the likelihood that much of the gospels were derived from common earlier sources such as a collection of quotations from christ.

2) deliberate editing to remove or adjust discrepancies. whole bunches of texts such as gnostic or more miracle-oriented accounts were suppressed as heretical, pretty much because 2nd and 3rd century church fathers felt they should. doesn't make the remaining texts any more true.

consider, for instance, matthew 28:11-15, or john 21:23. basically ""there were rumors you may have heard, but don't believe them.""

3) deliberately selective or embroidered accounts that are written to agree with previously known ""predictions."" it's not like the jewish prophets had sealed all their writings in an envelope, to be opened only after the gospels were complete. there is a tremendous incentive to make the narrative of christ agree with apparent prophesies in older texts, particularly if the writer is trying to persuade other jews to listen.",sickofthisshit,2007-01-04 23:24:48,reddit.com,4,straight: het

god invented spellchecker for word processing programs. ever since then my papers have been infinitely better, although i still fourget too use it sumtimes. for a while i thought i would never get into college because of this spelling problem, but in the advent of spellchecker this is no longer so much of an issue. there are still certain ways that this problem manifests itself in my daily life. for example, in dashing off quick emails where spell checking would take more time than writing the letter itself, i rarely bother. the other obvious way i am affected is when i have to hand write something in school or when the power goes out. normally in school it isn’t as much of an issue since one isn’t expected to have a dictionary at their disposal so assignments are graded more on content than form. however when writing formally, such as writing thank-you notes to people, i still tended to embarrass myself for a while.

over the years though my spelling has miraculously improved. i credit this to spellcheck underlining misspelled words instead of just automatically correcting them at the end. this way i could see errors as soon as i typed i word wrong. this caused me to keep trying different spellings until i got the word right. trying different spellings of words was time consuming, so eventually it became easier just to memorize the correct spellings. thus, the laziness that caused my problem also ironically solved it. i look forward to a spelling future so bright that everyone reading my papers will have to wear songlasses.",Alex3917,2007-01-04 23:59:43,reddit.com,16,gay: gay

all i wanted was to fall in love and live happily ever after. the end.

except it wasn't that simple. at forty-something, i was hardly ""on the shelf"", but i was the veteran of two divorces. that gave rise to plenty of self doubt. it gave rise to another more sinister, subtle symptom too: i didn't trust the opposite sex not to hurt me again. and guess what? since the women i was meeting were in a similar age bracket, and also veterans of some painful emotional history, their fears echoed mine. result? an almost cast iron guarantee that love cannot flourish! you might as well scatter seed on concrete and expect a wheat field to flourish.

the internet is peppered with such walking wounded. dating sites abound and literally tens of thousands of people from all over the computerised world are looking for love. naturally, there are success stories with happy endings. but the vast majority are frustrated individuals. join these sites for a while, (i did for 3 months and ended up staying for 3 years), and you will see the same faces come round again and again. they are not ugly or evil or dangerous people. they are ordinary people like you and me, and yet somehow love is just eluding them.

why?

to answer that you have to first ask yourself why anyone wants a relationship in the first place. the answer is not obvious, but it is simple. in just about every generation up to about the 1950's, people got into relationships because it was inevitable. sooner or later, procreation was going to take place, and pregnancy meant the mothers needed economic support which was, of course, provided by the fathers. roles were clear, nature played a big part. whether relationships were ""happy"" or the couple were ""in love"" were secondary considerations. the relationship itself was primary, and at all costs was made to survive until death did them part. add in social and religious pressures, and no wonder our grandparents and all of their forbears stayed together for life.

nowadays we have a completely different agenda. it boils down to this: we will only stay in a relationship, or even enter into one, if it feels better than not doing so.

in other words, relationships have to make us happy or we're out.

that's a big agenda, but the biggest problem with it isn't its size; it's that it goes unacknowledged. society, from government to the church to our neighbours, tends towards the old values and we still measure ourselves by  
ourselves by them. we still consider ourselves to have failed if we break up a relationship, or worse, if we are the one who is jilted. this, in spite of the fact that we don't bat an eyelid if our friends change career, move house or emigrate no matter how many times they do it. but change partners? there's something wrong with you!

the fact remains, though, that broken relationships lead to broken hearts, and broken hearts hurt. pain leads to fear, and fear leads to either a total giving up, or an attempt to half commit - with resulting unsatisfactory relationships all round.

so what's the antidote?

two things, really. first, love yourself. if you can feel good about the person you're guaranteed to wake up with every day of your life, no one can hurt you, because that's your inner strength. it wouldn't matter how many times someone told arnold schwarzenegger he was a weakling, would it? he would always know that wasn't true.

secondly, get clear, really clear, about what you want. and then be honest about that. do you really want to be with someone with young children? do you mind if the lovely person you've just met has an almost zero libido? or an insatiable one?

also be flexible with yourself about this. your wants and needs are going to change. they won't be the same three months after the end of a relationship as they will be when three years have elapsed. so you have to learn to listen to your inner self, and not only hear it, but trust it and act on its advice!

what this amounts to actually reduces to an amazing and simple formula for finding and keeping true love. want to know what it is?

get to know, like and love the person you spend every day with. (for full details of who that is, check your nearest mirror!)

that's it! that way, you'll have bundles of love to give away, you'll be a joy to be around, (which makes you irresistibly attractive), and during those times when you find yourself alone, you'll be delighted to have your company for a while.

after all, who wouldn't?

cx4hr,t1_cx273,"ok, i will answer your points, however, no matter what i write it seems you won't listen. you are in a bad temper.

i would ask you, despite your current lack of respect for my opinions, that you temporarily assume that what i am saying could have a certain merit. and afterwards you may tear it to shreds.

anyway, for your entertainment (i'm public spirited):

unfortunately, i am going to have to go back to the blue and green folk again. i am sorry to have to use blue and green, but that is the only way i can stop making this personal. once i mention american or any other race or colour you immediately think i am talking about a particular example and miss the general point i am trying to make (or worse, call me a racist).

you remember the blues, they tend to discriminate against the greens until it is no longer news. it is part of their culture and noone notices it.

many blues think it is wrong, and indeed loudly proclaim it to be wrong. however, even where there eyes come upon it, they soon stop seeing it.

there is another land, redland, and the reds (as everyone knows) discriminate against everybody except themselves.

now mr blue and mr green (sounds like cluedo - no?) head off to redland and decide to go out for a meal at a restaurant. there is a queue for the restaurant. they are waiting to be seated, but everytime a new red comes along, he is placed ahead of them and they move back in the queue.

mr blue is shocked at this blatent discrimination and it eats him up. mr green is amused at his discomfort. he is used to this back home and takes it in his stride.

when mr blue gets back home he makes a big deal of it and all his fellow blueys empathise with him and say how disgraceful it is. mr green gets home but doesn't say anything about it. he has nothing to report. nothing newsworthy happened to him. he experiences this every day of the week.

the blues who empathise with mr blue while not seeing the much more serious discrimination that happens to mr green are being hypocritical. they see a problem when one of their own is discriminated against, but completely ignore the blatent and continuous discrimination to mr green. this is only acceptable behaviour if you start from the position that the greens are inherently less worthy.

that's enough of the cluedo gang- let's make it real.

the greens are the arabs in american airports. i haven't been to many american airports - maybe 20, all after 9/11 - but when i was there, i didn't see many arabs. almost all of the arabs i saw were stuck in the security area (statistically this would indicate that they are frequently stopped). i saw one woman in her 60s who was being examined by a female security agent. the agent was examining the woman's toes. each one individually. this would not be a comfortable ordeal for anybody who does not have a toe fetish, but for a culture that value the privacy of women, it would be especially uncomfortable.

i saw arab kids being thoroughly examined. this was only happening to arabs. if you and your family were continuously stopped at airport security you would get pretty frustrated. if you were searched in public it would be pretty embarrassing. i couldn't believe this was happening. most americans didn't even notice. i assume that they saw this all the time and it had ceased to register.

it wasn't only in the airport that i noticed this, it was also evident in the way arabs were looked at in public. and, boy, you should have heard the taxi drivers.

now let's take the woman who was turned away by a doctor. an american woman is refused service that she had paid for. that is pretty dispicable. but get this, it doesn't come close to comparing with the continuous treatment that arabs have to put up with in airports every day. i don't mean the one incident. i mean the relentlessness of it.

now to be disgusted at this woman's treatment and to ignore the more serious and ongoing racism against arabs in airports only makes sense if you assume arabs are less worthy than americans.

it's like a mother saying ""doctor treat my little johnny first, he scraped his knee, that other guy only has a broken leg.""

that is where that point came from. this is what i have being trying unsuccessfully to convey.

as to why i assumed the woman was white: there are a few reasons/hunches:

1. she is not used to experiencing racism. ""we just couldn't believe it. we were left standing there with our mouths hanging open,"". you're telling me that a black woman in america wouldn't be used to experiencing racism - that she would stand there with her mouth hanging open because she wasn't being served.

2. the doctor was a palestinian. now i suspect that his dislike of america is due to its support for israel. this support is generally associated with white americans (condi notwithstanding). i therefore suspect that a black woman wouldn't have been the target of his ire. admittedly this is a hunch, but it is on hunches that assumptions are made.

3. when i was in sweden, there were very few nonwhites there and i suspect this is still the case. i therefore figure that there is a high chance that her husband is white (the swedish name would also indicate this). now there is an evolutionary force that tends to drive people to find similar mates to their parents. although, i don't know the figures for mixed marriages, i am guessing that they are a small portion of all marriages and this would also indicate the woman is more likely to be white. naturally, the hunch caveat applies to this also.

although i never said the woman was white, i did imply that she was white and i did think that she was probably white. however, even if she was black it wouldn't negate the point i am making. however, you did want to know what my assumption was based on - now you do.

so now it is your turn to tear it to shreds:

nosoup: what! are you serious ... you mean you assumed the woman was white based on that flimsy evidence!

ff: yep. sure did.

nosoup: and what about where the op wished the woman ill.

ff: the woman's response was astonishment and disbelief. now it is possible that later she had some insight and might have thought ""my god, that is how it feels when you are discriminated against. that is what it feels like when you are always stopped in the security queue. it hurts. except those poor guys have noone to turn to, noone to complain to, noone to offer them sympathy. they don't have the nurses, the hospital management, and all the redditers who were on my side. how come noone can empathise with their position?""

this insight would make her a better person and probably improve her life (i think understanding is always a plus).

maybe she won't get any insight. she might say ""you can't do this to me. don't you know that i'm an american.""

i don't know what the original poster meant, but from his words and general theme, this is what i took him to mean.

cx5g8,t3_x1gd,"i had a few objections to this article, and to a few of the responses posted herein.  i am a graduate student of mathematics, though my economics experience is minimimal.  here are my objections.

1.  the statistic that ""less than x%"" of people are actually on minimum wage is irrelevant.  more pertinent is what % of people are below the new minimum wage, as these people will be affected.

2.  as a mathematician, i study, very axiomatically, properties of number systems, topological spaces, groups of matrices.  things which are invented on a chalkboard, and can be formulated and studied precisely.  i mention this to emphasize the following:  economics is not mathematics, and does not have the same inherent absolute truth.  economics, if considered a science is more closely akin to biology, or perhaps physics.  classical ""keynesian"" economics constructs a hypothetical axiomatic system, necessarily simplified to an enormous degree.  any economic ""proof"" or ""theory"" should be considered ""true"" /only/ within that framework.  any attempt to apply economic theories to the real world should undergo the same gauntlet as those in biology or physics:  1) use the theory to form a hypothesis. 2) test this hypothesis against mounds of data. 3a) if it holds up, consider it a reasonable model.  3b) if not, it must be rejected.  perhaps there is a significant volume of data correlating minimum wage to employment rates.  i have never seen it.

3.  arguments contending that by increasing everyone's wages, no real change will occur, due to inflation etc. are misguided.  changing the minimum wage shifts the balance of economic power because it only (directly) affects the earnings of the working class.  for instance i don't believe anyone will argue that shifting the minimum wage would increase the earnings of a middle class or upper class worker.

4.  arguments that standard of living are location-dependent and thus there should be no federal minimum wage are misguided.  as the law only sets the minimum, it will not affect those states/cities which have enacted higher minimum wages themselves.  for such an argument to be worth mentioning, one would need to demonstrate that there is some part of the country wherein $10,712 (=5.15 x 40 x 52) is enough to support a family.  i doubt such a place exists.

i think argument number four is the most convincing argument for the change.  it is simply unfair to pay someone, anyone, such a low wage, in a country of such wealth.  if doing what is right by our working class means a disruption in our fragile speculative economy, i think that's perfectly fair.

a related point:  did you know that agricultural workers are largely exempt from minimum wage regulations?  in oregon and california (where i have personal experience), agricultural workers are paid per product, and end up making even less than minimum wage.  the people that make our food.  shameful.",canonicalform,2007-01-05 10:11:36,reddit.com,2,straight: het

""for those who follow the zeitgeist — and the nobel prize committee seems always in the position of following rather than leading — the 2007 peace prize was no surprise. it went to one of the least-criticized men on the planet: professor muhammed yunus and his grameen bank of bangladesh.

pundits left, right, and center appear to love him. his microcredit scheme seems to mix the best socialist ideals with free market means, and then the rhetoric alone carries the day.

""the literature on grameen is an echo chamber of hurrahs. even the nobel committee didn't bother looking more deeply. its press release provides 5 paragraphs of puff. its link to other resources includes only one source: the grameen bank itself.

""the uncritical attitude is especially strange given the extent to which pawn shops and payday lending — which, unlike grameen, are genuine market institutions — in poor areas of the united states are hounded by the anticapitalist left. why is giving high-interest loans to the inner-city poor considered exploitative in the united states but wonderful and compassionate in bangladesh?

""the best fallout from the prize, then, will be a continued rethinking of the core assumptions behind microcredit of the grameen model. a deeper look at this institution shows not a success but precisely the sort of flop you might expect from a government-subsidized program that is predicated on the view that money alone is the answer to poverty.""

cx716,t1_cx5e2,"thank you for your cordial comments.

&gt; don't try to characterize osx as a lightweight, fluffy-bunny os, though.

my comments were not truly directed at osx except by comparison.... perhaps a slightly better comparison would be an mre imitating a 4 course $200 meal at a french restaurant.  the mre is optimized for shelf life, nutrition, compactness, minimal-infrastructure-requirements, and low-cost.   the french restaurant is optimized for almost completely unrelated things... trying to mix the characteristics of the two meals will ultimately result in something less optimal for either criteria.

also, it seems that the parts of osx that vista is copying are entirely fluff.

&gt; i heard and had to deal with the same argument back when ""vista"" was ""windows '95"". and macs were still running system 7.  

frankly, i'd say there were in fact no shell improvements in mac os since os7, and none in windows since win98se.  oh there have been changes but they seem to be nothing more than skins, themes, and other superficially different ways to do the same old things: open/save/copy/move/delete files, boot the machine, run/manage programs, allocate memory, interface with devices and networks.  anything else is not properly part of the os, rather the jobs of applications.

this brings me to a subject that is almost philosophical: ""os-application-integration"".  i've gone to some effort to keep my various computer activities discrete such that the behavior of one activity/program is blind to the state of all others.[1]  this approach is facilitated by windows in a sort of back-handed way:  the built-in tools are so anemic that people have been forced to write a collection of 3rd party applications to replace/bypass windows components.[2]  thus if one is willing to dig around the internet, a massive diversity of shell extensions/replacements is available which can be cherry picked to include only the behaviors one wants, discarding all others.  consequently, a sophisticated windows user has only one ms product: windows itself.  everything else: text-editing, security, type-setting, graphics editing/viewing, multimedia editing/viewing, bandwidth, number-crunching, development environments, etc is and should be from unrelated 3rd party providers.  why would we ever have wanted these things integrated with the os?  this is really not a rhetorical question.  if you have an answer, i'd love to know what it is.

&gt; you would likely be better off using linux.

i'm keeping that option in reserve, and will use it if vista's fundamental failings can't be bypassed before xppro is no longer compatible with enough modern programs to matter.  windows still has one fact going for it: you have to really search to find an application that does not have a windows version.  compatibility trumps performance.

[1] for example, one of the advantages of using firefox is that changes to its preferences won't change the behavior of anything but viewing websites.  this can not be said for ie which is heavily integrated into seemingly unrelated things.  another example would be multimedia.  i don't want two different multimedia programs trying to reconcile their libraries, or migrate preferences/playlists.  chances are i'm using several different programs to bypass the built-in limitations of one another.  software follows the rule of the hardware store: nothing in a hardware store is ever purchased for it's nominal ""purpose"".  you buy a part intended for one thing and use it for another.  integrated behavior makes it hard/imposable to use software independent of, or even against its intended function.

the problem i have with your blue/green example is that you don't know whether the woman was blue or green.  you're also stating that green folk are used to the discrimination and don't make a big deal out of it.  frankly, this isn't true.

usually of the loudest complaints of bigotry are from green folk.  when a green person is fired, often times people around them hear ""this is racism! it's because i'm green!"" and immediate calls to the green squeaky wheel club occurs, with the green religious leader calling on a boycott of the company that fired the green person. (regardless of the actual reason for firing.)

your basic tenet that the green folk are used to it and therefore ignore it is untrue.  yes, there are plenty of green folk that ignore actual bigotry committed against them, but there are plenty more that scream for green power!

heck, there are pubilc green folk that publicly speak on the need to kill all blue folk.  this barely made any news except for bloggers.

you also state that i'm suggesting we ignore all bigotry when it happens against green folk.

i'm not supporting the treatment people get in airports.  i have a huge problem with the idiotic and insane situation that the overblown fear of terrorism has done to people here.  i've never once suggested that we should ignore stories about arabic victims of prejudice and bigotry,

what i'm saying is that this is a story about a woman who was refused medical treatment.  stating that worse happens here in the usa isn't at all relevent, and merely serves to degrade the issue.

to use an example, you get mugged and beaten and you report it.  when you mention it to friends, they all respond by saying, ""so i hope you understand how it feels in my home country where we get mugged, beaten, and raped every week"".

basically, you'd want to look at them and ask ""what the fuck is wrong with you?""  the fact that it happened to them every week over there is horribly horribly wrong, but it doesn't make this case ok.

cx7kp,t1_cx6uw,"i assure you that if exxon or whatever paid its ceo less, the savings would 100% go to the shareholders, and not a penny extra to the average employees (unless they owned stock).

workers get paid according to supply and demand for workers in their rough job abilities. everyone at mcdonald's, the average drugstore, gas station etc. are in the same job market. to a large degree skilled salesforces are in the same job market, regardless of whether they are selling cars or oracle software. 

in order for workers in a rough job category to move up in pay, the supply of workers in that entire group has to get smaller, or the demand for employees in that group has to get larger, or the productivity in the (multi-)industry group has to increase somehow (helping set off a bidding war in that category). 

if a single company in a large industry (or group of industries where workers are somewhat interchangable (carpenter, short order cook, house painter etc.) gets dramatically more productive, it will get dramatically more profitable. the new money won't trickle down.

ultimately what this means is that either the individual has to acquire more productive skills in order to move up the income ladder, or productivity over large parts of the the general job substitutable industry you are in has to increase in order to have increasing real wages over the years. a third way is to have a large enough percentage of people in your skill group upgrade their skills (perhaps they go to college if you are blue collar) while you remain.

therefore, as a country you want more and better education for more people, and more companies investing in any skill category (low, medium, high) in order to raise wages in that group overall. for the us, this basically means fix the k-12 education system (good luck), increase quality capacity in the college and postgrad level, as well as lower, or better yet abolish, taxes on investing, such as capital gains, dividends, and corporate tax rates, noting that the us has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. you can't (re)invest in new and expanding businesses, and their accompanying new demand for workers (read higher wages), what the government takes away in taxes. [link showing corporate tax rates, with the us being in a tie for 117-143 out of 156](http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/indexoffreedomtax.cfm). take a look at the basket cases that have higher corporate taxes than we do.

cx7oj,t1_cx3wm,"so you want to continue the argument.  ok, fine.

my arguments are not contradictory.  you simply chose to read them that way.

you stated that hospitals turn way people in need, and provided a link about ambulances being sent away. ( http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/special/srlinks.nsf/0/bcbf599ff642f565862571ff00735716?opendocument ) this was in an argument about insurance.  you were basically claiming that the ambulances were turning patients away because the patients weren't insured.  the article had absolutely nothing to do with insurance.  

the basic premise of my argument is that people can get medical care regardless of insurance.  you proceeded to argue for the next few days that i'm wrong because people are falling through the cracks, get redirected to other hospitals, or can't get to the hospital because they are in the wilderness.

falling through the cracks example, you seemed to like the liver operation examples.  you provided a link and claimed the guy can't an operation because he couldn't pay for it.  the very article you linked talked about how the hospital provided free liver transplant operations.  the guy you used as an example was someone who isn't on top of the list for a liver simply because he isn't as serious yet as a lot more people who will die much sooner than him.  the fact that he doesn't have a liver replacement yet has very little to do with whether he has insurance.  in fact, he probably will get his operation paid for by that very hospital.

maybe it's not contradictory but it's a bullshit argument.  it certainly seems to get close to the line of being contradictory when the very article disagrees with your premise.

my point that anyone who needs care in the us can get it was meant in the premise of ""regardless of insurance"".  it only seems contradictory.  my argument has always been that it's not a matter of insurance.  if you ignore that basic element, then yes it does *seem* contradictory.

perhaps i should put it another way that better states it.  ""lack of insurance will not prevent anyone in the us from getting medical care"".  happy?

you only chose to take it that i meant other than that.  why?  i can only surmise because you felt like having an argument.  certainly when i offered to end this peacefully, you chose to continue instead.",nosoupforyou,2007-01-05 18:49:27,reddit.com,1,straight: het

cx7rd,t1_cx7hc,"i felt i did answer your question.  what motives would someone have to write a letter to advertisers about a show, wasn't that the question?

basically in all the examples i gave, the motive boils down to someone objecting to a show and wants to stop the show from being aired.  i guess one could claim this is a form of attempted censorship, but the method of choice is varied.

one could call up the fcc and demand the station be fined or the show be pulled off the air.

one could start up a protest group on the station demanding the show be pulled off the air.

one can call up one's friends and demand everyone stop supporting the advertisers.

or one can contact the advertisers and do one of two things...1) claim you are offended by the radio show and will never support the advertiser or 2) suggest that the advertiser listen to the show before purchasing more ad time on it.  this last option is all he did.  i'm not sure how this can be considering going too far.

""a quick reading of the entry for ksfo on wikipedia (and readings of old revisions) makes it's pretty clear what the show is like. advertisers don't really care; they want sales.""

agreed, when a national chain such as chevrolet decides to buy time nationally on radio, they don't really care much about any particular show.  their concern is about the ratings the show gets and how many people hear their advertisement.  they aren't likely to go check up on each radio show, even so much as checking wikipedia for them, assuming they even know what wikipedia is.

however, if the national chain gets a single letter from someone providing links to the audio, and pulls their ads from that show, they are probably agreeing that they don't want their product affiliated with that show.",nosoupforyou,2007-01-05 19:12:24,reddit.com,6,gay: boi
cx7sf,t1_cx7ei,"then congratulations, you have no price.

me, mine is the low low price of 90k.

remember, i said not prison or even county jail.  tv programs such as the hbo stuff is a scripted tv show on prisons.  there was a 30 day episode where the host decided to go live in a prison for 30 days as a prisoner.  it wasn't quite as bad as the hbo show.  not to say that there aren't prisons like the hbo one but not all of them are like that.  

jail isn't quite the same as prison.  i'm hardly an expert, but from what i've been told by people who've been to both, jail is unpleasant, the other county jail (response is usually ""ooh, don't get put there!), and prisons can vary from unpleasant to a nightmare.

a friend of mine was stuck in a reasonably ok jail for 3-4 weeks until i could get his bail together for him, and his biggest complaint was that there was no smoking in there.  no, he's not a hardcore kind of guy either.

so depending on the jail, i don't think 21 days would emotionally scar me much more than public school did.

of course, 90k isn't enough for me to spend 21 days in the county jail.

cx89o,t1_cx7vv,"-you assume that the only thing that raises a standard of living is using more resources

*you need to re-read what i wrote and note the use of the word ""if"".*
-
ok, point taken.  i misread that.

-raising the standard is being done all the time by improvements to the better use of resources.-

*in one sense, we're just recycling the molecules we're stuck with on this planet.

in the shorter-term, some people get to use more or better forms of those molecules and that's the discrepancy.*

so the standard of living rises for everyone, and yes some people have more.  so what?  you having more doesn't necessarily mean i have less except in a system where no growth can occur.


-no matter what economic model you use, not everyone will be able to have a house on the beach.-

*strictly speaking there are. it involves population control or virtual reality. but regardless, it makes the point that some people get more of a desirable finite resource.*

our minds must be thinking alike. i was thinking i might not want to own a beach house, but it would be fun to have a one in a true virtual reality world. ;)

yes, a lower supply than demand of something means some people won't have one.  however, show me the place in the constitution that says everyone can have a beach house if they want.

simply the fact that not everyone gets a piece of each finite resource means that anyone's standard of living doesn't go up.  my standard of living goes up regardless of my owning a beach house.

-no, those are merely attempts at it.-

*one might say everything is just an attempt. but when the government is taking 1/3 of your income by force, it surely is redistributing it.*

i had stated ""but it's not possible to make it less uneven through legislation."".  you argue that taking 1/3rd (try 50% rather) of everyone's income by force and spending it on highways and public schools is distributing wealth more evenly?  it's redistributing it, but it's not making it more even.


-federal student loans aren't really a redistribution of wealth.-

*it's giving money to someone temporarily, who will later replace the amount given (presumably when s/he is earning more).*

again not redistributing it.  a loan is not a redistribution of wealth.  whether it's even successful as a loan can be argued against, as some people get fooled into taking classes by less than scrupulous schools and get stuck with debt for schooling that doesn't help them.

-welfare doesn't work, although you might disagree.-

*i don't know what you mean by ""work"", but i don't know what welfare is if not taking money from people who have more of it and giving it to people who have less of it, thus reducing the disparity, thus making it ""less uneven"" through legislation, by definition.*

welfare was never shown to successfully redistribute wealth more than in the short term.   it was probably the sole example you gave of true redistribution of wealth, but at least in my opinion it failed abysmally.  people more often than not got on welfare and were there for life.  it didn't raise their standard of living.  there were actually economic rewards to stay on welfare and have more kids because the welfare check would be larger.

something that tries to redistribute wealth but only causes more poverty isn't working, in my book.

whether or not you agree that welfare was a successful implementation of wealth distribution, that's up to you.  i certainly doubt if many welfare recipients became successful while on it.

definitely i don't see that 5% of the richest people owning 95% of the countries wealth really change at all because of welfare.

-highway maintenance and public schools don't redistribute wealth as far as i can see.-

*it's taking from homeowners and making something of use to everyone.*

so tell me why all the new highways seem to have tollways?  i can use it but i still have to pay to use it, even though i already helped pay to build it?

taking money from everyone and spending it on something everyone can theoretically use doesn't necessarily redistribute wealth.

public schools aren't a redistribution of wealth, unless you claim that students who leave it are wealthier than they would have been if there hadn't been a school.  well, a lot of people will argue that this isn't true, that public schools actually make students poorer than they would have been otherwise.

so back to highways. i claim it's not a redistribution of wealth where wealth is made less uneven.  in fact, it's the opposite.  the middle class ends up paying for it and using it, and the only redistribution of wealth that occurred here is that the middle class got taxed a little more and the pocket of the governor's friend got a little heavier.

this seems to be the opposite of the goals of wealth redistribution. 

-a lot of times, the highway projects end up being given to a friend of the governor or mayor, who then makes a tidy profit on it.=

*i don't know where you live but in ca there's caltrans, and my understanding is that work is done by state employees.*

i don't live in california, and i don't know much about caltrans, but does not caltrans have to purchase materials, but trucks and other vehicles to do this?  usually this is where the budget extras hide.  do you know for a fact that caltrans doesn't employ people who only show up for paychecks and happen to be related to the friends of important people?

the money gets taken from the middle class and poor, in the form of sales and real-estate taxes, and most of it is used to build highways and tollways where people can pay again for it.  yes, the highways can be used by everyone, but how much of this was actually paid for by the 5% of the wealthiest?

-how does this redistribute wealth?-

*didn't you just answer your own question?*

i asked because i assumed that a wealth redistribution where the rich get richer isn't what you intended.

*yeah, i spent months compiling a dossier on ""nosoupforyou"" so i'd know exactly what off-the-cuff remark about income disparity would inflame you politically.

get an ego reduction.*

actually, i was just trying to understand why you included that part.  you simply said ""of course there is also corporate welfare, tax cuts for the rich, and so forth.""

gasp!!!!. how dare you say such a thing. raising the minimum wage causes unemployment. it's cause and effect. how dare you even suggest that there may be other factors and the raising the minimum wage may have no effect on unemployment. if you raise the minimum wage and the unemployment rate goes up you must assign the blame (or credit) to unemployment.

stop it. you are speaking pure heresy.
--
no, i didn't say it wouldn't be measurable.  i said statistically it wouldn't be valid.  for an accurate statistical model, you need a lot of data points.  one per year over a 20 year period gives you 20 data points.  not really very useful.

for a more accurate model, you'd have to raise or lower the minimum wage every month and take a data point.  perhaps tying it to the gnp or inflation and getting regular data points.  i'm not saying these are desirable, but if you want an accurate representation of what it's doing, more than once a year of data points is necessary.

or wait, you just want to set up some kind of dole, right?  everyone makes the same money regardless of job, skill, or experience?  so an unskilled clerk working part time at the 7-11 should make the same money as someone who took the effort to learn how to maintain heating and air conditioning?

--""if he's been at the job for any amount of time, or if he's working in a union, he's probably making more than minimum wage.""

what??? i thought we agreed he was making the minimum wage.
--

so if he's making minimum wage, we agree he hasn't made even a little effort to get skills or a better job?  

--
""if he's working somewhere for a few years and still making only minimum wage and only being allowed to work part time, he's in the wrong job if he's supporting kids.""

exactly. so if we raise the minimum wage and you fire him because you don't care about him and you don't value him, his family or his efforts then maybe he can find the right job.
--

again we're back to firing him because i simply don't care about him.  nothing at all to do with the fact that the business can't afford to charge more to customers because they will just go to walmart instead.

are you a fan of walmart?  they are in favor of raising the minimum wage because it will drive their competitors out of business.

""the constitution says we may pursue happiness. happiness isn't handed to us. legislating happiness doesn't work.""

yes sure. one way to pursue your happiness is to vote for people who promise to raise minimum wages. there are other ways of course but it's something we can do and we should do it.
--
you take the quote out of context.  you have the right to pursue happiness, not the right to force others to make you happy.

i disagree that even raising the minimum wage will help make anyone happy.  he'll get more for a while, but then unions will demand increases because they need to be above minimum wage by so much, and then inflation sets in.  the minimum wage employee is back right where he started.

you can't get blood from a stone, and trying to legislate how much people earn just does not work.  it may make you feel good to believe you have helped some poor minimum wage guy in the city, but it's the same sort of 'help' that the country has inflicted on other countries.

&gt; i was reminded of this conclusion until i got to the part about the school children. that was definitely uplifting. a modernized irish is the only way to ""save"" it, as they seem interested in doing.

the idea that the coming generation is about to save irish has been around for generations now. it isn't going to happen this time either. meanwhile the number of native speakers of irish declines inexorably. the quality of the irish being taught in those new *gaelscoileanna* is often just objectively rubbish, by the way.

ah, there's the rub though. in the current system in the us, no one pays for their own. yes they pay some money to their company health plan, but when someone is sick, they don't value shop for a healthcare provider. they just go and the office charges whatever they want to charge or whatever they can get away with under their policy.

to use your example, what kind of price and progress would have been possible in the desktop computer market if people just went out and bought one without knowing or caring what the price was? if they bought the new model whenever they wanted to using someone elses money there wouldn't have been the breakneck competition that has made all the advances possible.

letting the government finance healthcare coverage for everyone, if they did it right, would keep heathcare costs down because the single payer could make a deal with providers that is beneficial to taxpayers. they would set the yearly increase equal to the cpi or whatever they use to adjust social security and they could focus on improving medical outcomes, which despite having the highest cost healthcare in the world, the outcomes are not nearly at the top. the infant mortality rate in the us is pathetic and the costs just keep going up without bound.

the machines drown out the booming disco racket from the overhead speakers. all you hear, aside from the constant hum of machinery, is metal on metal, minus the smear of grease.

squeak. squeak. squeak.

the stunning blonde attached to these legs peers down at a dark screen. at first, it looks like she's about to indulge in a game of pac-man or donkey kong, but in actuality, her ensuing fun is of a much different variety. this woman is about to work out.

after punching in a few keys as if it were tax time, her hips slowly begin to grind, and just like that, the fun has begun.

needless to say, the year is 1999 and what once was accomplished with such basic simplicity has now entered the world of hi-tech devices and advanced microchips.

to a new patron, who just wandered through the door, it all seems a bit pretentious as he peers over the motoring array of stairmasters, steppers, treadmills, and stationary bikes.

the observer smirks and chuckles, knowing well that, not so long ago, for the goal at hand, two legs and an old pair of nikes were all that was required.

however, the art of running seems a forgotten trade, not just for the random observer, but for the fitness public in general. for the mainstream crowd looking to foil the flab (and perhaps partake in the social aspects), a nice, honest jog through the park loses out to a sweat-session on the stairs any corporate day of the week.

yet, one fact remains, the  
remains, the same fact that has survived both the tests of time and the endless evolution of technology. nothing will whip you into shape faster and more effectively than a good, primitive run.

aside from the fresh air that expands your lung capacity, something you can't get at an indoor gym, running continues to stand as the leader in conditioning, fat burning, and keeping your heart rate up. just compare the three miles down main street with the same distance on the rubbery conveyor belt of a treadmill. the difference in the way you feel is astounding.

but one such concept factoring in the demise of running is the belief that it is a muscle man's worst enemy. reports that running will chisel away on that hard-earned beef have been relentless. thus, the running fad has come to heel a bit, almost seemingly limited to the hard-core crowd.

the experts say that the ideal method, however, to avoiding such a tragedy is to jog lightly for the first twenty minutes and then upgrade to a more vigorous pace thereafter. after the twenty-minute segment, the body generally kicks into the fat-burning business as opposed to the muscle-consuming business. remaining at a steady, moderate pace (say 70 percent), and ditching any hopes of becoming the next jesse owens would seem the most logical approach, especially for new runners.

besides, doesn't a nice stroll along a quiet country road amid the birds and the tress sound somewhat appealing? doesn't it beat gaping at the sweat-drenched back of the guy on the stairmaster in front of you?

if this is you, then perhaps it's finally time to leave those noisy treadmills and squeaky stationary bikes behind ? far enough behind to choke on your dust.

cxbht,t3_xbc7,"&gt; thinking about the problem generally requires the most part of the time in software development. there's only one way a programming language can solve it: by providing an existing solution.

this is a vast oversimplification.  the *best* way to solve a problem is by using an existing solution.  however, you'll also get a speedup in this phase if:

1. the language forces you to think about the problem in a more disciplined way, keeping you from going down blind alleys in the first place (eg. haskell's type system and straitjacketing of state into monads.)
2. the language provides tools that let you easily discover when your understanding of the problem is faulty (java's ide-based debuggers, smalltalk's image-based development, lisp's repl).
3. the language lets you easily adapt previous solutions that are *almost* adequate to the task.  (dynamic typing if you can reliably hold all the types in your head - i don't know many programmers that can *honestly* do this.  java's automated refactoring tools.  inheritance &amp; composition in oo languages.)
4. the language lets you *use* previous solutions in this context, by avoiding arbitrary restraints on composition.  (polymorphism, generic programming.  nominal subtyping - a la java interfaces, c++ abstract base classes - is a big no-no here, but it's certainly better than the c alternative of early binding.)  this is verging into code-reuse territory.

also, the bulk of my time isn't spent thinking about problems.  it's spent searching the net for existing solutions, reading the documentation for them, trying to fit them into our existing architecture, and debugging their bugs.  which brings me to...

&gt; also existing code is already debugged and tested. and if it's from a 3rd party developer you don't even have to maintain it.

perhaps you've been luckier in this regard, but i've found this generally isn't true.  i've run across bugs in swing, netbeans, jaxme, jsf (oh man, this is a cesspool...), somewhere between java 6 and tomcat 5.5, a4j, and facelets.  my cubemate just downloaded a javascript library that flat-out *did not work* - he wrote the simplest possible program, straight out of the docs, and it failed.  the only third-party libraries that i've used extensively and found no bugs in were jfreechart and opencsv (and core java, but i'd be *really* disturbed if that had bugs.  oh, and the jakarta commons stuff is generally pretty good, but you can get stuck in classloader hell if a library requires a version different than what's installed in your tomcat/jsf installation).  3rd-party software usually means you'll be doing your maintenance work *and theirs*.

i see this as a huge area for potential productivity gains.  if you can cut down the amount of time spent tracking down bugs in *other people's code*, programmers will love you forever.  some areas that need improvement:

1. versioning.  dependencies all need to be versioned, and the language needs to enforce and track this.  individual products have made some good strides in this (netbeans has a very usable mechanism), but it needs to run throughout the language.  otherwise, you end up with classloader hell (java) or dll hell (windows).
2. documentation.  as a general rule, programmers will not write documentation.  javadoc was a *huge* leap forward here, because even if the programmer doesn't, the library is still halfway usable, just based on names &amp; type signatures.  but documentation really needs to be enshrined in the language's culture.
3. testing.  make it easy, so we don't have untested messes escaping into the wild.  programmers hate writing tests too, so if it's not super-simple, they just won't do it.  i really like doctest in this regard: it fits with the programmer's normal workflow and also provides documentation.
4. packaging.  why must i hunt down all the dependencies for a library myself, and then curse as none of them work with each other (see point #1)?  why isn't the system smart enough to figure out it's own dependencies - it has import statements, after all - and then take care of downloading compatible versions on its own?  or let programmers package up everything an app needs in a single file with an easy single command.  don't make programmers learn installshield, msi, or wise - they won't, and the rest of us will suffer.
5. interface models.  libraries should tell you *really quickly* if you're not using them the right way.  preferably at compile-time.  none of this ""okay, this method takes a string name astring...what the hell is that supposed to be?  what are the valid values?""  (shamefully, my company's product is very much like this.)
6. abstraction leakage.  this is one reason why i'm beginning to *hate* oop.  it encourages you to keep state in your implementation, hidden away from any documentation, which inevitably results in weird behavior when programmers don't use your library in the exact way you intended (see points #3 and #5).  as a result, things fail with a nullpointerexception *hours* after the programmer made a call that they could not know was wrong (point #2).  apis should make the bulk of their objects immutable (this came up in [joshua bloch's presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design).  when they can't, they should clearly define what the expected effect on the object's internal state will be, in terms of the problem domain.

as an example of point #6 - my boss is basically mandating jsf, because ""if we don't have it, you have to think about all sorts of problems - like managing component state - that the framework solves for you.""  problem is, i have to think about them anyway.  for scalability reasons, we want to save state on the client, which means that the view state is serialized out into a hidden form field.  normally this is not a problem, as jsf always uses post for every request (okay, this *is* a problem, but nobody at my workplace believes me when i say that bookmarking, linkability, and the back-button are important concerns).  however, we're doing an ajax app using a4j, because ""the framework provides important functionality that we would otherwise have to implement for ourselves.""  a4j serializes certain objects and writes them out as parameters for a get.  ie has a 2038 character limit on get urls.  oops.  the framework handles all the component state for me, i just need to make sure that the serialized, gzipped, base-64-encoded representation of that state is less than 2038 characters.

moreover, if i go over the limit, i don't get any sort of error message saying ""serialized object xyz too large.  limit 2038 characters.""  it just silently ignores my request.  then i spend a day figuring out whether this is a problem with a4j, tomcat, jsf, my code, my boss's code, the back-end-platform-we've-written-over-5-years's code, or somewhere in between.

&gt; if you have code which uses a a-monad and want to fit it together with code which runs in a b-monad, you get problems.

i just complained about this on #ltu, and somebody gave me a solution.  put the monadic operations in a typeclass.  don't overspecify the function signatures (i.e. say `monadstate m =&gt; m a` rather than `mystatemonad a`).

it seems to be working rather well.  for example, i had code that was working in a type-inferencing monad defined as `type typem a = state (int, constraintset) a`.  i wanted to add some error handling, so i just changed the definition to `type typem a = statet (int, constraintset) evem a` where evem is my main interpreter monad, an instance of monaderror, and i can use throwerror/catcherror with no other changes.

switching from pure functions to monads *is* a big pain, and i wish there was an easier solution for that.  #ltu again gave me some pointers: striated monads and ""composing monads using coproducts"".",nostrademons,2007-01-06 20:40:58,programming,16,"straight: straight, straight: het"

an inconvenient truth...... the truth is it's only partisan nonsense.

i finally got around to seeing this fine piece of political bs. it was much like michael moore's flicks, designed for people that have a preset mind and want some reinforcing. numerous times gore says it isn't about politics, yet he consistently makes it a political issue. he fails to mention that during his 8 years as vp there was countless times he could have helped to push policies to lower total us emissions, instead he pushed policies that raised total emissions. co2 emissions in america were at 18.4 tonnes per person in 1992, yet by the year 2000 they were boosted to 20.4 tonnes per person annually. also he was part of increasing immigration which is the sole driver to us population growth, during his years the population went from 255 million to 282 million. he was also part of lifting trade sanctions on china, a country known for poor pollution standards. he didn't mention that his party also in for lowering punishments for criminals and allowing crazy people to be on the street, and a big reason people don't like to bus, walk or bike is because of these crazies and criminals.

the movie did put out some good scare tactics. it failed to offer any solutions other than blame republicans and big business. it didn't emphasize at all that population growth must be stopped in order to avert problems (that's not in keeping with his political views). could you explain why gore didn't tell his followers to go home and change out their light bulbs for compact fluorescent bulbs? or why not tell his followers to rally for less immigration in order to slow population growth in the most consuming nation on the planet? why didn't he ask the people attending to show their bus passes to prove they're helping support mass transit?

speaking of pollution per capita, the us currently puts out 19.8 tonnes per person. did you know that mexico averages 4 tonnes per person? so when one person leaves mexico and moves to america it is like the planet is seeing a total population gain of 4 people. you figure with 10 million illegals here that is a population boost of 40 million the planet gets to enjoy.",JTucker381,2007-01-06 21:45:48,reddit.com,-2,gay: trade

cxbor,t3_x9p0,"many businesses and home users wrote apple off in the days when they weren't doing so hot (twice in history) and in the second time, microsoft had to give them an injection of cash to keep them afloat. but now that microsoft is making people go to the store and rethink their reasons why they stuck with windows, and now that apple works on pc hardware, i bet a lot of people are scratching their heads and wondering if they should make the switch. (note: i use to be a rabid apple user back in the 70's to the 90's before i switched to win 9x, 2k, and xp.)

and i hope they do make the switch. and perhaps those users who do make the switch will then learn about my favorite os, **[ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/)**, and compare it to apple. you get another *nix, more apps and more choices, more abilities to 'mod' the interface to your liking, less lockups, and the ability to run it on your *own* choice of pc hardware instead of apple's choice, thereby saving money.

microsoft would have done better to just keep people on xp and just offer them more new software products, office upgrades, and plus packs rather than to give them an opportunity to think about making another os choice again.

and all of that is not even scratching the surface. when users start to learn about vista's ""call home"" drm for their illegal mp3s, or all the annoying ""do you wish to permit this?"" dialog boxes, or the expense of having to get the very latest hardware, or the terrible eula, or the high cost of the product, or the no compelling reason to upgrade, or the fact you can't swap out hardware without purchasing a new license -- it sure makes people stop to think.

at my day job, a global employer around the world, they had no problem letting us install nt4, then w2k, and then xp. it wasn't a major deal except a requirement that we switch from nt4 to w2k at least because of security reasons. but now that vista is here, all the top guys are reviewing whether it makes sense at all to go with vista.

cxbtb,t1_cxal9,"never said it did the latter; i said there was much that could be learned from *studying* zope, not from *using* it.  big difference.  ;)

regarding interfaces, i would refer you to the python-3000 list, where there was quite a bit of discussion about adding interfaces to the language, with considerable support from guido.  the last pronouncement was that he believes py3k should at least have some sort of formal abc (abstract base class) hierarchy for certain language-defined interfaces.  similarly, restricted execution has been a big python-dev topic in the last year.

as for rest, check out the first papers on bobo, zope's predecessor, published for the 1996 international python conference.  the term rest hadn't been coined yet, so they used the term ""object publishing"" instead.  granted, it was not an ideologically pure form of rest, but one slightly watered down for the browser, followed later by what i believe were the first python webdav implementations (which *were* pure rest).

the history of zope is littered with brilliant core ideas wrapped in crud -- and i've made a habit of stealing those brilliant core ideas and using them for other things, and noticing that the rest of the python community usually takes 3-4 years to catch up.  if you want to stay ahead of the pack, you could do a lot worse than to keep a close eye on ""what zope is up to now"".

by the way, plone is a very nice system in certain respects, but it's built on an earlier zope corp. innovation known as the portal toolkit, or ptk.  in other words, you've got it backwards: plone wouldn't be where it is if zope hadn't already been successful for many years beforehand, because it never would've existed.

in general the layers of ""crud"" on the top of zope's brilliant innovations are a necessary consequence of the fact that zope corp. is not in the business of selling technological innovation, but rather, business results.  creating systems that are user-friendly for non-programmers pulls a system's design in ways that produce greater complexity.

which reminds me of another zope-&gt;python innovation: doctest and tdd.  while tim peters wrote doctest, jim fulton overhauled it to make it integrate with the unittest module and scale up to huge test suites.  zope was also one of the first python projects to adopt automated testing on a massive scale, and their enhancements came back to the stdlib.

oh, and need i mention cpickle and cstringio?  zope and zope.  threading.local?  zope.  isinstance() proxy support?  zope again.  the datetime module?  also zope.  debugging support for doctest?  zope.

and all that's just what i happen to recall off the top of my head!

the python community owes *huge* debts to zope, whether they know it or not.  what makes zope better makes python better, because zope contributes.  in the history of python, it's hard to imagine a company that has contributed more to python's development than zope corporation, until google came along.  but zope corp. doesn't have billions to burn, and they gave until it hurt.

and what do they get in return?  shunning and flaming from the people who use their inventions and praise others for the work they did, the way some people think bill gates invented the freakin' mouse.  sometimes it just makes me sick.

cxc8r,t1_cxbw4,"&gt; as in this case, there is no code reuse, but there is a productivity difference.

this was a lisp&lt;-&gt;java comparison. but lisp provides lots of code reuse by having powerful built in features. the main one: macros which let you write code once and reuse it other where. it's very powerful, but this advantage can turn into a disadvantage if you have to match code of different independent developers. if you write all your code alone, you know what macros you wrote, how they can interact with other macros etc. but another developer who don't knows about your macros - and you don't know about his can create macros for very similar situations - but still in a slightly different way. and if you now want to incorporate his code in your project it won't fit easily.

&gt; also, i'm not yet convinced that the abstraction features of a language should be considered as code reuse - because then you end up calling just about everything code reuse, and diluting the argument. perhaps there's a simple way to draw a line around that one, however.

not everything, but many things are. in the end all our code is translated into assembler instructions, so it's plausible that to 'do more' with a certain operation in the source code it has to create more assembler instruction in the end. this is code reuse: creating multiple instructions by specifying only one. if you call a function in a library, use a macro from a library or write a loop-statement: it's all the same, reusing existing code.

norvig wrote about how patterns show deficiencies in a language - and i think he's right and wrong at the same time. yes, having to write out patterns explicitly are deficiencies, but they also exist (and will continue to exist) in *every* language. but after we found them we can create a new abstraction based on the pattern and let the compiler create the boilerplate code instead of writing it ourself (often there is an intermediate step where those patterns are partly handled by library code). and soon afterwards we will discover that we use new patterns which are possible (or visible) now because we don't have to think about the more primitive ones which are handled by the compiler now.

and i don't think that this dilutes the argument, i think that it makes more clear which abstractions can enhance productivity most: the ones which creates 'more code' in the end (i know that this is a bit imprecise, but i don't know in the moment how to articulate it better).",kawa,2007-01-07 02:14:46,programming,2,gay: boi

first, it's spelled ""walmart"".  not ""wallmart"".

second, fighting the coming of ""wallmart"" into your town doesn't mean you succeed at it, regardless of whether you are inept at doing so or not.

third, you can be very successful at managing your store, meaning you aren't inept at all.  the fact that walmart opened a superstore in your neighborhood doesn't suddenly make you poor at managing it.  basing your definition of ineptness on whether walmart opens a store in your town is just ludicrous.

fourth, you don't give money to the chamber of commerce that in turn gives it to politicians.  frankly, small town chambers of commerce aren't in the habit of lobbying politicians by providing funds or gifts.

fifth, your imaginary buyers club alliance of other store owners ""in your area"" is sort of a retarded concept.  if you have enough other stores in your area selling the same products you do that you could form a buyers club, you'd be rather inept right there.   there's only so much demand for the same products, which is why opening a walmart will generally put a small retail shop out of business.

a worldwide buyers club is even more of an inept idea.  i'm hoping you mean a national club rather than worldwide, since few small stores really need to purchase international goods.  i find it unlikely that a small shop in ohio would need or want to ally on bulk purchases with a small shop in london.

a national buyers club wouldn't do much.  sure, you could call each other store and say ""hey, i need two cases of plain white glossy paint.  if we can get 600 other stores to go in with us each for two cases, we can save 15 cents per can.  if we can get 6000 other stores, maybe we can demand the paint manufacturer kowtow to us like walmart!""

this completely ignores the fact that the level of complication, time, shipping, and basic nightmare it would entail in trying to handle this.   perhaps, you think, a buyers club that does all the purchases, and then the store can just buy from them!

the basic problem with this inept idea is that the people who run the buyers club is not going to be doing this for free.  they would then have to cover warehousing, shipping to the stores, order taking, etc, everything that walmart central does now except that it would probably cost more and take more work since each individual store isn't owned by the buyers club like walmart owns their stores.

""i gotta say, you see things as pretty black and white if you think that a business will only shut it's doors through the ineptness of the owner.""

yes i do. just like the people who think raising the minimum wage causes a rise in unemployment.

--
the cases are hardly comparable.

even you admitted that raising the minimum wage will cause a rise in unemployment.  however, only you are the one that claims that a business that fails is purely due to the ineptness of the owner.

what's good for the goose is good for the gander. if you are willing screw people over by fighting for a lower minimum wage then don't come crying to me when wallmart runs your out of business. so sad, too bad. it's a dog eat dog out there isn't it? the poor fuck is getting minimum wage because he is too lazy to improve himself right? isn't that what you said? well to me the guy who gets shafted by walmart is just like the poor fuck getting minimum wage. you should have improved yourself fuckface, i am not crying for your sorry ass.

--

good for the gander?  how am i screwing people over?  i'm not fighting for a lower minimum wage?  i'm arguing that a higher minimum wage won't actually help anyone.

i'm guessing that you make minimum wage, and are upset that anyone doesn't agree that you should make a higher wage without doing more productive work.

because i'm disagreeing that a higher minimum wage will actually do any good, i'm somehow shafting you.

since you've decided to make it personal, want me ""to go out of business"" because i'm an ""inept"" business owner probably because i didn't ""run wallmart out of town"", allow me to make similar assumptions about you.

you are obviously a completely unskilled employee working part time at a job you hate, for a business you want to see go under, and feel a sense of entitlement.  the country owes you a decent lifestyle and should be concerned about making you happy.

you personally are retarded.  you, personally, should get off your ass, go to school and learn some skills.  get a decent job, and quit bitching that you don't earn a ""sane"" income.  if you aren't willing to do that and want more money, then work more hours or a second job.  quit playing with the nintendo and do something about it.

if you object to my making it personal, or want to insist that i don't know anything about you, or that i have no right to make judgement calls, what have i done that you haven't?

uh, no.

defending yourself with a gun doesn't require 20/20 vision. i have weak vision and i would have little trouble defending my home against invaders trying to force me to join a fuedal system.

even assuming i'm living alone without family, i would easily be able to pick off a few before i'm killed. my neighbors would definitely be warned when they hear a gunfight next door.

this would sort of make trying to become a fuedal overlord a difficult proposition, if all your victims shoot back at you.

maybe you think it would work out in the boonies, where people don't have close by neighbors.  well, maybe someone would be able to take out a bunch of homes in such an area, but they won't be able to take over much more.  in a libertarian society, such a group would be anathema.  no one would trade with him.  attempts at trying to force trade would basically be dealt with by returned force.

""no, actually what you said was that if we had just caused a great deal of unemployment by raising the minimum wage, we should just let inflation eat away at it. are you unable to keep straight your own statements?""

right if ( and i don't accept that if) we somehow end up causing unemployment by raising the wages then we stop and let inflation take care of it. you were worried that one or two dollars would raise it too much so i said let's do it by .50.

so keep your arguments straight.

seriously, you seem to be confused here.  ""if"" we cause a rise in unemployment after raising the minimum wage, you said we should let inflation eat away at it.

your premise is that we raise the wage and see.  your statement is supposes either unemployment doesn't go up too much, or it does go up too much.  the ""if"" is already part of the premise.

this means that you stated we'd be letting inflation eat away at it, ""if"" it happened to cause a problem.  i'm arguing about the problem we'd be seeing ""if"" your supposition occurs. are you so stuck on ""if"" that you can't understand your own statements?

again with the blasphemy. stop saying things like this. economics is simple. there is cause and there is effect. if you raise the minimum wage then unemployment goes up. every time. all the time. it's cause and effect.

right? isn't that what we are arguing about? how dare you suggest that rising of the minimum wage may have no effect on unemployment. that's heresy.

you keep pulling words and statements out of your ass and pretending i said it.

please quote me where i made such statements.

there is cause and there is effect.  however, with economics, there are multiple concurrent causes with multiple delayed effects vying with current effects.

it's not a simple matter to decide that a 5% rise in inflation caused a 2% decrease in unemployment.  i gotta say, if you've mastered economics where you can figure out what each effect was caused by, you should go pick up your nobel peace prize.

however, i suspect you are merely talking again out of your ass.

it's cause and effect right? i mean does it really matter what language people are speaking?

--

you stated that we have the data points from every country from decades available, to compile as thousands of data points.

now you are saying that italy's data has no relevence to the usa's data.  since this is perfectly in line with what i've been saying, i'm going to thank you for coming around to my way of thinking.

no.  you seem to have a basic level of confusion about what capitalism is.  capitalism isn't about getting the government to force people to give you more money.

no, actually the term ""happiness"" in the context was defined by the writers of the declaration of independence.  you don't get to redefine it.  attempting to redefining it is either taking the quote out of context or is an attempt at rewriting the constitution.

i can check countries without minimum wages and compare their economies to ours. furthermore i can state without any hesitation that the existance of the minimum wage and the periodic raising of it hasn't stopped our economy from dominating the world. apparently it doesn't seem to have any averse effects at all.

--

this is like the classic physics joke where the professor tells the students to define the universe and give three examples.

you can't make a claim as to what the economy would be like today if we never had the minimum wage because there's no way to do it.  making a claim that it would be either worse or better is only making a judgement call.  you have no idea if it's had an adverse affect, and you're retarded for claiming it didn't.  show me a link or provide some data backing up your claim, or take it back.

second, i already asked you for some data on these other countries with robust economies with minimum wages you keep referring to.  show me the data or quit trying to argue facts when you have no facts at all.

thirdly, it's another judgement call that our economy is currently dominating the world.  many people would argue against it, especially when we're outsourcing jobs to india and companies move overseas.

in fact, the argument is made that the dollar is weakening against the euro, and people are betting heavily against us.

&gt;we hold a fair and logical stance on the issue of palestine. several decades ago, egyptian statesman gamal abdel nasser, who was the most popular arab personality, stated in his slogans that the egyptians would throw the jewish usurpers of palestine into the sea. some years later, saddam hussein, the most hated arab figure, said that he would put half of the palestinian land on fire. but we would not approve of either of these two remarks. we believe, according to our islamic principles, that neither throwing the jews into the sea nor putting the palestinian land on fire is logical and reasonable. our position is that the palestinian people should regain their rights. palestine belongs to palestinians, and the fate of palestine should also be determined by the palestinian people. the issue of palestine is a criterion for judging how truthful those claiming to support democracy and human rights are in their claims. the islamic republic of iran has presented a fair and logical solution to this issue. we have suggested that all native palestinians, whether they are muslims, christians or jews, should be allowed to take part in a general referendum before the eyes of the world and decide on a palestinian government. any government that is the result of this referendum will be a legitimate government.

the ""srong"" can still kill people, but it's much tougher to try to subjugate them.  you might be able to kill a lot of people, but unless they are willing, you will never be their king.

it seems reasonable to assume that intelligence in humans is 'capped'. what i mean with this is that humans evolved to be intelligent only to the point that it maximized their chances to produce offspring but *no more*.

this would imply that there could have been humans who were too intelligent to reproduce (whatever that would mean in a real humans life). of course there could be other limiting factors for evolution to produce more intelligent humans, like the head becoming too big to pass through the birth channel or it becoming too difficult to maintain in a biological environment with temperature fluctuations. 

also it might be that a brain any more complex than that of a human would be impossible to 'program' because of the exponential increase in the number of possible brain states.

but if there would have been more intelligent humans that somehow didn't make it who were they? i mean apart from the leonardo da vinci's and the tesla's? the fact that there are so few notable women in such lists seems to indicate that there could have been many that we never knew about. also, how much has tesla's genius helped him in the end?

a little further back in history we have the neandertals who  are supposed to have a bigger brain than homo sapiens. an interesting theory about them is that a specific gene, 'microcephalin', the absence of which causes a condition in which there is a very small brain but otherwise no physiological defects, somehow ended up to be present in 70 percent of our current population because of [interspecies breeding](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0606966103v1), possibly with neandertals.

there might be other factors that limit our intelligence in order to keep us 'grounded' in reality. maybe sleep and dreaming are not only for resting but also for refocusing our attention on the immediate situation, thereby limiting our options but at the same time increasing our survivability and our reproductive success. it's not for nothing that 'sleeping' with someone also has a reproductive interpretation.

finally, there might be reason to assume that with the increase in virtuality caused by ubiquitional computing the brain will develop into a more intelligent system because it can be decoupled from everyday survival necessities. this might occur faster than expected by 'genetics only' theories because there seem to be possibillities for [epigenetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epigenetics) effects on gene expression too.

the ironic thing is that it would be necessary for soldiers to become less focussed on surviving in order to increase their intelligence, because they would need to be free from direct survival tasks.

in december 1993, shakur was charged with sexually abusing a woman in his hotel room. according to the complaint, shakur sodomized the woman and then encouraged his friends to sexually abuse her. in sentencing shakur to one-and-a-half years in prison, the judge described the crime as ""an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman.


in 1994, he was convicted of attacking a former employer while on a music video set. he was sentenced to 15 days in jail with additional days on a highway work crew, community service, and a $2000 fine. in 1995, a wrongful death lawsuit was brought against shakur in the 1992 shooting of six-year-old qa'id walker-teal of marin city, california. the child had been the victim of a stray bullet in a shootout between tupac's entourage and a rival group, though the bullet was not from tupac's gun. criminal charges were not sought, and shakur settled with the family for an amount estimated between $300,000 and $500,000.[25][26] after serving part of his sentence on the sexual abuse conviction, he was released on bail pending his appeal. on april 5, 1996, a judge sentenced him to serve 120 days in jail for violating terms of probation.[27]",Riman34,2007-01-07 08:51:17,reddit.com,1,gay: sod

cxd45,t3_xd44,"15 ways to keep your speaking inspiring and creative
when stressed or blocked it is wise to make a change so thatwe don't stay in that place. yet, many times we forget someof the simple things that we can do for ourselves, quicklyand easily to bring our inspiration back and increase ourcreativity.

1. if you usually type your speech first, hand write them.nothing compares to seeing the ink mesh into the paper anddisplay what you created.

2. if you spend too much time at the computer, take a breakevery hour. go for a walk or just sit outside in the sun.even five minutes in a winter sun does wonders for a moodand creativity.

3. flip through magazines or books. their colors and ideaswill give you sparks and switch your attitude. blue andgreen can reduce your stress levels by 30% or more.

4. add strong smells to the room. light scented candlesaround you, visit the fruit isle at the grocery store, or goto a store that is heavily scented. find an orange orstrawberries and smell it. both will change a mood orcreate inspiration. smells awaken your creativity. smellstrigger memories and are a great method to rekindle storiesfrom the past.

5. go see or rent an inspirational movie. relaxation timeis important. watch the movie with a notebook and recordinspiring phases or ideas that pop in.

6. read a book on the topic that stirs and sparks yourcreativity. poetry can do the same.

7. look at bold and bright colors for a few minutes. thesechange your mood.

8. talk  
talk with a friend about your topic to flesh out ideas,titles, and content. tape-record the conversation so youdon't miss anything. you would be surprised at how much wethink we hear and how we actually do.

9. write an email to a friend to tell him or her what youwant to accomplish. if you are stuck, say so and ask forhelp.

10. check in with your vibrational energy and do somethingto switch it into high gear. take a shower. go for a walkor dance naked in the moonlight.

11. hire someone to transcribe your recording so that youcan stay focused on the creative end of the speaking.

12. authentic, flat-out, raw laughter frees the psyche andopens the creativity process.

13. find a setting with lots of trees and flowers and feelnature. if the weather permits, take off your shoes andsocks and feel the grass between your toes. nature has away of freeing our spirit to let the flow out of our bestmaterial.

14. if you are used to practicing your speak in a quietplace, create noise and practice. you will learn to speakwith distractions.

15. go for a quiet leisurely drive and practice your vowelsoutlook expand your voice range.

that was exciting, wasn't it? post this list in aconspicuous place so that it is readily available whenneeded. do one or two of these daily to keep your thoughtprocess clear and attracting. your audience is waiting.

""if someone says blacks are more dangerous to whites when compared to how men are dangerous to women you just blow that comment off"". i didn't comment because it wasn't the matter at hand. if you want a comment, my first response would - i hope - be the same of anyone with a grasp of scientific method. what are the specifics of the data you're quoting, are they directly comparable etc? and giving your numbers the benefit of the doubt (a dangerous thing to do on the internet when talking with someone who has already demonstrated their partisanship and inability to rise above it) before drawing conclusions on them i would ask if you have you ever heard of the difference between correlation and causation? ""of course cigarette smoke harms schoolchildren's exam results - children who smoke get lower scores.""

""blacks commit much more crimes against whites and as a whole are much more racist."" racism is bad - whoever is doing it. people teaching racism to the next generation - either explicitly or implcitly - are doubly bad and should be opposed. i don't know where you stand on this.

""you are enthused about this guy making his comments just like a parent gets pleased when a child does something right. you have such low expectations for black people that when one of them does something as simple as recognize a problem you get excited and say 'wow, look. a black man that has the right viewpoint.'"" - flat wrong. i applaud lack of partisanship wherever it shows itself. i'm pleased when politicians oppose their or their parties' interests on a matter of principle. i'm pleased when anyone who has been wronged is able to resist hating in return. i'm pleased whenever someone acts in a civilised way.

""he hasn't done anything that hasn't be done millions of other times by white people."" - if you mean speak out against hate crimes performed by people of the same race as you then yes. and that's good. but it's easier to do that when the ""boot is on your foot"", which is why this article is more newsworthy.

cxe2b,t3_xdhs,"this article should have started with *""there are many* **misconceptions** *about **credit** out there.""*

credit is not necessary. credit requires you, the debtor, to engage in a contract that will always be to your disadvantage.

credit can be used and leveraged, but most people don't use it properly and become debtors. 

credit card companies are some of the worst 'creditors' around and should be avoided at all costs.

the 'credit report' reveals whether or not you are a good security risk for borrowing money that isn't yours. there is no shame in having a poor credit report. my report probably looks pretty bad - i have no 'credit'.  but i also have no debt.  and i own my own house, cars, land, everything free and clear.  i accomplished this without credit, you can too. 
i save a huge amount in interest, late payments, overdraft fees and other extortion charges.

learning to live without credit is better then learning how to 'get credit'. learning to live within your means is better then learning to live beyond your means.  learning to avoid shysters and sharksters like banks, credit unions, creditors, credit card companies, and payday loans is far better then learning how to negotiate the legal maze of 'credit'.

credit perpetuates the fiat money, fractional reserve banking system that keeps everyone enslaved in this country and around the world. 

if 'credit' wasn't so 'advantageous' to the lender, don't you think they would put a stop to it?  that's what they do to you!  when you no longer become 'worthy', you're instantly shut down, even by creditors with whom you have a good standing with.

this 'old boy's club rules' means they stick together while sticking it to you.  like a gang of thieves, they make sure that you're under their collective thumb - or else!

or have you ever considered why they promote the idea of being a debtor so heavily?  the idea is to keep you paying, and paying, and paying, and paying, while you buy their useless junk and worthless products, ever running the treadmill of life and forever and ever in debt for a whole lot of things you don't need.

the interest you pay over a lifetime would probably pay for your retirement.  avoid the credit scams altogether and gain your life back.

i could care less about 'improving my credit score' because i will not enslave myself as an indentured servant to banks and credit card companies. if i cannot pay for it outright, then i do not need it.

don't beleive there is a tradeoff between pollution and prosperity? how many people own zero emissions electric cars in the us? they exist, why not own them? the answer comes down to money, hence the tradeoff.

if oil companies in nigeria are flaring off natural gas instead of bringing it to market, the author ought to have questioned why it was not cost effective to sell it. but if they did that then they'd have to admit the problem is with nigeria's government, not the oil companies and the evil of bill gates.

yes, aspartame does release minute amounts of methanol when cooked, but so do many foods. a can of tomatoes, a bottle of apple juice contain far more natural methanol than any recipe using aspartame. 

aspartame itself is a tripeptide, a short chain protein that  has the terminal carbonyl group methoxylated to resist hydrolysis. in the stomach and gut, the methoxy group is cleaved to form methanol, and the protein digested. 

many fruits and vegetables also contain methoxylated compounds, some of which are responsible for their flavor and odor, and these too are broken down into methanol. the levels of methanol produced in either case is safe enough to be handled by the liver and excreted.

those cases of supposed reactions to aspartame probably have a simple explanation, perhaps they suffer from other protein allergies, like wheat or milk. some people's guts are 'leaky' allowing short chain proteins into the blood stream where they provoke allergic reactions. it'd be interesting to see if purported aspartame 'reactions' are allergic in nature. but i seriously doubt it's the material itself that is toxic, any more so than wheat or milk.",CrusoethePainter,2007-01-07 16:47:47,reddit.com,8,gay: fruit

2. suing farmers that didn't buy monsanto seeds but just happened to have soil on the edge of their property germinated by seeds from the adjacent farmer that did buy monsanto seeds is very very wrong. look it up, they did that. and the farmer lost. it's like microsoft suing osx users for receiving spam containing windows serials/keys, sent by hijacked spyware-laden xp boxes. sure, you could say there is some value in it but you did not ask for it nor were you actively seeking it.

the argument that ""they don't have to buy"" doesn't hold in every market situation, especially in monopoly/oligopoly conditions. the fact that monsanto sells better seeds has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that their licensing agreements are atrocious.

providing a better product doesn't put a corporate above the law. things like this are precisely why govt. intervention is needed in corporate affairs. fcc banning a nip-slip on tv is useless meddling. ftc preventing monsanto from dictating whether farmers can reuse leftover seeds is useful intervention.",chime,2007-01-07 17:16:02,reddit.com,7,straight: het

you're probably talking about *monsanto canada inc. v. schmeiser* and if so, your description is deceptive.

the farmer was not a passive victim of wind, surprised to find himself in court. he specifically selected for plants that survived the season's spray, then saved and replanted only those seeds the following year, which is why nearly his entire field contained roundup ready crops (not merely ""soil on the edge of [his] property""). he tested his defiance in court and lost.

here a longer version of what i just said straight from the court documents:

""schmeiser never purchased roundup ready canola nor did he obtain a licence to plant it.  yet, in 1998, tests revealed that 95 to 98 percent of his 1,000 acres of canola crop was made up of roundup ready plants.  the origin of the plants is unclear.  they may have been derived from roundup ready seed that blew onto or near schmeiser’s land, and was then collected from plants that survived after schmeiser sprayed roundup herbicide around the power poles and in the ditches along the roadway bordering four of his fields. the fact that these plants survived the spraying indicated that they contained the patented gene and cell. the trial judge found that “none of the suggested sources [proposed by schmeiser] could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of roundup ready canola of a commercial quality” ultimately present in schmeiser’s crop ((2001), 202 f.t.r. 78, at para. 118).""

cxf3z,t3_xf3y,"five crucial components of a business plan

the format of a business plan is something that has been developed and refined over the years and is something that should not be changed. like a good recipe, a business plan needs to include certain ingredients to make it work.

when you create a business plan, don't attempt to recreate its format. those reviewing this type of document have expectations you must meet. if they do not see those crucial decision-making components, they'll see no reason to proceed with their review of your business plan, no matter how great your business idea.

executive summary section

every business plan must begin with an executive summary section. a well-written executive summary is critical to the success of the rest of the document. here is where you need to capture the attention of your audience so that they will be compelled to read on. remember, it's a summary, so each and every word must be carefully selected and presented.

use the executive summary section of your business plan to accurately describe the nature of your business venture including the need that you plan to fill. show the reasons why people need your product or service. show this by including a brief analysis of the characteristics of your potential market.

describe the organization of your business including your management team. also, briefly describe your sales and marketing plan or approach. finally include the numbers that those reviewing your business plan want to see - the amount of capital you seek, the carefully calculated sales projections and your plan to repay the loan.

if you've captured your audience so far they'll read on. otherwise, they'll close the document and add your business plan to the heap of other rejected ideas.

devote the balance of your business plan to providing details of the items outlined in the executive summary.

the business section

be sure to include the legal name, physical address and detailed description of the nature of your  
of your business. it's important to keep the description easy to read using common terminology. never assume that those reading your business plan have the same level of technical knowledge that you do. describe how you plan to better serve your market than your competition is currently doing.

market analysis section

an analysis of the market shows that you have done your homework. this section is basically a summary of your marketing plan. it needs to show the demand for your product or service, the proposed market, trends within the industry, a description of your pricing plan and packaging and a description of your company policies.

financing section

the financing section must show that you are as committed to your business venture as you expect those reading your business plan to be. show the amount of personal funds you are contributing and their source. also include the amount of capital you need and your plan to repay this debt. include all pertinent financial worksheets in this section: annual income projections, a break-even worksheet, projected cash flow statements and a balance sheet.

management section

outline your organizational structure and management team here. include the legal structure of your business whether it is a partnership, corporation or limited liability corporation. include resumes and biographies of key players on your management team. show staffing projection data for the next few years.

by now you're probably thinking that you don't need business plan just yet. well you do, and there is business plan building software that can help you through this immense project. these software packages are easy to use and affordable. use one today and produce a professional-quality business plan - including all critical components - tomorrow!

&gt;in fact israel may have similar opinions on iran, and that is valid. that is not war

israel-iran's conflict is far more than ""differnet opinions"". claiming that simply reveals amazing ignorance. iran's leaders are very open about being at war with israel. the war in lebanon this summer, for example, was between israel and hezbollah which is essentially run by iran.

israel is, undeniably by anyone with slightest grasp of facts, largely secular. it allows gay marriage, for example. the claim jews originally come from israel isn't based on torah, it's based on history. i'm pretty amazed you don't know that. 

regarding ""jewish state"", many countries in europe are christian. does that make them fundamentalist or racist?

&gt;its native palestinians (christian, muslims, or atheist) have no right

again, bullshit. all natives of israel - jews, arabs, druze or christian - have equal citizenship. if you're referring to the palestinians in the west bank, they have citizenship of the palestinain authority and they vote in democractic elections for the pa (something no other arab country's citizens get to do, btw)

&gt;a jew, born any where in the world, gets right to citizenship

that's true. because israel was founded when jews were persecuted, so it passed this law to serve as haven for them. non-jews do get citizenship in israel, passing certain criteria - just like any other country.

cxfjl,t1_cxe8r,"&gt; i'm not sure what you mean by memory management functionality in raii, though. to me the essence of raii is that you can setup destructors without explicitly calling them.

you'll find this feature (object finalization) in just about any oo-flavored languages;  raii is a bit more special.

specifically:  the problem with piggybacking external resource deallocation on top of object finalization in most languages is that tracing gc implementations don't give you any assurance about when, or even whether, objects will get finalized.  this is fine for a resource like memory, but a disaster for scarce/expensive resources like file handles or database transactions.

raii only comes in when you *can* rely on timely object finalization, such as when using stack-based allocation or (as blugill pointed out) reference-counting.  (note, in particular, that this means you can't use raii together with tracing gc libraries for c++.)

&gt; i haven't looked at the other mechanisms, but from a skim of the custodian system it seems you have to explicitly call custodian-shutdown-all.

well, the idea behind of custodians is that they're constructed in a hierarchy, mirroring the structure of your application, so that you only have to worry about deallocation where it's natural to do so.  for example, a web application would only need to shut down the top-level custodians of each request or session (when they complete/fail/timeout) to take care of all its subordinate resources;  most of the code need not worry about anything.   (the idea is quite similar to [apr's memory pools](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.2/svn.developer.pools.html).)

&gt; the lisp languages don't have destructors, do they?

they certainly do!  they're just not useful for the raii idiom, as explained above.

&gt; having deterministic deacquisition without having to explicitly orchestrate it every single time is a good thing.

indeed it is, which is why `with`-block syntaxes let you declare deallocation for the same price as the corresponding allocation.

&gt; increasing [the level of indentation](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/%7eakkartik/feed.cgi?lisp.html#bind) just because i want to acquire a resource (create an object) seems unnecessary.

\*shrug\*

personally, i much prefer having resources' lifetimes explicitly reflected by code nesting, instead of being hidden.  (this is in sharp contrast with your nice `bind` macro, which removes nesting that is indeed superfluous.)

&gt; or is it that raii requires a type declaration?

cxfk3,t1_cxfc9,"you are mixing apples and oranges: indentation of code is a distinct problem from alignment of code.  indentation deals with structuring logical blocks of code; alignment deals with the aesthetics of lists, comments, and other unstructured items.  rather than trying to assign both duties to a single character, it would seem best to use two: one (tab) for logical indentation, and the other (space) for aesthetic alignment.  this gives a one-to-one correspondence of each character to its intended effect (each tab adds one nesting level, each space adds one character of padding).  because in this scheme, spaces are never used to align to tabs or vice-versa, proper visual formatting is preserved no matter what tab stops are used.",colanderman,2007-01-07 22:01:58,programming,5,"straight: het, straight: het"
cxflb,t1_cxf36,"see my reply below to ubernostrum... the solution (which you point out in your second sentence) is especially obvious with python.  tabs should be used to indent blocks of code, spaces to align lists.  taking your example:

    tab          223409982349823,
    tab          34250923450238923]:
    tab tab print 'y'

this code will look correct no matter what tab stops are used, because tabs are not used for aesthetic alignment (which is not their purpose).

of course the first reply to my message will be ""but mixed tabs/spaces is even worse!!!""  i assert that it is not.  the display of mixed tabs/spaces, used in the above fashion, will never be incorrect.  the entry of mixed tabs/spaces, provided the programmer observes the simple rule above, will always be correct.  only the transmission of mixed tabs/spaces in brain-damaged media (e.g. the body of an outlook express e-mail) suffers.  naturally, this can be fixed trivially by a pretty-printer (such as emacs in your example above).

cxfpt,t3_xeqt,"&gt;i've long wondered when americans were going to snap out of this multi-culti trance we're all in[.]

&gt;my only question is what will it finally take to see a final end for race-based reward systems?

maybe it will take our culture getting over its ridiculous racial issues.  i understand that plenty of folks here who live in progressive communities think that the obvious way to do this is just to discourage all discussion of race and assume that a colorblind society will result -- and if it doesn't, it's a clear indication of the merit of each race.  it will be nice when we can do that, but speaking as someone from the deep south, i don't think we're anywhere near that point yet around here.  

the country is still full of people, kids in the newest generation, who have ridiculous ideas about them colored folk.  i worked at a state park with a bunch of guys who would see black toddlers in the parking lots and they'd talk about how nice it would be if you could just run them over instead of stopping.  they debated whether it would be okay to overlook halle barry's moon cricket blood and fuck her (the consensus was maybe, but only because she's so hot).  

these people are an extreme.  at least, i sure hope they are.  but these were casual attitudes.  these people didn't think twice about all this.  we're not gonna have a colorblind society until some sense is smacked into them.  i wasn't crazy about the idea of affirmative action before i worked at that park.  now i'm in favor of any policy that will try to smack some sense into those folks.  the informal hiring policy atht epark, i was told, was that they don't hire women because they don't want to have problems with sexual harassment.  they don't hire blacks because they don't want to have racial tension.  screw that.  

i understand that a lot of you live in nice places and think everyone else should be similarly sensible, but society has a long way to go, and i am in favor of trying to force some sense into people for at least another generation or two.  any policy that makes the fuckers i worked with work alongside other americans who aren't the same color as them is fine with me.  i understand this isn't really the situation at colleges, but i just want to suggest that there's still a lot more to this race thing than us enlightened bloggers recognize.  i don't know about other parts of the country, but i'd be happy with mandatory affirmative action south of the mason-dixon line and east of texas.

on a happier note, five of the fifteen students in my differential equations class were sassy black women, and they kicked my ass on the exams.  so maybe things are looking up.

oh, and to the folks who keep bring up ""would you go to a black doctor, thinking that he might've gotten help from aa?"" obviously, you do what you can to make an intelligent guess about the doctor's qualifications, and then you pick the absolute best person you can.  making race the focus of the question makes it sound like that's the first thing you're taking into account, and that in turn suggests that you're spending a lot of your attention trying to make generalizations from race.  there are a lot of people (eric s. raymond, for example) who are very interested in finding statistical race/iq connections, and while obviously we can't force our political ideas on the real world -- data is data -- the obsession over race seems to me an indicator of shoddy thinking and some **a priori** prejudices looking for a rationalization.

in any given year, x amount of wealth is produced, to be split between all of us.  if the value of x (the size of the pie) does not increase when the share given to a particular person increases, then the extra part of his share is just coming out of somebody else's pocket. 

the fact that the sum increases every year doesn't mean it's not a zero-sum game for any given time period.

china had millions of people literally starve to death under communism. mao finally died in 1978, and they were fortunate enough to get a leader who understood something about creating wealth. since 1978 their gdp per captia has exapanded almost 8-fold, an astonishing statistic. this has brought most of the chinese out of third world definition poverty, as well as bringing many much further up the income ladder. starvation there has ended, as well as many other forms of privation being radically reduced. and this process is not stopping.

at the same time, china has a huge pollution problem. they made the tradeoff between having pollution and having starvation as well as all kinds of other misery associated with deep poverty. i believe they made the correct tradeoff, as do the majority of the chinese (the relevant opinion).

over the decades, a per capita gdp (ppp adjusted of course, non-adjusted is economic ignorance and rather pointless) of about $10,000 is where countries have tended to trade off economic growth for pollution abatement. (yes virginia, as everywhere in life, there is a tradeoff). in essence, the first ~$10,000 in per capita gdp citizens as a group feel the gains from spending money on alleviating non-pollution problems outweigh the gains from lower pollution.

since this is pretty much what all western countries have gone through, as well as more newly developed countries, it is pretty arrogant for anyone in a rich country to tell people that starvation and misery are better than pollution. it is up to each country to make its own tradeoffs, not for imperialistic busybodies to make the decisions for them.

cxi7v,t1_cx38i,"&gt; java always requires boilerplate code. lots of.

no it doesn't. while every langauge has some boilerplate code, that is unavoidable, java is far worse than it needs to be because of design choices of the framework authors.

a lot of complexity in java could be reduced by not spending so much time on trying to make ""extendable"" code. a lot of programmers, especially but not solely in java, has this notion that classes can never be altered. this results in downright nonsensical design patterns like dependency injection via xml config files. 

i think it is always important to show the boilerplate code so that everyone realizes what it is. then you can start asking hard questions about the need for specific extension points.

quite often it will be found that not only the extension point and related boilerplate code isn't necessary, it is downright harmful and results in far less flexable solutions.

case in point, using config files for dependency injection. say you can use class x in implementation a or b. if you use a config file, it is easy to switch between a and b without recompiling. you can even introduce a previously unknown implementation c. but this makes the solution far less flexable because you cannot use both a and b in the same project.

microsoft burned us in .net 2.0's xml serialization. when the behaviour changed, they didn't offer a programatic way to decide which to use. the only option is a application-wide config file. this makes it impossible to write applications that need to use both methods.

&gt; do you really suggest that it's better to use a overly complicated, less extendable pattern like 'interpreter' - which has no boilerplate code? 

i define overly complicated as needing excessive boilerplate code. 

as for extendablity, i think that is usually a fools errand. as long as you have the source code, a program can usually be extended from the inside with less effort.

&gt; or do you suggest that we all abandon java right here and now and switch over to haskell, because haskell allows for nice concise code? 

of course not. unless language x offers a vastly superior solution to your current problems with language y, i think efforts should be on improving y.",grauenwolf,2007-01-08 12:19:39,programming,-1,"gay: boi, gay: boi, gay: boi, gay: boi, gay: boi, gay: boi"
cxid3,t1_cxi06,"i think it was a tradeoff that he almost got right.  the number of permutations of a 6 element list is 720.  since when you talk about permutations, you're pretty much referring to unique sequences, and since we know a priori that there is a duplicate in the sequence, it'd probably be a good idea to not return those results (which he missed doing).  a correct implementation of permutation would return only 360 results for the given list.

at that point you look at the constraints and see that you can expect to toss out on the order of 5! results due to rule 1 and 1/5 of the results because of rule 2.  the cost of doing this would be to no longer have a ""permutation"" function, or at least not a succinct one.  since the number of results to be rejected doesn't change the fact that this is an o(n!) algorithm, that's probably not a decent trade.  in fact, it's the difference between iterating over 198 results and 360, numbers which grow factorially with one another.",inkieminstrel,2007-01-08 12:51:58,programming,1,"gay: trade, gay: trade"
cxie0,t1_cxhbl,"well i see what you are driving at, but occam's razor takes it from a different direction.  here is the definition from wikepedia:

""occam's razor states that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible, eliminating, or ""shaving off"", those that make no difference in the observable predictions of the explanatory hypothesis or theory. in short, when given two equally valid explanations for a phenomenon, one should embrace the less complicated formulation. the principle is often expressed in latin as the lex parsimoniae (law of succinctness):

    entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem,

which translates to:

    entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity.

this is often paraphrased as ""all things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one."" in other words, when multiple competing theories are equal in other respects, the principle recommends selecting the theory that introduces the fewest assumptions and postulates the fewest hypothetical entities. it is in this sense that occam's razor is usually understood.""",beowulf,2007-01-08 12:56:31,reddit.com,1,straight: het
cxiek,t1_cxfyc,"er, hmm. which problems do you consider unanswered there? i'll give a few remarks, and perhaps you can bullet point a few of the concerns which you're still looking for answers to.

regarding adding a piece of state to your design late in the game, i would say that this *shouldn't* be an easy thing to do. it's something which can fundamentally change the contracts of functions, as you pointed out, and hence should not be an easy change to make. doing it correctly is something which does, and always will, require some thought. 

i don't think that it should be possible for monadic code to look the same as pure code. pure code doesn't have any way to describe the order of computation, but the order in which actions occur is very important. (which is one of the reasons we're using the monadic abstraction in the first place.) it's been argued that some special syntax might be better than do-notation for the special case of commutative monads. while this is true, i'd still want to avoid allowing it to look like pure code. the assumptions which can be made about pure code are very different from those which can be made about code in general commutative monads. referential transparency is still pretty much gone, for instance.

in a similar vein to the first point about adding state later on in development, monadic refactorisation isn't something which should be taken lightly. monads are effectively embedded domain-specific languages. if you change the monad you're using, it's a bit like changing your programming language. you can rewire things to change the meaning of code almost endlessly.

however, there are quite often nice ways to make the changes orthogonal to one another so that largely you don't have to change the code which is using the monad, but this really depends on the changes you're making. adding a new piece of state should not be an issue if you've done things correctly. unfortunately, i don't think many of the tutorials really express the right way to do things.

for the record, here's the right way to construct and use a new monad for your application, and should apply unless you really have something special going on.

1. use monad transformers to get the basic bits of functionality you want, building up a monad with a rich enough set of operations.
2. but don't use the type raw, wrap it in a newtype. leaving this step out is a subtle mistake which is quite popular, and which the design of the present monad transformer libraries actually can help you make in some ways. it's *always* better when using monad transformers to wrap the resulting type with a newtype declaration, and use the newtype-deriving extension to derive functor, monad, and potentially other classes you need.
3. stop, don't derive all the classes. things like monadstate and such are very general. you can often get lots more safety, and later, more comfortable extensibility by simply wrapping up things like get and put and not exposing the underlying monadstate interface from outside the module in which you're constructing the monad. in this way, you can introduce consistency checks -- for instance, in a state-transformed nondeterminism monad, you can cause attempts to change the state in inconsistent ways to automatically backtrack. this is extremely useful for [solving puzzles](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/sudoku) and other discrete optimisation problems.

so, you define a bunch of operations, quite often operations which do various things to the state parameters available, and maybe even ensure various consistency properties.

you write a bunch of code using this new monad, and then decide that *oops*, you need another state parameter. now you don't have to worry all that much. you alter the definition of your monad, perhaps adding another statet, and add any necessary lifting to the definitions of your other basic operations, and then define your new operations on that state. the rest of the code outside the module your monad is defined in keeps on working, because it's defined only in terms of the old operations, whose semantics haven't changed.

i really should put this technique somewhere so that i can point people at it. it's slowly gaining acceptance, and one sees it more and more in code. one might be tempted to ask whether it might be appropriate to extend haskell with features which make this sort of thing even easier to do. (it's currently not all that hard, once you get the general idea of it.) well, the truth is that it might be a good idea in the end, as one begins to see an idiom forming. programming idioms are almost always signs of things which the compiler or libraries ought to be doing for you. 

however, there are lots of good reasons not to do it yet. monad transformers already wrap one idiom, and it's nice to see that our existing abstractions are enough to express these sorts of ideas. secondly, monad transformers and the mtl haven't been around very long yet, and there are indeed other ways to solve the problems that they solve. it's probably worth thinking about some more before turning it directly into a language feature.

however, monad transformers are a better solution to the problem than most people give them credit for. the automatic composition of programming languages is not an easy problem by any means. at the very least, the mtl approach provides lots of flexibility. one can turn out [new](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/new_monads/monadrandom) [monad](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/new_monads/monadsupply) [transformers](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/new_monads/monadundo) from old rather quickly.

cxixw,t1_cxi00,"a lot of people seem to misunderstand why the graphics look the way they do.

the entire world is streamed to the user.  everything is editable.  this precludes a lot of complex geometry and lighting tricks (although you can pre-bake your own lighted textures, but lightmaps ala quake 3 are another matter).  keep in mind this was released in 2003, in development from around 2000.  per-pixel lighting just wasn't an option.

the client download is small.  other mmo games have a massive amount of data on a cds or a dvd and the areas are static.  second life is completely dynamic and so there are trade-offs.  it may look primitive -- that's because everything is made from primitives in constructive solid geometry style.

at some point the graphics will get an upgrade (i'm guessing sooner rather than later seeing as the client can now be modified directly), but increasing complexity also increases barrier to entry (needing a full-on 3d modelling program and skills) and increases bandwidth requirements.

this google tech talk from march 2006 describes a good deal of technical info in detail: clients average 13-14k of data received per second, but it can jump much higher when entering a new area; sl averages a gigabit of data per second going out to all clients which would've put them out of business if they'd have tried it five years before, but bandwidth costs are much cheaper now.  in the past few months sl has grown significantly so they may be up to 2-4 gbit/sec these days.

cxl1i,t1_cxks9,"&gt;it's one thing to force people to have driving insurance, to protect other people on the road in case you hit them, but it doesn't follow that the government is right to force anyone to have personal insurance.

so it doesn't endanger other people if a guy working in the kitchen of a restaurant is sick but can't afford to see a doctor or miss work? what about the homeless man he shares the bus with? if taxpayers will end up footing his bill when he crawls into the emergency room near death from an ordinary infection because he hasn't seen a doctor, does it not cost us more than treating him cheaply with antibiotics before it got this bad? this doesn't even account for the hundreds of (likely uninsured) people who rode on the bus with him. a [smart guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ben_franklin) once said ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of the cure"".

another [smart guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_donne) once said ""any man's death diminishes me, because i am involved in mankind."" we agree with that sentiment so we don't just let people die because they can't pay. right now, anyone who is ill or in labor can walk into their local county general hospital and receive treatment, regardless of their citizenship, whether they have the means to pay for it or not. those who won't be able to pay will be left with massive bills, financially ruined, and basically forced to declare bankruptcy. the hospital will write off the cost and it will be made up for by raising the costs for insured customers and probably some form of money from the government.

so the system **already incurs** the cost of taking care of the uninsured, that cost is just increased because the uninsured are less inclined to seek treatment until severely afflicted. meanwhile, the uninsured's already dismal life of poverty and poor health gets worse.

i agree, though, that forcing people to buy insurance sucks. this is an attempt at socialized medicine while keeping the insurance industry alive and happy. the most efficient thing would be to eliminate the insurance companies and replace them with a very open and transparent public system.",[deleted],2007-01-09 01:59:43,reddit.com,5,straight: het

i think it was because the rulers deemed it necessary to define reality. of course reality could never be defined in a way that criticized the ruling class. now that the internet is clearing all these power relations up for us by making it all visible in real time, we should start asking ourselves if this professor is  some really knowledgeable man who has suffered from the decrease in the intellectual climate or whether he is some statically typed compiler designer with an axe to grind because reality has cought up with him.

what is real and what is not? the solution seems to be something along the lines of [paul feyerabend](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paul_feyerabend): ""the idea that science should be separated from the state in the same way that religion and state are separated in a modern secular society"".

yes, i am as afraid as the next guy that ""intelligent design"" might take over science (at least the groups id is currently associated with horrify me) but if there's any doubt that science has the potential to act like scientology or like the religious clergy see for example the [piltdown man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piltdown_man) or more recently [john money's](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/ts/ts.html) ideas about ""surgically correcting"" the genitals of intersex infants to make them ""normal"".

is programming at a basic level really important anymore? do we still add numbers without using calculators? luckily the internet opens up all kinds of roads for young people to engage themselves with the things they find interesting, and instead of trying to make them fit our standards we should encourage them to find out for themselves, only giving guidance when explicitly asked. this will surely be a major reform away from the traditional testing and grading methods.",MosaSaur,2007-01-09 08:15:20,reddit.com,0,straight: het

cxmjv,t3_xkwc,"&gt; if you use classes to imply application functionality, you cannot tell at a glance if your class is defined in css as a style, or a facet of your application-specific code.

it's neither.  classes are defined in your html.  they differentiate elements into different groupings.

it is true that those groupings can then be used by you for different purposes such as styling or scripting, but that is beside the point.  it is (meant to be) first and foremost semantic information about the contents of your document.

if you are bothered that this information can be used in multiple ways, then you should be equally bothered about the id attribute and the fact that there are multiple element types in the first place.

but somehow, the sky hasn't fallen, despite the id attribute being usable by both css and scripts.  where are all the developers that get confused when they see id=""foo"" and demand to be told whether it's used by css or by scripts?  where are the problems caused by getelementsbytagname in scripts being confused with the element type name being used in css selectors?

it seems to me that this is merely a response by somebody who was under the impression ""classes are for css"", was unsettled to find out that they are used for other things too, and wants to find an excuse so he can put them back in the css-only box.  no.  they were never in that box to begin with, and it's not useful to stuff them in there.

&gt; why are we taking a step backwards, by putting application logic inside of something most web developers associate with being a visual characteristic?

it's not a step backwards because if it is true that most web developers think that classes are a visual characteristic (he never provides evidence to back this claim up), then most web developers are *wrong*.

&gt; as an example, here we can iterate through input elements, which are to be sub-totaled.

in my experience, this is a contrived example that isn't found in the real world.  i've worked on plenty of web applications that deal with money, and guess how many of them worked the way he describe?  **none**.  why?  because it's a hassle to keep typing in the currency symbol and commas when they simply aren't necessary, and once you do away with that issue, the problem he has disappears.

it is also true that you can extend xhtml.  it is *not* true that you can extend xhtml in the way this article describes - at least not according to the specifications.  you have the option of using xhtml modules.  you have the option of using a namespace.  you have the option of using a different document type.  in all three cases, the result should not be served as text/html, rendering it useless if you cater to internet explorer users.

now i'm not saying that the technique is totally worthless.  what i am saying is that it's simply a case of *""look, i found an invalid shortcut for the rare cases in which xhtml is not sufficient, and it worked in the browsers i tried it in""*.  i don't think that's a robust design strategy, especially when there are alternatives that *do* work according to spec.",Bogtha,2007-01-09 10:21:31,programming,1,straight: het

every person can implement drastic carbon savings on their own. but in a (at least outwardly) capitalist economy, competition acts as a suppressant on this ability. if i stop driving, but few others do, then i do not gain better mass transit, which is the trade-off required to keep things ""working"". in the end, i would expend large amounts of energy and time biking, walking, and/or finding the crap-ass bus routes to work. this leaves less time for sleeping and being with my family, etc, in an already time-compressed society to begin with.

maybe one solution is to allow people to pay *others* to do this. how many liberal philanthrope wannabes would actually put $50 a month towards paying someone *else* for their time and energy requried to stop driving? $10?

we've already seen some of this in practice, with energy sponsorships allowing people who don't have access to solar power the ability to buy ""credits"" in other parts of the country, allowing solar power to produce grid units *there*. hell, in some [places](http://www.ncgreenpower.org/) you can even ""give the gift"" of ""green power"":

cxn03,t1_cxmde,"&gt; the basic operation is abstract enough that it doesn't
&gt; much matter whether it is called 'fold' or 'inject'.

once i understood what the function was doing, i didn't find it abstract.

coming to the function as a clean slate, ""inject"" tells me nothing intuitively about what it does. ""fold"" is a little better. ""accumulate"" or ""snowball"" i think would capture it much more succinctly.

i understood haskell's folds before i came across the ""inject"" wording. when i saw it being used, i studiously worked out what it was doing (i assumed it was injecting things into an array) and eventually said, ""oh, it's just foldl."" if it was named ""accumulate"" i bet i would have made the connection right away.

cxnem,t1_cxi7v,"especially visitors are very good usable code. i have to write some (quite easy and straightforward) boilerplate stuff and get much shorter and better readable code elsewhere.

just look at the interpreter class above: its much more readable than distributing the functionality all over the different expr-subclasses. and if i want to create other kinds of tree walkers (like a pretty printer or compilation steps) i can reuse the visitor boilerplate code.

there are *good* and *bad* ways of using certain patterns. dependency injection via xml files is a bad one imo too. but otoh it would be stupid to throw away all patterns only because they can be misused. 

and visitors can be misused, too. if i write a complete visitor if i know that the problem remains simple, than a visitor would be stupid. if the example above is all the program has to do, my solution would be a bad one, because it is to complicated. but especially in the field of interpreter and compiler creation the above is only a short part of the whole. in all my experiences in this field i needed many different tree walkers and in most situations even the second one makes the visitor pattern an advantage.

but that's the problem with short examples: they may look stupid or elegant - and in a real situation it will be  exactly the opposite around.

and: i've said, that i can implement visitors without the mentioned boilerplate, just with a few lib-functions i wrote some years ago. they simply use reflection to look up the right accept method in the code and so you don't need to care about it.

this is the code for a simple version of the idea (no production code, my real one is a bit bigger an does some more things):

\tpublic class visitor
\t{
\t\tpublic visitor() {
\t\t\tcl = this.getclass();

\t\tpublic void visit(object parm) {

in addition, for the power grid to stay up, nearly every power station would need to remain safe and sufficiently staffed to run. otherwise, the grid will try to suck all the power it can from those still running, eventually bringing down the whole thing.

best solution, if you are really wanting power that badly, is to be by a hydroelectric dam, preferably in canada, so it is easier to flee north where its cold (and since we all know zombies dont have a beating heart or flowing blood, they will freeze). oh, also, apparently hydroelectric dams have the greatest chance of operating properly without, well, operators (taken from zsg, dont remember what backed it up though).",treetree888,2007-01-09 13:46:20,reddit.com,0,straight: straight
cxnlj,t1_cxiek,"thank you for your long answer (even if the question wasn't directed at you, but to slawa who is good in insulting others but lacks in providing useful informations himself).

&gt;regarding adding a piece of state to your design late in the game, i would say that this shouldn't be an easy thing to do. it's something which can fundamentally change the contracts of functions, as you pointed out, and hence should not be an easy change to make. 

i know that this is the idea of the concept. but it makes some things quite hard. this is not a problem if the things which are getting hard are avoidable of at least very seldom, but this is not the case here. so having to rewrite a huge part of a program if you discover a slight mistake you made earlier is simply a problem. it could be solved my some automatic refactoring tools thou - but i'm not aware of the existence of those tools.

i've used your 3-steps approach in my programs. i've even 'discovered' this myself. using new types with at least constraints as possible is nothing which is limited to haskell (but it can quite nice expressed in the language so it's even better to use).

but it don't helps if i have to transform some 'pure' code into 'do-form'. and if i want to reuse code which is in this 'pure' form, i sometimes have to rewrite it, because lifting isn't always possible (like in the set.filter example). this is a very bad situation. and yes, i really understand the reasons for this problem, they are good and valid - but that makes the problem less worse!

btw: using simple backtracking for solving puzzles is imo a typical case of 'toy-example'. in a real application this may work too, but often it's simply to slow and we need to write a better customized algorithmic solution instead of simply using a general backtracking approach. 

this is one of the problems i have with the haskell community: they provide lots of examples which really looks great - but if you want to use something like this in real code you often discover that it's not that simple and concise anymore and that it kills performance for any real application. while this can make people make curious about the language, it can also create a bug letdown if someone tries to use this for real and not only in toy code. the higher the expectations someone creates, the bigger is the disappointment if they aren't fulfilled later.


as i wrote otherwhere that i consider code reuse as the prime (and almost single) reason for productivity in general (there are special situation in which this don't holds but those are rare exceptions). to allow code reuse, we need to be able to put different pieces of code together without having to write lots of boilerplate code or even have to rewrite or refactor one of the pieces. in my past experiences code reuse works very well in haskell if it's all 'pure' code - and very bad in the moment you have to mix pure code with monadic one. 

this really annoys me. writing pure haskell code often works so well and while not be as concise as proposed can really make a 2-3 times win compared to java - which is a lot. i would abandon java instantly (for the projects where it's possible of course, i still can't avoid using java because of non-technical constraints) even if i find a language which could give me a 1.5-2 times gain. but in haskell the advantage in conciseness, clarity and also in the beauty of code is history in the moment i have to use mutable state somewhere. that's really pesky.

i think it's impossible in the moment to solve this problem - and maybe it will be unsolvable in the future. you gave a reason for this: ""monads are effectively embedded domain-specific languages."". this leads to the main problem with dsls and the reason why i've abandoned this concept as useful: it make the composition of programs from pieces much more difficult (and maybe even impossible) in the moment those pieces aren't written in the same dsl. because of this the productivity advantage we've gained from the dsl by allowing for faster to implement solutions to certain problems vanish because we can't reuse existing code in new projects anymore. i wrote an article about (this)[http://kawagner.blogspot.com/2006/09/disadvantages-of-user-extensible.html], but i suspect i wasn't able to make my points really clear, considering the 'judgment' of the reddit readers (up votes 8, down votes 10).",kawa,2007-01-09 13:50:14,programming,0,gay: boi

cxoeg,t1_cxl1i,"""so it doesn't endanger other people if a guy working in the kitchen of a restaurant is sick but can't afford to see a doctor or miss work? what about the homeless man he shares the bus with? if taxpayers will end up footing his bill when he crawls into the emergency room near death from an ordinary infection because he hasn't seen a doctor, does it not cost us more than treating him cheaply with antibiotics before it got this bad? this doesn't even account for the hundreds of (likely uninsured) people who rode on the bus with him. a smart guy once said ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of the cure"".""

how is the fact that the guy working in a kitchen and has insurance going to affect that he is sick?  he's still sick even if he's got insurance.  if he can't afford to miss work, the fact that he's got insurance means nothing.   if anything, he's going to be less inclined to miss work because he's got a huge monthly insurance bill to pay now too.

antibiotics or other medicine might cure the guy, but if he is still working, he's still spreading it.  how often do you stay home from work simply because you are sick?  most people end up going in to work rather than waste limited sick days.  you're also making the assumption that he'd figure out he's sick and go see the doctor.

all those people who rode on the bus with him aren't ""likely insured"".  i had insurance at one job and i still rode the bus.  in fact, pretty much everyone on the bus were dressed in styles that looked like office workers, and were probably insured.

""another smart guy once said ""any man's death diminishes me, because i am involved in mankind."" we agree with that sentiment so we don't just let people die because they can't pay. right now, anyone who is ill or in labor can walk into their local county general hospital and receive treatment, regardless of their citizenship, whether they have the means to pay for it or not. those who won't be able to pay will be left with massive bills, financially ruined, and basically forced to declare bankruptcy. the hospital will write off the cost and it will be made up for by raising the costs for insured customers and probably some form of money from the government.""

well, you obviously missed the people who have insurance and are still ruined financially.  i know several people from one job that provided heavy medical insurance but the medical costs outweighed the insurance by several hundred thousand.  one couple had a daughter with cancer and a bill that ran over a million.  the medical insurance didn't save them.  these kinds of bills aren't especially rare either.

mandatory health insurance isn't going to solve these problems.  it's just a poor bandaid over a bigger problem.

""i agree, though, that forcing people to buy insurance sucks. this is an attempt at socialized medicine while keeping the insurance industry alive and happy. the most efficient thing would be to eliminate the insurance companies and replace them with a very open and transparent public system.""

yes, i agree with you that this is an attempt at socialized medicine and appeasing the insurance industry.  

the horrible costs of medical care can at least partly be traced to insurance though.  when hospitals have to raise their profits by doing unnecessary testing because those will be paid, while limiting necessary testing because those won't be paid, you know it's a problem.

i really hate the idea that the medical insurance industry can have so much control over our care.  this plan to make it mandatory will merely give them more control.

if we never had the medical insurance industry in the first place, our medical care for basic care wouldn't be so high.  $40 for a bar of soap wouldn't happen.",nosoupforyou,2007-01-09 16:37:01,reddit.com,0,straight: het

the higherups might just be trying to resolve the matter by moving on, essentially telling the cops to be quiet and let it go away. yet, that leaves the citizen feeling rather  violated and pissed off, justifiably.
 
sometimes it might only take a few seconds for a policeman to give a civilized explanantion and everyone would be happy.

how long do yu think it will take to have a culture shift to reduce emissions by 50%? it would most likely take 10-20 years, because we have had this lifestyle for so long.

all you see is the first 1.3 million people. that happens every year and those people have kids. if us immigration would have been left at 200,000 in the 1960's our population now would be less than 220 million and decreasing. that is a difference in emmissions of 25%, with less emissions made each year. now let's look ahead even further. at that point if we had sound immigration policy that kept population steady at 220 million we would still have 220 million people in 2040, but instead we are having mass immigration that will push us to 400 million people in the year 2040. now were talking about a difference of 81%, and there isn't a single way possible that us emmissions will drop 81% with a world catastrophe.

we can't change the poor policies decided in the 1960's and 1980's, but changing immigration policy now to a sustainable  policy will prevent the us population from increasing to 400 million in 2040, instead it would hit around 350 million people.

what annoys me is you are 100% incapable of grasping that pollution is closely tied  to population. you also can't grasp that 1.3 million a year is a tremendous number and that number rises drastically when you consider it over 10 years and that immigrants average nearly 3 kids per woman. you also seem to think that while energy consumption in america was 334 million  btu/person and is currently 337 million btu/person that we can wave a magic wand and suddenly change things.

a culture shift is not an easy task. it needs to be done along with reducing the population. but to say we can ignore population and keep doing culture shifts and hoping to find new technologies to save us is shear ignorance.

we never said the problem was immigration, we said the problem is the population size. the population growth is the fault of immigration.

&gt;
&gt; if your data is strictly sequential; you should use a regular array. if your data is often sequential, or approximately sequential (e.g. an arithmetic sequence stepping by 64), judy might be the best data structure to use. if you need to keep space to a minimum--you have a huge number of associative arrays, or you're only storing very small values, judy is probably a good idea. if you need an sorted iterator, go with judy. otherwise, a hash table may be just as effective, possibly faster, and much simpler. 

...

&gt; of course, you can certainly take the attitude that judy performs well enough, and the fact that it's 20,000 lines of code doesn't really matter, as long as those lines of code work and you never have to look at them--and it appears judy is mature enough that this is the case.

anyway, i agree with you.  the real cost of this in the future is not taken into account, for the most part.  right now, there are environmental mitigation factors for any company.  anyone that has to pay to dispose of potentially hazardous waste (tvs, batteries, etc.) experiences this.  but those are cleanup costs only.  

aside from land titles/rights it doesn't cost them anything to take more resource out of the ecosystem.  it usually doesn't cost them anything to displace wildlife, destroy green space, destroy wetland buffer zones, etc.  conservationalists have tried to make these things cost companies something and to restrict damaging activity, but whenever they are successful, the companies in question just operate elsewhere.  the net effect isn't less damage, it's just distributed more.  

i've often thought our economy would be perfect if the ecological cost of doing business could be levied against all businesses proportionate to the side effects of their operating activities.  charging for each ton of emissions is an attempt to do that i think, but i haven't seen how that would actually resolve the environmental issues we are collectively creating.  additionally, it's proving nearly impossible politically to get it done in what we are being led to believe is the critical time window.  there’s probably hope for getting things right in the next 100 – 200 years, but that won’t be nearly soon enough from what i’ve read.

so, i just keep hoping that there's a lot we don't know about the environment that will somehow allow it to rebound without a massive kill-off of humnakind.  because that seems to be the road which we're heading down.  or maybe we’ll see some technology advances which will allow us to mitigate these things.  however, the some total of the side effects from a damaged ecology seem to be far too massive for that hope to be realistic.",vplatt,2007-01-10 10:41:48,reddit.com,2,straight: het

i didn't get that from the report at all.  i agree with you that the guy's conduct after the crime had a bearing on his arrest.  the difference *i* see is that he didn't care that he'd broken the law and showed every sign that he would do it again.  ""thanks for the suggestion"" is a polite way of saying ""i don't care what you are telling me not to do, fuck off"".

now if he'd have gone ""oops, sorry"", sure, he wouldn't have been questioning the cop's authority, but he also wouldn't be acting as if he'd do it again just as soon as the cop's back was turned.  i think the latter had more bearing, and rightly so.

this is made a whole lot easier if the person actually breaks the law right in front of the police officer, wouldn't you say?

&gt; after a brief hop flight 143 landed in ottawa. (...) the refuelers reporting the plane as having 11,430 liters of fuel contained in the two wing tanks. pearson and quintal, again using the same incorrect factor used in montreal, calculated they had 20,400 kilos of fuel on board. in fact, they left for ottawa with only 9144 kilos, roughly half what would be needed to reach edmonton.

let me get this straight: the crew knew they didn't have a working fuel gauge on board, and yet the plane was allowed to take off?

also:

cxt6j,t1_cxs25,"&gt; the problem is the implementation is a provider that can do anything they want with the id.

that's true for a lot of things: email, instant messenger, and dns, for example.  

&gt; it removes passwords for openid it just seems rife for abuse.

openid doesn't remove passwords; it delegates identity authentication to an _identity provider_.  the _identity provider_ decides on the authentication scheme, which could be a password, two-factor authentication, biometrics, mind probe, or whatever.

&gt; the only way for true trust is to have a third party hosted id service like passport (single sign on) but the market has already rejected one entity controlling your data.

openid isn't about trust.  it's about identity.  specifically, about linking identities.  rather than a having hundreds of unique username and password credentials for hundreds of different web sites, a user can have one identity (a url) for all of them.  

so how is any of this actually useful?  openid simplifies page backends because it removes the need to maintain per-user identity information (although sites obviously still need non-identity, per-user information; things like theme and comment viewing options, for example).  a site that exclusively handles openid identities also has no need for a password database. 

openid also makes users' lives easier because they don't have to remember a hundred different user names and passwords.  openid also gives users a single place to maintain common registration information.  

again, trust is a separate issue, one that already exists (as the article mentions), and one that openid explicitly does not address.  for web sites, trust is typically addressed with captcha, moderation, and spam filtering, and none of this changes with openid.  

although it does not address trust, openid could conceivably simplify it.  sites could easily implement an identity provider blacklist (by explicitly denying access to identities provided via abusive identity providers), or even an identity provider whitelist (by granting access only for identities provided via known good identity providers).  

&gt; i think that openid will not fly.

the jury's still out on that one.  i do know that the us government and many large organizations are extremely interested in federated identity management solutions.  whether things like [liberty alliance][1] and [saml][2] will ever take off is another matter entirely.

cxtrj,t1_cxt9n,"&gt; well a globally unique id is an email.  that seems to work fine.

email doesn't allow users to easily share profile information across
several sites, and it doesn't remove the need for each site to maintain
it's own password database or profile database (i clarified the
paragraph with this information in my response, after you wrote this
comment but before i actually read it).   

&gt; i just find it a little scary for anything you really want to secure,
&gt; to have the same id for all these sites.  it creates not only a
&gt; virtual profile of who you are but it also allows someone if they got
&gt; your password and id to not only cause havoc on one site, but all of
&gt; your sites.

i think that's certainly a legitimate concern, although again, you're
talking about trust rather than identity.  

the concepts are easier to distinguish if you think about them as
phrases: 

* _identity_ (authentication): ""the user is who they say they are""
* _trust_ (authorization):  ""the user is allowed to do what they want to do""

with that in mind, nothing about openid prohibits sites with additional
security constraints from requiring an additional step to establish
trust.  a bank, for example, could accept an identity provider's
assertion that a user is who they say they are, but require the user to
enter their pin in order to gain account access.

while openid doesn't address this issue, the heavier identity management
protocols like saml do; saml identity providers do incorporate the
concept of trust, and can relay a ""trust level"" along with an identity,
so a content provider (saml terminology) can determine whether both the
identity provider and the level of authentication are sufficient to
grant access to the protected resource. 

openid, on the other hand, is meant to be a lightweight identity
provider, and explicitly does not address trust issues.  

&gt; a good level of security is keeping obscurity between the layers. 

no, security is about minimizing the number parts that must to be kept
secret (or obscured) in order to keep a system from being compromised.
in cryptography, this is called [kerchkhoffs' principle][1].  bruce
schneier's may 2002 issue of crypto-gram, titled [""secrecy, security,
and obscurity""][2], addresses this issue directly:

&gt; a corollary of kerckhoffs' principle is that the fewer secrets a
&gt; system has, the more secure it is. if the loss of any one secret
&gt; causes the system to break, then the system with fewer secrets is
&gt; necessarily more secure. the more secrets a system has, the more
&gt; fragile it is. the fewer secrets, the more robust.

while kerchkhoffs' principle and bruce schneier's corollary don't
apply directly to this particular scenario (if my reddit password is
compromised, then my entire identity is still relatively secure), the
principle of fragility is apt.  

in particular, the ridiculous number of username/password combinations
users are expected to remember on a day-to-day basis causes users to
choose simple passwords or use common mnemonics for passwords (birthday,
social security number, pets name, etc), which, in turn, makes their
individual (albeit compartmentalized) identities less secure.

and again, you're confusing trust with identity.

&gt; this is the problem with the realid card coming out for us citizens.

there are three separate problems with realid and their ilk:

* they give up an unacceptable amount of individual privacy for a
  negligible increase in collective security.
* us law enforcement has a rich and colorful history of abusing
  collected private information for political gain.  i really shouldn't
  have to elaborate on this point, but [current administration's nsa
  wiretapping fiasco][3], the [clinton administration's personnel file
  controversy][4], the [dod peace protest database][5], the [john lennon
  fbi files][6], and, last but not least, the [watergate scandal][7]
  should be enough to illustrate why the this is a problem.
* these systems implicity (that is, without user consent) provide
  private information, rather than explicitly (with user consent).
  openid is an explicit system, in that it allows the user to explicitly
  decide what (if any) private information identity providers can reveal
  to content providers.

&gt; it connects all your data. so if someone broke into one account, in a
&gt; good secure setup the other layers would be as hard as the first. in a
&gt; poor security system, the door only needs to be broken down once. its
&gt; wise to use different identities or at least authentication per site.

again, openid is about identity, not trust.  also, private information
stored across several sites, each with a weak password, makes it more,
not less, likely that information will be compromised.

1. between 0-1500 ad, few revolutionary scientific discoveries were made
2. between 1500-2000 ad, many revolutionary scientific discoveries were made
3. this was caused by changes in society, such as (but not limited to)
3-1. universal education
3-2. professional academics
3-3. the development of a scientific method
3-4. other variables not accounted for

whether this person's argument is true or not, it is concise and the type of writing that is held to a proper standard in academic institutions such as universities. if an entire paper had been written like that, with some clean-up (removing informalities, source-citing) it would receive an ""a"".

the point i am trying to make then, which is a continuation of the point i have made above, is that reddit is inherently dysgenical, and demonstratably so. my argument is as follows, with some terms defined:

intelligence: 1) iq, as defined by one's biological strengths in visual-spatial ability, verbal ability, logical ability, or more simply ""what is tested on an iq test"". although numerous studies (many more arguing for than against, that is) have provided concrete reason to believe that it is hereditary, there is still debate whether it truly is or not. the best example i can supply for the case of intelligence being hereditary is retardation: if mental retardation is a supreme lack of intelligence, and mental retardation is hereditary, then intelligence must be hereditary in more than a few ways (but possibly not entirely, of course) 2) possessing an active knowledge of subjects that are commonly taught in academia, such as math, science, history, language, and many other related and unrelated subjects

intelligent content: information, media, or otherwise that makes active use of 2). can be related directly (such as an article that provides a critical analysis of immanuel kant's writings) or indirectly (an article that would require knowledge of 2) to appreciate), but requires some form of 1) due to an eventual plateau. if grammar, for example, is accepted by the majority to be an issue when one can not make proper use of possessives (your/you're), but not when one uses a comma splice or other seldomly-mentioned errors, then it is likely that the majority has a lack of a formal knowledge of grammar (possibly) or little capacity for acknowledging smaller errors (more likely than the former). there exists then a ""majority threshhold"". i, for example, deplore the use of ""okay"", ""like"", ""so"", ""um"", ""well"", and similar laziness in speech and even moreso writing. the common citizen does not notice such things and seems perplexed that one would bring such issues up. if i have a higher biological capacity for a specific trait of 1), such as the trait used for verbal analysis, then it can be assumed that what would be a conclusion that the average citizen would require much more time and analysis to reach can be reached by someone such as myself relatively quickly. therefor, an article involving grammar, such as a contemporary version of ""elements of style"", would require both 1), a strong natural intelligence, and 2), proper education to understand and/or appreciate what is being viewed by the person with 1). an example of dysgenical content would be replies: as intelligence decreases, there is less willingness to read long replies due to a lack of aptitude or 1), and hence discussion is cut off from the intelligent, with replies becoming shorter, less intelligent and more centered upon juvenilia.
 
mainstream intelligence: 1) in proportion to the population of western society, both offline and online. one could assert that it is represented in websites such as myspace, digg and youtube, where it can be assumed that they are of such wide usage that they represent the public as a whole, just as a sample selection for a study does.

tech-savvy intelligence: 1) in proportion to those who use non-mainstream websites and have reasonable competence with a computer. assumingly they do not represent the population as a whole, and have above-average, but not exceptional, intelligence or 1). websites geared toward this section can be able to sustain themselves and will be demonstratably more intelligent, but have potential for regression into mainstream intelligence.

with these terms defined, my argument follows as such:

1. reddit allows anyone to vote for what they consider good
2. those who are intelligent are a minority
3. if those who are not intelligent are a minority, then less intelligent people are the majority.
4. as a website's user-base continues to rise, if a website is unrestricted with all content submitted by users, then it is likely that its user base will reflect the majority
5. the content will, therefor, become less intelligent
6. the site will be of lesser interest to intelligent users
7. if the site is of interest to intelligent users, they will have continually less say as a majority base begins to disapprove and reflect such disapproval in their voting
8: intelligent content will be ignored or oppressed, leaving little to no exposure
9. the growing base will then model their content off of the  noticably available content, such as what is on the front page.

cxu9t,t1_cxtin,"&gt; 1. ice cores are a proxy, not actual measurement of histsoric temperature. [...] but to prove a theory using them is imposible.

they're one piece of evidence. it won't be possible to prove this kind of theory in a mathematical theorem-proving sense. this is science, not mathematics. we can only gain more evidence, of varying quality, for and against, and test our predictions.

&gt; 2. correlation does not imply causation.

true. that's why i chose my words carefully.

&gt; 3. irrelevant unless you prove causation.

not irrelevant. it may not prove human causation, but it's pretty freaking relevant if it's actually this far out of range. it's a sign that *something* out of the normal regime is happening, and that should be of interest independent of the particular theory one is trying to support.

&gt; it is currently estimated we will peak output within the next hundred years (thus annual co2 production would peak as well).

the evidence for this is no better than the evidence i've presented for human causation of climate change. choosing to believe this, and not my argument is pure supposition.

&gt; as fossil fuels become harder to get, we move to cheaper fuel sources, like nuclear, wind, solar (and possibly even hydrogen). we will already be moving to renewable fuels well within time to avert gore's imminent catastrophe.

even if this happens, it's unlikely to help us out if large ice-shelves have already melted, which could happen in the next 50 years, or so.

it sure would suck to miss our window of opportunity by a couple of decades.

bush continues to use the military as stage props - disgusting.

&gt;the troops here and across the world are fighting a global war on terror. this war reached our shores on september 11, 2001.

first of all its not a ""war"" on terror. it's like his father's war on drugs. equally useless and ineffective. 

bush attempts to paint the actions of a criminal organization as that of a nation-state to which they can only aspire in their wildest fantasies.

i won't even talk about his projection of imperialistic goals, that so closely match those of the us,  onto al-queada, who do not have the resources, depth, man power or coherence to run a nation let along multiple nations. shit we've been trying to run iraq for 3 years and we can't seem to do it, though that may be largely due to the incompetence of our oval office centered ""brain trust"", than the difficulty of the task.

&gt;after september 11, i made a commitment to the american people:

really? so now american foreign policy is about what the president decides alone? more president as king mythology. 

&gt;iraq is the latest battlefield in this war.

no it really isn't. this administration has started a war there, but clearly as the president said in the last sentence the ""battle field"" if there is such a thing in this context is in the places that bombings have occurred, ie:

&gt;madrid, istanbul, jakarta, casablanca, riyadh, bali, and elsewhere

not iraq. we're only 4 paragraphs in and the speech writer has already contradicted his own narrative. but i guess this is par for the course, for republican authors trapped in a world of newspeak.

&gt;there is only one course of action against them: to defeat them abroad before they attack us at home.

or as [wesley clark](http://reddit.com/info/xuc4/comments) and many many [others](http://reddit.com/info/xud9/comments) have stated there's diplomacy, and an honest attempt to address what's driving these people crazy.

&gt;we are removing a source of violence and instability — and laying the foundation of peace for our children and our grandchildren.

actually this is the total opposite. the bush/cheney administration is laying the foundation for international hatred and internecine warfare for future generations.

&gt;and when the middle east grows in democracy, prosperity, and hope, the terrorists will lose their sponsors, lose their recruits, and lose their hopes for turning that region into a base for attacks on america and our allies around the world.

we have freedom here in the us and it hasn't stopped the hatred, violence, and intimidation of the us right wing machine and its financiers.

&gt;hear the words of osama bin laden: “this third world war is raging” in iraq.

actually these are in fact [the words of newt gingrich](http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/16/newt-world-war/). i can see how bush can confuse the two. :-) i had a lot of respect for gingrich until his insane round of barkings that started this summer. it's amazing the speech writers would even attempt to resell this old turd of a meme, which was so soundly derided six months ago. if they are recycling rhetoric to sell this move, can the plan itself have any prayer?

&gt;and there is no limit to the innocent lives they are willing to take.

and apparently this is true of the bush/cheney administration as well. given the 20:1 ratio of kills we are currently running.

&gt;and we see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who behead civilian hostages and broadcast their atrocities for the world to see.

wow i wonder if nick berg's father is glad the speech writers are still getting mileage from his son's murder?

&gt;the terrorists — both foreign and iraqi — failed to stop the transfer of sovereignty. (*we never started the process*) they failed to break our coalition and force a mass withdrawal by our allies. (*we never really had a coalition*) they failed to incite an iraqi civil war. (*gosh if you only knew how hard we've been working to incite one*) they failed to prevent free elections. (*amazing how our two candidates came out on top in that*) they failed to stop the formation of a democratic iraqi government that represents all of iraq’s diverse population. (*now largely from outside of iraq, cause its too dangerous for these ""representative"" to actually be there*) and they failed to stop iraqis from signing up in large numbers with the police forces and the army to defend their new democracy.

what is difficult is to determine how accurately the real world tracks a particular model. predicting the outcome of various actions in the real world is the most compelling application of economic theory, but it doesn't mean that the application is easy or even possible. given some luck and creativity, it is sometimes possible to make strong deductions from available data. more often, crucial data is missing because governments don't feel like collecting it, and researchers can't afford huge surveys over long periods of time.

we don't discard euclid just because it is impossible to prove his theorems by measurements on real world objects.

in a straightforward case such as supply and demand for unskilled labor, the burden should be on the proponents of minimum wage to explain exactly what factors cause the usual economic theory to be invalid, and provide evidence to suggest that those factors are actually present. 

in reality, the major factor determining employment is macroeconomic fluctuations, or large shifts in particular industries that are important in one region or another. legislatures don't pass minimum wage legislation on a schedule designed to support controlled studies; they are based on election years and temporary economic downturns.

* **the children**: more variation here contingent on age and gender, but the same basic archetypes are invariably recycled: the sexpot (teenaged female), the sadistic hellraiser (tweenaged to teenaged male),the slow-witted underachiever with his best friend/sidekick/lackey at his side (tweenaged male), the friendless prodigy (the younger the funnier; gender variable with a slight edge towards female), et cetera. none are fair depictions of the multidimensional children we know to exist.

* **the grandparents**: cynical, cantankerous, and embittered by the ravages of time. despise their child's spouse. generally presented as a burden or unwelcome presence in the household.

cxvyo,t3_xvyl,"defining phrases such as disabled access, disabled lifts, wheelchair lifts, stair lifts, platform lifts, and wheelchair users. http://www.wheelchairaccess.co.uk 

as the world changes disabled access to the world must keep up. a vast range of disabled access barriers have been created and solutions follow, from disabled access being a blind person reading a brail book to disabled access being oscar pistorius, with two carbon-fiber prosthetic legs, breaking the 22 second barrier in the 2004 athens paralympics 200 meter sprint. it is important that one day people with disabilities do not have disabled access issues and there is no reason why that could not happen.

disabled lifts come in all shapes and sizes, from portable disabled lifts to common elevator shafts; even bath, bed and vehicle aids can be classed as disabled lifts.  disabled lifts have been designed for public or domestic use, for indoor even outdoor use. over history disabled lifts have been adapted to overcome all types of barriers to cater for the importance of individuals’ independent living. you can be assured that as new barriers are formed from developments in architecture, new ages and tastes etc, adaptations in disabled lifts will follow.

wheelchair lifts are a separate type of disabled access aid where the wheelchair is lifted with its user hence “wheelchair lift”. you can not class a domestic lift, for example, where the user has to move out of their wheelchair into a seat as a wheelchair lift as the user leaves the wheelchair behind, and in many cases has another wheelchair on the second level. wheelchair lifts usually take up more space, as a platform is needed for the wheelchair to sit on. other types of lifts are used when the user is not always wheelchair bound but it is generally easier for a wheelchair user to use a wheelchair lift.

sesame access’ system will change the meaning of the phrase stair lifts. a disabled or able bodied person in the street would tell you that stair lifts are the contraptions that carry people up a set of domestic house stairs; “you know the stair lifts you see on t.v.” it is sesame access systems ltd plan to create a sesame system or stair lifts even, that will be affordable and practical for use in every household whilst still using the theory that our stair lifts remain hidden until a discrete button is pushed. sesame access systems web site http://www.wheelchairaccess.co.uk 

platform lifts, on their own, are never the most aesthetically pleasing forms of access. you could even relate the phrase platform lifts to goods lifts. in many cases platform lifts are visible as an enclosed system with a gate as an entrance. we use platform lifts as a lifting mechanism but when the stairs are in the rest/pedestrian position you would need a trained eye to notice that platform lifts lays beneath.

it is believed that the earliest representation of wheelchair users was over one thousand years ago, an engraving was found in china of what appears to be wheelchair users sitting in a three wheeled chair. wheelchair users had to rely on able bodied people to help in movement until stephen farfler invented a wheelchair with hand cranks in the mid 17th century allowing wheelchair users to move independently. according to the department of health 1994 there are around 1.2 million wheelchair users in the u.k. using all sorts of variations in design of wheelchairs which keep on improving including the ibot that can carry wheelchair users up stairs, fantastic, but not too great for the wheelchair lift industry.

cxw2k,t1_cxsts,"it's not just education, but healthcare, networking, globalization, and a host of other factors:

with regards to education, consider what's really driving the price up. the number of ""top tier"", ivy league schools remains fixed at 50. there aren't any more elite schools like harvard, princeton, mit, yale, etc than there were 50 years ago, but the population of the us has jumped 100 million in that time. as the population grows, a smaller percentage of people have the opportunity to go to these schools - and that percentage will increasingly be the percentage that can afford to pay.

then look at healthcare - and here i'll use a particular example: braces. not everyone can afford them, and dental insurance is even harder to come by than health insurance. kids of the rich will all get braces at a young age - they might bitch in high school, but when they go to interview for a job they'll have perfect straight teeth. a poorer kid won't, and as much as we might wish otherwise, those things make a difference. but the same kind of thing happens in other areas of healthcare as well.

the most valuable thing your daddy can give you is a rolodex full of business contacts. who you know outweighs what you know in almost every facet of life, and the ""good old boys network"" is hereditary.

the main solution to lift yourself out of poverty forwarded here is ""start a business"". but let's look at that realistically for a second: it's a lot easier to do if you have a trust fund to get it off the ground with. not sure for the initial investment, but because it minimizes the risk you're actually taking. businesses can take months to get positive cash flow, or they can fail entirely - it might not be impossible to support a family while getting a business off the ground, but either way it's a big risk to take. during the startup phase you most likely won't be able to afford health insurance, again a lot to ask of a family. and finally, look at reality: the vast majority don't have the education or skills to be an entrepreneur.

most ""rags to riches"" stories we hear about today aren't - people like bill gates and these silicon valley entrepreneurs almost all come from solidly upper middle class backgrounds. you'd have a tough time finding someone who was *really* born to poverty and managed to become a millionaire.

so i think it's more than a self fulfilling prophecy; there are some real barriers to mobility that our society isn't addressing. inequality is a symptom of this; but the real reason it matters is that the vast wealth being accumulated by the ultra-wealthy could be going to alleviate some of this and create a more meritocratic society.",ejp1082,2007-01-11 09:00:10,reddit.com,1,straight: straight

cxwde,t1_cxvqc,"&gt;he is a partisan hack no better than ann coulter. olbermann can attack bush's credibility, but where does olbermann's credibility derive from? he's a sports reporter propped up reading a speech that he didn't write and probably doesn't even believe.

olbermann's credibility comes from the fact that he was trained with a degree in communications, spent 16 years interviewing sports poeple and the last ten interviewing politicians, analysts and every day people in the news.  this is besides the point that nearly anyone with a brain can attack bush's credibility.

if you actually watched his show, you'd see that he doesn't always read stuff other people write for him.  i have heard him numerous times speaking with dan patrick in the afternoon and then bring some ideas from there to a topic on his show.  it's clear it isn't scripted and he sometimes stumbles when trying to make his point.

if you watched any of the election crap last fall, you would see that keith was intelligent, quick on his feet, and had no problem discussing the issues at hand on all the live coverage.  he stumbled once or twice then but so did chris matthews.  no one's perfect.

keith started cornell at 16 and graduated at 20 with a bs in communications.  while he worked in sportscasting from 1981 until he quit espn in 1997, he won several major awards in sportscasting and was voted sportsman of the year three times.  

in 1997, he went to work for msnbc on his own show and occasionally anchored the weekend edition of nbc nightly news. then left to work for fox until 2001.  he was working for abc radio on 9/11 and won the edward r murrow award for his reports from the site.  he also had a weekly column at salon.com.  he has also written for other publications such as the new york times, usa today, newsweek, time, sports illustrated and playboy.

keith's special comments have facts to back them up.  just because he doesn't link to them on his show isn't his fault.  it's your fault for not verifying them.  i have also never heard him outright lie, such as ann coulter does when confronted with something she doesn't know about.

i'd say keith has a lot of credibility and enough history in the public to see what kind of person he is.  i don't always like his liberal leaning views but his arguments are always based on fact.  

he also doesn't always stick with the democrats-always-good/republicans-always-bad mantra.  he openly mocked the democrats for taking monday off, something you would have seen if you had paid attention.",berberine,2007-01-11 09:59:02,reddit.com,19,gay: wsw

the fact that this has not happend result in only two possibilities to me:

1)iran does really not want to have neuclear technology - which is supprising and possibly dangerous as this seems to be the only thing that can contain the us these days. this could be because iran fears that they would get nuked if they had some, but the us is not likely to be that mad.

2)north korea does not have neuclear weapons. this would be surprising, but not impossible (the detonations where very small and only the us did actual readings for radioactivity). in this case north korea would be wise to refuse to sell to iran for fear of letting the cat out of the back.

bottom line, diplomacy is the only viable option here. we could have taken a more hardline stance if we hadn't invaded iraq, but now we have very few cards left to play, and ahmedinejad has called our bluff. if we invade iran, no one is going to continue supporting us in the middle east. every other nation with a large troop presence is going to pull out; any insurgents in iraq would see this as an opening to attack us soldiers. israel would help us if it had any soldiers to spare, but it doesn't. our national debt would skyrocket, and make the dollar even more unstable and less attractive to foreign investment.

cxxim,t1_cxxbk,"we started ""it"" years ago. bush's tirades and foreign policies completely destroyed what could have been a diplomatically manageable situation. and, as another poster said, iran supported our invasion of afghanistan. 

with war, it's best to assume the worst; however, i didn't even mention the worst. i mentioned the more likely. 

the worst would be catastrophic results from the bird flu or another contagion evolving into a deadly pathogen (we are due for one, it's been almost a century since the last) sweeping unhindered through our populace, as a vast portion of our resources are stuck in the blithering desert. perhaps we are engaged in a struggle in the middle east for a decade or more, and all the money we spend there is not spent on reducing global warming; what if the planet starts to heat up and we're too late to do anything about it? what if by bombing iran's infrastructure and causing millions of civilian casualties, we just manage to piss of the wrong person with access to weapons-grade plutonium? what if we incur such debt that foreign investment pulls out to the extent of an economic depression or collapse? what if a nuclear strike happens in the middle of a deep recession?

all of these scenarios are rather unlikely (although it's best not to gamble with such things at stake, even with pretty good odds); nevertheless, we are wasting our resources in record amounts during a time when there are a dozen other things that need serious attention in this country. the worst part is not what money we've spent, either, but what we will have to spend in the future because of bush's policies instead of using it to fix our other problems.


lastly, whether or not the troops figure is accurate, iran has a gigantic military, a very large population, and vast real estate. we do not have the resources to fight on these terms. targeting civilian infrastructure, as we often do in such situations, would multiply the current threat of terrorism and insurgency a hundred fold, not to mention create massive international outrage.",TheNoxx,2007-01-11 13:08:27,reddit.com,9,straight: het

i treat patients with all the compassion i can muster, but toward smokers i am coming to have little pity.  the information is out there, fought vociferously by other addicts who resent ""being controlled"" - as if they weren't controlled on a cellular level already.  and to someone who is not addicted, they look pathetic.

&gt; he loads the .30-30 he just bought at wal-mart and walks into the street. what now? my aforementioned question remains unresolved: whom, exactly, is this man supposed to shoot? a cop? the mayor of boise? a fema employee? whom would he be revolting against? is it even possible for the modern man to know?

this much is easy, if uncomfortable to think about. such a revolution would need to go high up... congressmen, federal judges. stay away from state government, and joe everyman who is working as a cop or whatever.

a one-off assassination won't do the trick either. a significant fraction need to go within a space of a few hours, lest the others barricade themselves in safety. and multiple attacks too, a single bomb killing a dozen senators doesn't count as more than one attack.

federal law enforcement would be valid targets too, i think. and, once things were under way, even local law enforcement when it was necessary to attack those previously mentioned. (a nyc cop is verboten, unless and until he's on body guard duty for a ny senator).

things would have to be decisive. law enforcement would have to be pressed to continue guarding, to the point that investigations and prosecution are postponed. things would have to be urgent enough that the national guard is called out. attacks would have to be planned and waiting for them as they deployed.

there would need to be sympathetic media portrayal, so that their propaganda mills can't badmouth things too much. sympathetic state legislatures would help too.

body counts would be the most important part. at least 1000 within the first 3 days, consisting of 40+ geographically seperate attacks. at least 4 or 5 dozen federals dead, half of which are congressmen or federal judges. avoid the president, despite the gratification of such a success. avoid state legislatures, and governors (at least when they're relatively sympathetic).

yes. we can do that, by sending over 1 soldier for every 8 that are already there. do you have any idea how obscenely stupid that is?

&gt; do you see the insanity there?

fancy you suggesting that others are insane.

let me pretend that i was a warmongering little chickenhawk like yourself, but that i remained non-stupid (i know, i know, mutually exclusive). i desperately want to win in iraq. i will and can somehow do anything to accomplish this.

by win, i mean the flowers falling from the sky while iraqis dance and sing in the streets about their new american-like freedom. they happily continue to sell oil to us in dollars, and repay us for all we've done for them on some 99-year plan. they're downright hostile to terrorists, and suspicious of our enemies like the iranians. in other words, the fantasy that the neocons are still continuing to indulge in...

to accomplish this, i would need to reinstate the draft. we would need to train all the draftees, which can take anywhere from 6 to 12 months. in the meantime, we need to not lose the country before january 2008. so, we'd need to pull every last soldier out of europe and korea. we'd need to hang on to those who have finished their entire enlistment, involuntarily. no rotations home. we might be able to boost troop levels to 350,000 in the meantime. come january, we could maybe do away with those policies. starting january, we would keep drafting people until we have no less than 900,000 troops, 450,000 of which are in the immediate baghdad area. this could take up to another year, possibly longer if we increase things to the ideal level of 1.3 million troops.

to be able to afford this, we would have to retool all of our industry to put out war materials. people would have to learn to ration gasoline and steel and tire rubber and groceries like during wwii. we would easily boost the debt to twice its current size. to do this, we would have to appease china. taiwan would be sacrificed. russia would have to be appeased. who knows what that would take.

by january 2009, with our full troop strength, we would implement curfews an hour before dark. nothing would move without our say so. street patrols every fourth street.

we'd need to come up with 25,000 - 40,000 who spoke the local languages completely fluently. we'd need people with investigative skill... not the cia ""let's torture everyone until we stumble onto something"" sadist stuff we have now. we'd need to stay there in force until 2012 or so. we'd need to spend upwards of $150 billion actually rebuilding the country. every home needs sewage, running water, electricity , and phone service. when iraqi's called the police, they'd be calling american troops. no iraqi involvement.

overall, i only give this scenario a 50/50 chance of success. while it should be possible, supposing you could get rid of the incompetents (who never seem to be incompetent when it comes to the office politics that keep them in their position), the truth is we'd bankrupt our own country doing it. we would have to fight on this one, single front, rather than trying to fight on several. just iraq.

but we can't afford it. and nothing else can possibly succeed.

and as far as it being about terrorism, well... iraq never had anything to do with it. probably still won't even after we fail. we'd not be fighting the terrorists you see hiding in woodpiles all over the world.

cxylq,t3_xy1q,"it's amazing how blind c++ programmers are to the unsuitability of raii for resource management.

in general, there is a logical flaw.  take these statements:

1. ""resources with dynamic extent can be managed by allocating them at a certain point in the call chain and de-allocating them when unwinding.""

2. ""objects allocated on the stack invoke constructors when created and destructors when unwound.""

c++ programmers have connected the two by saying: ""resources can be allocated in constructors and de-allocated in destructors"" and thereby confounding the concepts.  they saw a simple example: ""hey, my stack-allocated file object just so happens to have the right semantics for resource allocation!"" (except it doesn't) and tried to generalize it, wrongly.

this is a gigantic mistake, because objects can be created in other places too!  objects with indefinite extent are allocated usually on the heap.  using the destructor of an indefinite extent object to free a dynamic extent resource is going to bite you back whether or not you use gc.

serious languages with automatic memory management wisely decouple arbitrary resource management from object memory management.  in java they call it ""try...finally"".  in common lisp, ""unwind-protect"".  in haskell, ""finally"" or  the more general ""bracket"".

i have barely mentioned gc yet: gc is for managing indefinite extent objects, where the lifetime is not necessarily statically decidable.  gc does not interfere with stack allocation, or any statically decidable allocation methods, in the least.  the problem c++ programmers have with gc is due to the peculiarity of c++ programming styles.

is gc a panacea?  no.  there is no such thing as perfect memory management.  you can screw yourself in any system.  that's why gcs come in many forms with parameters to tweak.  as do manual memory management libraries.",ricercar,2007-01-11 16:31:16,programming,13,straight: het

what's so ugly about dynamic code generation? this is one of the key advantages of dynamic languages. i use it quite often, and not just for benchmarks.

then that's not going to happen.. here's why:-

[(from a few comments exchanged between me and jesusphreak, on a post about ""jesus camp"" documentary, where children were praying in front of a cardboard cut-out of pres. bush.)](http://reddit.com/info/g3c4/comments/cg4uz)

&gt; the bible says all authorities are appointed by god (romans 13). the woman [pastor becky fisher, pentecostal church] never even calls bush a ""biblical"" leader, she says, as i just referenced, that the bible commands us to pray for our leaders.

and jesusphreak is (seems like) well educated person who posts some good comments on programming.reddit.com.

imagine the loyalty the uneducated/marginally educated rural conservatives will have toward bush. esp. when, besides the iraq- debacle, he has been pretty ""biblical"" in his policies: anti-abortion, anti-evolution, anti-gay rights, anti-muslim, blindly pro-israel...

i can bet money that bush will not be impeached! (regardless of the success/failure of this recent troop-""surge"")



--------------

this is the relevant interview of becky fisher which the above (partial) comment tries to explain:-

&gt; a particularly inflammatory scene that heightens the political overtones for viewers takes place at a revival meeting lead by fischer and her associates, in front of well over 100 children. in the scene, fischer takes a life-size standup photo of president george w. bush to the stage, and with a large american flag in the background, asks the crowd to raise their hands towards him in prayer.

&gt; ""i didn't realize how the secular world viewed what we were doing,""  

&gt; ""when we took out [an] image of bush, it turned political, but to us, it's not political - it's biblical,"" she said.

&gt; ""all you have to do is mention words like abortion, homosexuality and president bush to [garner] strong feelings from people,"" said fischer who maintained that using images of the u.s. president and the flags of the u.s. and israel were not meant to be overtly political. ""we are commanded to pray for our leaders and we're commanded [by the bible] to pray for israel. so it was a surprise to me because we don't think of this as political. but from a secular point-of-view, i can see how it's viewed politically.""

&gt; ***becky fischer and her fellow evangelicals view bush as a primary hope in pursuing their agenda regarding abortion rights, prayer in school, and gay rights,*** and the film captures the emotional devotion instilled within a new young generation of evangelicals.

cxzds,t1_cxz42,"&gt; we americans like our cars. but quite frankly if i could get on a rail in 1-2 blocks from my house and get off 1-2 blocks from work i would do it. (my commute is 45 mins and gas is killing me right now.)

yeh, it almost has to be that, and not much more. if you have to catch 3 busses to make the train, it's just never going to happen. i'm lucky, this new job i managed to find an apartment within 3 miles of work. previous jobs, never got closer than 19 miles, some were more like 40.

but, even more important than public transport, i think, would be the telecommuting. just out of curiosity, what do you do for a living, and could it ever be feasible to do your job that way?

&gt; interesting idea about nuclear trains.

does no good to switch our overland shipping to rail again, if we have to burn coal or diesel just to power it. dunno if it's feasible or not. more important though, is rebuilding it in such a way that it would be useful to businesses that need less than 150 train cars worth of goods moved in or out. you'd want these things to be able to pull up behind the local walmart, and offload a bunch in a hurry. how do you even set up the infrastructure to do that? almost need to make sure all such stores sit next to each other in a straight line... something they'd not be keen on doing. (but then, the light rail could be sitting right next to the heavy rail, for public transport...)

&gt; the honest truth is that if it cost more money, then people will not readily move toward the technology. secondly, i agree 1000% with the nuclear power plan. it's affordable, safe etc. but you have to get by the environmental crowd. they try to veto any new nuclear plant being considered.

two things. the environmentalists are nuts if they oppose it. no one i've heard is suggesting we build 1950s-era power plants. my god. it may have been dirty before, but we can do it right this time. and given the alternative, i just don't see how they can be serious.

the other thing is... has anyone even made a serious proposal for a new plant in this country in the last few decades? i've not heard of any.

&gt; i'm not sure i believe that fusion will be viable.

hard to say, but it's too valuable to not take a gamble on. it's for real, and something that we *can* master... but whether that's in 2040, or in 3040, it's too difficult to say. my gut feeling is that the tokamak is the wrong approach, but no clue what the right one is.

&gt; instead of taxing incandescents, how about some way to bring the prices of flourescents down some. i don't buy them because they are too expensive.

they are expensive, even at walmart. not worth buying elsewhere, they can be nearly $5 per in small stores. but then, in the first month i've been using them everywhere, my electric bill's went down by $14. if they last as long as they claim, it's cheaper in the long run. then again, i'm only a month into it, they might burn out tonight. there are mercury issues too, with their disposal. no idea how that will work out.

&gt; we would have to be reasonable in that we shouldn't ruin our economy to meet stringent environmental standards just to find that there would be no positive effect due to china and india.

i'm not sure we would ruin our economy, even if it had no benefit at all regarding global warming. all of the measures i've listed have at least some economic benefit beyond the environmental issue. cheaper more efficient shipping. gained productivity from recovered commuting man-hours. new technology. reduced power usage, allowing us to budget more to other uses. it's the way to run a country, in my opinion, whether or not the ice cap's going to melt.",NoMoreNicksLeft,2007-01-11 19:28:57,reddit.com,0,"straight: straight, straight: het, straight: het"

cxzob,t1_cxwmn,"&gt; i want to be able to put any piece of python code in it, whether it is `a = b`, `try: something` or `for a in b` or `if 1 != 1: print 2`. i want to be able to express my lambda in *multiple lines* [...]
&gt; 
&gt; i want to be able to define a function like this
&gt; 
&gt;     my_foo = lambda:
&gt;         foo()
&gt;         bar()
&gt;
&gt; and achieve an identical result with `def`.
 
yes, but have you ever tried reading an *expression* that contains an embedded multi-line `lambda`?

for example, how would you write your `my_foo` example if you had a tuple (or a nesting) of `lambda`s, instead of just one?

would this code:

    return lambda:
               foo()
               bar(), lambda:
                   frob()
                   munge()

return a tuple, or a nested `lambda`?

how about the currently-legal:

    (lambda:
        foo(a)
        -b)

would you interpret it as two statements?

in:

    frob(lambda:
             foo()
             bar(), baz())

is `baz()` a parameter to `frob` or part of the `lambda`?

and so on.  there are basically two ways of resolving these, and further, ambiguities:

* complicate `lambda` with block delimiters or other, similarly unpythonic syntax
* limit the use of multi-line `lambda`s to simple, unambiguous contexts like your `my_foo` example, which pretty much defeats the original purpose of having an advantage over `def`

&gt; i know people will ask why i won't just use the damn `def`. that completely destroys the purpose of having anonymous function in the first place.

as far as i see it, the purpose of nested function definitions is that they're closures, not that they're anonymous.",pjdelport,2007-01-11 20:56:56,programming,3,straight: het

cy1ln,t1_cxx3e,"metafilter inhabits some of the most sophomoric writing on the  internet and to say that it is for grown ups is discouraging. 

from what i have learned, the majority are young adults who make lots of veiled stabs at irony, and by that i mean the same type of impressionistic meta-humor relating to the internet (for example, ending a sentence with ""!11"") that is eventually grown out of as one matures. i saw most debates that read like high school essays - ""firstly, secondly, in conclusion..."" or, even worse, actually writing out the mental ""leftovers"" that occur in speech but should not in writing (beginning sentences with ""so"", ""okay"", ""um"", and what have you; using excesses of words like ""really"", ""even"", ""just""). yes, all of those annoyances are on reddit as well, but with far lesser frequency. on meta-filter i can expect to find it in nearly every discussion. writing of that kind is to english to what soap operas are to theater. i am not an english major nor do i have any vocational reliance on literature, but surely i can not be the only one who dislikes terrible writing.

granted, the content is more intelligent, but what the users have to say is much less intelligent than reddit. far more one-line remarks in snide are to be seen on metafilter. in reddit, the reverse is true - much of the content is idiotic with the occasional gem, while much of what users have to say is more interesting. 

i propose that a reddit/metafilter clone is created where to comment and submit articles (but not to read the site) one has to take an intelligence test. that would remove the wheat from the chaff, the only concern is what in fact should be tested. perhaps make it category-specific, i.e. before submitting an article in programming one has to take a test covering that sort of material?

i visit reddit to learn about new forms of technology and world happenings that are too rare or extraordinary to see on a traditional news site like bbc news. in other words, i visit reddit to educate myself. surely others do the same, and would like a website that offers such. if there are any web designers reading this, i would gladly anonymously donate to such a meritocratic site as the one i described previously in the name of education.",uidui,2007-01-12 07:14:01,reddit.com,5,gay: homo

cy2ym,t3_xvsv,"thank you for taking the time to share your concerns.  i write this intending to express my own views and not the views of other board members.
i may not reply to each of your points due to the large volume of interest in this matter.  i will set forth the salient points below though.  i will not be replying to your replies.

1.  we did not ban or censor the movie and have no intent to do so. teachers can use it as they see fit if they follow policy on movies and controversial issues.  all we requested is that the policies be followed.

2.  we are not banning the teaching of global warming.

3.  the debate on global warming is beneficial to society and limiting the debate to only one side’s view of the established facts would not be good for anyone even if they believe the debate is over.

4.  our policies are designed to make sure that the door is open for more debate on issues, not less.

5.  the decision was made on existing policy.  it was not based on anyone’s direct belief regarding politics, science, religion, or when the earth was formed.

6.  policy 2331 and 2331p (see below) is intended to prevent one-sided views of controversial issues.

7.  the action was based upon the fact that a teacher intended to show the movie without presenting an opposing view, which was in violation of existing policy.  there was also an offer last week by the proponents of the movie to give 50,000 copies to teachers across the country to use as
curriculum, which would have increased the chance that the movie would be used.  there was more than one complaint/concern expressed about this issue based upon that alone.

8.  the policy should be equally enforced regardless of what side of the spectrum any controversial issue falls upon.  this protects the integrity of the education process.  i would have made the same decision if the movie was about the iraq war or some other issue and was narrated by
george w. bush or other partisan, and even if the proponents felt the debate was over on the topic they were presenting.

9.  the partisan aspect of any issue makes it controversial per se in my opinion.  our schools will not be used as a farm team for any political party and we will protect against even the appearance of political indoctrination.

10.  science and politics are merged on this issue.  the political aspect of this is what makes it the most controversial, especially when a political partisan makes the presentation.  with that in mind, there are
many other ways to teach global warming instead of using a feature film by a political partisan (see links below from noaa and nasa that have have references to skeptics), but despite that belief on my part, i still did
not vote to ""ban"" the movie even though i had the power to do so.  i also had the power to compel other sources be used instead of the movie and did not do that either.

11.  on the issue of how final the debate is, i wonder if galileo or other out of the box thinkers would have ever made their discoveries had they not questioned what was perceived to be the determined ""facts"" of the day
by those in power.  i understand there was a religious component to quashing debate during their times, but does it matter what the source is that quashes debate when some think the debate is over?  those who believe
science is infallible need a history lesson.  research what was thought to be scientific fact 50 or 100 years ago and you will truly understand why i believe in debate, even about science and even when some think the debate
is over.

12.  some of you have made strained analogies to creationism and other ridiculous examples of opposing views.  first, creationism raises constitutional issues that global warming does not.  as to ridiculous examples, i am confident that the marketplace of ideas will quickly dismiss those examples.
in sum, simply asking for duly adopted policy to be followed by making sure opposing views are presented when a political partisan presents a contested political/scientific issue to impressionable youth is not too much to ask for in a free society.  you are entitled to disagree and that
is what makes this country great.

thank you.

controversial issues, teaching of - 2331p

the board of education of the federal way school district establishes the following guidelines to deal with the teaching of controversial issues:

• it is the teacher’s responsibility to present controversial issues that are free from prejudice an d encourage students to form, hold and express
their own opinions without personal prejudice or discrimination.

• when a teacher is in doubt as to whether or not a topic or speaker is controversial, they should refer the matter to the school principal.

provided.

when handling controversia l issues, the teacher may not present his/her own personal position as the only acceptable position, which may be taken on that particular issue.  the teacher shall not seek to bring about a single conclusion to which all students must subscribe, but rather
encourage a problem solving environment.  the teacher shall not suppress a student’s view on that issue as long as the expression of that view is not derogatory, malicious, or abusive toward the other students’ views, nor shall one student be permitted to dominate the discussion.

cy3yp,t1_cy3m1,"here are some western values i cherish:

sincerity - this has been cherished as a value since the greeks, the fount of western civ. - bush is the most disengenuous president i have seen yet, even worse than nixon or clin, a low i never though possible.

self-reflection - this is another classical value, the apollonian maxim ""know thyself"" was an ideal of the greeks and self-reflection has been regarded as a virtue, while its opposite a vice.  peggy noonan once said that reagan was proof that ""the unreflective life is worth living,"" which made me ill when i first read it.  bush is even less self reflective.  no matter how abysmally his policies fail he persists ignorantly imagining that changing course when failing to achieve one's goal is manliness rather than incompetence.

moderation - another apollonian maxim applies here, ""nothing too much.""  i won't give any side of any political debate much credit here, but the excesses bush has gone to are quite extreme.

democracy - another greek ideal.  bush praises democracy to the heavens while in practice he ignores the popular will or regards it with contempt.

rule of law - this one is at the root of much of civilzation, at least since hammurabi's code.  bush's suspension of habeus corpus, contempt for the higest law of our land, the ""just a piece of paper"" quote may or may not have been true, but it illustrates his behavior well.  the arrogance of calling himself the ""decider"" make it clear he doesn't hold up this particular western value to well.  bush's actions have caused the iraqis to actually suffer living under even less rule of law. 

human rights - as thatcher once pointed out, this is really implicit in stoic thought, though it was only properly articulated in the enlightenment.  i am afraid that here the republican leadership and especially bush don't even talk the talk, let alone walk the walk.

love of excellence - a center of greek society, one can see it in their olympics and in many other places.  at various points wester civ. really has achieved high points of excellence.  i am afraid that in today's world excellence is achieved by and large in spite of the republicans, not because of them.  i there is one thing that bush has not achieved in any respect it is excellence.   

i really am a great fan of western values, they are actually very liberating, and i encourage all to study the greeks and romans to see what values resulted in positive developments in civilization, and which values have not.  looking to the past gives us a fine way to see the effects of various values in a way where we can be more neutral than when looking to our own times.   i think that much of the greatness of the west of the past was due to their attention to classical values, and many of the horrors of the west a result of a lack thereof.   i am afraid that the other fount. of western though, christianity, while holding some ideals that are quite noble, has inserted a few values that i don't hold in high regard at all.  

if there is one (not uniquely) western value i do hold as being particularly ugly, it's a core value of too much of christendom, i don't have a single term for it, but it's the view that if one cannot ""save"" the stranger by converting them, then they are the devil, and should be regarded as evil.  both christians and muslims both hold this odious view.  it accounts for the persecution of the jews through history, after all if they don't convert they're the devil to be slain by christian soldiers/jihad.  while i don't think that western leaders really believe in it (i'd say most leaders are much to machiavellian to really believe their rhetoric), they abuse it as a way to win support for conquest, and it has been used an excuse for many more evils in the history of islam and christendom, from the muslim conquest of india which exterminated buddhism from that subcontinent (indian buddhism was largely monastic, and the monks didn't fight back), as well as many atrocities by the christians in the new world (the missionaries' cross always seemed to be followed by a sword), and so on.  from reading what you have said, i expect that your demonization of the muslims is really rooted in this).  it is implicit in much of bush's rhetoric, and is at the root of the support by many of his more fanatical supporters, before the invasion i recall reading about a number of churches planning massive missionary expeditions into iraq, though after the invasion the reality set in that bush fumbled the invasion so badly that there was no security whatever, and missionaries would not live there for too long.   while that view is not really the source of war (that's greed, another vice bush has in spades), it's been a justification to rally popular support for them for far too long.

i would be more than happy to see western values triumph in the united states, but i am afraid that while republicans love to throw around adulation in their rhetoric, their leaders' actions make it all too clear that they occasionally talk the talk, but rarely walk the walk.  they appear to me to be completely insincere and cynically abusing rhetoric to win over the credulous, and i count you as either among the credulous for repeating their rhetoric when the facts of their actions speak loud and clear, or as one of the insincere and cynical abusers of rhetoric.  neither is flattering, and i would encourage you to be more self-reflective, it's a wonderful western value, and we would all do well to try harder to live up to it.  remove the log from your own eye before complaining about the speck in your neighbor's eye.

you seem to have a habit of making false dichotomies when they are convenient for you, so i'll make it clear in advance that i am not apologizing for the democrats or the left, and i'm certainly not apologizing for islam.  many politicians on that side have their own cynicism, insincerity, and their own different  jesus-complex to get over.  it's irrelevant.  the republicans to not gain any virtue whatever if their opponents lack it.

to continue with chewie - after yoda escapes the wookies are enslaved and distrubuted throughout the empire as slaves. some end up building the death star. most of them end up somewhere. that's how chewie was found - he was rescued by han solo because he was a slave. and han had a life debt because of it.

as for the founders of the rebellion, there were three: mon mothma of chandrila, bail organa of alderaan, and garm bel iblis of corellia. the alliance was formed by something called the corellian treaty, which unified the military of the various anti-empire forces in the galaxy. it wasn't started in the conference room of the tantive iv. leia was never in charge of the rebellion - she was very important, yes, and after the destruction of alderaan became more so - but mon mothma was always in charge. her scenes were cut from episode iii, but if you go and watch the deleted scenes, they're great. especially that one.

the shit about the falcon is ridiculous; it was lando's first and then han won it from him in a sabaac game. this was long before han or lando were involved in the rebellion. you can read the wookiepedia entry here, and while it confirms that the falcon was scene in ep. iii (as a nod to fanboys), it gives nothing of it's real role or who owned it before. there's no established canon about the ownership of the falcon previous to landon owning it.

cy430,t1_cxvl0,"we're talking past each other. you 're failing to understand what i'm saying. let me clarify.

let's start with what you consider (and i can agree) are facts: 

1) assume that all else being equal, medical and food aid increase population.

2) assume that all else being equal, adoption of birth control decreases population.

what can we conclude, based only on the two facts above?

a) if birth control is *not* adopted widely, there will be no decrease due to birth control.

b) the total decrease is crucially related to the amount that birth control reduces births versus the amount that medical and food aid decrease deaths.

so, we're still in the realm of facts. where i disagree with you is how you interpret those facts.

here's my interpretation:

i) birth control has a much greater effect on reducing population than witholding food or medical aid. without reducing births, the slightly increased deaths would be irrelevant.

ii) birth control must be *adopted*, not just mandated in order to work. this requires educated women and an educated populace. in places where the public health and education system is non-existant there are all kinds of superstitions that would prevent women (and men) from adopting birth control, even if it were mandated.

so i conclude that without medical aid (and education!), we will not educate those in poorer countries, and there is no chance of them adopting effective birth control, which makes the other deaths useless.

i think that your proposals would contribute to the conditions that keep people in developing countries uneducated, and unable to effectively implement large-scale birth control.

&gt; again you are 100% wrong that there is room for more. you won't find any scientific studies that say this planet will support 6 billion people living in first world conditions.

you may be right, i don't know. on the other hand, some authorities in the 70's predicted that the world would be out of food by now.

&gt; so the options are to have some people be extremely poor to support western lifestyles or to help curb population, protect the environment and provide a higher standard of living for all.

why don't you ask those people whether they'd rather be poor, or whether they'd rather be dead? let me put that another way. you're asking *us* to decide whether *their lives* are worth living or not.

sure, by all means, prevent more people from being born. i object to your implicit assumption that it's also okay for us to decide that more living people should die.

in any case, assume that an average american (or canadian, or european) does 2-10 times as much harm as an average person in a developing country. clearly, we should start cleaning up at home. immigration is one part of that, but you'll notice that i didn't even object to immigration-controls in my reply.

every poll taken says majority of americans want immigration reduced. cnn, fox, nbc all stations every paper it's the same consistent view. 1.3 million is stupid and not sustainable. it will push us population to 600 million by the year 2100. 

history has also not seen anything like this in america. so we are conducting a massive experiment on the us population, which is a piss poor idea. history has shown that having two different cultures side by side often results in violence and civil war. if you're speaking of mass immigration in other countries it has resulted in civil war. cultures clash and wars happen, that's why nations formed in the first place. but i suppose you are one of these people that thinks america is above a civil war and it couldn't happen hear (again).

yes all countries down there have mass poverty and very little middle class. that is how america will evolve. you are naive to think otherwise. history has shown people bring their culture with them, the only way it goes away is if it is forced to go away. with millions of immigrants there is no need to adapt because you can settle around other immigrants and rebuild your native environment around you.

your assumption that when a construction worker loses his job he suddenly becomes a white collar worker is pretty pathetic. do you think people were working these jobs and waiting for wages to drop so they can quit and get a better paying job? many go on unemployment and many move to an area where there's less immigrants (ca loses massive numbers of americans each year that are fleeing to better states that have blue collar jobs that pay well). it has especially hammered the black communities that have large numbers of immigrants around.

i've been to numerous countries and seen how some are spectacular (japan and singapore) and many are overrun by poverty (mexico, thailand, philippines). i honestly don't care where you've been or what you can speak, because it has no impact on the long term effects of mass immigration to a country. you have pity on people because you've seen them, i have seen the poverty and realize why it's there and why we should avoid it.

some cultures crime is more tolerable. you can ignore that fact, but it doesn't change it. crime in america is tolerated more than japan and singapore. in fact the highest crime rates in japan are around the areas that have the most americans, because people bring their culture with them.

if you think the politicians are doing nothing because it's in the best interest of americans you are naive again. they are doing nothing because they can't see beyond their next election. they don't care about the massive impact 600 million people will have on the resources in america and they won't be alive to see it so they just do what their financial donors want. they won't acknowledge that water supplies are already strained or that the pollution currently made is unsustainable.

i had also heard that women on this diet often don't menstruate.  however, some of the article(s) i read drew the *opposite* conclusion, that it was menstruation that is pathological and the diet that is healthy.  the mechanism proposed was that a low-fruit diet robs the body of chemicals that make blood vessels more resilient and flexible, and so the uterine lining that would otherwise be reabsorbed into the body gets sloughed off and expelled.

i don't have enough information to judge either hypothesis.  however, the fruit-good-menstruation-bad one makes more sense to me, because:

1. menstruation is terrible evolutionarily.  many predators hunt based on the smell of blood.  aside from weakening the body like any hemorrhage, monthly bleeding would also draw predators straight to any human groups.  (perhaps this is also the reason behind menstruation taboos in many societies, along with the custom that women should be isolated while on their period.)
2. other species do not menstruate naturally, but often do when put on the same processed-food diet that humans eat.  for example, wild dogs and wolves do not menstruate, yet domesticated dogs often do.  grass-fed cows do not menstruate, yet corn-fed cows produce a bloody discharge similar to menstrual fluid.

right, which is why hunter-gathering is limited to much smaller population densities than agriculture.  the first couple google results gave a range of 0.15-1.15 people/km^2, which is roughly in line with the figures i've seen for north america's carrying capacity before europeans arrived.  the united states has an area of 9 million km^2, so at the high end of that population density, it'd be able to support 9 million people.  some books i've read suggested it was near the limit of its carrying capacity at 2-3 million, since a large portion of north america isn't suitable for agriculture.

history, in this country, has shown that having **many** cultures side by side has made the us a great place to be.  the civil war here wasn't because of an immigrating population that kept its values from their home country.  now *that's* a ""stupid"" assumption.  do you really think new mexican immigrants will start a civil war in america against everyone else?  really?  right ""hear?""

&gt;history has shown people bring their culture with them, the only way it goes away is if it is forced to go away. with millions of immigrants there is no need to adapt because you can settle around other immigrants and rebuild your native environment around you.

sure, they have already brought their culture with them.  but so has every other immigrant group in this country.  you have chinatowns *everywhere*, but are you arguing we should kick them out too?  i know plenty of people here in america that only speak chinese and live in the ""rebuilt native environment"" you speak of.  you could also make the argument that chinese culture ""tolerates"" more crime.  hell, in china, the *government* commits crimes everyday (murder, kidnapping, extortion, harvesting organs, etc.) and their most beloved leader killed tens of millions of people (mao).

&gt;your assumption that when a construction worker loses his job he suddenly becomes a white collar worker is pretty pathetic. do you think people were working these jobs and waiting for wages to drop so they can quit and get a better paying job?

no, i don't.  i'm just saying in the long run, the economy will adjust itself and make room for more jobs for everyone.  where do you think the immigrants will get their food?  houses?  clothes?  cars?  gas?  all these will have to be provided by *new* jobs.

i understand that in the short run many people will be harmed.  however, eventually it will be better for everyone, and the government can't say one group of people is entitled to a job more than another group.  unless you want to get rid of the free market, which has gotten america to where it is now.

&gt;you have pity on people because you've seen them, i have seen the poverty and realize why it's there and why we should avoid it.

i don't have pity on them.  i just used my situation to illustrate that i am familiar enough with the specific cultures to make a reasonable, informed opinion.  speaking of which, i have lived in korea for several years and i am also familiar with japanese culture.  i speak both languages as well.  from my personal experience, and my general knowledge of those cultures, they are just as prone to different crimes as americans are (north and south).  since you've been to japan, have you ever seen battle royale?  it depicts horrible acts of violence by schoolchildren, and it was popular enough that a sequel was filmed as well.  if you ever watch the news in *any* country (and i've been watching the news in several different countries), you will see similar stories of various crimes taking place.

about singapore, i have also been there.  the government there is extremely strict on any crimes (as americans found out after an american was lashed for his crimes) and so to a casual observer it may seem as though their culture encourages less crime.  however, again, by my personal experience in singapore, china, and the surrounding countries, all of which share a similar culture, the individual people who grew up in that culture are just as prone to violence and crime as any other.

&gt;some cultures crime is more tolerable. you can ignore that fact, but it doesn't change it. crime in america is tolerated more than japan and singapore.

okay, let's assume for a second that perhaps mexican culture *does* tolerate more crime (as preposterous as it is).  perhaps after fresh immigrants arrive *en masse* there might be more crime.  **however**, as they arrive into the country, assuming they become citizens legally, they will be forced to comply to us law, and any crimes will be dealt with.  eventually people will understand that it's *not* okay to commit crimes.

i could argue that certain subcultures of america encourage crime, and i'm sure you can as well.  should we kick them out of the country too?  of course not.

&gt;but i'm pretty certain it won't be worth squat in another 40 years.

type information is a direct requirement for speed, whether it is derived by inference or typed directly by the programmer. so by adding a bit of type-hints in the right places you will be able to make the program go fast.

cy6re,t1_cy2pl,"first of all there is a significant amount of controversy over whether or not multiple inheritance in it's pure form is good.  most modern languages have come to the conclusion it's harmful, thus they have removed it entirely.  ruby's mixin's are by far the most elegant solution i've seen to the problem of multiple implementation reuse.  once you actually start digging into how mixins work, they offer significantly more power and control to the user than multiple inheritance does.  this isn't really the forum to explain the differences in detail, but if you really grok how they work, there is simply no comparison to python's multiple inheritance, ruby's mixin's are clearly more powerful imo.  consider that mixin's give you all the same level of implementation sharing that multiple inheritance gives, but they also have hooks that allow you to do all kinds of interesting dynamic programming at the time the module is mixed in.

second-class methods is a straw man argument.  you're biggest argument is that it requires an ""altered calling convention"".  the question is can you achieve the same affect and/or do you have more power with ruby's model than with python's.  ruby's power in this area lies in how flexible and powerful blocks and proc's are.  generally procs are full lambda functions as opposed to the broken lambda's in python.  blocks give you the full power of lambda's, co-routines, lexical closures, and first class funtions all rolled into one.  blocks are more powerful in their implementation than python's first class functions because the syntax of ruby explicitly uses them.  they also form a much more natural style of programming than does passing in a function to another function, but this is largely a matter of taste.  of course high order functions aren't generally considered oo, so we are ranging beyond the realm of my post, but imo, i still prefer ruby's solution.

i'm not quite sure what you mean about not being able to extend ruby's method/attribute lookup mechanism.  are you referring to the magic methods in python or handling missing methods on a called object?  ruby's method_missing handles any methods called that don't exist in the lookup hierarchy.  the magic methods in python were designed because true functional programming in python is broken.  instead ruby uses blocks all over the place, which are more powerful and feel less hackish than magic methods.

no support for metaclasses?  ruby has very powerful metaclass programming capabilities.  however ruby's concept of metaclass isn't exactly the same as python's.  it sounds to me like you are expecting all of ruby's idiom's to map 1 to 1 to python's.  the thing to realize is that ruby has different core idea's than python, and many things are handled very differently.  rather than looking for some specific function or thing, you have to look at the overall goal of what you are trying to accomplish.  that's exactly why superficial comparisons between languages are flawed.  metaclass programming in my opinion is about dynamic programming.  it's generally not considered good form and is hard to work with in python.  in ruby it's a first class citizen and there are numerous facilities for handling different problems via eval, class_eval, instance_eval, adding or modifying classes at run time, or adding or modifying objects at run time.  again it's important to learn how to accomplish something in a new language instead of looking for a specific thing that was in your old language.  that's the mistake that people that don't really understand a new language make repeatedly.

python is a very powerful language, it's definitely my second favorite.  however i find ruby's syntax more natural, more uniform, and more powerful when i'm programming with it.  like any concept, it's tough to explain how powerful certain ideas are to someone who doesn't understand them.  explaining something like blocks and procs in ruby to a python programmer who doesn't really grok ruby is like trying to explain recursion or high order functions to someone that uses a language that doesn't support those ideas.  when your language lacks a feature, people find ways to work around that idea and they wonder why that feature is even useful.  when you find a language that implements that idea in a powerful way, your horizon expands and you begin to wonder how you ever solved problems without it.  in my humble opinion much of ruby is this way compared to python.",beowulf,2007-01-13 09:09:34,programming,1,straight: het

cy6wu,t1_cy6ss,"you can't ""cancel"" checks.  you can have a stop payment issued on a check but it's limited in duration which makes that option next to worthless plus it costs a lot to do a stop payment.  i had a check get lost in the mail once. i had to send another check.   stop payment on the old check wasn't an option since the stop payment is only temporary.  so in theory the lost check could be found and legitimately cashed and my account balances get screwed up, though i have a line of credit which would help.

for stolen checks, you can ignore the problem.  if the checks get used though, your checking account will get debited and maybe overdrawn with consequences thereof.  you will have to file a police report and wait for things to get straightened out but you will have a lot of pissed off creditors.  checking is not like credit cards where you can just contest the charges and it become someone else's problem.  the best bet would be to go to a new account.

a little off topic, but avoid debit cards if you can.  they're the worst of both worlds.  not only can you not dispute debit card charges but if your debit card is compromised, they can drain your checking account and all your checks will bounce, pissing off all your creditors and taking months to straighten out.  there is a trivial solution to this problem which is to just create a debit card sub account separate from your checking sub account.  but banks can't be bothered to make this most trivial of changes since they could not care less about customer service.",jseigh,2007-01-13 09:56:05,reddit.com,7,"straight: straight, straight: straight"

(quick summary for those with short attention spans: perhaps surprisingly, most populations (excluding outlying cases such as pygmies) have very similar height potentials. apparent differences between geographical areas are related to other factors, including illness and nutrition. perhaps unsurprisingly, some of these factors are based on racism of the ""ruling class"".)

""by and large, though, any population can grow as tall as any other.

this last point may sound counterintuitive. height, like skin color, seems to vary with geography: we think of squat peruvians, slender masai, stocky inuit, and lanky brazilians. according to bergmann’s rule and allen’s rule, animals in cold climates tend to have larger bodies and shorter limbs than those in warm climates. but though climate still shapes musk oxen and giraffes—and a willowy inuit is hard to find—its effect on industrialized people has almost disappeared. swedes ought to be short and stocky, yet they’ve had good clothing and shelter for so long that they’re some of the tallest people in the world. mexicans ought to be tall and slender. yet they’re so often stunted by poor diet and diseases that we assume they were born to be small.

in the early nineteen-seventies, when the anthropologist barry bogin first visited guatemala, the country’s two main ethnic groups seemed to live on different social planes. the ladinos, who claimed primarily spanish ancestry, were of average height. the maya indians were so short that some scholars called them the pygmies of central america: the men averaged only five feet two, the women four feet eight. the ladinos and the maya shared the same small country, so their differences were assumed to be genetic. but when bogin, who now teaches at the university of michigan, began taking measurements he soon found another cause. “there was an undeclared war going on,” he says. the ladinos, who controlled the government, had systematically forced the maya into poverty. whether they lived in the city or in the countryside, the maya had less food and medicine, and they had much higher rates of disease.

a decade and a half later, after civil war had erupted and up to a million guatemalans had fled to the united states, bogin took another series of measurements. this time, his subjects were mayan refugees, between six and twelve years old, in florida and los angeles. “lo and behold, they were much taller than the maya in guatemala,” """,jbert,2007-01-13 16:05:23,reddit.com,7,straight: het

personally i don't think scotland can devolve. i don't think it has the infrastructure. if nothing else, it just hasn't enough people to create strong enough leaders. or strong enough business people to create the wealth and success. it's a small country that's two-thirds uninhabited (ie the highlands). the whole of britain suffers from a similar problem. the best that the whole of britain could put forward to run the country was blair and brown (scots, both of them, but that's beside the point!). there's a real chance that the next leader of the country is a guy who calls himself ""dave"", who hasn't the will-power to give up the fags, and who believes that putting a windmill in his back garden will stop global warming! we just haven't a good sample of people in the whole of britain, so scotland isn't going to fare any better.",finbaloo,2007-01-13 17:22:37,reddit.com,-2,gay: fag

this is simply rubbish. there are plenty of small and successful countries. scottish financial institutions make up about a quarter of the financial institutions in the uk despite only having one tenth of the population. economically scotland would be *better* off independent of england. economic policy in the uk is london centred, the interest rates required to hold inflation in the south east to reasonable levels since the uk came off the gold standard have devastated growth levels of the rest of the uk, that includes the north of england btw, as well as scotland. by joining the eu, scotland would benefit from far lower interest rates and would have the ability to set lower corporate taxes as well. growth would improve dramatically. that can't be done without independence.

i mean, i know men do it. even my darling, uber nerdy boyfriend confessed to removing his engineering ring when he’d go out to meet woman lest they catch a whiff of his less prestigious career and flee, but nobody can have a lasting relationship based on lies. seriously, there are girl out there who like the traits you think disqualify you. in example i happen to think his trade is cool.

i still stand by my statement that mate selection is something where it's fine to seem irrationally picky. for example (i'm going to assume you're not bi) would you date a man? that's 50% of the human race many, many people rule out. you can chose not to pair with someone for any number of reasons that might make them unattractive to you. don’t like my gender example? well, would you really go with –anyone- of the right gender if they offered?

about the case of the girl going for a man with money, not you: i'm saying you shouldn't be angry with the girl for not picking you. if you must contemplate revenge, think about how that when you're a well-established man you'll laugh when gold diggers throw themselves at you. and then buy a pretty necklace for the girl you married/are currently attached to, who loves you for yourself. ;)

and yes, you should give up if you're chasing the sort of girl who will show more interest in your moneyed rival. not because you're unworthy of female company in general (you're not), but that it's a waste of your energy to go after the sort of girl who won’t find you interesting.

not all girls are gold diggers. for example, i personally find the fact that my boyfriend is highly skilled, intelligent and just a little evil what makes him attractive. he doesn't have a pile of bling, just the desire to work hard to get one, just like me.

and finally, as a female, to say that we are all, as a gender, interested only in power, prestige and what’s in your chequebook is more then a little insulting. that’s as inaccurate as saying ‘all men want is a busty blonde who just turned legal this morning’

from a programming standpoint, the game is divided into two phases: autonomous and driver-controlled.  most of the time is spent in the straightforward driver-controlled code -- ""take analog joystick value and send it to the motor controllers as a pwm signal"".  in the first fifteen seconds of each round, however, the robot must act without human intervention.  this is where you get some room for creativity -- though excessive creativity can yield unreliable performance.

cy96a,t3_y6wb,"wow.  where the hell did this guy get his doctorate from?  some of the mistakes and half-truths in the entry:

&gt; 1) money supply growth has gone parabolic.

i think he means exponential.  parabolic curves grow as y=x^2, which isn't what the rest of the article talks about.

&gt; every road, factory, bridge, school, factory, and house built, every unit of economic transaction that ever took place over those first 350 years required the creation of $1 trillion in money stock.

no - roads, factories, bridges, etc. do not require the creation of *any* money stock.  the u.s. money supply was more-or-less constant up until 1933, because it was backed by gold.  the government could not create any money that it did not have gold on hand for, and so the money supply could rise only with the gold supply, i.e. very slowly.

all those roads, factories, bridges etc. took 350 years of *time* to build.  money is just the medium of exchange: it determines the price level, and in the short run it can have real effects on the economy, but it doesn't *create* goods.  only people can do that.

economists usually speak of the ""velocity"" of money, defined as gdp / money supply.  in simple terms, it's the number of times each dollar changes hands every year.  value is created in these transactions.  gdp is the real measure of how much was constructed.  

&gt; every single dollar in circulation is loaned into existence by a bank, with interest. 

well, almost.  economists classify the money supply into a bunch of different categories:

* m0 is physical cash, the greenbacks that you can touch and feel.  in the u.s, this comes to about $688 billion (much of this is probably in the hands of foreign governments and drug dealers).
* m1 is m0 + checking accounts, anything you can freely access.  in the u.s, this is about $1.4 trillion.
* m2 is m1 + savings accounts.  in the u.s, this is about $6.5 trillion.
* m3 is m2 + some exotic securities i don't understand.  in the u.s, this is about $9.7 trillion.  this is the number that has grown rapidly over the last 5 years.

i've heard that some economists go up to m8 in describing other forms of money, though m3 is the highest you see in most traditional economics textbooks.  it's rather difficult for the government to keep tabs on *all* money, because anything that can be used as a medium of exchange in transactions is technically money.  where does paypal fit in, for example?  how about transactions in second life?  what about open-source projects where you're expected (though not required) to commit your changes back?

banks *do* create money through loans.  whenever a bank makes a loan, the debtor now has the cash available to spend.  however, the depositor *also* can still spend that money.  essentially, you have multiple people with claims on the same piece of physical currency.  

banks operate on a ""fractional reserve"" system, so they must hold back a portion of their cash to satisfy depositors.  in the u.s, the reserve requirement is 10% for checking accounts and zero for savings account.  yes, this does allow the bank to create money ad-infinitum: if the debtor takes the money he just borrowed and puts it in a savings account, the bank can loan 100% of it out again to another debtor, who can then deposit it in a savings account, and so on.  but a debtor would have to be stupid to do this, because he earns less money on a savings account than he pays in interest.  

stock and real estate bubbles are a much bigger problem: the debtor may take that money and buy a house with it (driving up house prices in the process).  the seller then takes the proceeds + a loan and buys another, larger house for more money - driving up house prices in the process.  meanwhile, everyone else on the block has taken cash-out home equity loans and converted their rising house prices into currency, thus adding to the money supply.  everybody's acting rationally until house prices start declining, in which case debtors find their houses aren't appreciating enough to pay back the interest on their loans.  they default and the bank has to write off the loan, which means that the bank must raise their interest rates to bring their outstanding loans into balance with their new reserves.  this causes still more homeowners to default, with a big deflationary spiral as credit collapses.

anyway, enough about how he may be right and back to how he's wrong...

&gt; if all money in circulation is loaned into existence it means that if every loan were paid back, all our money would disappear.

well, except for m0, the currency stock.

&gt; if you guessed “from additional loans” you are a winner! said another way, for interest to be paid, the money supply must expand.

only half right.  the nominal interest rate charged on a loan has two components.  there's the real interest rate, which is the fee charged by the lendor for use of his money.  there's also the inflation rate.  by definition, nominal interest rate = real interest rate + inflation.

saying his statement in yet another way, the interest payment has two components.  the inflation component comes from additional loans (either directly or indirectly), as a result of the money supply increasing.  the real interest rate comes from the added productivity that the debtor managed to obtain by taking out the loan - it's basically a share of his labor, paid to the supplier of capital for lending that capital.  hopefully, he really was more productive: people who take out loans to finance consumption are stupid, and this unfortunately includes many americans today.

&gt; exponential functions are sneaky buggers. one minute everything seems fine, the next minute your flask is full and there’s nowhere left to grow.

e^x is also an exponential function, and yet that really *does* keep growing forever and never crashes.

before you chastise me for an irrelevant mathematical formula, it really is analogous.  the money supply is *just a number*: as we saw above, 90% of money doesn't physically exist.  there're no physical constraints as to how much it can grow.  people just get used to it increasing by 2% or so every year.

in actual economies that have suffered severe inflation, the government usually fixes it by reissuing a new series of bills that are convertible at 1:1000 or 1:1000000 or some other large multiple.  so things that would cost $1200 of the old bills instead cost $1.20.  the inflation itself is painful (remember, these countries often inflate at 100% or more per year), but the monetary reset is not.

bacteria etc. actually grow on a [logistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logistics_function) function, which only applies when there is a resource constraint in the environment.  so it's flatly wrong to say that exponential curves always collapse: by definition, exponential curves *don't* collapse, and natural phenomena that do are modeled by a different function.

&gt; just remember, money is supposed to be a store of value or, said another way, a store of human effort. currently it seems to be failing at meeting that characteristic and therefore is failing at being money.

why does everybody always forget the ""medium of exchange"" purpose for money.  there *is* no value if you don't have trade, there's only people building their own tools.  you don't need money for that.",nostrademons,2007-01-13 23:28:34,reddit.com,5,gay: trade

in this case it's not the loss of electrolytes per se but rather the relative decrease in their plasma concentration. your kidneys are mainly responsible for making the adjustments:

drink a lot of hypertonic fluid (e.g., sea water), your sodium concentration will go up, and your kidneys will dump small, concentrated (colored) amounts of urine to bring you back down.

drink a lot of hypotonic fluid (e.g, straight water), and your kidneys will dump large amounts of dilute (clear) urine to bring your sodium concentration back up.

cyfsm,t3_yffa,"three main things stood out about this, for me. firstly, the title is highly misleading. ""90 years in prison for having child pornography found on your computer"" sounds like an unusually harsh sentence but hardly an insane travesty (or at least, not a surprising one). sure, the original article makes the same absurd conflation of 'porn' and 'child porn' but that's not an example to emulate.

secondly, how responsible is this kid? i mean, he's sixteen at the time of the offense he's being charged with, if i'm reading that correctly - how can a sixteen-year-old be sentenced to 90 years? and the deal at the end - pleading guilty to a sex offense of distributing pornography to minors, because you showed some kids your own age a playboy - what the hell? the article does say that the state has among the harshest child porn laws in the us, but surely *any* law relating to supplying things 'to minors' should take into account whether the offender himself is a minor?

thirdly, i found the article frustratingly vague on the actual crime and sloppy in its discussion of the technical aspects of the case.

&gt;""if you have an internet connection, high speed, through, let's say, your cable company, or through the phone company, that computer is always on, and basically you have an open doorway to the outside,"" loehrs said.

i think what she meant to say was ""if you have a high speed connection and your computer is always on..."", but that's a pretty muddled quote. it comes off as saying that having a high-speed connection itself means your computer is always on and open to the outside. that's pretty misleading; and if it's really what she meant, does anyone know what she's talking about?

&gt;""it means that computers are not safe,"" said jeannie. ""i don't want to have one in my house. under even under the strictest rules and the strictest security, your computer is vulnerable.""

there was no indication in the article that they had *any* rules or security relating to the computer, let alone 'the strictest'. the article's handling of the risks associated with computer security was pretty sloppy. no real details were given as to what, exactly, the kid was supposed to have done - apparently there were images on his computer, but they also talk about his having accessed a particular ""yahoo account"" - what's the link? talking about a real danger in such vague terms is pretty sensationalist.",kamikasei,2007-01-14 16:32:00,reddit.com,41,straight: het

note, i am not an expert of any kind in any branch of law.  however, one of my clients was a domestic abuse resource organization, and i've read one or two horror stories.

for example, statutory rape laws do not take the age of the rapist into account.  at the least i'm pretty sure this is true in my state of wisconsin.  there is probably a rational justification for this, though i can't imagine what it is.  however, it can result in horror stories when, for example, two teenagers have sex, and one set of parents finds out and decides to press charges against the teen who had sex with their child.  because their child is in their custody, they are the ones running the show when it comes to legal prosecution.

science is indeed more sensitive to negative results than religion (as proven by the fact that newtonian mechanics was eventually abandoned, while creationism lives on), but this isn't what makes science and religion different. religion is a form of ritualistic behaviour that may or may not be supported by a theory. it is a cultural artifact, not an acedemic enterprise. it ministers to spritual needs, rather than being a dispassionate quest for the truth. it makes substantive ethical claims, rather than being value neutral. the differences between the two are vast, and cannot be boiled down to one single difference.

you say that physicists are searching for a model that explains all phenomena, but wouldn't such a theory be true, and therefore aren't they searching for the truth? i'm not saying they would ever *know* that the theory they have is 100% true, or that they would sit back and stop trying to falsify it. i'm just saying that this is what they're looking for, even though they know in advance that they will never be able to prove that the theory is true, and hence will be pursuing the task forever.",cchooper,2007-01-14 20:45:10,reddit.com,8,gay: boi

however, i have a suspicion that you are using veiled mockery, or 'satire'. if this is the case, then you have descended into juvenilia that supports my case. you will notice that i have requested your reading and due response to my statements prior, to which you have provided none. you are fully capable of doing so, as you have had no trouble responding to my statements proper. however, you have rendered me unable to respond to yours. i can not become fluent in latin without years of education, so, lest you have the patience to wait several years, which assumes that this website will exist with all of its current content, you can not possibly be serious in your proposition.

if it is proper 'satire', then from what i can gather, your argument is such that one should not be able to say what one ""should"" know or be forced to do. however, there are several problems with the way you have presented your case, primarily your contention that latin is the ideal language that one should learn. many states already make it required to attend foreign language classes, but relatively few require latin. this is not much different than what you are proposing, except that they do not elect to teach latin in many areas. it would not be unreasonable, then, to say that an expectance of fluency of latin from me is absurd. if this is the case, then you have yet to provide a proper rebuttal, for your current rebuttal is not a proper reducto ad absurdium - it does not follow the conventions of what i am suggesting, because it refers to a policy that is highly questionable in its merit, and unimplemented - one can not garner the fruits of such a policy without the policy's implementation.

i suggest, if my suspicions are correct, to cease any juvenilia that you may desire to actuate. it seems that you have a distaste for rules, policy, and formality, evident by your avoidance of formal debate and a method of evasion that would grant you an immediate disqualification had you been in one. i have entered this debate, like all of those who enter proper debates, to learn through reasoning. you have, after all, stated that you wish to know what others think of the policy. my objective is not to ""win"", which is counter to the goals of logic, though presumably the juvenile objective of many. if i am to venture a guess for your current evasion, it could be possible that it is done because you did not desire such a response, only agreement. 

if this is to become a waste of time, then not only have i further evidence for my reasoning, but i have no purpose for further engagement. if you wish to prove otherwise, give prompt proper retort to the contentions argued in ""gfbhehrn""; if there is no such proper retort, then my cause is purposeless and i will immediately cease any communication.",etyuetuye,2007-01-15 04:58:17,reddit.com,1,gay: fruit

however, once the people have created warp drive they must be dealt with in a different way because now you will run into them in space and will have to deal with their culture.

the episode that drives the writer crazy could just as easily have been written with a different ending (an in my opinion should have been written with a different ending).

2. the cured race rises in power and kills off the other race, that was otherwise about to win the planet. 
3. our intervention, although well intentioned, actually lead to massive genocide. 

this is what the writers should have written, and this is the type of scenario that captures the spirit of the prime directive. you are not as smart as you think you are. your attempts to aid another primitive culture will likely end really badly. leave them alone until you are forced to deal with them!

cyjjj,t1_cyfy1,"i agree that there is an implicit belief that white on black crime is more newsworthy - equivalent to ""man bites dog"" (as pointed out by mynameishere).

but this is only half the truth: there's also disincentive to promote black-on-white crime stories because of the threat of accusations of racism.

both these aspects of the vuu story need to be acknowledged; otherwise, you have people like rocky_m who will ""spin"" the vuu story into somehow demonstrating implicit racism against blacks.

speaking in such half-truths is characteristic of racists, black and white.  rowd149 does the same thing above, by saying that the black crime rate is ""not about being black, it's about being poor.""  certainly economic conditions have something to do with it, but no one can deny the partial culpability of black culture itself, in glorifying crime and failing to protect its youth from bad influences.",chchatham,2007-01-15 11:36:57,reddit.com,1,gay: wsw

&gt; he brought the unemployment rate below the average rates for the 70s, 80s, and 90s.

if you pick the right start and end times, you can make any time look comparatively good. i'd like to remind you that the '70s were marked by the chronic macroeconomic malaise called stagflation, which was produced when the price of oil quadrupled overnight, and the '80s were a decade of high real interest rates (in the summer of 1981, the prime hit 21 percent), severe, economic volatility, and high real public and private debts.

clearly he did not appoint his advisers based on merit. his attorney general argued that the geneva convention against torture was quaint and outdated, and that's just about all anyone needs to know about the top law enforcement official in the country. 

his secretary of state completely missed the boat on the intelligence community's warnings to bush in summer 2001 that a major terrorist attack was in the works. she made the ridiculous statement in january 2003, ""we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud,"" in regards to saddam's alleged wmd. she also disgraced her office by campaigning, as national security advisor, on bush's behalf before the 2004 presidential election.",[deleted],2007-01-15 12:57:53,reddit.com,3,gay: gay

cyklk,t1_cyic7,"actually, there is. in humans, it's turning out that epi-genetics is very important in human biology. we have suprisingly few genes, but between individuals, while the # of different genes doesn't vary, the number of copies can. breast cancer tumor promoting genes are known to 'multiply' inside the genome of cells that later become cancerous in susceptible women. between you and your brother, you may have different numbers of the same gene.  

human b cells are literally rewriting their dna all the time as they try and make anti-bodies to attack invaders.

bacteria grown in certain cultures and under different stressors, either shed unnecessary genes as they unessential to survival, or survive as 'junk' genes mutate under stress yielding a novel protein that aids their survival. i've seen the last example in a freshman biology class. it's quite impressive.

usually the biggest chestnut trotted out is that ""why haven't we seen one species become another"". well, that tends to be slow. but there is an example happening right now. dogs are bred for different roles. their selective pressure is human desire, whether their use for a given job or their appearance. their 'evolution' is sped up drastically because humans put incredible adaptive pressure on them. historically, unwanted puppies ended up in a sack in the river. the 'rejects' rarely got a chance to reproduce , as humans were a harsher selection agent than nature.

""but humans are playing god! we're the intelligent designer"" no more so than dogs living up north would survive better in the wild with long fur, and those down south would survive better with short hair. we're just speeding up the selection because of utility! 

one common misconception is that seperate species can't interbreed and produce viable offspring. not necessarily. many closely related species could possibly interbreed and produce viable offspring, but don't because...

1) the sexes of opposite species don't find each other attractive
2) geological barriers
3) physical incompatibility ( size, anatomy )

as any of these barriers appear, then the species are well on their way to becoming genetically incompatible as well. without interbreeding, genetic differences continue to pile up until 2 species can not successfully interbreed and produce viable offspring at all.

and with dogs, we have one good example. chihuahuas and great danes. oh sure, we could probably inseminate the female of either breed, and get puppies. but out in the wild, physical interbreeding between the two would be rare.  and over time, genetic drift would eventually make them into 2 seperate species genetically. but for all practical purposes they already are.

it would be interesting to study great dane and chihuahuas at a genetic level, and if there was viability data for the interbreeding of the 2, see how many viable offspring could result. my bet is they may already have serious issues genetically with producing viable offspring.",CrusoethePainter,2007-01-15 15:16:20,reddit.com,2,straight: het

we can't begin scaling down the strength of the troops less than 700,000 before 7 or 8 years have passed. we'd want the full 1.5 million there for the first 3 years. and we'd probably need several hundred thousand there for as long as 10 to 15 years.

in other words, insanely expensive, so much so that we could never hope to afford it.

&gt;however, even with 1.5 million troops it doesn't stop the insurgency from building up. they will start with wherever troop presence is the lightest. even in towns with lots of troops, that's just more targets for ieds. the problem is that mere numbers do not tell you which of the people walking down the street is the culprit; that's always the problem of occupiers and resistance.

of course with 1.5 million troops trained very differently than they are now, efficiently acting as a police force, and not a military force, speaking the language, they'd be able to stop some of it before it happened. ieds need to be planted, and if there's always a patrol rolling through, if there are squads going out on foot, keeping an eye on things... 

and if things are better with us there (hah, in theory, mind you), there would be real informants helping us to arrest those insurgents blowing people and buildings up. as it is now though, they're the heroes, not us.

cyl36,t1_cyken,"the word ""primitive"" as used in relation to civilization or culture (and that is what we are talking about) has nothing to do with biological evolution. our culture is loaded with rituals that prevent use of violence. 

humans (as a biological species) are generally extremely peaceful (when is the last time you had a physical fight?). we have rituals to prevent violence. those rituals are taught intensively to children. the basic teaching is to not do to others what you don't want others to do to you. it is interesting to notice that there is a need to teach this. maybe it is not in our genes. but nevertheless we (most of us) are able to learn that it helps to imagine ourselves in the position of someone else.

a civilization with a limited reservoir of rituals to prevent violence can be called ""primitive"". such a civilization will use violence easier and ofter. violence on the level of a civilization is called war. and wars are destructive, cooperation bears fruit. you won't meet any space-travelling civilization that hasn't found a way to minimize or even totally control the use of violence.


as for the biological interpretation of the word primitive: you are placing organisms on a ladder based on brain size. that is a classic human-centered view of the living world. in modern biology there is no relation between brain size and primitivity. there is no evolutionary ladder from single celled eukaryotes (ever seen violent plants or fungi?) to humans. there is the tree of life. and we can only conclude that insects are the most successful group (and not humans, apes or even mammals) as measured in number of individuals, number of species and probably even in total weight of organic matter.",TakaIta,2007-01-15 17:22:56,reddit.com,2,gay: fruit

talkorigins.org is a site discussing the biological and physical origins of species. it's primary concern is therefore with natural history, not the contention that god created the world in order that it may evolve according to natural selection, and similar positions (although i have no doubt that such questions are also discussed there.) it does not exist to tell creationists what they believe, or even to discuss what the word 'creationism' means, but to discuss the truth of natural selection. if you agree with current theories of natural selection, then you are on their side and they are not criticising you. they are simply using the word 'creationism' in a way that you object to, but which is nevertheless, for better or worse, the popular meaning.

as for aristotle: apologies for assuming that you were citing him as an example of an atheist, but that is very much what you earlier post sounded like. i can't really argue about whether 'the theistic view of the world has always assumed evolution' is true because i don't understand what progressive development means in this context. aristotle believed all things were progressing towards their final cause, so did he believe in progressive development? is someone who believes in economic progress a believer in progressive development?

*1. lots of people believe them.*
no one insisted we respect the beliefs of the branch davidians. no one argues that we must respect the beliefs of the schizophrenic who believes that aliens live in his nasal passages. we simply acknowledge these beliefs as false, and those who are offended by this must deal with it, because it is their problem, not ours.

cylm0,t1_cy6re,"&gt; first of all there is a significant amount of controversy over whether or not multiple inheritance in it's pure form is good.  most modern languages have come to the conclusion it's harmful, thus they have removed it entirely.

only languages with broken, ambiguous multiple inheritance. :)  the c3 linearization scheme i linked to was introduced to avoid these problems:  far from being abandoned, it is being actively adopted by an increasing number of new languages.  (ruby's own module/mixin system is a partial implementation of it.)

&gt; once you actually start digging into how mixins work, they offer significantly more power and control to the user than multiple inheritance does.

if you're talking about something like c++'s multiple inheritance, yes, but not modern, linearizing multiple inheritance, which mixins are almost, but not quite, an implementation of.  specifically, if you split python's classes into two limited, non-overlapping groups, one without the ability to multiply inherit, and one without the ability to be instantiated, and changed the latter's linearization scheme to one of the non-consistent variants discussed in the c3 paper ([depending on your ruby version](http://talklikeaduck.denhaven2.com/articles/2006/10/09/a-subtle-change-to-mixin-semantics-in-ruby-1-9)), you would essentially have ruby's classes and modules, respectively.

[this ruby-core post](http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/1442) by mathieu bouchard has more to say about it:

&gt; _mixins are not any more ""controlled"", in that everything you can do with real"" multiple-inheritance (in lisp for example) can be also achieved in ruby, if one is willing to turn every class into a module, and to make a dummy class for each module so that this module becomes instantiable.  mixins are more ""controlled"" in the sense that you have rather arbitrary restrictions that provide no advantage and have to be circumvented._
&gt; 
&gt; _i assert that ruby is essentially a multiple-inheritance language, but with unnecessary complications, rather than a single-inheritance language with an added cool-sounding feature._

(end quote)

&gt; second-class methods is a straw man argument.  you're biggest argument is that it requires an ""altered calling convention"".

it is a concern when you're trying to write generic code;  the altered calling convention hinders writing code which doesn't need to care about the difference.  (why do you think programming language people are always making such a big deal out of first-class support for things? :)

second-class methods are also, for example, why magically vivified per-object singleton classes are required to get the same effect as simply assigning a method directly to an instance.

&gt; i'm not quite sure what you mean about not being able to extend ruby's method/attribute lookup mechanism.

well, in python, instance methods, class methods, static methods, properties (the equivalent of ruby's attribute accessors) and so on are not actually fixed into the language, but are user-level implementations of the more generic descriptor protocol.

&gt; the magic methods in python were designed because true functional programming in python is broken.  instead ruby uses blocks all over the place, which are more powerful and feel less hackish than magic methods.

eh?  magic/special methods are used for the same purposes (operator overloading and such) in both python and ruby.  i don't see how they're relevant to functional programming, blocks, or this discussion.

&gt; no support for metaclasses? ruby has very powerful metaclass programming capabilities. however ruby's concept of metaclass isn't exactly the same as python's.

""metaclass programming"" (a useful umbrella term) is not the same as actual metaclasses (a well-defined object system feature).  ruby (of course) supports the former in varied ways, but not latter.

&gt; it sounds to me like you are expecting all of ruby's idiom's to map 1 to 1 to python's.  the thing to realize is that ruby has different core ideas than python, and many things are handled very differently.

right.  i'm talking about what is and isn't expressible, not about looks.

&gt; metaclass programming in my opinion is about dynamic programming. it's generally not considered good form and is hard to work with in python.

what gives you this impression?  python supports metaclass and other dynamic programming (with and without actual metaclasses) just fine.

if you're thinking specifically of python programmers' disdain for ruby-style ""monkey-patching"", this is not because python makes this hard to do (it doesn't), but only because python's culture tries to encourage alternatives that are considered more modular and maintainable.

&gt; in ruby it's a first class citizen and there are numerous facilities for handling different problems via eval, class\_eval, instance\_eval, adding or modifying classes at run time, or adding or modifying objects at run time.

right, same as in python.

&gt; like any concept, it's tough to explain how powerful certain ideas are to someone who doesn't understand them. explaining something like blocks and procs in ruby to a python programmer who doesn't really grok ruby is like trying to explain recursion or high order functions to someone that uses a language that doesn't support those ideas.

forgive my hubris, but i'm pretty sure i understand how blocks, procs, and so on work.  did you actually look at metaclasses, c3 linearization, or descriptors before you dismissed them so cheerfully? :)",pjdelport,2007-01-15 19:46:47,programming,1,straight: het

now, i hate wal-mart with a passion and haven't set foot in one since 2002, however, every one i had ever been in had huge gaps in places.  this also happens in places like your supermarket, target, kmart, etc., when they have sales.  you'll often see big open spaces because people have restocked the shelves.

this guy also didn't need to take so many biased pictures.  for example, the cardboard displays.  you see these everywhere.  he takes photos of two of the four sides.  one is completely empty.  well, it's a 4-sided display.  what the hell can you do but leave it until the other three sides are empty?

a lot of the photos are also photos of shelves half empty, with no indication of a good sale or if someone just got the frosted flakes munchies and bought the whole lot.

fruit bins get empty.  oooo i'm so shocked people buy fruit.  the only two shots worth noting there was the bitten into peach and the broken apple.

we're also supposed to be shocked that people leave crap all over the store.  this is not shocking.  people decide halfway through that they don't want/need/can't afford whatever, so it gets dropped where they are.  really, how many of you actually go back to the place you picked something up from and put it back after you decided you weren't going to buy it?  again, i see this in every store i've ever been in.

i will say that all the spills are nasty and there's no excuse why they hadn't been cleaned up.  however, it only takes an hour or so for a tootsie roll pop to stick to anything.  if you have kids, you know what i mean.

the sunlight dish soap is the only bottle on the shelf.  it's label is half ripped off.  i have seen many places still try to sell a product in this condition because, even a discounted sale brings in money.

those rubbermaid blue and red bins are also a problem for most stores.  people pull them down, look at them and never put them back up.  i used to work in a sporting goods store and our baseball gloves and batting gloves always looked like this aisle with the bins.  why?  because you clean the stuff up and twenty minutes later it's a mess again.  at some point you give up and say, ""fuck it, i'll wait 'til we close to clean it.""

wal-mart also sells their bananas dirt cheap.  i have never seen their bananas more expensive than any other shop in town.  it's not surprising that the shelves for these are empty.

wal-mart parking lots, nationwide, are always filthy too.  i always assumed it was a testament to those that would consider shopping there.  this guy also said that he went at 8:30pm.  that parking lot is awful empty for that time of night.  maybe this town is small enough that everyone is at home but it just seems strange to me to see one of their lots so empty.

while i do agree that a lot of wal-mart's are not the cleanest places in the world, we simply do not have enough information about the area, time of year, sales, etc., to make an informed decision.  this could have just been the ""day from hell"" or ""status quo"" for this store.",berberine,2007-01-16 04:35:36,reddit.com,7,"gay: fruit, gay: fruit"

&gt; truth: this is the biggest mistake i ever made. i used to be loyal to whomever i was with, even when someone better came along. all that happened was that i missed out on some great opportunities while i hung on with losers that ended up dumping me anyway. do this if the two of you are getting married; once you've tied the knot it's a whole other can of worms. however, if you're just dating, do exactly the opposite. in very subtle ways you have to let her know that although you like her, there are lots of other women out there and you still notice them. glance at tits and legs. smile at and chat with pretty ladies, even while she's with you (you're just being friendly, of course). this is the most important thing i've learned about dating in a decade. i even thought of dating wasp bitches again, so long as i could keep this in mind. never, never let her know that she's the only game in town. as soon as she believes that she's your ""everything,"" she'll start whining and bitching and making demands.

&gt; think of it like buying a car. if you let the salesman know that this is your dream car, that you've stayed awake nights thinking about buying exactly this car, do you think the price will go down? of course not! he'll jack the price up as high as he thinks he can go and still have you buy it. if you tell your girl that you've dreamed all of your life of going out with someone like her, do you think she'll smile and kiss you and things will go on as before? of course not! she'll realize that you'll put up with more of her bad habits, and that she can put up with fewer of yours, and the bitching will start. she'll try to make the relationship as comfortable for her as possible and still keep it going. remember the car salesman? remember the attitude that ""this is a nice car, but there are hundreds of other great ones, including that one across the street"", even as your heart is thumping and you're practically drooling? if you're just dating, this is the attitude to take.

how about big newsmedia? who owns disney corporation, new york times/international herald tribune, washington post/newsweek,aol-time warner/hbo? look at the responsible editors in any major magazine/news channel. hom many % of these are not jews? 10%-20% ? 

this does not mean that they do anything wrong or that there is some secret conspiracy of jews (in fact there used to be big  bias against jews in america, this forced them to move onto new industries en masse, like movies and other media). it just means that there is strong bias. i understand that is politically incorrect to state the fact, but this does not make it go away.",[deleted],2007-01-16 13:34:06,reddit.com,3,gay: wsw

the other angle is that large-scale commercialization has standardized the processes behind production. the fact is that 20 years ago there were very few places that would even have cappuccino, never mind a quality assured product like starbucks (though not the greatest in the world).

standardized product reduces risk even more. people pay for that too.

additionally, and admittedy a bit parenthetically, have you observed that with opposition to the u.s.'s occupation of iraq strong and increasing, a few bitter-enders such as john mccain and dick cheney posit that the immediate withdrawal of u.s. forces from iraq now (january 2007) will require the u.s. to fight a subsequent and larger war in the greater middle east?

this is a fascinating supposition.  for example, what other nations besides the u.s. will ""need"" to fight such a war?  china?  russia?  sweden? ireland?  japan?  brazil?  australia?  who, exactly, besides the u.s.?

certain u.s. politicians clearly suffer from the self-serving delusion that the world's other countries must choose between submitting to u.s. desires or being coerced by u.s. military power.  if, for example, events in the middle east make the u.s. uncomfortable, why then the only possible response is a ""wider war of civilizations"" fought by the u.s. military.

cypr3,t1_cypgb,"&gt; i effectively destroyed your argument by pointing out that plenty of non-foxnews networks have made similar mistakes regarding obama.

my thesis was that the mistakes fox news makes overwhelmingly make non-republicans look bad. just because a different network also makes a mistake that makes a non-republican look bad, that doesn't undercut my thesis. we know from leaked memos and insider testimonies that fox news explicitly tries to make liberals, war opponents, democrats, etc. look bad, and so it should not be a surprise when we observe a pattern of just that on the network. 

it's not just obama; that's just one data point in a larger trend. yes, it's easy to confuse the two names, but i've never seen fox news or its affiliate imply that dick cheney is a sex offender, or that john mccain is a terrorist.

if wolf blitzer, a cnn talking head (and, incidentally, a hardline conservative), also makes a mistake that conflates barack obama with a terrorist, that is strictly irrelevant to the issue of whether fox news is biased toward making its political opponents look bad in whatever ways it can.

the main reason this doesn't happen with sports is that sports are profit driven.  refs have to be fair because they would cost the whole industry money if they weren't. if funding for sports were politicized, (and paid for through taxes, for example), then there wouldn't be such a strong motivation for refs to be fair.

cyr1p,t1_cyp99,"all right, mr. big dick.  how's it done?  how can a guy be a decent man while asserting himself over others in a way that'll impress women?

i'll describe my circumstances.  i'm an introverted guy who stands up for myself and my rights, but also has an extremely, incredibly sharp tongue.  so depending on the situation, i'm either a doormat or a hero.

when it's a matter of making random little conversation, i come off like a doormat.  why?  i can't stand small talk; it grinds at my introversion because most topics of small talk among teenagers and college kids don't interest me.  looks can only make up for the lack of so much.  also, people have a tendency to say i'm ""too smart"".  more importantly, i hold back because i don't want to offend anyone with my strong opinions and painfully sharp tongue, since it's lost me friends before.

on the other hand, challenge me, mine and my rights and i go straight into alpha mode.  i'm famous for fights i've gotten into, that i got into because i knew i was right.  chicks have flocked to me after these, but because of issue #1 up there i've had little to do with them.

third thing, i was raised by an ardent feminist, in a family of ""strong woman"" female relatives.  it's left scars.  i have absolutely no experience of the womankind who wait daintily for me to make my move so they can daintily pretend they don't want to have sex so i can pretty much trick/force/coerce them into doing what they've been craving *for the past 3 hours already*.  that's serious, because i've heard women say that just because they let us do something doesn't mean they want it, and while i try to stay away from that type they're unavoidable at a certain age.  i also tend to think of woman as independent, complete human beings who don't need my money or protection - especially protection.  i'll buy your drink, lady, but don't dare tell me i have to take physical aggression from you without striking back (my female friends always try to ""correct"" this.  i never change it.) or defend your honor by fighting some guy who said the stain on your shirt was ugly.

so here's the important thing: *how do i assert myself and impress chicks without having to trample on some other guy's rights?*  i mean, what is assertion besides imposing your will on somebody else?  furthermore, how do i catch the signals sent by women who feel they can't take the direct approach and tell me what they want?  i've lost at least one possible girlfriend because i thought she was teasing and she really liked me.

really? i did that, too. i tutored public-school near-dropouts full-time for about a month. i only saw them excited when one of my friends pretended to be interested in buying some drugs. these kids were interested in passing grades, not in learning the material -- i tried making it interesting, i tried making it relevant, i tried working one-on-one and i tried talking to groups, but the only thing that ever worked was telling them that i could teach them how to guess effectively on multiple-choice tests.

before i did the tutoring, i thought illiteracy and under-education were the schools' fault. now, i just don't think that people should be compelled to go to school when they aren't interested in or capable of learning, and will only use resources that could be spent actually teaching people who are worth teaching.

cyred,t1_cyr2r,"well, yeah, there are limitations to how much any proof will say about the system. at the end of the day, you're never even really sure that the list of requirements that you're trying to prove is complete or correct. the idea is simply to add as many checks as possible that the code actually means what is desired. tests rule out finite spaces of bugs, proofs can eliminate the potential for various infinite classes of bugs, but you're never completely sure that you've covered everything.

the amount of trouble you're willing to go to is something that you have to decide for yourself. if your software controls aircraft, or critical medical equipment, it might be worthwhile to go to the trouble of constructing an operating system with a large number of provable nice properties.

on the other hand, if you're writing an everyday program, the assumption that there will be enough memory is usually fairly reasonable. in any event, it's usually impossible to rule out things like subtle (or not-so-subtle) hardware failures, for instance, memory corruption, but you have to stop somewhere.

more often, you're interested in whether the algorithm you've chosen actually satisfies certain properties, the canonical example being that a particular algorithm sorts a list. a better example might be showing that a particular piece of concurrent code will not deadlock. such proofs are always done modulo a reasonable set of ordinary circumstances. also, properties like these are easier to prove if your language has strong guarantees regarding the composability of correct programs. most of the languages used today by the industry have very few such guarantees making it quite a lofty chore to prove anything substantial. you end up having to prove things about the system as a whole all at once, rather than building up from proofs about the components.",cgibbard,2007-01-16 21:48:27,programming,2,straight: het

are you tired of those dark circles under your bloodshot, sunken eyes? bloated, waxy, pale skin and dry cottony thirst that no amount of water on earth can quench?

are you tired of waking up in the morning after passing out the night before tired, feeling like you never slept, with a pounding head and a hangover that washes over you like waves crashing on the beach?

are you tired of wondering what you said last night. tired of probing around friends, family and aquantances looking for clues as to whether you made a drunken spectacle of yourself?

are you tired of disposing of the empties? tired of rotating liquor stores hoping the clerks will not notice how much you drink? 

tired of that alcohol odor leaching from every pore in your body?

tired of passing up activities and opportunities so that you can stay home and drink?

tired of scraping together yet another $10.00 or $20.00 daily to feed your alcohol monkey? 

tired of hiding? tired of fear? tired of lies? 

tired of worry? how much longer before your health gives out? before your marrage gives out? before your relationship gives out? the example you are setting for your children?

tired of wondering when you will get your dwi? when you will hit something or someone? wondering how bad the wreck will be?

well, if you are tired of all that i have a soluton for you. 

it will require a small investment. 

now, i know what you are thinking...""how much does it cost? $1,000? $2,000? $5,000?

it's free.

""what is the catch?"" you may be asking.

no catch.

i guarantee that you will feel better, look better, smell better, be a better companion, better employee, better employer, better parent, better person, save a ton of money, add years to your life. 

loosing weight and getting in shape will never be easier.

eventually you will sleep like a baby and wake refreshed. feel confident in any situation.

so what is it? if you have not guessed by now, all you have to do is stop drinking alcohol.

you can be too. 

first is this place. participate as much as possible. 

next make an escape plan. today is an excellent day for escape. 

stock up on tons and tons of alternative, non-alcoholic drinks. i like sparkling mineral water. 3 liters per day minimum. i buy them by the dozen. add some juice to it for flavor if you wish.

never by thirsty.

eat well. eat good food, especially an hour or so before your normal drinking time. low blood sugar will cause cravings. 

get a good multi vitamin. take extra b. 

never be hungry.

have a loose plan for all the time that will become availalbe, time that was otherwise spent drinking and recovering. make a list of fun things to do. 

cooking, diet and exersize were a big help for me. cooking is fun, takes time and you can eat the end result. 

the 1st three days are the hardest. you are adjusting. sleep may be difficult...limit caffiene consumption especially after noon. beware of caffiene in sodas and chocolate. 

as the days add up and you recover your senses everything will become vibrant. emotions may also seem intense, no longer numbed by alcohol. dreams may be quite vivid. 

make sure to enjoy it. a refreshing nights sleep. a clear headed wake up. a $20.00 in pocket change lasting all week! your spirit re-awakening.

i think some yahoo in the fbi, cia, or nsa did the anthrax attack and did so without the support of the fbi, cia, or nsa, and did so as a way to force the passing of the patriot act. perhaps there's a skull and bones society connection there -- i dunno. it seems that the fbi, cia, or nsa has tried to cover the whole anthrax case up.

i really enjoyed your attempt at condescension- my orange juice almost came out my nose as i was laughing at you! is it possible that what an author claims is his point is not actually his point at all? i think you will find this often to be the case, especially among the pundit class of writers. this is particularly helpful when evaluating the ""positions"" of aei ""scholars"" like murray. consider the credibility of his fellows who have been just dead wrong about such important issues of the day as america's attempt empire building in iraq.

i think what is pretty clear is that the point of the murray article is actually this.

&gt;some say that the public schools are so awful that there is huge room for improvement in academic performance just by improving education. there are two problems with that position...

this is the heart of the article, an apologist position on the terrible us public school system. essentially murray advocates that it is not that the schools are failing our children it's that half of our children are just incapable of being taught! this is a completely outrageous statement. that the wsj op-ed board would even attempt to print it shows just how much that board despises the american public, but that is an argument for another time.

that you fell into the rhetoric trap that the apology at the end was his main point, which by the way is completely unsupported by any other statement in the article, is par for the course. read the article again and ask yourself if murray is talking about how iq relates to living a good life, or whether that in murray's opinion, since iq is a hard static limit this ""fact"" alone makes the task of universal public education an essentially impossible one.",smacfarl,2007-01-17 06:15:55,reddit.com,1,"straight: het, straight: het"

murray backs his claims up with lots of evidence, most famously in *the bell curve*, which has in turn been validated by the apa.  conclusions drawn from his research have been refuted again and again by mainstream scientists and their large corpus of research.

&gt;really the guy who argues extensively about the validity of his statistical models can't read a math journal?

his inability to understand every complex mathematical proof published in a technical journal does not undermine his ability to comprehend and apply statistics, even though it is also a mathematical concept.

&gt;you have already accepted his premise that ""g"" exists, that he has found it and measured it near-perfectly, and that it is a static limit. and it is the third assumption that is really the one that is most central to the murray position and all the drivel that ""follows"" from it.

so vkkim what do you believe? that the bell curve is valid or that it is flawed. to be refuted by a large body of evidence is a pretty damning claim against the validity of a work.

his ""innability"", is a hypothetical rhetorical canard tossed into the writing to mask his radical position. as for using and defending statistics- statistics is probably the highest form of basic math, utilizing many many results from calculus and diverse areas of discrete math. it is no accident that many college engineering programs use statistics courses to separate the men from the boys mathematically. that the bell curve relies so heavily on statistics is not an accident, it was an attempt to use the machinery of math to attempt to construct an ""irrefutable and overwhelming case"", one does not base ones seminal work on statistics without some serious knowledge of the subject.

many species adopt a very tough model for reproduction: a tiny elite of powerful males get a whole harem of females, while the large majority of male losers don't get an opportunity to reproduce. the result is a much stronger selective pressure on males. 

females in the harem species prefer to be in a harem because the male won't help a lot with raising the babies anyway, so they're only in for the good dna. they don't have the option to build a harem of men, since every child cost the female a lot of resources, so they're into quality of mates than into quantity (this is easily seen in human mating patterns).

females prefer an exclusive partner when they expect that partner to consecrate a lot of resources to children education. the male would accept to do so if the conditions are so tough that it's a safer bet to use resources increasing the survival rates of born kids, rather than use them finding other females to impregnate.

subsidies are often combined with tariffs, that is why the price of sugar in the us is around ten times higher than in the rest of the world.

then there are export subsidies, which allow producers to sell well below production costs to third world countries(bankrupting their farmers), and at the same time charge more at home.

with hfcs, you get all the fructose all at once, straight to the liver.  the glucose is absobed faster  then sucrose is, too, leading to sugar spikes.

in point of fact, starch and cellulose is, by your argument the same thing as pure glucose.  i hope you can see that this is absurdly wrong - they are different things.  the fact that strach is digested into glucose dosn't make them the same (and cellulose isn't, but that's due to the nature of the bond between the glucose units, something you asserted was meaningless).

basically, tariffs and price controls exist to ensure local production of food can continue. food is considered a 'strategic resource'. and in times of war, yould you rather have your food produced locally, or find that your largest source of imported corn/sugar/wheat is now your enemy, and imports are now cut off. starvation now looms as a crop is now a season off.

besides, evening out prices by stockpiling/releasing grain, the us program of price controls, tariffs, etc, is 'supposedly' to ensure that we have a viable selection of local producers of food.

from wiki, someone on a normal diet could die from under a gallon of water if they drank it in a single sitting: 

""consuming as little as 1.8 litres of water (0.48 gal) in a single sitting may prove fatal for a person adhering to a low-sodium diet, or 3 litres (0.79 gallons) for a person on a normal diet. however, this must be modulated by potential water losses via other routes. for example, a person who is perspiring heavily may lose 1 l/h (0.26 gal) of water through perspiration alone, thereby raising the threshold for water intoxication. the problem is further complicated by the amount of electrolytes lost in urine or sweat, which is variable within a range controlled by the body's regulatory mechanisms. water intoxication can be prevented by consuming water that is isotonic with water losses, but the exact concentration of electrolytes required is difficult to determine and fluctuates over time, and the greater the time period involved, the smaller the disparity that may suffice to produce electrolyte imbalance and water intoxication.""

hardly.  to not agree with you here is not being unamerican or callous.  claiming that the pursuit of the american dream requires everyone to be handed the same starting position is simply a guilt trip laid on people by socialism.  it's merely a method used to make people believe that the nations wealth can be spread evenly through legislation.

the american dream is not to be handed wealth. it's to make something of oneself.  the idea behind it is that no one is locked into class distinctions.  you can start out a peasant in your home country, come here, and become a doctor without being restricted by the class you were born into.

- talented individuals (they had something to contribute)

who said anything about being handed wealth. it is about ""opportunity.""

they have opportunity.  if they didn't, then no one from the ghetto would ever have been able to reach the dream.

i personally have done nothing to hold down anyone and i refuse to accept a portion of the blame out of racial guilt.

no one said you were. but if you're not helping to solve the problem, provide opportunity to those who are guilty of nothing more than being born into the ghetto regardless of race, then you are part of the problem.

you said everyone shares the blame.  i disagree.  if i'm not partly at fault for holding someone back, then how can i partake of the blame for holding them back?  you can't have it both ways.

sorry, but not being part of the solution does not make me part of the problem.

how am i supposed to provide opportunity for someone living in the ghetto?  am i supposed to open up a business and provide reverse racial discrimination so that only ghetto dwellers will work for me?  this exists already.  it's called affirmative action.  but it doesn't really work.  all it serves to do is lower expectations rather than get anyone to improve themselves.

this is anecdotal but does nicely illustrate national statistics, since a majority of women call themselves feminists (and nearly all women agree with the statement ""i believe women deserve to be treated equally to men""), but something like five percent of women are lesbians.

_you can't compare google to previous search engines (of which there were only a handful worth using anyway)_

sure i can. i was an early adopter of google and i remember thinking at the time, ""this search engine is better than the other ones."" it was ""better"". there was no fundamental difference in functionality. you type in a word, results come back, and you pick through the results looking for the appropriate ones. if altavista/yahoo/excite/lycos had a good hit on 50 percent of the first page of results, google had a good hit on maybe 80 percent. great. through the years, i have noticed no real changes in quality, though certain kinds of spam seem to get through more now.

i want to really stress, however, a distinction between google the _search engine_ company, and google the _javascript application_ company. the latter's endeavors have seemed to me laughable, for the most part. even the most popular one, google maps, is just a web equivilent of applications that have been done to death elsewhere.

at any rate, i stand by my statement that an os or office suite is more complicated than a search engine. i suspect most of the difficult work with google's system (especially regarding mapreduce and anything related to faster seek times) has more to do with scaling-up than with search complexity.

thoroughly outraged betty and irene seek the help of the only people on board that they trust, irene under the impression that betty is having some sort of episode turns to the bartender she has befriended while betty is meeting the captain, who after it's cleared up that she is not the one trying to have her mother killed is more than willing to help. a climactic fight scene on the lido deck ends with jared going into the drink. closing scenes have irene being introduced to a widowed banker by the bartender and betty kissing the captain as the ship sails into the sunset.

(eg ceos vote themselves obscene bonuses etc).

another solution to conflict is to not deal with that person if you think it's unfair.  anyone can change jobs; they can even deploy capital themselves, and move from worker to owner.  that choice is pretty democratic.

since you say you understand buddhism rather well, let me use buddhist terminology to simplify what i said. 

i'm not deriding buddhism because many of its proponents fail to achieve enlightenment. i'm saying that there is no moksha, no nirvana. buddhism is not the way out, it's just more maya, more samsara, more attachment, albeit to something else. 

we, you and i, are both the rat pressing the lever, and buddhism and catholicism and hinduism and the naive realism that you naively attribute to me are just another press of that lever. if you knew (or remembered) what aldous huxley tells us that every schoolboy knows, you would understand what i meant about the endorphin system, and how your love of philosophy and my arrogance, your post and my answer and everything we do are just that lever again. 

there is indeed one reality, one way that the universe really *is*, but it's doubtful we will ever achieve anything other than a ""close-enough"" approximation of an understanding of it, because we're *part* of it, you see. i suspect we'll sooner or later run up against the same godelian barrier that stops us cold when we try to argue about free will and whether our consciousness, or the universe, can be causa sui or not. 

i suppose you might call me a scientific realist, but really any ""ist"" or ""ism"" is an attempt to discern or impose an order on the universe, and the universe isn't obliged to have order or understandability just because we wish it to. what i am doing is really just acknowledging that the human brain is a machine for understanding things, and that, like any machine, it occasionally breaks and small important bits fly off into dark corners with a ""sproing"" sound. godel taketh away and godel taketh away some more.

cyzry,t1_cyzcg,"&gt; the quote was cited. it is attributed to olga vives, chair of the now's national lesbian rights taskforce.

so if i was to write, ""louf is a closet homosexual who hides his prurient, shameful thoughts behind a facade of homophobia; i know this because he told me,"" that claim somehow *becomes* cited just because people can now point to a web address where it's posted? of course not. you would rightly object that it was simply made up and has no basis in fact.

and yet you accept this same standard for equally made up claims that support your prejudice. no wonder you're so prone to believing spurious claims; when it comes to your preconceptions, you are clearly willing to dismiss what it means for a claim to have a *source* - a credible, verifiable record of origin.

now's position on lesbians is not that almost half of now's members are lesbians, but that lesbians should be treated equally to other humans, ""to live their lives with dignity and security"" and to have ""the rights of equal marriage"", a position that is entirely consistent with basic liberty but with which you obviously take issue. 

&gt; *everybody* believes that ""women deserve to be treated equally to men"".

men who beat their wives don't believe this. men who go into villages during wars and rape all the women don't believe this. men who automatically expect their wives to take care of domestic duties and childcare in addition to their paid jobs don't believe this. men who make sexist, degrading remarks to and about women don't believe this. the man who drove past my spouse and yelled, ""fucking dike"" as she walked out of a shop called the ""women's bookstore"" didn't believe this. the restaurant dining room manager i once worked for who explained his policy of only hiring female servers (but only male cooks) by saying, ""i want to be the cock in the henhouse"" didn't believe this. the company executive i used to work for who said of his hiring policy, ""all things being equal, hire the man"" didn't believe this. the guy who, in 1989, went into montreal's école polytechnique and murdered 14 female engineering students didn't believe this. i could go on and on but either you get the point already or you never will.

&gt; most feminists are gay or hate men.

yet another made-up claim that you use as a shield to protect your bigotry from scrutiny. do you even know any feminists (or lesbians, for that matter), or have you formed your opinion based on leviticus and rush limbaugh? 

of the feminists i know (and every woman i know calls herself a feminist), none of them hate men. of the lesbians i know (and i know a few), none of them hate men. they are just sexually attracted to women rather than men. that's their business, their preference, their orientation, and by no means does it make them evil or immoral or hateful.

of course, by judging and condemning them before you know anything about them, you guarantee that you will never be exposed to interpersonal experiences that might challenge your bigotry. surrounding yourself with fear and hate, you lose out on opportunities to learn about other humans and build friendships that might enrich you as a person. for that you have my condolence.",[deleted],2007-01-18 08:56:32,reddit.com,6,"gay: lesbian, gay: homo, gay: homosexual, gay: homo, gay: lesbian, gay: lesbian, gay: lesbian, gay: gay, gay: lesbian, gay: lesbian"

monica lewinsky never accused the president of sexual harassment.

because, if she had, then the questions regarding their relationship would have made a little more sense, though perhaps still not making them valid.

--

the questions were entirely valid.  the fact that lewinksi didn't accuse clinton of harrassment has nothing to do with it.  go ask a lawyer, without specifying names or the case, if a sexual harrassment case would be reasonable to ask the defendent if he'd ever had inappropriate sexual relations with people who worked for him.

it's entirely reasonable, and entirely expected, regardless that you feel it's not ok.

btw, the situation with lewinksi was illegal whether you want to admit it or not.  adultery is illegal in most states, although clinton wasn't charged with it.

you might as well claim that a lawyer shouldn't ask a defendent about his previous driving record when the case is about how he recklessly drove into someone's car.

cz1n0,t3_yym7,"resumes are a horrible first step.  most of them never even get read.

one company had some good ideas: apply through their website, in short-answer format.  

 * what are your preferred languages?  what do you like about them?

 * what are some of your favorite problems you've solved?  
 
 * do you have links to open-source projects you've worked on?  (for code)

this does a couple of things: it weeds out mass-resume-emailers; it gets someone who actually went to your website and typed something in.  it gets info that shows writing style, a bit of thought process, and code -- and it's short enough that they will read it.

i don't mind writing pseudocode but i don't develop on paper or a whiteboard with people staring at what i'm doing with no syntax-checking available.  no, i can't implement an avl tree off the top of my head, i use one in a library, thanks (no way they could either).  if you want to see my code, i'll be happy to show you what i wrote sitting in front of my computer.

no, i didn't memorize all the performance characteristics of a wide range of sort algorithms i never used; i remember a couple and i look the rest up if i need to worry about worst-case dos attack patterns etc.  however, i did come up with other stuff that you can't just look up and isn't in that sorting textbook.

if you think i'm lying about code i say is mine, just ask me to explain it.  depending on the piece, i can also tell you about 10 different ways to do it and what the various trade-offs are.  with other pieces, i just looked up the usual way to do it.

if i lied my way through, it will be obvious pretty quick that i don't know what i'm doing and you can fire me. to make it easy for the company, with new workers:

**1. hire them as temps for a short trial period.**  don't bother with the full gamut of paperwork until you decide you want to keep them.  

almost every single company makes this fatal mistake of leaving positions vacant for 6 months or more because they can't find the exact right fit, whereas with a bright person in there, s/he could learn your exact process in a couple of weeks or months on the job.

if that exact fit does show up a year later, you can hire him/her  and now you have two people who can do what you want.  if your budget is so tight that you can only afford one, guess what, you already have a person who's been doing what you want for a year.

i think what companies needlessly worry about is the exact right fit showing up the next day after you hire someone; this fear keeps them from hiring anyone in case ""someone better comes along..."".  having one good person in there is better than zero perfect people, and the good person can grow into covering everything needed.

mr bush has never tried to enact religious dogma, creationist or otherwise. he *has* tried to enact religiously inspired ethics (eg: the stem cell thing, the abstinence thing, and so forth). even then he's not gone as far as his base would have wanted (abortion ban, contraceptive ban). the difference is whether religion is commanding the nation (dogma) or inspiring him (ethics). he plainly respects the 1st amendment enough not to try the former. so basically to think that he would order park wardens to equivocate geology is to take a position that cannot be justified from any nuanced view of his character or from the evidence of his rule to date.

you won't get an invented language to become popular due to network effects (although state intervention with school curricula could perhaps achieve this). i.e. the value of learning a language is proportional to the likelihood of encountering a speaker of that language (which is in turn related to the number of speakers of that language).

the way it seems to work is that people pick up a second language as a ""lingua franca"" (wiki tells me this was the name given by the arabs to latin-derived languages). latin held this role in europe for some time whereas english has it now (and in many places outside europe too).

similarly, i believe swahili is used in this way to some extent along the whole east coast of africa (and further?)

look at how the time is segmented:

* customer is seated and given menus
* customer decides what to order.  server has no control over how long this takes.
* server takes order.  server can minimize this time by not letting the customer sit around waiting after completing the order, but in my experience the difference between a great server and a mediocre one here will usually only be a few minutes.
* everybody waits for food to be cooked.  server has no control over this.
* customer eats.  server has no control over this either.
* server gets check to customer, deals with payment if it's not a place where you pay at the counter.

so the only time the server can control is how long you wait for them to take your order and how long you wait for them to take your payment.  usually, that's a small percentage of the time you spend in a restaurant.

and even then, it won't make any difference except in a busy restaurant during peak hours.  if it's not busy enough that there are people waiting in the lobby, which most restaurants aren't, most of the time, the server can do absolutely nothing to increase the number of customers (in the short term, service may effect whether they come back, of course).",lysine23,2007-01-19 06:18:40,reddit.com,1,straight: het

while everyone might be happier in a world where sexual attraction worked the way it does in films, the fact is that we don't. whisper is hardly sacrificing his happiness to play the lone avenger: he has simply discovered that being cruel and manipulative **will bring him sex.** and being kind, emotionally open, generous with gifts and trusting **will not**. some of us have found exceptions to this heuristic, but it is statistically solid nevertheless. anyone who denies this fact has either never met many actual young women or has drunk the political-correctness kool aid.

with regards to the women, they likely indeed ""did nothing wrong."" however, the fact is: we are all human first and individuals second. there are accurate generalizations you can make regarding most people you're likely to meet, based on their gender. how long is someone expected to deny himself and be exploited again and again while searching for what seems to be an exception to the rules?

====================
&gt;in case you’re wondering, such a wholesale firing of prosecutors midway through an administration isn’t normal. u.s. attorneys, the wall street journal recently pointed out, “typically are appointed at the beginning of a new president’s term, and serve throughout that term.” why, then, are prosecutors that the bush administration itself appointed suddenly being pushed out?

&gt;the likely answer is that for the first time the administration is really worried about where corruption investigations might lead...

&gt;for a long time the administration nonetheless seemed untouchable, protected both by republican control of congress and by its ability to justify anything and everything as necessary for the war on terror. now, however, the investigations are closing in on the oval office. the latest news is that j. steven griles, the former deputy secretary of the interior department and the poster child for the administration’s systematic policy of putting foxes in charge of henhouses, is finally facing possible indictment.

&gt;and the purge of u.s. attorneys looks like a pre-emptive strike against the gathering forces of justice...

&gt;the broader context is this: defeat in the midterm elections hasn’t led the bush administration to scale back its imperial view of presidential power.

&gt;on the contrary, now that president bush can no longer count on congress to do his bidding, he’s more determined than ever to claim essentially unlimited authority — whether it’s the authority to send more troops into iraq or the authority to stonewall investigations into his own administration’s conduct.

&gt;the next two years, in other words, are going to be a rolling constitutional crisis.

most of her behavior in this article really is terrible.  but it's not surprising that she lost her temper -- though it is still ugly.

so at first you hang out here and there, and it's fine, but eventually they start trying to include you in all of their plans and getting you to do the same for them.  at first maybe you're flattered, or you try to give them a chance, but eventually you realize that things are getting out of control.  you try to let them down nicely, but they don't get it, so you do less nice things, like telling them ""i don't want to be more than casual friends,"" talking about the fun things you do with your ""real"" friends, and outright avoiding them.

then they come over and say ""check it out!  i bought you a genuine _diamond-encrusted_ &lt;whatever&gt;!  it took me months to save up for this!""  (subtext: ""maybe *now* you'll like me!"")

you might get freaked out.

again, i'm not trying to say that her behavior wasn't ugly.  but it shouldn't be taken as overwhelming evidence of the evilness of women (girls, actually) either.  people of both sexes have their comfort zones and limits, and part of growing up is learning to deal in a non-ugly way with people who freak you out.

* you almost always remember the first *something* in your life, whether it was the first kiss, girlfriend, driving, sex, day at uni, job, anything.

what bothers people like me about the iranian people (whom we know have no ill will towards america) is that they put up with the mullocracy that rules their very existence. they take so much crap and give nothing back in return. maybe i am just taking for granted that i was raised in a society that taught me to rail against the system when i perceived an injustice. but still... if the iranian people ever want to taste the fruits of what they appreciate about americans, they are going to have to take matters into their own hands. as we have learned in iraq, forcing freedom on a nation takes too long and is at too high a cost to be a viable path to the promotion of freedom.",socalpundit,2007-01-19 11:29:03,reddit.com,-12,gay: fruit

cz6ed,t3_z0co,"sophistry != gnosticism.  the gnostics actually treated plato as a sacred text (book vi of the republic is part of the nag hammadi collection), they did not refer to protagoras or any of the sophists.  they did not all make claims of wisdom, if you read their literature you see that they were seekers of the experience of gnosis.  sophia fit into their systems as a spiritual entity completely transcendent of this world which the gnostics sought through their various practices.  but they did not assume that the individual was ever wise, as the principle they sought unity with was always greater than any individual person.

&gt;first, the gnostic is always dissatisfied with any given situation.

this is a false blanket statement.  traditionally scholars divide gnosticism into two main groups, pessimistic gnostics who see the world as infuses with evil, created by a misbehaving god, and optimistic gnostics who see the world as a theophany.

&gt;the second aspect of the gnostic attitude is the belief that any drawbacks to any given situation can be attributed to a flaw in the system, that the world is intrinsically poorly organized.

this appears to build on previous errors.

&gt;the third principle in the mindset of the gnostic liberal is, “the belief that salvation from the evil of the world is possible.” 

gnostics do have a belief that salvation/redemption is possible.  but then again so do many cosmologies.  “form this follows the belief that the order of being will have to be changed in an historical process. from a wretched world a good one must evolve historically.”

uhh, no.  gnostics formed communities that by and large abandoned the world.  no gnostics writings i have seen suggested redemption of the world through human action was possible.  they lived in a time when they had no political power whatever or had much influence on any sphere of events, and even if they imagined they could redeem the world, their writings make it clear that they were only interested in saving themselves.  they were exemplars of the position that if you want to save the world you have to save yourself first, and that once you have saved yourself, to save the world you must teach others what you have found.  there's just no politics there.

the author is forcing an alien mindset onto gnosticism so that he can apply it to later groups.  he would have been better off just tracing the history of the views of the sophists in modern thought.  so far as we know them (we don't have their writings, most of what we have are plato's unsympathetic accounts of them), protagoras, gorgias, hippias and others have views that actually still do permeate our culture on the right and the left.",[deleted],2007-01-19 11:31:43,reddit.com,1,straight: het

cz78i,t1_cz741,"&gt; but that doesn't do any good for people who have already died as a result of a bad product.

well, yes, and this applies to government regulation as well.  sometimes nobody sees it coming, and there's nothing we can do to prevent it.

&gt; i suppose if the government didn't exist, consumers could create some independent body to put their seal of approval on a product, but then you end up with the same issues of trust and potential for bribery, etc, that you get into with government, and no law hold those people accountable if they are corrupt...

yes, exactly!  now think a little further -- the seal of approval is worth something to companies because consumers trust it.  the independent certification body can sell their testing and approval service, and companies will pay because without it consumers wouldn't trust their products.

essentially they are in the business of selling trust.  now, if the certification body goes corrupt and starts approving bad products, they lose trust. corruption in this independent body completely destroys the value of their service.  companies won't pay for it anymore -- in fact, it's even worthless to pay money as a bribe for the approval of a bad product.  corruption would be as bad for business as locusts are for a farmer.

the difference between this profit-based body and the government is that the government does not depend on trust for revenue, it can just tax you.  it doesn't depend on whether companies value compliance with regulations, and therefore it doesn't strongly depend on whether consumers value the regulation.  plus, it forces every company to follow the same standards, even though some consumers might be much more sensitive to price for some products, at the expense of occasionally finding a bad apple in the bunch.

one example of a body similar to the kind you mentioned is [underwriters laboratories, inc](http://www.ul.com/).  they do some work for governments, but mostly work to certify other companies' products.  their service is valuable because people trust it, and so they work hard to keep people trusting it.",asokoloski,2007-01-19 14:01:14,reddit.com,0,"straight: het, straight: het"

cz8ao,t1_cz4f4,"&gt; i know that idea makes people angry, but i'm not entirely sure why.

because language = culture, and asking a people or country to give up its language is akin to asking them to give up their culture.  in order to make a standard language stick, everything has to spoken, published, sung, and otherwise communicated in that standard language.  without going all out in that respect, you won't be able to efficiently communicate more complex, nuanced (esp non-quantifiable) ideas.  

imagine for example asking france to switch its national language from french to english.  of course in reality the entire nation would sooner commit mass suicide, but hypothetically if it happened, after several generations, it would no longer be france - the accent would be gone, the melifluos language would be gone, along with a huge part of what makes the french french.  their culture is no less worth preserving than those of the british isles, germany, or any other unique and ancient culture, even if it means it takes longer to share ideas among different cultures.

as americans with relatively little culture (no, hollywood and strip malls don't count) it may be hard for us to understand and value distinct cultural differences as europeans or perhaps asians do, but that doesn't mean it's not important.  from anthropological, sociological, and psychological points of view, the world's disparate cultures are an amazing petri dish for investigating the human psyche, society, and evolution.  from a humanistic point of view, we should not be surprised when people get angry when they perceive their unique culture is being threatened.",fbg111,2007-01-19 17:54:59,reddit.com,2,straight: het

it's interesting that you mention that. i've been studying the roman empire lately and it is interesting to see just how differently alternate lifestyles were viewed in the ancient world. for example, romans would never think of lumping a person into a class based on who they slept with. there were no ""heterosexuals"" or ""homosexuals"". sleeping with men or with women were both legitimate expressions of sexual desire. 

on the other hand, they did draw a distinction between pitching and catching. a distinguished man was expected to be a giver, because receiving was considered unmanly. also, adultery was only frowned upon when it could cause serious social disruption, such as muddying the question of inheritance. a citizen committing adultery with a non-citizen or with slaves was hardly considered adultery at all since the bastards produced could not inherit property under law.

so your ""paper"" is a well known fraud.
is this really what you base your beliefs on? a 1998 propaganda effort?

http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=oregon_institute_of_science_and_medicine

more specifically the details on ""the paper""

http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=oregon_institute_of_science_and_medicine#case_study:_the_oregon_petition

&gt;the oregon petition, sponsored by the oism, was circulated in april 1998 in a bulk mailing to tens of thousands of u.s. scientists. in addition to the petition, the mailing included what appeared to be a reprint of a scientific paper. authored by oism's arthur b. robinson, sallie l. baliunas, willie soon, and zachary w. robinson, the paper was titled ""environmental effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide"" and was printed in the same typeface and format as the official proceedings of the national academy of sciences. also included was a reprint of a december 1997, wall street journal editorial, ""science has spoken: global warming is a myth, by arthur and zachary robinson. a cover note signed ""frederick seitz/past president, national academy of sciences, u.s.a./president emeritus, rockefeller university"", may have given some persons the impression that robinson's paper was an official publication of the academy's peer-reviewed journal. the blatant editorializing in the pseudopaper, however, was uncharacteristic of scientific papers.

...

&gt;in reality, neither robinson's paper nor oism's petition drive had anything to do with the national academy of sciences, which first heard about the petition when its members began calling to ask if the nas had taken a stand against the kyoto treaty. robinson was not even a climate scientist. he was a biochemist with no published research in the field of climatology, and his paper had never been subjected to peer review by anyone with training in the field. in fact, the paper had never been accepted for publication anywhere, let alone in the nas proceedings. it was self-published by robinson, who did the typesetting himself on his own computer. (it was subsequently published as a ""review"" in climate research, which contributed to an editorial scandal at that publication.)

&gt;none of the coauthors of ""environmental effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide"" had any more standing than robinson himself as a climate change researcher. they included robinson's 22-year-old son, zachary, along with astrophysicists sallie l. baliunas and willie soon. **both baliunas and soon worked with frederick seitz at the george c. marshall institute, a washington, d.c., think tank where seitz served as executive director. funded by a number of right-wing foundations, including scaife and bradley, the george c. marshall institute does not conduct any original research. it is a conservative think tank that was initially founded during the years of the reagan administration to advocate funding for reagan's strategic defense initiative--the ""star wars"" weapons program.** today, the marshall institute is still a big fan of high-tech weapons. in 1999, its website gave prominent placement to an essay by col. simon p. worden titled ""why we need the air-borne laser,"" along with an essay titled ""missile defense for populations--what does it take? why are we not doing it?"" following the collapse of the soviet union, however, the marshall institute has adapted to the times by devoting much of its firepower to the war against environmentalism, and in particular against the ""scaremongers"" who raise warnings about global warming.

&gt;""**the mailing is clearly designed to be deceptive by giving people the impression that the article, which is full of half-truths, is a reprint and has passed peer review,**"" complained raymond pierrehumbert, a meteorlogist at the university of chicago. nas foreign secretary f. sherwood rowland, an atmospheric chemist, said researchers ""are wondering if someone is trying to hoodwink them."" nas council member ralph j. cicerone, dean of the school of physical sciences at the university of california at irvine, was particularly offended that seitz described himself in the cover letter as a ""past president"" of the nas. although seitz had indeed held that title in the 1960s, cicerone hoped that scientists who received the petition mailing would not be misled into believing that he ""still has a role in governing the organization.""

&gt;the nas issued an unusually blunt formal response to the petition drive. ""the nas council would like to make it clear that this petition has nothing to do with the national academy of sciences and that the manuscript was not published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences or in any other peer-reviewed journal,"" it stated in a news release. ""the petition does not reflect the conclusions of expert reports of the academy."" in fact, it pointed out, its own prior published study had shown that ""even given the considerable uncertainties in our knowledge of the relevant phenomena, greenhouse warming poses a potential threat sufficient to merit prompt responses. investment in mitigation measures acts as insurance protection against the great uncertainties and the possibility of dramatic surprises.

...

&gt;when questioned in 1998, oism's arthur robinson admitted that only 2,100 signers of the oregon petition had identified themselves as physicists, geophysicists, climatologists, or meteorologists, ""and of those the greatest number are physicists."" this grouping of fields concealed the fact that only a few dozen, at most, of the signatories were drawn from the core disciplines of climate science - such as meteorology, oceanography, and glaciology - and almost none were climate specialists. the names of the signers are available on the oism's website, but without listing any institutional affiliations or even city of residence, making it very difficult to determine their credentials or even whether they exist at all. when the oregon petition first circulated, in fact, environmental activists successfully added the names of several fictional characters and celebrities to the list, including john grisham, michael j. fox, drs. frank burns, b. j. honeycutt, and benjamin pierce (from the tv show m*a*s*h), an individual by the name of ""dr. red wine,"" and geraldine halliwell, formerly known as pop singer ginger spice of the spice girls. halliwell's field of scientific specialization was listed as ""biology."" even in 2003, the list was loaded with misspellings, duplications, name and title fragments, and names of non-persons, such as company names.

...

&gt;notwithstanding the shortcomings in robinson's theory, the oil and coal industries have sponsored several organizations to promote the idea that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is ""good for earth"" because it will encourage greater plant growth. the greening earth society, a front group of the western fuels association, has produced a video, titled ""the greening of the planet earth continues,"" publishes a newsletter called the world climate report, and works closely with a group called the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change

yeah the oism is in *no way* a political organization fronting for obvious corporate interests. lol.

this is morally appealing -- it's a good thing in general when harmless types of eccentricity become more widely accepted -- but how practical is it? i can think of a few things that could be problematic:

what really happens when you take your dog or cat to a shelter…graphic

date: 2006-07-06, 12:15pm pdt


i am posting this (and it is long) because i think our society needs a
huge “wake-up” call. as a shelter manager, i am going to share a
little insight with you all...a view from the inside if you will.
first off, this is a forum to for adoption and/or rehoming as clearly
stated in the rules. all of you breeders/sellers on craigslist should
not only be flagged (and i hope the good people on craigslist will
continue to do so with blind fury), but you should be made to work in
the “back” of an animal shelter for just one day. maybe if you saw the
life drain from a few sad, lost, confused eyes, you would change your
mind about breeding and selling to people you don’t even know…that
puppy you just sold will most likely end up in my shelter when it’s
not a cute little puppy anymore.

so how would you feel if you knew
that there’s about a 90% chance that dog will never walk out of the
shelter it is going to be dumped at? purebred or not! about 50% of all
of the dogs that are “owner surrenders” or “strays”, that come into my
shelter are purebred dogs. the most common excuses i hear are; “we are
moving and we can’t take our dog (or cat).” really? where are you
moving too that doesn’t allow pets? or they say “the dog got bigger
than we thought it would”. how big did you think a german shepherd
would get? “we don’t have time for her…”. really? i work a 10-12 hour
day and still have time for my 6 dogs! “she’s tearing up our yard…”.
how about making her a part of your family? they always tell me “we
just don’t want to have to stress about finding a place for her…we
know she’ll get adopted, she’s a good dog”. odds are your pet won’t
get adopted &amp; how stressful do you think being in a shelter is?

well,
let me tell you…your pet has 72 hours to find a new family from the
moment you drop it off…sometimes a little longer if the shelter isn’t
full and your dog manages to stay completely healthy…if it sniffles,
it dies. your pet will be confined to a small run/kennel in a room
with about 25 other barking or crying animals. it will have to relieve
itself where it eats and sleeps. it will be depressed and it will cry
constantly for the family that abandoned it. if your pet is lucky, i
will have enough volunteers in that day to take him/her for a walk. if
i don’t, your pet won’t get any attention besides having a bowl of
food slid under the kennel door and the waste sprayed out of its pen
with a high-powered hose. if your dog is big, black or any of the
“bully” breeds (pit bull, rottie, mastiff, etc…) it was pretty much
dead when you walked it through the front door. those dogs just don’t
get adopted.

if your dog doesn’t get adopted within its 72 hours and
the shelter is full, it will be destroyed. if the shelter isn’t full
and your dog is good enough, and of a desirable enough breed…it may
get a stay of execution…not for long though. most get very kennel
protective after about a week and are destroyed for showing
aggression…even the sweetest dogs will turn in this environment. if
your pet makes it over all of those hurdles…chances are it will get
kennel cough or an upper respiratory infection and will be destroyed
because shelters just don’t have the funds to pay for even a $100
treatment.


here’s a little euthanasia 101 for those of you that have
never witnessed a perfectly healthy, scared animal being “put-down”.
first, your pet will be taken from its kennel on a leash…they always
look like they think they are going for a walk…happy, wagging their
tails. until they get to “the room”, every one of them freaks out and
puts on the breaks when we get to the door…it must smell like death or
they can feel the sad souls that are left in there, it’s strange, but
it happens with every one of them.

your dog or cat will be restrained,
held down by 1 or 2 vet techs depending on the size and how freaked
out they are. then a euthanasia tech or a vet will start the
process…they will find a vein in the front leg and inject a lethal
dose of the “pink stuff”. hopefully your pet doesn’t panic from being
restrained and jerk…i’ve seen the needles tear out of a leg and been
covered with the resulting blood and deafened by the yelps and
screams. they all don’t just “go to sleep”, sometimes spasm for a
while, gasp for air and defecate on themselves. when it all ends, your
pets corpse will be stacked like firewood in a large freezer in the
back with all of the other animals that were killed…waiting to be
picked up like garbage. what happens next? cremated? taken to the
dump? rendered into pet food? you’ll never know and it probably won’t
even cross your mind…it was just an animal and you can always buy
another one right?

i hope that those of you that have read this are bawling your eyes out
and can’t get the pictures out of your head…i do everyday on the way
home from work. i hate my job, i hate that it exists &amp; i hate that it
will always be there unless you people make some changes and realize
that the lives you are affecting go much farther than the pets you
dump at a shelter. between 9 and 11 million animals die every year in
shelters and only you can stop it. i do my best to save every life i
can but rescues are always full, and there are more animals coming in
everyday than there are homes.

my point to all of this…don’t breed or buy while shelter pets die!


hate me or flag me if you want to…the truth hurts and reality is what
it is…i just hope i maybe changed one persons mind about breeding
their dog, taking their loving pet to a shelter, or buying a dog. i
hope that someone will walk into my shelter and say “i saw this thing
on craigslist and it made me want adopt”…that would make it all worth
it.

cz918,t1_cz5rh,"democracy - even perfect democracy - is inherently flawed.  it's flawed by lending legitimacy to majority rule.  it's flawed in that it creates a system where coercion is bureaucratic: when democracy inevitably harms others, there are no efficient means to right the wrongs.  

not only can anarchy work, but anarchy *does* work.  i'm fond of the phrase, ""anarchy is everywhere government isn't"".  anarchy is what puts food in the supermarket.  anarchy is what regulates who you befriend or who you avoid.  it's a system that's worked for thousands of years and still works today in the gross majority of human actions.  what we're seeing now is where government grows so big that anarchy has less and less a chance of functioning.  eventually, things fall apart because the clumsy, coercive government has screwed up the system.

when we realize that anarchy is everywhere, working all the time for each of our own benefits, and acknowledge that government does nothing but thwart the fruits of anarchy, human beings will reach the next level.  from the fuedal system to the constitution, it's all a progression away from monopolizing power in the government - and a return of power to the individual.

the design flaws of government are intrinsic: they cannot be fixed.  until we acknowledge this simple truth, we're doomed to continue believing what so many well-meaning people before us have believed: that with the right people, government can work.  history tells quite a different story.  time to acknowledge it",AnarchoCapitalist,2007-01-19 22:36:49,reddit.com,2,gay: fruit

so what you end up with is a situation where oil is *always* a little too cheap to make ethanol competitive without subsidies. as oil prices rise, the cost of producing ethanol rises nearly in lockstep.",frankus,2007-01-20 00:24:09,reddit.com,1,gay: boi

2. people who ""claim"" to be libertarians are not necessarily libertarians.  hell, that jackass o'reilly occasionally claims to be a libertarian, and every libertarian i know think he'd be an even worse example of right-wingnuttery than bush if he were elected to the presidency.

if anything, it sounds like it moved more to the left than to the right.  removing marriage from the realm of legislation that prevents gays from participating, ending corporate welfare, and eliminating criminal consequences for hiring ""illegal aliens"" is in no way mainstream republican platform material.  furthermore, the platform's general statement on foreign affairs is more strictly opposed to military adventurism (to borrow a term from the left) than the democrats' platform ever was.  thirty-some democrats in the house of representatives voted for the military commissions act: i defy you to find a single politician with a membership in the lp that would have voted for that thing.  i doubt you could even find one that wouldn't give his left nut (or ovary) to see the mca eliminated and constitutional protections of the power of the courts to issue a writ of habeas corpus strengthened in explicit terms -- unless you find one whose right nut (or ovary) is already missing, perhaps.

did you read it? because if you haven't, what follows won't make any sense to you.

before i saw the comments section i believed that a straightforward proof like this one would be sufficient to convince everybody that 0.999... = 1, even if they've believed otherwise for their entire life.

but to my surprise, they don't. people make up excuses, 'facts', and all kind of other rubbish just so they can rationalize the nonsensical belief that 0.999... is ""moving, but never *gets* to 1"", or something equally rediculous. the comment section reveals that no matter how patiently people explain to them why their reasoning is flawed, the logic bounces off. i wish i had the superpower of being immune to logic.

considering the impact a belief that 0.999 != 1 has on your life, and the willingness of people to adjust their view, it becomes clear what a monumental effort it is to explain to people even if most trivial things. somebody's religious beliefs have quite a different order of magnitude compared to 0.999 = 1.

let's take another example. scott adams (mr dilbert) has posted on his blog a bunch of philosophical posts about the meaning of life, free will and related topics. his argument, paraphrased, is that because we're made up from biological parts which adhere to the laws of physics (moist robot), our brain has to adhere to the laws of physics as well. (it's only the sum of its parts after all). therefore, our brain's output must be a function of its input and possibly computational errors. this means that either (a) we don't have free will, because if it existed it would break cause and effect in a supernatural manner, or (b) there's a random element involved, which means humans are not deterministic, but random in the way they act.

if you're not familiar with this dilemma you should definitely read up on it before disagreeing with me: it's pretty hard to understand at first.

whether free will exists is outside of the scope of this debate. however, the kind of responses scott adams gets on his blog (in the hundreds!) are written by adults who write clearly and eloquently, and at the same time completely miss the point. completely.

now while the democratic party has lots of problems, within the last 4 years there's been a net revolution to take it back. so when guys like lieberman become the president's toady there is a large understanding in the community, on and offline, that he is really a republican. sure we couldn't defeat him in this election cycle on his own home turf, but it is and will be totally apparent to everyone that he is not really a democrat. when a pundit who claims to be liberal or democratic actually takes republican positions, this is well known in the blogsphere. 

what you guys need to do is defend yourselves. guys like glenn reynolds, ie instapundit, who does write the occasional essay against the drug war, is one of the biggest bush apologists on the internet. there are many many examples of this besides glenn, let's call them proxy republicans in libertarian camouflage. now while whatever few people attend your meetings where ever they are, (you still haven't given any specifics), may know the difference, the public at large does not. and this makes libertarianism seem a joke. you can't let people call themselves libertarian when they are opposed to most of what you seem to think are the core ideas of your party. particularly on the bush/cheney executive power grab. man i have been waiting for 6 years to hear the outcry from libertarians. that i had to get in to a discussion on a reddit thread to hear it is a huge statement to how co-opted your party has become.

further where are the state house, state senate, and local town campaigns? these are the cheapest to get in and the beginning of really establishing the power and base to go national. when the ""conservative"" movement wanted to take back the republican party they started local 30 years ago. many ""progressives"" are attempting the same thing now in the dem party. where are the libertarians?

so okay one guy on the internet doesn't know big deal right? wrong! i am a mini-maven for political news. look at my profile i spent much time every single day scouring the net and other kinds of media, for info from all kinds of places and yet i have never, ever seen the libertarian outrage at bush until i talked to you. and if i, check my reddit profile, can get the impression that libertarians are nothing but a republican proxy group, what does the average person that doesn't get into things at the level of detail that i do think? and if they don't understand whether the local memberships are co-opted or not doesn't matter, because for all intents and purposed they have been co-opted.

completely disagree with this. terrorism is not about large numbers of fatalities but quite the opposite, it aims to create maximum psychological impact with a relatively small number of deaths. 9/11 was unusual in the high number of deaths which made it particularly newsworthy, though as the cartoon points out, even this extreme case is relatively low when compared to everyday risks. from the public's point of view, the best defence against terrorism is to take a more robust approach and largely ignore it, just as we filter out all those other daily risks. indifference goes a long way in negating the efficacy of the terrorist strategy. so far america has gone in the opposite direction and shown itself to be particularly susceptible to the psychological objectives of terrorism with a reaction of complete hysteria which i imagine would make it a very attractive target to terrorists of various stripes in the future.",chu,2007-01-20 12:22:29,reddit.com,33,gay: wsw

it's not an algorithm, guys! flowers + dinner do not equal love combined with sex. they can help lubricate the whole process a great deal, but if a strange or semi strange male started showering me with pretties and attention i would be worried and frightened.

spoiling correctly applied is merely being nurturing. for example, because of relative wealth disparity (i’m poor, he’s not), my boyfriend buys dinner when we eat out. it’s one of the things i really like about him; that he not only goes out of his way to please, but doesn’t make a big deal out of it. by the same token, because i love him i rub his shoulders when he’s gaming, bring him breakfast in bed and otherwise encourage him to enjoy the things i’m good at.

czdkp,t3_za64,"neoperiapt's argument would undermine all of our fundamental rights.  if congress could somehow remove habeas corpus by failing to enact a statute, the same technique would permit congress to, say, remove federal jurisdiction over all first amendment cases (such a technique has indeed been suggested by various authoritarian extremists).  

it does not help neoperiapt's argument to attach the name of john marshall or other ""lesser"" commentators to it -- marshall was interpreting the constitution in a particular context in the early 19th century and you'd have to know alot more about the context to see if his opinion were applicable today. (under marshall's view of the law, slavery did not violate due process for example, nor did excluding slaves from juries and other political rights, not to mention women.  and, lest anyone say that this was simply the way it was back then, remember, new jersey had given women the vote in the 1790's, then taken it away again with the approval of legal giants like marshall.)  indeed, judges from the early 18th century were full capable of getting all kinds of legal points wrong, even a great justice like marshall.  when a legal argument depends on ""a great judge said it"", remember holmes (the greatest of them all perhaps) saying, ""six generations of idiots is enough"" in his argument that forced sterilization didn't violate due process of the victim.  if you make arguments about fundamental rights by appealing to ""authority"" whether that's marshall or some textbook, you do run the risk of accepting some pretty illiberal authority.

back to habeas -- if you go back to the debates over ratification, no one offered the ridiculous argument that the habeas clause did not guarantee the right to habeas.  there were alot of subtle arguments over the proper division of state and federal power.  the  pinckney proposal and its modification reflects the view of many of the ""framers"" that the constiution  should not be considered the source of rights but rather a charter for what power should be given the government.   so, many members of the convention thought it was not proper for the federal constituion to guarantee any rights.   the right of habeas corpus was regarded as the birthright of all americans and not for the contitutional convention to grant or to take away.  this was important at the time of ratification because the federalists said repeatedly that people were retaining rights that weren't expressly taken away by the constitution.  this same point is made in the 9th amendment, which neoperiapt and gonzalez ignore.  if habeas isn't included in the rights reserved to the people, what on earth is?  the whole point of the 9th amendment was to prevent the government from arguing that rights like habeas could be withdrawn because the language of the constituion can be read in a crabbed way to say the right isn't affirmatively guarateed by the express langaugage of the document.  there's no evidence at all that anyone on any side of the framing or ratification controversey (federalist or anti-federalist or fence-sitter) was engaging in the kind of wordsmithing proposed by neoperiapt and gonzales.  there were some rights that event the members of the constitutional convention believed should be protected against federal interference in the constitution and habeas was one of them.  it was a common law right that was being explicitly protected.  

of course, the argument today isn't about whether or not habeas is in the constitution, but whether gonzales and neoperiapt can read the clause in a cramped way to allow for circumvention of the great writ by the federal government, or one reads it in a liberal way to uphold the fundamental rights that were promised in the constitution.  that's a question for today, and is ours to answer.",tourgee,2007-01-20 17:25:18,reddit.com,2,"straight: het, straight: het, straight: het"

interesting that most of this is from the old testament. i will grant that the new testament is a powerful and visionary set of philosophy in places. it eschews materialism, promotes acceptance, basically is hippie liberalism all over the place.

if you're a straight male (or a gay male who is content to stay in the closet), or straight female, it's extremely easy to rail against the sins of homosexuality. it's easy to read genesis literally and dismiss scientific consensus. if you're a male or adult female past child-bearing age (or still fertile, but with access to birth control), nothing is easier than routinely voting for a pro-life candidate and deluding yourself into thinking you've done your part.

it's extraordinarily difficult, however, to deny yourself worldly goods in the interest of helping the less-fortunate. the phrase 'upper middle class christian' should be as inherently contradictory as 'radical islamic homosexual.' unfortunately, that's not the case. i can think of one thing that would be harder than giving more money to the poor: trying to sustain a congregation or following while preaching that others should give to the poor. people would leave that church in a heartbeat and would find no shortage of excuses to do so.

czglf,t1_czelc,"&gt; where's disco? 

i don't think it would belong.  at least, if you start slicing up popular music and trying to call any of its distinctive moments ""fads,"" you'll be in for a long night of list-making.   

to the people participating in disco as a pop cultural moment, it was just what was contemporary and cool.  yeah, it was replaced quickly enough, but only by equally fleeting things (""punk,"" kind of, to the extent it was posed as a backlash; ""new wave,"" which was just pop only with a scrubbed punk aesthetic and synths, ""alternative,"" which was posed as an alternative to what was popular, which was actually dance pop, which was just the slickness of new wave married to the dance-driven imperatives of disco) and on and on and on.  punk, grunge, alternative, college, metal, rap, etc.  they've all had their moment as the dominant popular music in the past two decades. they all have the cultural life expectancy of mayflies, they all eventually yield to the next big thing even if they soldier on in niche markets after their period of dominance ends. 

pop music's function is to mutate constantly.  in the age of carefully identified and segmented markets that are often sold to on the basis of their rebellion against ""the mainstream,"" most people listening to ""pop music"" probably don't think that's what they're listening to at all, because even though it's mass produced and readily available to anyone with a radio or cable television, it's sold as being _not_ what everyone is listening to (unless the market it's being sold to prefers to believe it listens to what everyone else listens to).

czh02,t1_czek7,"&gt;they were amazed as to how well they were cared for

well that is good to hear, but it sure wasn't apparent from your first post.  if you had said, ""i'll get a kitten from the newspaper from someone giving it up,"" there would have been nothing for me to comment on.  but when you said you might get a kitten from a pet store for $85, that turned it into an issue.

&gt;why charge me $100 for saving an animal?

because it almost always includes spay/neuter, it helps a good cause, it shows commitment to the animal, and it prevents lab scroungers from picking them up.  while some pet mills and many breeders raise animals humanely, any store that can sell an animal for $85 is buying from an unethical source.

&gt;are you aware they get donations etc

they do, but usually only a fraction of their operating expense.  most if not all spcas are tax-exempt.  if they happen to have money left at the end of the year, they are required by law to invest it in the organization.  hopefully that benefits the animals, but maybe not in every case.

&gt;average consumer doesn't care where he gets the pet. 

and that is the root of the problem with animal overpopulation and mistreatment.  if you are not responsible enough to know the consequences of where you buy an animal, what are the chances you will raise that animal humanely?

&gt;and there is no way to kill in ""humane way""

now that is quite arguable.  drowning is out.  but some neuroscientists believe lack of oxygen while distressing for a few seconds, leads to euphoria.  possibly there is some pain involved, but you wouldn't know unless you were euthanized would you? the mistreatment many unwanted animals experience likely trumps any pain they may experience being killed by phenobarbital.

&gt;stray cat is better than a dead cat.

grew up in the us.
muslim and practicing.
no i don't shake hands with guys. 
this really didn't hit me hard until my debate teacher in high school managed to get me to go to competitions. after each match, i had to explain why i wouldn't shake their hand if they were male. all was fine. it was just a debate match. nothing big.
people were confused at first, but then that in itself invoked interesting conversations during meals.
a few years later, majoring in electrical and computer engineering i find myself going to career fairs. i have 2 min at most to make the person i talk to remember me. ok fine. i go through two years of career fairs, not really looking for offers, but more to get a feel for the whole thing. i decide that i am not going to shake the guy's hands. but apparently it takes much more for 50 year old managers to get over the fact that i won't shake their hand, even though i am wearing a headscarf. so hopefully that indicates to them that i am not pulling the religious excuse out of my ass. but no.i have seen anything from glares to complete change of tone. i am not complaining. i saw it coming. all is fine. 

there must surely be a way around this. or so i think. last spring i take an engineering communications class. subject comes to interviews and such, as it was the class before the spring expo. professor, having been the vp of ""large corporate company"", shares insider insight: whether you will get an offer or not after the interview depends on the impression you make and most recruiters make up their mind within the first 3 minutes.

great. i have 3 minutes to convince a middle aged most likely white man that i am the best candidate he has, and that no, i don't shake hands with guys, but that doesn't mean  i don't know my stuff. dammit.

so i go to the professor's office hours. this being the very first time i have consulted someone about this whole not shaking a guy's hand thing. i explain. his eyes keep getting  wider and wider. i am done. 30 seconds pause. ""hmm, you are screwed."" only then he realizes he actually said that out loud, and tries to mitigate the situation with, ""but there must be a way around it. you should just explain it. it's really not to your advantage but if you really have to then there is no way around it."" i knew all that. useless.

so this year i actually needed to find a coop. i analyze the situation. weigh my options and suck it up. i go to the career fair, shake their hands and talk. within a week i have quite a few interviews lined up. and after a few weeks i have offers from all the interviews but one. looks good.

how many interviews i got from the two previous career fairs? none.

am i glad? no. i would have rather not shaken their hands. did it do anything to me? no. i am still the person i was. i still refuse to shake guys' hands in a personal setting. and sometimes as i just recently found out, it means for my best friend to call her friend that i have never met and we are about to eat dinner with ahead and explain that i don't shake hands with guys, so that he doesn't try. because according to her, and having witnessed my explanation and apology routine quite a few time, it just leaves the situation awkward. the friend asks why? and she answers it's a muslim thing. 
this apparently was the lesson she learned after my apology and explanation for not shaking her military-retired dad went less than ideal with his response, ""i wasn't going to shake your hand anyway."" (this all happening while he is carrying boxes downstairs and sees me and i say hi and he scrambles to set down the boxes)

close enough for the purposes of this absurd argument.

heh. boy, you really are getting desperate. i suppose if we completely ignore the biological realities of human gestation and pretend we're in a parallel reality where women's wombs are external to their bodies, fetuses gestate without causing health problems in the women, are obviously conscious and viable from the moment of conception - then yes, i think that maybe i'd have a problem with abortion.

but then we're talking about killing a viable human, and not removing a piece of tissue.

&gt;so those abortion procedures where part of the fetus's body exit the vaginal canal, these are wrong?

&gt;and those pregnancies that cause no harm, abortion should be illegal for those?

again, you're making up your own reality. pregnancy always causes harm to the woman. but that's only part of the issue. until a fetus is an *actual human being* (which i take to mean viable outside the womb), it is a part of the woman's body, and it is up to her whether she wants to harm her body in order to have a child, or not. to say otherwise is to treat women as incubators.",NoFixedAbode,2007-01-21 16:16:03,reddit.com,2,straight: het

""you have had the opportunity to amend the sentence, as it might have simply been casually thrown out there, but it becomes clearer you believe it as is.""

i do believe it as is.  federal research always costs more and is less effective than it should be.  nasa is a perfect example.  private enterprise is currently doing more to getting us to the solar system than nasa ever will, and they will do it for far far less.

with federal research, you have to deal with federal rules, federal oversight, and federal budgets.  federal budgets tend to come with strings attached.

the worst part of federal research is that any particular line of research, such as space travel, is controlled and driven by one individual with his or her own goals.  

within the private sector right now, there are at least 2 different groups trying to create a vehicle to get us to the rest of the solar system, and at least one other one trying to create a space elevator.

if we left it solely to the feds, we'd still be arguing about whether we should make a lunar base, a space station, or try to get to mars, with every few years a new change in leadership that puts us back to square one.

the feds have this same problem with every line of research.  unless it's military and secret that is, but even then it's hugely unnecessarily expensive.

""i have plenty of tolerance for opposing views, but i have none for the type of extreme statement that you made that comes neither with an argument, evidence, or any room for the possibility of being wrong.""

czlql,t1_czllj,"&gt;consciousness is now your criteria?

no, it is *a* criteria. and there's no fine line to be draw, because it's a very complex issue. basically, the closer a thing is to a viable, conscious, human being the more we should treat it like a human being.

a fetus is obviously not a viable human being - for quite awhile it bears absolutely no resemblance to a human being. therefore we shouldn't treat it like a little human sitting in a woman's body.

by a viable organism, i mean an organism that tries to maintain its life by seeking out and satisfying its needs. a human infant seeks food, warmth, and companionship - it is viable. a fetus, separated from the womb does not do these things (except may much later in the pregnancy and i already stated that i think that later term abortions where the fetus is conscious and viable i think are much closer to murder than abortion).

&gt;hardly the bizarro universe. it's right here, 20 years from now.

so now we can bring in reality 20 years and the future and use it to support our arguments? ok, fine. if a man and women can place their sperm and eggs in a jar and out pops a baby a few months later, then people probably won't have abortions (at least, in places where these technologies exist), so this whole discussion becomes moot.

&gt;so your definition relies on whether or not it's inexpensive? prisoners cost nearly $40,000 a year to incarcerate, should we execute all of them, no matter the crime?

big difference. pregnancy is expensive both economically and medically to a woman - an individual. with prisoner we're talking about a social problem and a completely different thing.

when i'm talking about bringing expense into the equation, i'm suggesting that maybe it's not moral to force a woman to assume a huge economic burden just to preserve the life of a piece of tissue.

&gt;no. while those pregancies that do cause harm are hardly what would be called uncommon, let alone rare, it's simply not true that all cause harm. how can you even argue against such a declaration, it's like you just claimed that the sky is orange and that trees grow upside down.

quite simply you are wrong, and do not know the first thing about pregnancy. have you ever talked to a pregnant woman? actually read anything about the changes a woman's body goes through during pregnancy to support the fetus?

pregnancy effects virtually every organ and system in the body of a woman. bones lose calcium to build the bones of the baby, hormone levels change drastically, many women become diabetic, gain weight, stretch organs and skin almost to the point of tearing. i could go on, and on, and on, but i trust you know how to use google and are interested in fixing your vast ignorance on these issues.",NoFixedAbode,2007-01-21 16:49:50,reddit.com,1,straight: het

czm4f,t1_czlz7,"i think abortion is generally immoral. i make exceptions for rape (note that i do not lump incest in with this) and for health reasons. even supposing a fetus is a human being, if the fetus will die anyway when the mother does, what is unethical about this? supposing the baby would survive, and the mother wouldn't, i still would let the woman make this decision. i would refuse to judge her regardless of the decision she would make.

in rape, it's still a human being, but something more akin to justifiable homicide. any guilt would be the burden of the rapist, not his victim.

i consider it only to be immoral once implantation has occurred. the morning after pill is ok.

i think that legislation cannot hope to solve this. i am in favor of leaving laws as they are, and neither repealing roe vs. wade nor trying to chip away at it as the fundies do.

czmuu,t1_czma6,"ok,

again you are way off topic. and you aren't making any sense.

the whole point of opec is to artificial control oil prices. they do this by putting caps on output. sometimes they are able to agree, sometimes not. but the whole point of the existence of the organization is to limit output of oil so that the price goes up. this is really indisputable. 

from your own article. why you cite it i have no idea.

&gt;in 1999 the price of crude oil dropped close to $12/barrel. this frightened opec into real cooperation, and as i write this in early 2000, the opec nations seem to be operating at close to their agreed quotas, and the price of crude oil is at a 9-year high, around $30 a barrel. probably opec calculates that this is around the price that the industrial nations can afford to pay without major damage to their currently prosperous economies

do american oil conglomerates do the same thing? yes in the sense of doing whatever it takes to maximize the price per barrel. obviously it is counter-productive to bring on new extraction technologies which would increase the volume of oil available. the oil sands being one of many options that would increase production.

as for your second link. again i have no idea what you were linking to. [here is a much better one.](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/oil.html) the gist being that one lone company has been working for years to make sand extraction compete with **$20 a barrel oil, in the 90's**. is it that it can't be done? no. it's that no one is really serious about doing it. why? because it will ultimately force oil prices down.

the party for overcharging oil is over. as the market is showing in its slide since january when there is some threatenable oversight of the market. the only reason we saw almost $85 dollar a barrel oil was the intentional mismanagement of the oil market and our foreign policy by the current bush/cheney administration. we are heading back down to $30 a barrel crude or lower depending on how much of a war the sunni's and shia's can be made to fight in the region. and whether oil comes from alberta sand cheaply or not is really a function of the will to put enough minds on the problem to make it happen.",smacfarl,2007-01-21 19:34:19,reddit.com,1,straight: het

or maybe you're just hiding behind a stereotype that allows you to preserve your bigotry.

&gt; if you are a woman then you make my case for me. ... if you are a man then you have a screw loose.

well, you've certainly insulated yourself from the necessity to revisit your stereotypes in the event of conflicting evidence. 

i'm a man, which makes me a non-man-hating, non-lesbian feminist, and makes my spouse a non-man-hating, non-lesbian feminist as well.

let me share a story with you. i actually used to know a lesbian, man-hating, separatist radical feminist. after she left her abusive husband, she decided to give up on men altogether and even planned eventually to move to a women's-only intentional community she had discovered somewhere in the states. 

she was involved in a project with my partner, and called our house from time to time to speak with her. the first few times i answered the phone, she wouldn't even say anything. then, she would brusquely ask for my spouse, and would simply say, ""i'll call back later"" if she wasn't available. finally, she decided i was good enough to take a message for her.

i could have been affronted, insulted, and quite frankly pissed off by her evident opprobrium toward me. in fact, part of me was; but part of me also recognized that by reacting to her hostility, i would simply be reinforcing her stereotype of men as vulgar, abusive, insensitive boors. so i decided to try a different tack: i was unfailingly gentle and polite toward her, and made attempts at conversation when i found opportunities to do so.

after awhile, she became more kindly disposed toward me, and eventually, we became quite friendly and would chat on the phone or when we were at some social event together. on one occasion, she made a disparaging remark about men, and i called her on it. ""you're overgeneralizing,"" i said. ""i'm a man, and i don't think what you said is an accurate description of the way i behave.""

""well, you're different,"" she replied. ""you're not like typical men.""

""ahh,"" i said. ""sammy davis jr. syndrome.""

""what?"" she asked.

i explained. ""sammy davis jr. was the proverbial black man in a white man's world, and on many occasions, people around him would make openly racist jokes. sometimes he would get upset and say, 'hey, do you mind? i'm black.'"" people would reply, 'you're not black - you're sammy davis jr.!'""

well, she was pretty angry and ended the conversation right after. however, she called me back a couple of days later, told me she'd been thinking about what i said, and agreed that she had been stereotyping unfairly. she realized that she was starting to become that which she most abhorred - someone who judges and dismisses people on the basis of preconceptions and prejudgments.

the most stereotypical radical lesbian feminist i ever knew (actually, the *only* stereotypical radical lesbian feminist i ever knew, and i know plenty of feminists) demonstrated that she was better than her bigotry, willing to subject her own dogmatism to some honest, critical thinking.

losing a favorite startup does not have the same impact on its founder as an impact of losing the sole source of sustenance for any employee.

it's like having your pet project die.  it's sad, but it's not that bad.  you move on.  it's not like losing your sole source of income.

&gt; and that doesn't even include the opportunity cost, they could have been doing something else that might have paid off.

that's nonsense.  that which you think you could have been doing instead, is as likely to fail as it is to succeed.  in any case, while ""opportunity cost"" is not an entirely useless concept, you have to be careful in how you use it.  in particular, you should avoid mindlessly comparing the current situation to some arbitrary mental construct of what ""could have been"".  you need to understand the limitations of comparing something presently real to something hypothetical.

&gt; google developers rarely have google as their only job choice. people who create startups usually do so out of ambition, not for lack of options.

correct.  that's what i said.  founders don't rely on their startups for sustenance.  if the startup fails, from a founder's perspective, it's either no loss or an annoying loss, but not a ""make or break, do or die"" loss.

most employees do rely on their jobs as the sole source of sustenance.

the employees that knowingly choose to work for a startup are similar to the founders -- they can either afford it, or have nothing to lose.  alternatively they are deluded and swallow some kool-aid that distorts reality -- for example, the employees are told that there is no way that this particular startup could fail and that making mega-millions is all but guaranteed, and so on, and of course there are some idiots who will believe that.

czn7h,t3_zl51,"quite a few years back, when i was young and impressionable, i bought a deck of cards for playing dungeons and dragons. the idea was to have a random encounter with these three hundred cards, each with an individual encounter on them. i had dungeon mastered for a small group of my friends for a while, and these were inexpensive and helpful. i recall one card where an old lady is found wandering alone in the wilderness, and she leads the player characters to her cottage in the woods. the dm then decides whether or not this old lady turns out to be a doppelganger or other horrible creature that the pcs can kill.

i was having a casual conversation with my pastor at church, and the matter of my playing dnd came up. he seemed very concerned, (especially since i kept the source material in my room in a box at the foot of my bed) and told me ""a true story"" about a friend of his who used to listen to marylin manson's music. (which we all know is satanic and evil :] )

now, this friend was a christian, but after a few months of listening to the music and having the posters up on her walls, she began to seclude herself in her room more and more often, and became isolated and depressed. this went on for a few months before she came to this pastor for advice. of course, since marylin manson's music is satanic, and satan wants to steal each person's soul through it, this is the sole cause of the depression, social anxiety, and seclusion.

he had her bring in all her cds, posters, cassettes, (pfft) concert ticket stubs, t-shirts - anything at all that was evil and she didn't want in her room. when they were done, he burned them all in her backyard and said a prayer over her for her protection and happiness. after that moment, she was no longer depressed and she had no problems hanging out with others. it was a phenomenal success, and a testament to the saving power of jesus! hallelujah!

so, when i was talking to him, he relates this story to me and advises me to do the same with my sourcebooks and dm stuff, as well as all my notes i took in-game.

i don't do this for quite some time, but the story he told me goes through my head over and over again, especially when i'm trying to get to sleep at night. i knew that dnd couldn't possibly be satanic... but for some reason, it still bothered me.

in fact, it bothered me enough that after a few months of thinking about it, i found i couldn't get to sleep easily, and had nightmares more often than i was used to. those sourcebooks just must be the problem.

so, i took them down to the fireplace and burned them. immediately, i felt better and that night i found i could sleep much easier. years later, thinking back, i realize an essential truth about how the mind works. i also realize now that this subconscious belief in an untruth can even affect adults who don't realize it's happening.

i find it interesting that you say ""it is a big coop, whether or not you think it is in practice."" by ""in practice"" don't you really mean ""in reality""? do you prefer to point at a few words on a piece of hemp paper and say ""this is a representative federal republic because this piece of paper says so"" rather than take a look at your current situation and realize that this is not the case; and that this is not the case precisely because the president has publicly stated and admitted to ignoring the constitution (and thereby that he is above it) and we have done nothing about it? you have no right to appeal to the constitution if you are unwilling to defend it.

intelligence on greatness has not changed over the course of u.s. history. that is, its predictive power has neither increased nor declined with time. 

the indirect things they estimate: 

* openness to fantasy -- ""vivid imagination and rich fantasy life; dreamy,"" 
* openness to aesthetics -- ""deep appreciation of art, music, poetry, beauty; artistic, original,"" 
* openness to feelings -- ""receptivity to own inner feelings and emotions. experience emotions fully and value them; excitable, spontaneous,"" 
* openness to actions -- ""willingness to try new activities, go new places, do things differently; wide interests, adventurous,"" 
* openness to ideas -- ""intellectual curiosity, willingness to consider new ideas; idealistic, inventive,"" 
* openness to values -- ""readiness to reexamine (or reject) social, political and religious values; unconventional""

czng1,t1_czn69,"&gt; define a corrupt war. define incomprehensible moral failure. weak, very weak. we're victims...all victims.

a war on the whim of an unelected president against an enemy that had never attacked us and posed no threat, with massive civilian casualties, rampant profiteering, and a lack of planning that *beggars belief*.  all timed perfectly for the republicans to cynically exploit americans' patriotism for the 2002 midterm election.

victims?  we've plunged a country into civil war for no reason.  we're not victims, *we're villains*.  villains by proxy who *barely notice* we've caused the deaths of over  half a million people.  and no, i'm *not* blaming about our soldiers.  most of them have served with unimpeachable honor.  i'm blaming the *rest of us who sent them there to kill and be killed for no good reason*.

&gt; why don't you stand up and do something other than hold hands with the politicans. change things from the inside. put your money/time where your mouth is for a change!

hold hands with politicians?  **i kicked politicans' asses.**  i donated and phone banked for around a dozen candidates, making thousands of phone calls to encourage people to vote and tell them how to report illegal vote suppression. 

you may not have noticed (the press certainly did its best not to), but we democrats *shut the republicans out*.   we kicked republicans out of 31 house seats, 5 senate seats, and 6 governors' mansions.  they didn't take *any* of ours. we've broadened our party's reach into the south and west.  netroots-backed candidates won all over the country against incredible odds.  [it was a stunning victory](http://www.mydd.com/story/2006/11/8/45817/2313).

**november 2006 was the tipping point.**   

if we had lost, this rogue presidency would be broadening the iraq war to engulf the entire middle east and america would be on an accelerating slide towards fascism.  this administration has made torture and illegal surveillance policy, made it *routine*.  where do you think they'd stop themselves?  death squads?  prison camps?  they already use these tools on external enemies.  do you honestly think they'd have any qualms about using them on internal enemies as soon as they could get away with it?

**we won.**

we're stopping the war, exposing the bush cabal's criminality and holding them accountable.  we're starting to repair the damage bush has done to our country.

we didn't win by ignoring politics.  we didn't win by being cynical and apathetic and telling ourselves ""politicians are all the same"".  we won because i, and millions of ordinary people like me, *gave a damn and showed up*.  some of us sent $20 to a promising candidate.  some of us phone banked for a couple evenings or a couple days.  some of us spent the summer and fall sleeping on couches and working 70 hour weeks.  each of us did what we could.

it's useful to think about opportunity cost only when you understand the limitations of speculative, hypothetical comparisons of mental constructs.  for example, the notion of opportunity cost may be useful to sort out your feelings on where you stand with regard to your motivation.  but it's 100% useless in terms of financial decision making, or in terms of making a decision to pursue your passion.",[deleted],2007-01-22 01:46:01,programming,-2,"straight: het, straight: het, straight: het"

czo0x,t1_czkz8,"wow, there’s whole lot of assumptions wrapped up in there. my problem with your post was not any of the issues that you raise but that it was an un-thought through knee jerk reply.

yes i have noticed an anti-christian trend on reddit. at least 3 reasons i think: first a high proportion of users are rationalists (that doesn’t mean we always manage to be rational btw, please forgive us) so religion pisses us off when it claims special authority based on irrational beliefs; second religious groups have been making a bit of a fuss in the world lately and lastly the famous reddit groupthink, which is a problem but is not the overwhelming force that some claim.

i believe that the daily mail article was misogynistic if seen as part of a strong thread in the british right-wing press to focus on specific issues around islam and women as being a problem. (shrykk has already put it better in his reply.) so no hypocrisy on this particular point then. a question for you, how was the article the complete opposite of misogynistic as you claim?

the reason that i (and maybe the other lunkheads) slag the mail is that i love britain and i hate the small mindedness and fear that it fosters so that it can sell newspapers. it brings out and feeds on the worst and least generous aspects of white british culture. 

you assume that i have a problem with people criticising islam. big assumption. what i do object to is taking specific episodes to smear whole communities. i disagree with large swathes of the religion, in as far as i know about it. i have no axe to grind with the individuals brought up in it. there are definite problems with immigrant and more-recent-immigrant cultures learning to live with each other, and it isn’t all white racism, but they need dealing with over time, not with unhelpful daily mail style frothing.

as for the excluded middle here:  you yourself are guilty of this.  you claim that the snake handler is damaging the environment and criticize him.  geofferensis and i are pointing out that we ourselves almost certainly do much more damage in our own ways and that criticizing this guy is pointless.  we've already adopted the excluded middle ground:  this guy isn't the only person guilty of damaging the environment.  we all are!  and you are attacking that statement based on what?  can you actually make an rational argument that it isn't true?  you may decry the use of the rhetorical tactic of focusing the attention back on ourselves, but what complaint or objection can you legitmately assert to protest that?  in short, the snake hunter may have handled things less than ideally, but i think it's still valuable to point out that he is the least of our worries where the environment is concerned.

recall that geofferensis never said we shouldn't care *about nature or the environment because they live in a house and use electricy*.  so, what's stupid about what actually has been said?  you're misquoting the gp article.  you’re calling people names instead of exchanging ideas.  and you can't even spell!!!

czpom,t1_czm31,"first off, this will piss people off.  i apologise for that, but it's impossible to say some things without some people taking offence at them, irrespective of how they're expressed.  all strapped in?  ok?  then let's go.

""integrating with a society, so long as it does not interfere with what i believe is completely acceptable.""

integrating with a society ""as long as it doesn't require you to change your behaviour in any significant way"" is not integrating.  integrating is the process of compromising on your behaviour to fit into the society better.  if you don't compromise on anything and run into problem you haven't integrated.  if you don't compromise and don't run into problems, you were integrated already.  integration is a process of compromising.

it's your prerogative to ignore or disagree with any cultural customs you like - as long as there are no overwhelming safety or legal consequences.  even underwhelming considerations can be bypassed - for example sikh motorcycle riders in the uk are allowed to ride without helmets, since it's impossible to wear a helmet and a turban, and their religion mandates a turban.

that said, if you voluntarily choose to refuse cultural customs, it is not guaranteed anywhere that everyone in the country has to agree with your decision, or not come to any negative conclusions about you.

in this case, it's a relatively tiny thing - handshaking is the most common form of greeting in the western world, and plays a large part in establishing trust and rapport in new encounters (i believe it originally stems from demonstrating your hands are empty of weapons and so you can be trusted, but i digress).

it's a simple, non-invasive, minimal-bodily-contact custom used to establish trust.  if someone opts out of it, they are going to look:

1. shifty - handshakes establish trust, and many people believe they can tell a person's personality from the strength/firmness/whatever of a person's handshake.  anyone obviously and deliberately opting out of this procedure immediately starts off being viewed as less trustworthy, even at a subconscious level.

2. odd - while i respect others' religious beliefs, it's a pretty tiny thing to compromise on.  refusing to compromise even a little bit to the ""normal"" attitude, even in order to make your self look better is (understandably, but still technically) self-defeating.  people who show *apparently* arbitrary odd behaviours (eg, for no *apparent* good reason not acting in your own best interests) are harder to relate to, and the one thing you want to do in a business context is establish a rapport with your prospective employer/sale/whoever.

3. demanding of special consideration - handshakes are a pretty trivial thing in the secular, western, uk.  anyone who will deliberately break this expected part of the social ceremony instantly appears (hell, *is*) the kind of person who will demand special treatment and consideration.  i'm nto saying it's right, but when you're running a business, special treatment are unnecessary mental and paperwork overheads.  if you've got two equal candidates, one of whom will plug straight in to your structure, and one of whom will necessitate various changes throughout it, you go with the one who will cause the least disruption to the business.

i'm not dissing anyone's religion or faith here (although given you're presumably allowed to travel on buses/trains/underground trains at rush-hour, or can stand in a crowd, the accidental touching of men is likely impossible to avoid).

people should be allowed to believe what they want, and as long as it hurts no-one else, act as they wish.

however, that also other means people are free to jump to whatever conclusions they wish if the first person appears to be acting rudely, shiftily or just arbitrarily.

it's hard to express this kind of sentiment without immediately being branded prejudiced or a racist, but there are valid arguments there to answer.

tolerance is supposedly a hallmark of the west, and a great ideal to live with.  the trouble is if you bend over backwards to accommodate people because they're less tolerant than you, eventually you end up living in an intolerant society (because, eg, images of the prophet mohammed (pbuh) offend certain people, so we all have to avoid them).

these guys are like cult leaders predicting the end of the earth - each time they're wrong and go back to their entrails and texts to eliminate the small error in interpretation, their followers become more emotionally convinced that *next time* they'll be right.

neither cybercommerce, nor the y2k bug, nor fractional reserve banking, nor any of the dreaded state artifacts or disruptive technologies these neoliberal doom merchants prattle on about in their paid monthly newsletters and overhyped paperback tracts, is going to bring about the end of government. 

the alternatives to government are indeed worse, and we don't need to imagine because we've seen it happen enough times. when the power of the government to impose the rule of law ends, as in the case of, say, somalia or afghanistan, what you end up with is self-serving warlords, widespread terror, extreme brutality, casual atrocities, abject poverty, and personal despair. 

it doesn't take most or even many ruthless people to make this happen; but in the right conditions, those people who are willing to take by force what they want will build fiefdoms and extend their reach through violence and intimidation. organized efforts to prevent such excesses and abuses are called ... liberal, democratic governments.

i'll take government power and the risks of accountability to an often-apathetic public  and to professional standards of conduct that are steadily eroded by the lure of graft and cronyism, thank you, and i'll do my part as a citizen to try and make it work as well as possible.

there's nothing wrong with trying to be more [self-reliant](http://www.raisethehammer.org/article/481/) and trying to build localized community relationships that are small and close enough that personal accountability can flow from community mores. such individual and community independence is healthy to cultivate even if the governmenet is comparatively benevolent and responsive, because it builds self-reliance and is more efficient and personal than bureaucratic structures.

what you describe is possible to experience.  experience knows no limits.  all is possible to experience.

since all experiences are possible, the only way to distinguish valid experiences from invalid ones, is via a mindset.  there is nothing in the experience itself that can do this.  experience does not judge itself as valid or invalid.  experience does not appear within our awareness pre-judged as it were.  it is judged accordingly by our mindset.  that mindset is subject to change under certain circumstances.  when it changes, the way a person experiences life changes fundamentally and what is possible and impossible, what is valid and invalid also changes.

this does assume that you believe other people really exist already, of course, at a minimum.

czse5,t1_cznor,"option one: we can choose to divorce ourselves from anything remotely related to the military.  this adds up to living naked in mud and straw huts eating only fruit and bugs.

option two: we can choose to recognize the fact that various military organizations have been an integral part of human society since the beginning of written records, and, probably, even before that.

i believe that human civilization is, as a whole, a good thing.  this extends to the military.  there is a common, and false attitude that the military is some sort of vestigial organization of killers left over from the days of privative tribes.  in fact, it is a necessary response to population pressures that drive sub-populations (typically referred to as tribes, gangs or nations) to attempt to improve their standard of living at the expense of other sub-populations (ie.. conquest).  as long as we are trapped on only one planet of finite size, these population pressures will exist.  in other words, the function of the military is to prevent the whole of human history from being dominated by characters like genghis kahn instead of being dominated by characters like sir isaac newton.  therefore supporting the military, in general, is a good idea.

with regards to sponsoring military technology specifically, progress in the military arts has generally resulted in lower casualties as a result of warfare, both amongst civilians and soldiers.  examples are too numerous to list fully but they include precision munitions, and nuclear weapons.  anything that can be described as a ""force multiplier"" tends to favor small standing armies of professionals rather than large poorly trained mobs of novices.  professionals act like well... professionals, they rarely loot or engage in atrocities, and when they do, they are usually held accountable.",Lucretius,2007-01-22 13:03:45,reddit.com,2,gay: fruit

taste is in fact, whimiscal and ever-changing.  good taste and bad taste, while the essence of fashion, is irrelevant in art.  craft is important, because it determines whether it is done well or poorly.  would you be more inclined to listen to an articulate speaker or a foul-mouthed brute?  it is not trickery.  it is technique.  (incidentally, the very word, ""technique,"" is derived from the greek word for art, ""techne."")  and the idea that you can make yourself ""immune"" to trickery, is self-deceiving.  if you are looking at a piece of cloth on a wall and thinking about a woman whose ""image"" is painted on it, or the smell of varnish, then you've been duped.  if you're seeing a penetrating view of a landscape on a 2-dimensional surface, then you've been fooled.  art is all trickery.  it's why plato thought it best not to allow art into his utopian fantasy world.

i am unsure whether you're asking about how you run multiple servers with seaside or how you handle upgrades across multiple servers. i'll answer both.

seaside, although extremely good at dynamic content, is not a speed daemon, and therefore almost any real seaside application will be deployed behind a proxy server that farms static content out to apache or similar and dynamic content to seaside. as long as you use a proxy server that can do load-balancing (which is nearly all of them these days), you can use a lamp-like tiered fan-out, where a single proxy front-end farms out to multiple seaside back-ends. you will need to activate session affinity, due to how seaside works, but nearly all load-balancing proxies support that these days.

deployment to multiple servers can be handled in a few ways. the easiest way is simply to push your updated code into a running server. because smalltalk programs don't really have a separate compile and run step, this is trivially doable. leveraging the fact that your seaside apps will probably be running behind a proxy, your other option is simply to deploy new smalltalk images alongside your old ones on a different port, then update your proxy server to drain-stop your old images in favor of your new ones.",gecko,2007-01-22 17:14:51,programming,12,"gay: msm, gay: msm, straight: het"

czvs2,t1_czvhd,"&gt; think we'd all get down to the point if we threw out all the philosophical pandering about what people should do, and concentrate on what people will do. 

i agree. this is extremely practical, and quite likely the only direction that will work. things like telling teenagers ""that abstinence is the best and safest way"" is just plain stupid.

&gt; all morality as we currently are aware of it is dictated by familiarity

most of it. i like to think that i at least give passing thought to the unfamiliar, and what it means.

&gt; now, the real question that comes is not ""are we good people"" if we allow or restrict such a thing as abortion.

going with your ""be practical"" strategy, restricting it simply won't work. and, if people really should be appalled at the idea of abortion, then it's prevention, not punishment, which should be the goal. and not just prevention of the procedure itself, though that is sinister enough. supposing a child is born that wouldn't have been wanted otherwise, we need to do things to keep that kid from growing up in a crackhouse, from half-starving the first years of its life, from being mistreated or abandoned.

preventing abortion is only the first step of many that would need to be undertaken to make things right. we would need to find ways of continuing it from there. i'm not wise enough to know how this could be done, though i have a few ideas, they certainly aren't the whole picture.

&gt; the question that really comes, in the end, is ""what culture may come of this, where such a view is its only acceptable one?"" and ""is this a culture i want to live in?""

it's not an acceptable one. it's not one i would want to live in, given a choice. it's a culture in which human life is devalued, where we let accountants decide whether you're a person or not by counting up how many cells you're composed of, and how many are functioning neurons, where we let bureaucrats decide who lives and who dies based on which side of a vagina you happen to be on. where we start deciding for people whether it's better for them to remain alive or not based on an iq test.

if an 8 month old fetus is fair game, why not a 1 month old infant? one's no less a person than another. technology will steal the excuse away from compromisers who like to draw the line at viability, and yet this won't deter the pro-abortionists one bit. the whole point of the procedure is getting rid of the child, of course, and they won't feel at ease if they have less time in which to come to that decision.",NoMoreNicksLeft,2007-01-22 20:05:18,reddit.com,-2,"straight: het, straight: het"

czwk1,t1_czwbu,"&gt; but you didn't answer the question, how is a fetus a person in any relevant sense, ignoring the problematic ""potential human"" argument?

it's a human the same way you are. not potential, but actual. that it won't file a tax return this year does not make it less a person. that it's not as smart as some won't make it less a person. that it's not as big as some people, same deal.

i suppose we can do the sliding scale thing, but there is this cutoff point nature gives us. pro-abortionists want to allow it right up to that point, and yet i don't think we're exactly ready for a ""it's not quite murder if it were a newborn"" either.

or do you mean something else?

&gt; that is, human moral obligations should extend to entities in proportion to those entities' capacity to suffer pain, physical or emotional.

gee, that really sucks for those of us with a high pain threshold. it probably makes all vertebrates equally ""people"" in that sense. do you want cows elevated to your level of value, or would you rather be ground up into hamburger?

to answer your question as directly as possible. every single metric we might use has no clear demarcation point. using most of them alone would leave us able to murder people we already consider (even **know**) to be people. we can probably come up with some arbitrary combination of them that will exclude fetuses, but protect currently protected people. this lacks principle, and says we aren't protecting people, we're just making up rules convenient to some.

historically, that's been somewhat dangerous.

czxom,t1_czx73,"you're dodging. :)  the point i am making is that if you pursue any system, at some point it all comes to some assumption that's impossible to validate, that you simply must accept on faith.

what i was showing you was that even if i do agree to something, like ""that there are other people who are not imaginary"", i can still show you that you must rely on some arbitrary distinction somewhere in your system of thought.  it's a tough pill to swallow, because basically, if you take what i am saying seriously, it disembowels your ordinary ideas about reality, and that's never a pleasant thing.  it's not just logic that has to be strong for this to happen, it's also that a person has to be ready for this kind of investigation on an emotional level as well, because most people don't enjoy having the ground pulled from under their feet (which is what happens what you start questioning the most basic assumptions that most of humanity holds, mostly unconsciously, without even fully knowing what it is they subscribe to).

&gt;an experiment in which someone else can flip a switch and turn an experience of a flower (or whatever) on and off for you strongly suggests that the brain gives rise to your experiences.

i bet you don't really want to say what you say.  because if you are saying this, you mean:

1. external objects are not necessary for experience.
2. there is no simple relationship between experience and objects (such as if i see it, it exists, if i don't see it, it doesn't exist, one to one correspondence with the sense perceptions).

if you can turn experiences on and off with a switch, who is to say that what we see is actually not there?  i mean who is to say that the brain is not imagining everything?  or 90% of everything?  etc.  there is no way to validate anything other than the brain in your way of thinking.  of course you can't actually validate that the brain exists either if you're pressed for it hard, but even if we go with your own assumptions unchallenged, you have to admit that if the brain can generate vivid and sustained experiences internally, there is simply no solid ground upon which you can distinguish valid from invalid experiences.

the best thing to do is to accept the full extent of this and to forget about the brain altogether.  of course if you're a scientist who studies the brain, for example, that's hard to do, because that's the source of fun for you.  it would be like telling kids to forgo all their favorite candy. :)  i don't expect any such thing to happen.  i expect kids to grab those candy. :)

there are advantages and disadvantages to all these ways of relating to one's experience.  materialists have one advantage in that they live in a world that's is full of expected and stable behavior.  a fire hydrant remains a fire hydrant.  there is no magic, but then all things are pretty stable (at least they appear to be).  but it all comes with a cost, a downside.  the downside is that it eventually dehumanizes you, as you become more and more a meat puppet, a biorobot, with the same inherent value as a chicken or fish, or a steal robot, namely an expendable flashy toy at best, or a robot destined to crank out maximum possible number of widgets and reproduce before you die at worst.  robots only have that power which is designed into them.  you can't grow at a fundamental level.  for example you cannot become an angel or a spirit.  you'll always be what you are.  yes, it's stable, but **because** it's stable and unchanging, it's also stuck and cannot improve and lacks fluidity and awesome malleability that non-materialists can experience. :)  if something has great inertia, it's stable, but it doesn't move well.  the drawback to stability is poor adaptation to change.  it's necessary that it be that way.  if a thing has no inertia, if it's malleable, then it's also unstable for that very same reason.",[deleted],2007-01-23 00:30:24,science,1,gay: flower

czxyu,t1_czx8w,"&gt; nor do i find it intuitive to think that a fetus is a person. 

no big deal. stupid ignorant people have often had trouble recognizing different races or the deformed as human. so i can see how it might be tough for you.

&gt; in naming the fertilized and attached egg a person, i think you are returning back to the ""potential human"" argument in all but name.

well, a potential person is a hypothetical construct. it's a person that will be alive 300 years from now. the fertilized egg is alive in the biological sense. as opposed to say, a gamete. it's genetically human. it has continuity. to think that at some point it's magically a person but until that point (where ever you might set it) that it's not... that sounds almost religious. does it acquire a soul or something? it sounds pretty dumb.

i'd much rather figure that it was a person all along. i've met some really stupid people. that the blastocyst isn't very smart, doesn't bother me. it's certainly no dumber than a redstate voter, for instance. that it's not self-aware is not a big thing for me either... i see people drifting around every day. that it can be ugly (at least in the first few weeks) doesn't mean much either.

but tell me, just what is it then? is there some magical thing going on that once it gets squeezed out of a twat that it becomes a person? or do you do like most, and set the line where it's convenient for the irresponsibly promiscuous to get rid of something they were too lazy to prevent?

homicide is a more accurate term. murder is generally held to be something like the depraved and indifferent, pre-meditated homicide of another person. homicide is the killing of another person in general, and not a moral judgement in itself.

what's ridiculous though, is you continue to view it as ""choice"". this is the crux of the argument, whether or not it should be a choice. calling it such is fallacious. defend that this should even be a choice. do so in a manner that is logical and consistent. none of you even try, you just keep spouting off jingoistic crap.",NoMoreNicksLeft,2007-01-23 09:04:47,reddit.com,0,straight: het

the argument for non-materialism, here, is like the argument for god.  you can't prove that it's not true, strictly.  but since you have to choose your actions based on whether or not you believe it's true, you'll only have a chance of accomplishing external goals if you believe that they are meaningful.

and that's fine; feel free to believe that there is nothing external to you. :)  my only point was that **if** you are willing to accept the external existence of other people (at all), the ability of those other people to affect your experiences argues strongly for the separate existence of the material world, and for the idea that you are implemented in it.

does this mean you cannot become an angel or a spirit?  sort of.  but if it's **true**, you can't anyway, and if it's false, you can always change your mind, later.

the argument for substantiality is also like the argument for god.  you can't prove that substance exists (and logically it doesn't make sense for substance to exist, since you can show that there is nothing that can have an inherent identity).

i'd be much happier if materialists realized that their views are also an expression of faith rather than an all out absolute truth.

&gt;does this mean you cannot become an angel or a spirit? sort of. but if it's true, you can't anyway, and if it's false, you can always change your mind, later.

if it's false, the only way to find out that it's false is to first change your mind.  isn't that interesting though? :)  this is not a kind of thing that ""suggests itself to you"", you have to go for it willingly if you were to discover it.  but isn't that funny?  because most materialists have the ""show me an inordinate amount of proof before i will even consider your viewpoint"" attitude. :)  but as long as that's the attitude, it's impossible to ever prove it. :)  if mind can have non-ordinary influence on life, the only way to find out, is to try to use it in non-ordinary ways, since it's your own mind we're talking about.  and no one ""outside"" can show or prove you what your own mind can do if your mind is indeed what i say it is, and it decided not to listen.

it's important to recognize that there are classes of experiences and knowledges that are only open through willingness and can never be shown and proven to unwilling.  this is why the so-called skepticism is a total waste of time.

&gt;but just as knowing how light's interaction with water drops produces a rainbow does not make the rainbow less wonderful, i do not expect to find that understanding how chemicals and electrical flows produce people will make those people less valuable.

in general, i agree with you here.  like i said, all these views we discuss have advantage and disadvantages.  materialism has an advantage in that if you believe in it you can sincerely engage in science.  without believing in materialism you can still be a scientist, but then you'll know you're playing a big game and won't take yourself too seriously, and i believe it won't be the same thing, although this might be fun too.

on a personal level, whether or not you find materialism stifling depends on what experiences you crave.  if the limitations of matter are acceptable, it's not a problem.  but there comes a time when they stop being acceptable.  that's what happened to me.  i used to be a hard-core scientific materialist too.  i grew up in an environment where science was valued and where i myself used to value it, and where we laughed at religion.  but i changed my mind since then.

i'll never be happy with any organized religion, and i hate dogmatism of any kind.  that said, i see materialism as a type of religion in that you have to take it on faith that there is something external and something internal (because if there is nothing internal, ""external"" makes no sense).  and that religion, the religion of materialism is not for me.

one particular thing i dislike about materialism, is that all causes are necessarily seen as material.  this leads to all solution tending to be material as well.  so, for example, if you have a psychological problem, materialist doctors feel more comfortable prescribing a pill than recommending a person work with their mindset.  that is sad.

luckily dalai lama introduced the idea of neuroplasticity to western science, the idea that mind can affect the brain (contrary to the prevalent dogma that mind is solely the effect of the brain).  so while this hasn't cured materialists on a philosophical level yet, it does make their brand of materialism less stifling and moves them closer to freedom from my point of view.

materialism is not an inherently bad or good or neutral view.  it's not inherently anything.  same with my view.  but it would be nice if materialists could recognize that their view of the universe is 1. not the only possible self-consistent valid one, an 2. not a type of view that absolutely lacks any flaws.  scientists who understood that would become 10 times more charming in my opinion.",[deleted],2007-01-23 11:15:25,science,1,straight: het

and the entirety of your response was an *ad homine* and a repetition of your premise.

do you really think that that's an effective counter? ""he can't be right -- because if he's right, there's a chance that someone he knows might benefit!"" i should add that this parent is about to retire, and that at that point his source of income will change from insurance-broker premiums to social security, and that i'm against social security. so if we're judging the truth of an argument by the extent to which this truth harms the arguer, i'm netting something closer to a win.

&gt;still think that the idea of 'innovation in health insurance' amounts to ever more sophisticated versions of three-card-monte.

(note to readers who aren't laprice: this is going to basically repeat earlier arguments which laprice ignored. so it's probably as much a waste of your time to read it as it is mine to write it): if you have one provider of health insurance, they can make 'bet the company' decisions one at a time. they're likely to standardize, to create certain practices, and to be reluctant to change these practices on the grounds that it might be better down the road.

if you have 1000 insurance companies, there are 1000 different paradigms on which someone, somewhere, can be betting the company at any given time. there are thousands of tweaks, notions, features, and policies that can be used or not used, considered and ignored or implemented or reversed. a market with more than one company can handle more than one standard.

your argument is once again only correct if we have, right at this moment, reached an absolute pinnacle of health-insurance knowledge, after which improvement is impossible and experimentation is counterproductive. if you're willing to bet the future health of every american on this theory, that's your decision, but please don't expect the rest of us to think it wise.",[deleted],2007-01-23 11:31:05,reddit.com,1,straight: het

c1028k,t1_c101wl,"do you know what the markup is on produce in grocery stores? i worked in wholesale produce one summer, and i learned a little about the business. the markup is something like 900%.

the interesting thing is that even though people know this, they tend not to buy produce straight from growers, and growers tend not to sell even though there's obviously a market they could exploit. the reason is simple: if you want to buy onions for a tenth of the normal cost of albertson's onions, you could drive down to the onion shed, and buy them. *but* you'd have to buy a 50-pound bag, because the shed doesn't deal in smaller amounts. and you'd probably have to know the guy who runs the shed, because it's really not worth his time to talk to you as a customer.

the reason is that at the same time you're walking out the front door with your $7 bag of 50 pounds of onions, there's a truck pulling out the back dock with twenty *tons* of onions for distribution to grocery stores. meanwhile, other produce sheds across the country have similar amounts shipped, to be sold at similar markups.

this system actually works. you could go farm to farm and eat lots of fresh food for about a dollar a day, but if you did that, you'd waste lots of time (and gas money) just going places, negotiating deals, comparison shopping, etc. as it turns out, it's more efficient to just have the albertson's buyer do that, ship everything to his store, and sell it to consumers for ten times what he paid for it. in fact, that's *such* a good business that albertson's isn't the only store that does it. if you're just thinking in terms of product price, and you're ignoring expertise and negotation, you're surrounded by ripoffs and you accept them every day. on the other hand, when you try to live *without* ripoffs, you realize that the current system is a surprisingly good deal, and that if you're going to talk about rebuilding it from the ground up, you'd better figure out what the foundations are first.",[deleted],2007-01-23 11:40:11,reddit.com,0,straight: straight

in response to nostrademons, pypy is the answer because it isn't focused around making things faster (it hopes to be at least as fast as cpython and possibly faster in the future through jit), but is focused around making the implementation simpler (much as an ocaml implementation would, except without the problems listed above), and also a lot more flexible. it sure would be nice if you could put together your own python vm suited to your particular problem like it has suggested pypy will be able to do.

this is the way to move forward. we've gotta get python (and other dynamic languages - see rubinius for such an idea in ruby) off the backs of other languages and walking on their own. as i said, such an approach allows implementations of languages to become much more flexible, powerful, and ultimately could even lead to a speed increase.

and, in response to the 'lets not do the one language approach again', that's not what this is. yes, it is python-based, but it isn't python-restricted. you'll still be able to pull in c modules and code all the same (see pje's mention of the ffi), its just that the *implementation itself* will be done in a higher level language.

c104a1,t1_c103cw,"how to minimize investment returns  - berkshire hathaway 2005 ar
pp. 19 - 20
 
 it’s been an easy matter for berkshire and other owners of american equities to prosper over the 
years.  between december 31, 1899 and december 31, 1999, to give a really long-term example, the dow 
rose from 66 to 11,497.  (guess what annual growth rate is required to produce this result; the surprising 
answer is at the end of this section.)  this huge rise came about for a simple reason: over the century 
american businesses did extraordinarily well and investors rode the wave of their prosperity.  businesses 
continue to do well.  but now shareholders, through a series of self-inflicted wounds, are in a major way 
cutting the returns they will realize from their investments. 
 
 the explanation of how this is happening begins with a fundamental truth: with unimportant 
exceptions, such as bankruptcies in which some of a company’s losses are borne by creditors, the most that 
owners in aggregate can earn between now and judgment day is what their businesses in aggregate earn. 
true, by buying and selling that is clever or lucky, investor a may take more than his share of the pie at the 
expense of investor b.  and, yes, all investors feel richer when stocks soar.  but an owner can exit only by 
having someone take his place.  if one investor sells high, another must buy high.  for owners as a whole, 
there is simply no magic – no shower of money from outer space – that will enable them to extract wealth 
from their companies beyond that created by the companies themselves. 
 
 indeed, owners must earn less than their businesses earn because of “frictional” costs.  and that’s 
my point: these costs are now being incurred in amounts that will cause shareholders to earn far less than 
they historically have. 
 
 to understand how this toll has ballooned, imagine for a moment that all american corporations 
are, and always will be, owned by a single family.  we’ll call them the gotrocks.  after paying taxes on 
dividends, this family – generation after generation – becomes richer by the aggregate amount earned by its 
companies.  today that amount is about $700 billion annually.  naturally, the family spends some of these 
dollars.  but the portion it saves steadily compounds for its benefit.  in the gotrocks household everyone 
grows wealthier at the same pace, and all is harmonious. 
 
 but let’s now assume that a few fast-talking helpers approach the family and persuade each of its 
members to try to outsmart his relatives by buying certain of their holdings and selling them certain others. 
the helpers – for a fee, of course – obligingly agree to handle these transactions.  the gotrocks still own 
all of corporate america; the trades just rearrange who owns what.  so the family’s annual gain in wealth 
diminishes, equaling the earnings of american business minus commissions paid.  the more that family 
members trade, the smaller their share of the pie and the larger the slice received by the helpers.  this fact 
is not lost upon these broker-helpers: activity is their friend and, in a wide variety of ways, they urge it on. 
 
 after a while, most of the family members realize that they are not doing so well at this new “beat- 
my-brother” game.  enter another set of helpers.  these newcomers explain to each member of the 
gotrocks clan that by himself he’ll never outsmart the rest of the family.  the suggested cure: “hire a 
manager – yes, us – and get the job done professionally.”  these manager-helpers continue to use the 
broker-helpers to execute trades; the managers may even increase their activity so as to permit the brokers 
to prosper still more.  overall, a bigger slice of the pie now goes to the two classes of helpers. 
 
 the family’s disappointment grows.  each of its members is now employing professionals.  yet 
overall, the group’s finances have taken a turn for the worse.  the solution?  more help, of course. 
 
 it arrives in the form of financial planners and institutional consultants, who weigh in to advise the 
gotrocks on selecting manager-helpers.  the befuddled family welcomes this assistance.  by now its 
members know they can pick neither the right stocks nor the right stock-pickers.  why, one might ask, 
should they expect success in picking the right consultant?  but this question does not occur to the 
gotrocks, and the consultant-helpers certainly don’t suggest it to them. 
 
 
 18
 the gotrocks, now supporting three classes of expensive helpers, find that their results get worse, 
and they sink into despair.  but just as hope seems lost, a fourth group – we’ll call them the hyper-helpers 
– appears.  these friendly folk explain to the gotrocks that their unsatisfactory results are occurring 
because the existing helpers – brokers, managers, consultants – are not sufficiently motivated and are 
simply going through the motions.  “what,” the new helpers ask, “can you expect from such a bunch of 
zombies?” 
 
 the new arrivals offer a breathtakingly simple solution: pay more money.  brimming with self- 
confidence, the hyper-helpers assert that huge contingent payments – in addition to stiff fixed fees – are 
what each family member must fork over in order to really outmaneuver his relatives. 
 
 the more observant members of the family see that some of the hyper-helpers are really just 
manager-helpers wearing new uniforms, bearing sewn-on sexy names like hedge fund or private 
equity.  the new helpers, however, assure the gotrocks that this change of clothing is all-important, 
bestowing on its wearers magical powers similar to those acquired by mild-mannered clark kent when he 
changed into his superman costume.  calmed by this explanation, the family decides to pay up. 
 
 and that’s where we are today: a record portion of the earnings that would go in their entirety to 
owners – if they all just stayed in their rocking chairs – is now going to a swelling army of helpers.  
particularly expensive is the recent pandemic of profit arrangements under which helpers receive large 
portions of the winnings when they are smart or lucky, and leave family members with all of the losses – 
and large fixed fees to boot – when the helpers are dumb or unlucky (or occasionally crooked). 
 
 a sufficient number of arrangements like this – heads, the helper takes much of the winnings; 
tails, the gotrocks lose and pay dearly for the privilege of doing so – may make it more accurate to call the 
family the hadrocks.  today, in fact, the family’s frictional costs of all sorts may well amount to 20% of 
the earnings of american business.  in other words, the burden of paying helpers may cause american 
equity investors, overall, to earn only 80% or so of what they would earn if they just sat still and listened to 
no one. 
 
 long ago, sir isaac newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius.  but sir 
isaac’s talents didn’t extend to investing: he lost a bundle in the south sea bubble, explaining later, “i can 
calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.”  if he had not been traumatized by this 
loss, sir isaac might well have gone on to discover the fourth law of motion: for investors as a whole, 
returns decrease as motion increases.",instantdm,2007-01-23 15:19:54,reddit.com,11,"gay: trade, gay: trade, gay: trade"

there are documented facts about the lies that o'reilly has stated and stood behind even when called on them.  his statement about american soldiers massacring germans during wwii when it was exactly the opposite, is just one example, but there are many more.

i am a republican.  i am a real republican, an old school, small government, fiscal conservative, states' rights, social keeper-outer republican.  

if you want give me your email and i'll email you a picture of my registration card.  it's right here in my wallet.

no, i don't watch o'reilly anymore, just like i don't listen to the misguided and often deluded sermons of the pastors i grew up listening to.

hell, i don't watch much tv on tv anymore, mostly i just find shows i want to watch and download them (as legally as possible) and watch them that way.

to come up with all sorts of crazy ideas about me and how i've learned and shaped my ideas is first, ludicrous, and second, juvenile when you realize that the person on the other end of your post might actually be a living breathing adult who is actually active in their political and social communities.

it's amusing that you've only watch olbermann three times, i've watch o'reilly and olbermann many times more and it is rather obvious the man, o'reilly, attacks from positions of power, and it is his tactics in arguing that win him points, and not the content of his speech.  he uses every dirty trick in the book and has invented some of his own.  even if he was arguing for the same beliefs as i hold dear i'd still have issue with o'reilly.  at least olbermann speaks plainly, straight-forward and doesn't have to bend reality to fit his will.

it's sad really, i feel abandoned by my party.  hell, i've felt that way since at least 2000.  bush and his cronies with all their sycophantic pundits are anything but neo (new) or conservative (careful and slow to change what works), or compassionate (when have they ever cared about the poor like it says to do in the bible? the book they pay, at least, lip service to).

i've had a lot of issues with the democrats for ages, but these days it seems that there are a lot more of them with their heads screwed on right than any of the page farking, money laundering asshats that have an r next to their name in congress.

hell, if you go over to fark (a place i've frequented for years) you can go back into the fark archives and see where i used to cheerlead for the maverick mccain.  that stopped the day bush gave him the judas kiss and mccain became the gimp for the neocons.",st_gulik,2007-01-23 15:34:54,reddit.com,1,straight: straight

that's it people.  bush and cheney are simply business people and they're doing what business people generally do - expand, take over other areas (expanding market share), tax cuts and corporate welfare, advertising (propaganda), snake oil selling, etc.  the same old crap we had in the 1980's and under nixon and the same people.

in conclusion - take a look at what the republicans have promised over the last 100 years.  they've failed in every regard.  at least the democrats do actually come through occasionally.  maybe we'll even get health care - we got civil rights.  i'm still waiting for the economic trickle the corporate right wing promised back in the 1980's and i'm still waiting for victory in iraq (just like vietnam).  bunch of corporate bs and war profiteering.  same old crap and the same old gullible electorate dumb asses.",[deleted],2007-01-23 15:36:21,reddit.com,-1,straight: het

i don't think either of those is necessarily true.  

whether someone is a theist or not is completely independent of evidence or how much one has thought about the world.  people make the mistake of thinking that because they've thought quite a lot about it, and became an atheist, that this is a consequence of the reasoning involved.  but theism or atheism is an *assumption*.  because of the nature of the proposition, there is no way to prove or disprove the existence of gods or a god.  you can disprove specific hypotheses about deities in some cases, but not the generic ""there is (or is not) a god"".

about (us-style) liberalism: to the extent that much of the education faculty leans left, more education in the us makes one likely to lean left, just to get along.  but it's not inherent in the education itself.  there are areas of study that encourage conclusions which seem more ""left"", such as art criticism and religious studies (!), and areas of study which encourage conclusions that seem more ""right"", like economics and history, but the vast majority of education is in fields that have no political bias at all, save for what an instructor chooses to introduce.

c105zg,t1_c105ef,"&gt; i find that hard to believe. do you have any proof on that?

spend a little time studying republican social values and policies. 

the fetus-is-a-person schtick is a con.  if anti-choice activists were actually concerned about ""the unborn"", they'd be fervent advocates of birth-control and sex-education.  instead they oppose access to birth-control and *effective* sex ed on the grounds that it ""promotes promiscuity"".  anti-choice is about undoing the sexual revolution and feminism.  the same strategy is employed (to greater effect) by the taliban.

vote suppression of minorities is a standard republican electoral tactic.  overbroad and inaccurate ""felon"" purges, voter id laws, voter intimidation and misinformation, robotic phone harassment, rigging of elections so that white, conservative districts have plenty of poll-workers, and machines or ballots while black, liberal districts have multi-hour lines and run out of ballots.  these are all well documented republican tactics.

&gt; regarding most of the stuff of the democrats, great. removing tax subsidies is great, although i think that the dems calling them subsidies is a form of deceit when they are actually tax subsidies. it makes people think we're giving them cash.

there's no difference.  if you use the common wealth (and oil companies certainly do) and you are let off the hook for your fair share of taxes or resource use leases, it's the same thing.  it's freeloading.  it's a rip-off.

&gt; but not all the dems projects are so exciting. recently there was a bill proposed to require bloggers to report to congress once a quarter. this would be basically a way to make people afraid to blog or post. you'd think the dems would have voted against it, right?

&gt; they voted for it. the republicans voted it down.

that's a great example of the work we have left to do in the democratic party.  there are powerful establishment democrats who find the netroot movement deeply threatening.  these are the democrats who are responsible for the corporate cronyism and ""big government excesses"" we both find so revolting.  i'm happy to partner with freedom loving republicans who will help me defend this powerful new medium for free speech.  i'll work with anyone.

&gt; i don't particularly trust any one party. they each have their own agenda, and it's not necessarily in our interests.

agreed.  but taking over the democratic party and re-forming it into a progressive force is far easier and more productive than independent action or third-party escapism (and i speak as a former libertarian and green).  the democratic party has just been sitting on its laurels, coasting and getting fat and corrupt for *decades*.  to the point where it almost got locked out of power *permanently*.
it's ripe for takeover by an energized organized grassroots movement with unprecedented messaging, fund-raising, and *thinking* power.

&gt; a lot of the stuff the dems are doing is to damage the republicans and uncover their corruption, which is great. that's what should happen.

what's encouraging is that the democratic netroots are *even more pissed off* at the few corrupt democrats out there.  netroots raised a *pile* of money for karen carter in her run-off election against william ""fbi agents found $90,000 of the cash in my freezer, in $10,000 increments wrapped in aluminum foil and stuffed inside frozen-food containers."" jefferson.  we weren't particularly excited about carter, but we were bent on kicking jefferson into the swamp.  

(didn't work.  i guess federal accusations of corruption against a black congressman doesn't count for much in new orleans these days.  i wonder why not?  (through he *was* dissed by pelosi out of a plum committee chair.))

anyway.  my point is, i'm confident that netroots will be a strong self-policing element in an ascendant democratic party.  and a clean, empowered democratic party will be strongly motivated to expose and destroy republican (and corporate) corruption because they won't be afraid of their *own* dirt coming to the surface.

most countries will not have this opportunity.
europe got rich off the exploitation of africa and south america. the us, which always protected its industries, largely got rich off wwi, and maintains its wealth through violence or the threat of violence.
i don't see wealth creation as theft, except when it clearly is theft. like when european powers looted tremendous wealth from africa - they weren't creating wealth for africans at all. i'm for what you might call broad based economic empowerment, in other words, as much wealth as possible for everyone, rather than just the corrupt.
and the solution is not either dealing with or overthrowing corrupt elites. the solution is to deal with those who are working to democratise and spread the production of wealth. this may, or may not, include fair trade producers, trade unions, progressive ngos, civil society groups, media organisations etc. - depending on the circumstance. in other words, strengthen the democratic forces so that they can undermine their own corrupt leaders.",Leischa,2007-01-24 10:37:12,reddit.com,1,"gay: trade, gay: trade"

""organic food, which is grown without man-made pesticides and fertilisers, is generally assumed to be more environmentally friendly than conventional intensive farming, which is heavily reliant on chemical inputs. but it all depends what you mean by “environmentally friendly”. farming is inherently bad for the environment: since humans took it up around 11,000 years ago, the result has been deforestation on a massive scale. but following the “green revolution” of the 1960s greater use of chemical fertiliser has tripled grain yields with very little increase in the area of land under cultivation. organic methods, which rely on crop rotation, manure and compost in place of fertiliser, are far less intensive. so producing the world's current agricultural output organically would require several times as much land as is currently cultivated. there wouldn't be much room left for the rainforest.""

not that we should lose hope:

""the best thing about the spread of the ethical-food movement is that it offers grounds for hope. it sends a signal that there is an enormous appetite for change and widespread frustration that governments are not doing enough to preserve the environment, reform world trade or encourage development. which suggests that, if politicians put these options on the political menu, people might support them.""

however, when i saw the name ""rick jelliffe"" i relaxed. if you, like me, actually knew rick jelliffe you wouldn't be so worried any more. paying rick to write about these two standards for wikipedia sounds like a great idea to me, since that ensures wikipedia gets some well-informed coverage of the two. rick is a highly respected xml technologist and standards creator, and very, very far from being anything resembling a microsoft partisan. the article says rick was surprised to be asked by microsoft to do this, and i can certainly see why he would be surprised, but on the face of it this sounds fine.

the reason people think that money being spent is good is that the most common (easiest) way to measure economic growth is by -- surprise! -- how much people are spending money.  unfortunately, this can vastly underreport a lot of things like increased production capacity, efficiency increases, etc.  this measure is biased toward consumer spending and against investment in production.  

for that reason, many people think that inflation is good because it increases the incentive to spend money.  the problem is that inflation creates mal-investment as businesses are fooled into increasing production to satisfy consumer demand, a lot of which is just people getting into debt, and therefore very temporary.",asokoloski,2007-01-24 13:52:03,reddit.com,5,straight: het

not true.  in some places they are used to it.  but the killing of animals for food is recognized as problematic by cultures across the globe.  you might have read books as a child about certain native american tribes who, after killing an animal, performed a ritual of atonement asking the animal's spirit for forgiveness.  or the position of a billion plus hindus and buddhists who think killing animals is wrong.  or the greek utopia, in which normal people were shielded from animal slaughter, it being done outside the city.  or the ""purification"" rituals of any number of religions, that involve not eating meat.

c10hjn,t1_c10hag,"&gt;the 'banks' in sl, definitely are businesses of questionable nature, and as is not hard to see (unless they're investment geniuses) can not support their ridiculous interest outpayings by any way other than getting new, gullible customers.

i think it's possible to create a viable sl bank, but the investments are a little weird -- usually, a bank finances the purchase of assets, which you either use as collateral (a house, for example) or which generate cash flow (equipment for a business). but the only assets that would qualify in second life are time. you might, for example, start an sl escort agency by borrowing a bunch of linden dollars to hire a bunch of sl escorts for (say) four hours, and then lease them out to clients for smaller lengths of time. buy wholesale, sell retail. but the amounts aren't large enough for this to be a sensible transaction.

&gt;if everyone tried to cash out of one of the banks the virtual-shit would hit the fan.

true of most banks, actually. true, in fact, of any business that gets by through borrowing short, lending long, and making money from the carry trade. that's why banks usually hedge some of their investments, borrow from the fed in emergencies, and support deposit insurance.

&gt;they are however completely different from the exchange rate services, and can't be considered in the same paragraph at all.

both require someone to have lots of cash on hand, and a finger on the money-supply pulse of second life. the big dynastic banks in the renassaince started out trading (or minting) coins.

c10i8f,t1_c1024f,"&gt; well, ok, but threads that don't share state are usually called something else, like ""processes"", ""jobs"", or ""tasks"".

really?  haskell's threads are just called ""threads"".  erlang's processes are not uncommonly called ""threads"" too.  and what about conventional threads that simply avoid shared state?

&gt; i can't think of an obvious way that non-preemptive threads help in a multicore configuration.

uh, depends what you mean.  ""non-preemptive threads"" can mean either cooperative (single-core) threads or concurrent (multi-core) threads, which are quite different things.

&gt; the usual benefit of non-preemption is that threads don't yield control at arbitrary points, so that shared state can be kept consistent without locking.

here, you're talking about cooperative threading (which, like preemptive threading, is a single-core concept).

&gt; but if you're executing two threads on multiple cores, you lose those guarantees.

here, you're talking about concurrent threading.  and the guarantees you're losing are the same with regards to both cooperative and preemptive threading.

&gt; what sort of threads did you have in mind?

threads that avoid either one of the ""shared-state, preemptive"" adjectives:

1. avoiding the first (a la erlang, concurrent distributed/parallel haskell, ...) in favor of futures or message-passing is ideal, but not yet practical in most languages/environments.
2. avoiding the second in favor of cooperative scheduling tends to be a practical trade-off:  you get to access your shared state without running the deadlock/race condition gauntlet, and can still use higher-level message passing to communicate between machines/cores.

not avoiding either, on the other hand, gives you pretty much the worst of both worlds:  you tend to pay more than the former's cost in error-prone locking, while only getting the latter's scalability.",pjdelport,2007-01-24 19:56:07,programming,0,gay: trade

here's an example for you. say a hog farmer in the southeast begins to buy out his competition, consolidate his operations and create huge farms. the farms are efficient but the effect on the environment is truly catastrophic. the air downwind is spoiled and the groundwater is ruined. people's health is affected and health insurance costs increase significantly in the area.

what should have been done to contain the problem before it got out of control? 

&gt; thinking that the government has a magic wand that gives them the power to solve problems for you is naive

i know you're not talking about me since i never said or implied anything of the sort. what i said was that a government needs to act to create situations where the free market can work. if that means blocking an aquisition to allow a broader playing field, then they should do it. if it means restricting a national chain from competing in a locally limited economy, then they should do that. i'm not saying any government has magic fairy dust that they sprinkle on the good citizens. but turning a blind eye to corporate greed is just stupid and counterproductive.

&gt; what is naive is to think the minimum wage helps the poor and hurts the big corporations, when it is completely the opposite, it puts the poor out of a job, and allows the big corporations to crush their small business competition.

again, i'm not sure whose post you're replying to but big corporations don't crush their small competition because of low end wages. the do it through economy of scale. if walmart negotiates directly with a chinese manufacturer, the minimum wage is not going to matter to joe's hardware who pays twice as much for the same product. there's simply no way he can compete.

health insurance and medical care in general are not like other goods, they are not substitutable, purchases are often done at the behest of an agent who may have serious conflicts of interest (think of a doctor ordering tests for reasons of cya or failing to order tests because the tests that might be needed are known to not be covered by the insurance company), customers cannot make fully informed decisions at the time of purchase and often there is no effective choice, and thus no market as such.

&gt;here are a few structural variants where the insurance company owns or is owned by a medical care provider, or is operated as a non-profit corporation; but they are marginal and are usually required to be profitable for accounting purposes anyhow.

profitable means *the cost of their service does not exceed the amount paid for it*, which will be true whether medical care is dispensed by capitalist doctors or a socialist state. the fact that *you note that there is no difference in care provided by for- or non-profit entities is not a great argument in favor of transferring all care from competing for- and non-profit entities to a monopolistic non-profit entity*.

&gt;as profit maximising entities they have a strong interest to reduce the amounts of disbursements for care as well as overhead.

but i thought:

&gt;20 to 30 % of the money given to health insurance companies is wasted in administrative costs, like paying cubicle warmers to dny treatments for bogus reasons.

so which is it? do they minimize those costs, or waste money flagrantly? or does that depend on which class i've joined?

i think i'll be a rogue.

&gt;all three of which are antithetical to quality of care, as well as the general health and welfare

they aren't 'antithetical', they're just *different*. it's neither profit-maximizing nor helpful to care for someone to light patients on fire. it's both profit-maximizing *and* good for care if (for example) a company avoids waste and superfluous bureaucracy. a profit-disinterested government is unlikely to do either, and it won't leave patients any recourse. however hard it is to switch insurance companies now, imagine how hard it might be to switch when there's only one and you're paying for it whether you want to or not.

&gt;as such, the entire industry is structurally corrupt.

""structurally corrupt"" seems to be your term for ""not having the same interests as customers,"" and it seems to apply to every relationship between every entity. the government is no less 'structurally corrupt' for trying to preserve itself -- that's what governments do. a corporation can only preserve itself as long as it can find customers willing to pay it enough to break even -- a government lasts as long as it has better guns than the nearest bully.

c10kkj,t1_c10gyf,"you're wrong again.  here's why.  as long as private property remains what it is, as the bottom moves ""up"" the property cost will rise with the bottom at the same rate.  in effect the bottom rank earners will be able to afford the same housing as they can now -- sleeping in their car or rooming with 10 people, or homeless, or living in their daddy's basement.

don't you understand that wealth is relative?  as what it means to be at the bottom is redefined, the bottom will still have the same purchasing power with regard to land property, because no matter how hard you train your skills, the landmass doesn't increase!

in fact what your solution will create is that in order to live even the most pitiful life in a car or rooming with 10 people you have to train and get a college degree, because that now will be the requirement for absolute bottom.  if you don't have those, then you can just shoot yourself straight in the head.

c10l0l,t3_10l0g,"evil fears laughter

are demons and devils real? in my view, it doesn't matter whether or not 
they exist in an objective or literal sense. the point is that we are all 
plagued by split-off, unintegrated portions of our own and other people's 
psyches. they behave exactly as if they were diabolical entities--demons, 
djinns, dybbuks, and devils--working at cross-purposes to our conscious 
desires.

in dealing with their hassling interventions, i endorse the approach 
described by paul foster case in his book *the tarot: a key to the 
wisdom of the ages.* there he suggested that mirth is the best way to 
beat the devil. ""laughter is prophylactic,"" he wrote. ""it purifies 
subconsciousness and dissolves mental complexes. in a hymn to the sun 
god ra we read, 'thy priests go forth at dawn, washing their hearts with 
laughter.' this is a prescription we may all follow to advantage.""

my friend and teacher, vimala nostradamus, echoes case. ""the best way 
to neutralize the devil is to laugh at him,"" she says. ""satan's most 
effective recruiting technique is to get people to take themselves too 
seriously."" to exemplify her argument, she once told her daughter in my 
presence about a foolproof way to avoid being hassled if you're a woman 
walking by a crew of construction workers: ""pick your nose.""

the novels of tom robbins provide spiritual guidance about dealing with 
diabolical spirits, both those that originate within us and those that come 
from without. here's a sample tip from his *jitterbug perfume*: ""play--
more than piety, more than charity or vigilance--is what allows human 
beings to transcend evil.""

we regret to report that further help on this matter is not available from 
the holy books of the world's major religions. none of their authors ever 
figured out that an excellent weapon against the fragmented, shadowy 
portions of our psyches is humor, tomfoolery, and laughter. this 
ignorance may be the greatest mystery in history.

but christianity, judaism, islam, buddhism, hinduism, confucianism, 
taoism, shintoism, zoroastrianism, and jainism aren't the only spiritual 
traditions that have failed to take advantage of evil's primary weakness. 
the esoteric spiritual paths of the west, including hermeticism, 
rosicrucianism, and alchemy, also suffer from an inexplicable lack of jokes 
and fun at the heart of their practice. shamanism, paganism, yoga, and 
tantra are, for the most part, similarly bereft.

there are rare exceptions. the sufis have cracked a few funny stories 
down through the ages. the fourth way teacher, george gurdjieff, had a 
sense of humor that he used pedagogically. and 20th-century america 
spawned two authentically comic religions, discordianism and the church 
of the subgenius. unfortunately, their combined flocks are smaller than 
the crowds drawn by any popular evangelical preacher in one night of 
mean-spirited pontificating.

*

here's a letter we received at the beauty and truth laboratory, along 
with our response.

""dear beauty and truth laboratory: after long meditation on what's 
missing from my relationship with god, i found the answer: a sense of 
humor. i realized i can never truly love or honestly communicate with a

one of the beauty and truth laboratory's unpublished holy books god's 
laughing with you, not at you.

*

chapter 26, verses 182-188: the plot to debunk pronoia

a meeting of hell's board of directors was taking place. the devil was 
upset because recruitment had dropped to a new low since the pronoia 
meme had begun to spread. ""it's intolerable,"" he raged. ""these f***ing 
pronoiacs are so mentally healthy it makes me want to puke. 
suggestions?""

hell's executive vice-president blurted out, ""i'll go down to earth and 
convince thousands of pronoiacs that their friends are jealous of their 
happiness.""

the marketing chief chimed in: ""i'll go down to earth and make them feel 
guilty for feeling so good.""

then the head of intelligence spoke: ""i'll go down to earth and inspire a 
bestselling new age author to write a sappy mass market book about 
pronoia.""

*

chapter 57, verses 112-116: how to ask for what you want

george prayed every day for three years to win the lottery, but never 
heard from god or hit the jackpot.

finally, god woke him up in the middle of the night. ""george, is that you 
who's been praying so hard to win the lottery?"" the supreme being 
boomed.

""yes, lord, desperately!""

god paused for a moment, then said thoughtfully, ""george, i'll tell you 
what. i want you to meet me halfway. buy a ticket, ok?""

*

chapter 88, verses 15-21: do-it-yourself exorcism

if you're average, you're demonically possessed not just by split-off, 
unintegrated portions of your own and other people's psyches, but also 
by 20 million ads and 200,000 televised acts of violence stored in your 
brain.

the good news is that as you practice the art of pronoia, you'll attract 
steady streams of amusing experiences that are effective at neutralizing 
those toxins. every time you laugh, you'll most likely purge a nihilistic 
image or inane story that had been depleting your energy. a belly laugh 
may flush out the imprints of as many as 500 commercials.

*

chapter 93, verses 81-84: pronoiac homework

upon request, the beauty and truth laboratory gives homework to 
students of pronoia. an assignment we're fond of is to ask them to finish 
the sentence, ""the one thing that keeps me from being myself is 
__________.""

many respondents fill in the blank with ""my fears."" other common 
answers are ""lack of money,"" ""my spouse,"" and ""my obsession with 
status.""

of course there are no right answers. but the above replies don't capture 
the spirit of pronoia as well as an exemplary offering from ann-marie at 
getunderground.com. ""the one thing that keeps me from being myself,"" 
she wrote, ""is other people's reluctance to lick patent leather."" 

*

chapter 153, verses 11-16: how to know god

below you'll find three messages. one is an authentic communiqué from 
the divine wow, which i channeled while in ecstatic trance. the other two 
are fakes that i made up. if you're as thoroughly in tune with your inner 
purpose as you need to be, you won't have any trouble knowing which is 
the true word of the creator.

message #1: ""i, the supreme designer of heaven and earth, am totally 
pissed off at your lazy sins and lack of faith. cut the crap and shape up.""

message #2: ""i, untouchable and unknowable ceo of the universe, 
couldn't care less what you do. don't bother me.""

message #3: ""i, the universal jokester who runs all of creation on the fuel 
of my sublime pleasure, am well-entertained by the stories you've been 
living. thanks! i can't wait to see what you do next.""

*train your mind, change your brain: how a new science reveals our 
extraordinary potential to transform ourselves*
by sharon begley

""for decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the 
hardware of the brain is fixed and immutable--that we are stuck with what 
we were born with. as begley shows, however, recent pioneering 
experiments in neuroplasticity, a new science that investigates whether 
and how the brain can undergo wholesale change, reveal that the brain is 
capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new 
neurons, even into old age. the brain can reset our happiness meter, allow 
us to break cycles of depression and ocd, learn compassion, and heal us 
after trauma.""

c10mi1,t3_10lz8,"is it me or is he a little *too* emphatic about the improvements of c# 3.0?

i mean being excited about c# 3.0 is fine, and c# 3.0 is a very interesting and nice improvement of the language and platform but...

&gt; c# 3.0 introduces radical features, *many of which have never been seen in any other language before* – this is where we, as .net developers, are really getting excited. the future platform is not only one of evolution but also revolution!

(emphasis mine)

many of which have never been seen in any other language before?

let's review

* _object initialization_    
  trivially implementable via keyword arguments, using metaclasses and/or decorators in languages supporting kwdargs (or pseudo kwdargs, see ruby) even makes this completely transparent. seen before.

* _type inference_    
  this is merely filling something that was lacking, on the jvm nice and scala support local type inference and a limited type inference of functions, other languages (ml dialects, haskell) have very strong type inference abilities (including type inference of recursive functions). seen before.

* _anonymous types_    
tuples, literal hashmap notation, records, ... seen before.

* _lambda expressions_    
seems like they can infer parameter types, can they also infer output types? seen before anyway.

* _extension methods_    
extend an existing type with new methods... seen before too, sorry. i even recall java and c# dudes moaning about ruby's (among others) ability to extend built-in and third-party types and calling that ability a sin and an insult to the god of encapsulation and all...

* _linq_    
dsls included in c#. well the syntax is not c# at all (i'm not sure whether or not this is a good thing. on the other hand, you can't really write nice dsls in c#), but i can't say that's never been seen before (pretty much all of lisp works that way, dsls in smalltalk or ruby, ...). yeah, seen before.

* _expression trees_    
this is probably the most original improvement of c# 3.0. i'm pretty sure you can easily extract the expression tree of a smalltalk method, it's probably more of a bother to do that with python or ruby (i've never done it before, but i guess you'd have to use the interface to the interpreter's bowels, ugly). this is of course trivial in lisp. sorry, not ""never seen before"" either.

overall, the article is a nice rapid overview of the new c# features, but calling c# 3.0 a revolution and hinting that it's adventuring on grounds never explored before shows the author's lack of culture outside of the c/c++ family.

in an ideal world i might be tempted to agree with you that an armed citizenry is the best guarantee of a free citizenry. but life is a series of human failings and trade-offs over time. in other words, if you want to get to the swiss model you don't want to be starting from here. switzerland is unusual in europe, like the us it has not been directly involved in violent conflict on its own territory in living memory, it’s armed citizenry may be part of that, but geography and economics played a bigger part. the experience of countries that have seen fighting close up is that small arms cause too much havoc and misery to be in the hands of anybody that wants some. the european experience is also that governments can be overturned without an armed populace (romania, czechoslovakia, etc) armed attempts at restructuring have turned into genocide (yugoslavia). there has been too much death on our continent. we would rather out source violence to our armed services and rely on politics to govern ourselves. we don’t even particularly like our police to flash their guns about too much. 

the african experience, starting from a very different position to europe has been that extensive gun possession has been a source of endless strife rather than freedom and stability. one man’s freedom becomes his ability to pistol rape other people. hence the [4000 people cheering]( http://news.aol.com/topnews/articles/_a/tanzanian-police-set-fire-to-2000/n20070123085509990001) in tanzania as the guns were burnt. 

i don’t think that the us understands that it is [different](http://reddit.com/info/z0f0/comments/cz6ap). it’s public position is that what works over there is best for the rest of the world. sometimes you are right (we are grateful for normandy &amp; the marshall plan). but our national identities are not based on the myth of the west where a lone gunman saves the day.

just thought of something else, it's one of the trade offs i referred to above. years back i read a dorothy rowe book which talked about the arms race in terms of the protagonists' emotional projection of their own capacity for violence onto their opponents. eg, ""i have nukes and i know that i am capable of violence, therefore my enemy, who is by definition worse than me must have an even greater capacity for violence, so i had better get more nukes"". the other party is obviously thinking exactly the same in reverse and each party reflects the other’s fear, feeding the cycle. something similar applies here perhaps. europe has largely rejected personal weapons, so when we project our own awareness of our aggressive potential onto our fellow citizens the thought of getting shot doesn't come near the top of the list, so there is no real drive to acquire a gun. in the us, where gun ownership is high the fear of being disempowered by another gun-holder is also high. the european strategy may not be stable. as levels of gun violence creep up over here so might the demand for personal weapons, which would fuel anxiety, creating a spiral towards us levels of gun possession and gun fatalities.

c10ouv,t1_c10oiw,"normally, i'd agree (and i don't understand why you've been downvoted...)  however, most of my haskell programming consist of bootstrap interpreters for other languages, which adds a bunch of other factors:

1. it's throwaway code anyway.  for a bootstrap interpreter, it's often better to try out a bunch of different approaches so you don't settle on one that's unworkable in the production code.  (for example, the recommended haskell indentation style doesn't put a line break after a layout-sensitive keyword.  this means that subsequent lines need to shift over if the preceding expression grows, which means you're forever reindenting functions in emacs.)  it's the same reason people prototype.
2. in a bootstrap interpreter, it's often better to follow the conventions of the *guest* language rather than the *host* language.  your standard library will use the guest language conventions anyways, so it's easier if contributors need only learn one convention instead of two, at least to the extent that the syntax allows it.
3. writing a language implicitly implies a certain belief that ""no really i'm right everyone else is wrong"".  that comes with the responsibility of actually *convincing* everyone else that they're wrong, which usually means you need to find a new market that's *not* satisfied with their current language.  so you essentially have a fresh slate available.

that said, the guest language's coding conventions are basically straight out of [pep 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), since the new language is a syntactic derivative of python.

i should also note that i wouldn't recommend this for production code in production languages.  i use java coding conventions for my java code, a reasonably common c coding convention for c code, and pep 8 for my python code.  things are slightly different for a language without a significant user base, however.",nostrademons,2007-01-25 11:02:56,programming,2,straight: straight

furthermore, you characterised my claims that *reliance* on javascript is bad as claims that *use* of javascript is bad.  if you knew that you can use javascript without relying on it, why did you mix the two up?

christ, can you be any more of a phb?  *""...if your functionality model leverages javascript""*?  you're going to have to translate that into english, because my best guess as to what you mean &amp;mdash; that if you rely on javascript it's hard to cater to non-javascript situations &amp;mdash; is simply a meaningless tautology.

&gt; you must be new to development if you believe otherwise.

i've got a decade of experience developing for the web.

my feeling is that if something doesn't get about 5 quick votes up, it dies. so the low hanging fruit posts get upvoted. so we have more of them.

i've been doing an experiment lately - posting things with very literal titles. every one gets nuked almost instantly. my suspicion is that the title of the post is way more important than the content. others have said the same, so this is no great insight, but it does indicate that there isn't a correlation between voting and _better stories_, just with _more redditish titles_. (notice i didn't say better...).

c10yjf,t3_10pty,"&gt; if you want to help the jamaican ... encourage the development of international and local free markets. it's a simple solution...

oh god, this is so unbelievably wrong. yes, it's a simple solution, thought up by simple people.

the best book i've found on the subject is amy chua's *world on fire: how exporting free market democracy breeds ethnic hatred and global instability*. she's studied the effects of free markets and democracy on many poor societies for years and probably knows a bit more about it than one guy who went with the peace corps to jamaica and now writes [stories](http://www.mises.org/articles.aspx?author=fedako) for the mises institute like ""[recycling: what a waste!](http://www.mises.org/story/1911)""

i don't have room in a reddit comment to summarize chua's book, but here's how she summarizes it herself, in opposition to another man's simple solution:

&gt; thus after the september 11 attacks, friedman published an op-ed piece pointing to india and bangladesh as good ""role models"" for the middle east and arguing that the solution to terrorism and militant islam is: ""hello? hello? there's a message here. it's democracy, stupid!"" -- ""[m]ulti-ethnic, pluralistic, free-market democracy.""

&gt; by contrast, the sobering thesis of this book is that the global spread of markets and democracy is a principal, aggravating cause of group hatred and ethnic violence throughout the non-western world. in the numerous societies around the world that have a market-dominant minority, markets and democracy are not mutually reinforcing. because markets and democracy benefit different ethnic groups in such societies, the pursuit of free market democracy produces highly unstable and combustible conditions. markets concentrate enormous wealth in the hands of an ""ousider"" minority, fomenting ethnic envy and hatred among often chronically poor majorities. in absolute terms the majority may or may not be better off -- a dispute that much of the globalization debate fixates on -- but any sense of improvement is overwhelmed by their continuing poverty and the hated minority's extraordinary economic success. more humiliating still, market-dominant minorities, along with their foreign-investor partners, invariably come to control the crown jewels of the economy, often symbolic of the nation's patrimony and identity -- oil in russia and venezuela, diamonds in south africa, silver and tin in bolivia, jade, teak and rubies in burma. (p. 9)

it's mortifying that this jim fedako sniggers about how wonderful it is that the powerless are forced to trade with the powerful, using his own experiences with [a rush album in high school](http://www.mises.org/story/2382) as his example. these are the sad simpletons who pretend they have something to teach us about how the world works. over and over again, they are wrong. they never bear the consequences of their error -- if they ever did visit a third-world country, they leave it and never go back.

the irony of all this. is that if people *did* vote based on whether an article was good or not, then they'd have to read every post, regardless of title.
a good title guarantees that someone will read the article, and then either up/down vote depending on the outcome (and if they can even be bothered. as someone who uses rss, i only bother up-voting the *really* good ones).

if i read a title of a subject of little-to-no interest, i don't usually down-vote it, as i haven't read the article.
however if i were to down-vote it without reading it, eventually causing that subject to be buried (if others followed this philosophy), then people would complain about users down-voting based on titles.

i think the amount of votes (positive or negative) an article receives should (if not already) be one of the variables that determines which articles make it to the front page, and not just those with a higher ratio of positive ones. while it might create more noise, there's less likelihood of articles that *nobody* votes for/cares about hitting the front page. 
which would possibly negate the effect of a large amount of negative votes/groupthink in the early stages of a threads life. as at present, if they hit negatives, other ""new"" posts closer to zero appear to replace them.

 it most likely does, but i don't think even you would contest the fact that it's not number one in all areas (in fact not even in most). education, health care, unemployment, even freedom of speech... there's plenty of areas where the us is lagging, and sometimes even considerably.

&gt;i thought it was because we massacred 100,000 iraqis without so much as provocation.

 it's just not the case. the problem isn't that you are wrong and someone else is right. the problem is in thinking that there is an absolute right and an absolute wrong. it's easy to say killing is wrong, it is almost universally seen as such. but, for example, saying that a free market is the only way to do things can be seen as arrogant, why? because in a certain context that might mean: privatize health care, or privatize energy companies, deregulate markets.
 some entire countries, with hundreds of millions of people may be against that idea. for example canada. for example france. does that make them wrong? not really. does it deny you the right to chose to have a private health care system? no it doesn't either. but if you were to impose that particular system in canada and enforce trade embargoes until we complied, we'd be pissed.

c113is,t1_c1137n,"&gt; it shows that we spend much more, yet get very little marginal benefit.

that depends on what you mean by ""we"". let me put it this way: tomorrow, bill gates could decide to spend $3 billion to have a nuclear-powered golden pacemaker implanted in his chest. ""our"" gdp spending on health care would instantly rise by a measurable $3 billion. our per-capita expenditures would rise by $10.  but ""we"" wouldn't have a worse or less efficient health care system.

of course, that's an absurd example, but think about a hypothetical retired janitor from gm whose health care costs, say, $30,000 a year, which i don't think is absurd at all. does he really ""need"" $30,000 worth of health care? probably not, but he's got an absolutely terrific plan thanks to the union and gm, and he takes advantage of it. the doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies are glad to take gm's money, and he loves the care he gets. if he were in canada, maybe he'd only get $10,000 worth of care a year, and probably like it almost as much. yeah, the marginal utility to him is not worth $20,000, but that's gm's stupidity, not his, and it doesn't hurt anyone except their shareholders.

the ever-popular wall street ceos are another example. when they go to the hospital, i'm sure many go first class all the way, paying tons of out of pocket costs. all that counts against the % of gdp spent on health care.

none of this implies that the ""average american"" is getting worse service for more money. for that you have to look at what the average american *actually spends* which is what the bls number tells you.

comparing per-capita cost while ignoring the possible contribution of a (relatively) few heavy consumers at one end of the curve is not helpful. it's like complaining that a passenger on a boeing 747 is overpaying because the average cost of a seat on the plane is $50 more than on an airbus 320. but if the boeing has a first class cabin and the airbus is all coach, then the boeing passenger might be paying *less* for the same flight. he might even be getting better service if the first class passengers aren't particularly price-sensitive. what do you think a premium hospital room in a wealthy florida retirement community goes for per night?",twoodfin,2007-01-26 16:30:55,reddit.com,3,straight: het

c113qf,t1_c111ww,"in much the same way, i don't believe it is possible to police the rights of any 'copyright' holder in the digital domain, whether that is the content creator or someone who legally owns the copyright. also, on a personal ethical level, i believe that artists should only sell copies of their work and always retain the rights as the creator, and that the 'rights' to be the creator of that work should not be transferred, but that's a personal opinion i don't expect anyone, especially americans who have grown up in an extremely capitalist culture, to agree with me. 

the whole idea of intellectual property is a legal construction (and a comparitively recent one, historically). if you extrapolate the behaviour of people and information on the web, i don't see this structure surviving. i could easily be wrong on this. draconian drm measures *might* succeed, but i very much doubt it. 

drm is essentially an attempt to create an artificial scarecity on a supply of limitless abundance, simply to maintain an economic system based on limited levels of supply and a demand that fluctuates accordingly. no modern economic theory has space in it for limitless free supply (once again, i could be wrong - any economists care to pick me up on this?).

one of the biggest problems i face with this argument is that the bulk of english speakers on-line are american. it's taken me years to realise just how deep the capitalist indoctrination runs. very few americans can entertain the concept of a world where money is not the sole measure of happiness or success, and they write you off as some sort of commie when you suggest a world where money isn't the prime measure of worth. as soon as i start talking about drm &amp; copyright/patent law etc i face the problem that drm can be viewed as 'protectionism for capitalism'. so, to have any meaningful discussion about the future of rights management in the online environment, i have to introduce concepts that most americans find almost impossible to entertain. (and plenty of others - i'm not attacking the us specifically here, but they *are* undoubtedly the most hardcore capitalists on the planet - even some of my left-wing vegan american friends refuse to see beyond the capitalist paradigm). unfortunately it's hard to attack such a key value system without invoking a defensive response, as this response will prevent the rest of the discussion running smoothly and productively.

the rights denied to gays may not seem like much, but they are numerous and significant. just the inability to get married presents a lengthy list of legal benefits gays do not have access to. a lot of these are slowing being addressed and included in domestic partnership laws, but not all of them, and not everywhere. then there's adopting children--some places you can't for no other reason than being gay.

iraq is a mess, that's why we need some kind of change in strategy from lets put a bunch of americans on the street in the middle of a civil war, you know, as target practice. what is that new strategy? i don't know, i'm not a military or diplomatic expert, but i thought the administration said they were. after all, they know how to secure the country better than the democrats, right?

iraq is a ticking time bomb! every day it continues, the ranks of our enemies grows, and their power solidifies. we've spent almost 4 years on this, and we've missed too many chances, and the last thing we need now is stubbornness! like you said, it looks like this will continue until we get new leadership in the executive branch. why? because bush, the most powerful man in the world, is not professional enough to do whatever he can to achieve victory? there are people dying, and we can't afford to wait and see.

as far as saddam goes, who's the rogue nation? saddam's a bastard, but there is something fundamentally wrong with the ""pre-emptive"" doctrine. this war's wrong not just because it was executed badly, but because it was undertaken to begin with. at least they had electricity under saddam. you could walk out on the street. there was order, not roving militias and hundreds of thousands of murders. they're not collateral damage, or casualties, they're fucking homicides, whether committed by sunni, shia, or american.

bush and the apparatus spend election season after election season telling us that they're the ones that are going to protect us, and the democrats are just incapable, hell, they're practically in league with al qaida. then bush says that he's the decider, and only he can dictate what we need and don't need to win the war, not the generals, not congress, certainly not the american people. what i'm saying is he's had no one to hold him back or interfere with his plans, and yet here we are still, with a failiure on the ground in iraq.

if everyone were to just point the finger at him and tell him to do what he needs to do, all at once, he wouldn't be able to sit in his little bubble, ignoring the study group, the generals, the lackluster anti-war movement, the international community, and unspun reality. the war in iraq needs to end, like years ago, and yet we have to look ahead two years to even consider change, because we as all know, bush, like a driver unwilling to stop for directions, has taken a stand, to...keep us right where we are now, which is stuck.",malapropist,2007-01-27 07:17:46,reddit.com,1,straight: het

c119tm,t1_c1181l,"| it's not entirely clear to me there are legions of people who earn less than $6 an hour right now.

there are in fact millions of people in the us currently earning less than what the democrats want to raise the minimum wage to.  that's well documented.  some conservatives love to point out that most people earning the federal minimum wage are teens or part timers, which is true.  however, a) many of those part timers want more hours, and are not part-time by choice, and b) the majority of people earning below the *new* minimum wage (that is, people whose wage would rise under this legislation) are in fact adults supporting themselves and/or families.

| in classical economics, a minimum wage presumably reduces the number of available jobs by artificially shifting wages higher;

the logical extension of that is to say that if we could pay people $1/hour we'd have a lot more jobs.  and people who are desperate for any money would have a little bit, but they still wouldn't be able to afford basic food an shelter.  this gets to the heart of *why* we even have an economy.

the main purpose of an economy is to allow people to support their basic needs through a market system, rather than having the government feed and house them all.  for an economy to serve that purpose, only jobs which pay enough for basic needs, are worth having.  if you change the system such that more people are ""employed"" but fewer people can support themselves (and thus need government support, or simply die), that's a net loss.  if you change the system suc that fewer people are ""employed"" but more can support themselves, it's a net win.

however, that's a fantasy trade-off.

in reality, as classical economics also knows, people at the bottom of the income scale who can't meet all their basic needs spend everything and save almost nothing.  every little bit of extra money you give them will immediately be spent on things they need but haven't been able to afford.  it's the most efficient way to plow money right back into the consumer spending economy that is the backbone of our country.  unlike all other ""incentives"", this one is the purest *market* incentive, because you're giving little bits of money to large numbers of people to spend immediately, and those who want some of that money must offer goods and services people need and compete for it.

by raising the wage ""floor"", we not only ensure that more of the jobs our economy provides are the kinds of jobs that serve the purpose we want to have jobs for, we also stimulate the economy for everyone.

c11a27,t1_c011687,"&gt;you're looking at it like a charity, as though businesses are actually interested in paying employees based on merit instead of paying them the minimum they can and still hold onto said employees.

i don't understand the charity comment other than minimum wage being welfare, which is a kind of forced-participation charity. 

no, businesses are *not* interested in paying employees based on merit, they are interested in retaining employees that add value to their enterprise. more skilled employees are able to add more value and are therefore more generally desirable and can command higher wages.

&gt;there is not one reason why any jobs should exist wherein a person working a full week cannot afford a place to live, and that's what the minimum wage attempts to do. there are people who put in the effort but do not have the skills and are thus limited to extremely low paying jobs (i have worked with many of them in the past).

now you *are* talking about charity where you believe in some minimum lifestyle that our society should support. whether this is a good idea or not, using a minimum wage to accomplish this distorts the economics of free-market employment.

&gt;to look at the job market with a social darwinist ""excel or perish"" viewpoint is, in my mind, un-american. look at that poem on the statue of liberty, it doesn't say ""give me your rich, your energetic, your educated and experienced masses."" the united states of america should be the country where anyone willing to put in the work can carve a living for themselves.

and the minimum wage ensures that the *initially* unskilled don't get the option of working at all.

&gt;abolishing the minimum wage strips the country of that. and you know what? if you take out the minimum wage, most of those jobs will go to kids, because the adults won't make enough to survive and will opt for welfare instead, so the teenagers who only need work to impress their parents will start getting the $3.50 an hour jobs.

kids may be a reasonable portion of the demographic for low wage jobs. they are generally unskilled and need a chance to get started in the working world. the problem is *staying* unskilled. 

there are many options to improve your value in the working world. i recently started attending evening classes at the local community college. the costs are miniscule and if you can't pay even those, they have financial aid which would cover almost all of the costs. but you do have to get off your butt and do the work.

&gt;then there's immigration. if all businesses were forced to pay $7.15 an hour, why would they hire illegal immigrants? why pay that much for someone who can't speak english? if businesses (states, currently, but you can bet states will simply not have a min.) don't have a minimum they have to pay, they'll start offering $20 a week jobs to the illegals and no one will bat an eye.

you're covering two issues here. first, discrimination toward people with fewer (presumably) needed skills such as language. they deserve the opportunity for any job they are qualified for.

second, you are probably talking about how businesses are apparently supposed to act like an arm of the ins. immagration policy is, and should be, the responsiblity of our citizens acting through our governernment. illegal immigrantation is a law enforcement issue, not an employment issue.",BobCollins,2007-01-27 13:26:11,reddit.com,1,straight: het

free history mitika, expresses, disvela the truth, but also the hidden one, forgets it, the kripta under the appearance of the cure, of the latenza that guards conserve, attends to, consecrates and

only the knowledge of the being always concurs of being of forehead and encounter to the being mitiko in the equilibrium of the sacred field of ""mithos"" that it will concur of decostruire and

solar cells already cost 20x - that's a two (2) followed by a zero (0) - as much as conventional sources of electricity. and that's *if* solar cells are made using cheap energy. if the solar energy cycle were to be closed, it boggles the mind what they would cost. 100x as much as nuclear probably. which is exactly how much more costs solar thermal technology than the cheapest alternative once you strip out the government subsidies.

furthermore, what i said about nuclear not having that green cachet was sarcasm meant to indicate how much i look down on you. because you see, the rest of the world overwhelmingly *doesn't care* that [americans are retards incapable of figuring out the difference between environmental facts and environmental fictions](http://www.lewrockwell.com/miller/miller13.html). in the rest of the world, nuclear is king. nuclear is the light. not the [light of an oncoming train at the end of the tunnel](http://www.amazon.com/solar-fraud-energy-world-second/dp/0971484546) which solar power represents but industrial light &amp; electric co. here and now, and for [the next million years](http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html).

you can also predict ""harmonious"" tonal combinations by understanding simple wave interference. the closer two tones are two each other, they create dissonant wave interference (beats). when a wave frequency is a simple ratio of another frequency, the other frequency is considered a harmonic of that frequency, the ""beats"" created by the interference make a sympathetic vibration to the listener.

wow, now that is some professional-grade weaseling. 

he wants to make it sound like 80% of the country is glad they were invaded. 

but what he literally said meant ""i personally allege that some number, which i'm not going to tell you, but i think is a lot, of the 80% of the population are glad the ba'ath government is gone."" 

well, an unknown fraction of 4/5 is an unknown fraction. 

and as for being glad saddam is gone, i'm sorry, if you're glad saddam is gone, you're an idiot. 

people think the way iraq was is a product of the way saddam was. the reverse is true.

iraq can only be ruled by a tough, hard-nosed dictator, because that's what it takes to hold that nest of snakes together. saddam did with a fraction of the men and money, what bush can't do with all the might of the largest war machine in the history of the world: bring peace to iraq.

that's because saddam was something bush isn't and never will be: a tough, competent realist, who deals with the situation in front of him, not the one he wishes he could have. 

was he a bastard? sure. the job calls for a bastard. there is only one way to keep together a cobbled-together nation, arbitrarily assembled from tribes whose hatred of each other by far antedates the notion of ""iraq"" as a nation, and that way is brutally torture anyone who breaks the peace you're enforcing. and when you're in the market for a brutal dictator, you couldn't get a better pick than saddam. sure, he was the source of many a horror story, but he also had a secular government that built schools, hospitals, electric power plants, roads, infrastructure. saddam's iraq was a place america could do business with. saddam's iraq was a place where people got enough to eat. saddam's iraq might have eventually become a lot more democratic, once people had several generations to start thinking of themselves more as iraqis than shi'ites or sunni. 

but it was not to be. with typical american impatience, we wanted to make it all better, right now. and with typical american arrogance, we thought that other nations and other peoples would just roll over like good little puppies, and fit themselves into our plans for them with fawning gratitude for the opportunity to be civilized by us superior beings. it's the ""white man's burden"" all over again.

all this american niceness and democracy and handwringing over saddam being a big 'ole meany doesn't mean they like us. it just makes them think we're a bunch of pussies. hell, we even *torture* them like pussies. naked pyramids? what the hell is that? these people's idea of a strong leader is someone who has his enemies punched full of holes with an electric drill, has their toenails ripped out with pliers, has a car battery hooked up to their genitalia with jumper cables. these people think we're so hopelessly out of touch with their world that there's no way we could plan for their future. and guess what? they're right.

they don't *want* democracy all that badly. it's waaaay down the list of things they want, certainly below ""enough to eat for my family"", and ""all my enemies brutally tortured to death"". 

and before *you* start giving *your*self airs, think about how little *you* want democracy and freedom. when they started tapping people's phones and searching people's homes without warrants, when they started disappearing people in the night and hauling them off to concentration camps on foreign soil, what did you do? 

armed rebellion, as was appropriate? no. most of you didn't even march around with signs. instead, you sat on your ass watching the talking heads on the news worrying about whether protesters were ""blocking traffic"". ""blocking traffic""!

people get the government they deserve, and they only deserve better government by banding together and demanding it. iraqis haven't earned self-determination and freedom yet, and we ourselves are so complacent that we might well deserve to lose ours.

my primary source, though, is experience.  i used to drink about 600 calories of soda a day.  conventional math would say that cutting these out of my diet would allow me to lose a whopping 73 lbs a year (if i had that much to lose, which i don't).  instead, cutting them out of my diet 2 years ago caused me to lose approximately 0 lbs.

why?  because my body told me to eat more to make up for the calorie deficit.

weight loss doesn't just happen for normal people.  it involves slowly starving your body of the calories your body is telling you it needs, and doing so in great enough quantities that your body can't compensate by doing anything other than dipping into its emergency reserves (fat).  so, you can do all the casual exercise you want, but unless you're ignoring your body's signals to eat, it won't do you any good.  i can say for certain that my parking further away and taking the steps instead of the elevator for a year also lost 0 lbs.

they allow you to add new *syntax*.  you can use syntax for things other than control structures, and you can implement control structures using things other than syntax.  a lot of higher-order functions and behavior-implementing classes (for example) are instances of the latter.

what pivo is saying is that, given the same semantics/behavior, the macro version is not any more difficult to assimilate than the non-macro version.

c11fyx,t1_c11fv2,"interesting point about population growth.  however, i don't think that the problem lies with industrialized nations.  the u.s. has 300 million people.  china has 1.6 billion and india has 1 billion.  those countries are industrializing rapidly and it is scary.  the neo-classical economic posturing about continued economic growth being the ultimate good is fine until you think about the consequences of the other 4 or 5 billion people outside of the u.s. and eu participating in it.  i suppose you can question whether we, as a global society, really need to be wasting fuel and incurring the co2 emissions hundreds of plastic injection molding factories that create millions of mcdonald's happy meal toys and the trinkets and trash sold at corner gift shops in manhattan.

  i have little faith in the free market regulating itself based on the findings of these scientists.  big tobacco has paid many quack scientists throughout the decades to announce that cigarettes are not addictive in spite of knowing better.  i think that many executives in corporations have little desire to do the right thing for society -- they just want to maximize their short-term stock prices and executive compensation packages.  at the same time, many members of the u.s. congress also rely on campaign contributions from large corporations to get elected, so i think it would be hard for them to pass bills that outright harm their donors.  i'm not sure where the answer lies.  perhaps in campaign finance reform?  but that's a small step in a larger global problem.

  the 10 year estimate may or may not be a correct guess.  however, paying too much attention to that time frame is ignoring the real issue: the environmental system of the earth can only sustain so much unnatural pollution before it goes into collapse-mode.  the earth's environment is a closed system, not an unlimited resource.  if you take issue with the scientists' findings, then you take issue with that idea.  perhaps the climate change won't mean the end of life on earth, but who knows if we'll be around to see its recovery.",cashcow,2007-01-28 08:24:08,reddit.com,16,straight: het
c11fz0,t1_c11c4n,"&gt;put dna in a bottle of water and it does not replicate. dna does not self replicate all by itself. dna needs a living cell to replicate. dna isn't able to create all proteins and other molecules to replicate itself without a machinery already already present in a cell.

i'll agree that rna is likely the precursor to all life, not dna, which is simply a more stable form of storing information than rna.  it is interesting to not that modern ribosomes (the machinery responsible for manufacturing proteins from the transcript) contain both a rrna subunit and a protein subunit.  in the very beginning, ribosomes were likely rrna exclusively, evolving later into the more stable rrna+protein ribosome we see today.  so, in my opinion, rna is likely the most viable candidate for the origin of all life on earth.

&gt;of course this story is well known when speculating about the origin of life. this wikipedia article mentions a number of hypotheses for what came first: genes (rna), metabolism, bubbles (cells)

genes are simply sections of dna which encode a gene product.  metabolism is the break-down of complex molecules--for example, glucose, which can be broken down into dihydroxyacetone phosphate, phosphenolpyruvate, pyruvate, ect., via the embden-meyerhof pathway or any number of less complex, necessary precursor molecules in the krebs cycle (oxaloacetate, citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, ect.).  during this cycle, nadh and fadh2 are reduced and the stored energy from metabolism is used in oxidative phosphorylation to make gtp/atp.  i read the wiki section on the metabolism-first hypothesis, but given the extreme complexity of the above processes, i find it extremely unlikely (i think almost all fellow microbiologists would agree with me). coincidentally, the krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondria, where we turn to next.

&gt;in an eukaryotic cell, the mitochondria are not produced by the dna of the nucleus. mitochondria have their own dna. just to make clear that the dna of the nucleus is not the absolute boss of a cell.

indeed, the mitochondria do have their own internal dna, although it is minimal and mostly silent.  almost all of the proteins encoded by the mitochondrial dna have migrated to the nuclear dna and are now found there.  it is likely that mitochondria were primitive prokaryotes that were engulfed by larger prokaryotes early in the evolutionary tree and have been conserved because the endosymbiotic relationship is fruitful for both organisms. the mtdna likely codes for some of the minor proteins involved in the citric acid cycle (mutations of the mtdna cause serious disorders, but total disruption of the cac would cause death--this is, coincidentally how poisons such as cyanide kill you).

&gt;for one thing that all becomes clear with horizontal (lateral) gene transfer: the tree of life has knots because species acquire genes from other species. see also this article about the three domain hypothesis where is shown that tracking different genes in bacteria leads to different trees.

i agree that this is an interesting phenomenon.  i mean, hsp70 is conserved amongst all branches of the tree of life, but the tree of life is really just a human conception, an ordering of data to make it more managable.  if the hsp70 gene (protein) were present early on, it would have been conserved throughout all future organisms--but this doesn't mean laterally transferred once after being acquired by one organism.  i'm not sure without looking it up (no time) but i believe that hsp70 is a heat-shock protein which regulates an important and competitively advantageous trait found in most bacteria and archaea, so it seems likely that such a valuable protein would be conserved.  does hgt occur?  absolutely, as evidenced by the acquisition of antibiotic resistance via conjugation in bacteria.  i'm not aware of any mechanism in mammals for hgt, but i'd be very interested in evidence of that.

&gt;i am not sure if it is possible to state that a protein can have an ""incorrect"" 3-d geometry. a protein just has a certain 3-d geometry. the word ""correct"" has only meaning in a certain context, and in this case that is the context of a living cell. if a protein is not automatically considered in the context of a living cell, then there is no such thing as correctness of its 3-d geometry.

agreed, and this is a fair point. however, since changes in protein conformation (geometry) result in actual detrimental consequences, when speaking of protein function, it only makes sense to speak of the functioning protein as the ""correct"" conformation.

i gather that you are saying that evolution could occur in individual proteins by means of intermediaries which change the protein conformation (such as prions).  the problem with this hypothesis is that, were a prion to refold a protein and confer a competitive advantage, that advantange would be uninheritable and would exist only for that specific protein.  for an inheritable change to occur, the dna would have to be modified; changing a single protein is like cutting off an arm--you would see a physical change, but not one inherited by the offspring. 

&gt;and that is exactly the view i want to promote: the elements of a cell are not the slaves of the dna. they have a certain independency. evolution does not equal evolution of dna, but co-evolution of all elements of a cell. genes can jump from one species to another. complete cells (species?) have evolved to become organels in the eukaryotic cell. what if scientists would research the evolution of cell membranes (not based on dna-research but just chemical analysis).

but they are!  a cell membrane cannot evolve on it's own for the same reason that a protein cannot--the change would not be inheritable!

no.  i believe that a warmer climate will result in widespread shifts in which areas are agriculturally productive, which are on prosperous trade routes, and which contain natural resources that other countries demand.  this leads to massive economic dislocation as countries find they are no longer competitive in their traditional competitive advantages, followed by the political instability and war that normally follows that.  once we've done a good job at killing each other, *then* other animals might have a decent shot at outwitting and overtaking humans.

interesting read!",anykey,2007-01-28 10:11:54,reddit.com,1,gay: fruit
c11gkn,t3_11ftp,"1. eat food. though in our current state of confusion, this is much easier said than done. so try this: don’t eat anything your great-great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food. (sorry, but at this point moms are as confused as the rest of us, which is why we have to go back a couple of generations, to a time before the advent of modern food products.) there are a great many foodlike items in the supermarket your ancestors wouldn’t recognize as food (go-gurt? breakfast-cereal bars? nondairy creamer?); stay away from these.

2. avoid even those food products that come bearing health claims. they’re apt to be heavily processed, and the claims are often dubious at best. don’t forget that margarine, one of the first industrial foods to claim that it was more healthful than the traditional food it replaced, turned out to give people heart attacks. when kellogg’s can boast about its healthy heart strawberry vanilla cereal bars, health claims have become hopelessly compromised. (the american heart association charges food makers for their endorsement.) don’t take the silence of the yams as a sign that they have nothing valuable to say about health.

3. especially avoid food products containing ingredients that are a) unfamiliar, b) unpronounceable c) more than five in number — or that contain high-fructose corn syrup.none of these characteristics are necessarily harmful in and of themselves, but all of them are reliable markers for foods that have been highly processed.

4. get out of the supermarket whenever possible. you won’t find any high-fructose corn syrup at the farmer’s market; you also won’t find food harvested long ago and far away. what you will find are fresh whole foods picked at the peak of nutritional quality. precisely the kind of food your great-great-grandmother would have recognized as food.

5. pay more, eat less. the american food system has for a century devoted its energies and policies to increasing quantity and reducing price, not to improving quality. there’s no escaping the fact that better food — measured by taste or nutritional quality (which often correspond) — costs more, because it has been grown or raised less intensively and with more care. not everyone can afford to eat well in america, which is shameful, but most of us can: americans spend, on average, less than 10 percent of their income on food, down from 24 percent in 1947, and less than the citizens of any other nation. and those of us who can afford to eat well should. paying more for food well grown in good soils — whether certified organic or not — will contribute not only to your health (by reducing exposure to pesticides) but also to the health of others who might not themselves be able to afford that sort of food: the people who grow it and the people who live downstream, and downwind, of the farms where it is grown.  “eat less” is the most unwelcome advice of all, but in fact the scientific case for eating a lot less than we currently do is compelling. “calorie restriction” has repeatedly been shown to slow aging in animals, and many researchers (including walter willett, the harvard epidemiologist) believe it offers the single strongest link between diet and cancer prevention. food abundance is a problem, but culture has helped here, too, by promoting the idea of moderation. once one of the longest-lived people on earth, the okinawans practiced a principle they called “hara hachi bu”: eat until you are 80 percent full. to make the “eat less” message a bit more palatable, consider that quality may have a bearing on quantity: i don’t know about you, but the better the quality of the food i eat, the less of it i need to feel satisfied. all tomatoes are not created equal.

6. eat mostly plants, especially leaves. scientists may disagree on what’s so good about plants — the antioxidants? fiber? omega-3s? — but they do agree that they’re probably really good for you and certainly can’t hurt. also, by eating a plant-based diet, you’ll be consuming far fewer calories, since plant foods (except seeds) are typically less “energy dense” than the other things you might eat. vegetarians are healthier than carnivores, but near vegetarians (“flexitarians”) are as healthy as vegetarians. thomas jefferson was on to something when he advised treating meat more as a flavoring than a food.

7. eat more like the french. or the japanese. or the italians. or the greeks. confounding factors aside, people who eat according to the rules of a traditional food culture are generally healthier than we are. any traditional diet will do: if it weren’t a healthy diet, the people who follow it wouldn’t still be around. true, food cultures are embedded in societies and economies and ecologies, and some of them travel better than others: inuit not so well as italian. in borrowing from a food culture, pay attention to how a culture eats, as well as to what it eats. in the case of the french paradox, it may not be the dietary nutrients that keep the french healthy (lots of saturated fat and alcohol?!) so much as the dietary habits: small portions, no seconds or snacking, communal meals — and the serious pleasure taken in eating. (worrying about diet can’t possibly be good for you.) let culture be your guide, not science.

8. cook. and if you can, plant a garden. to take part in the intricate and endlessly interesting processes of providing for our sustenance is the surest way to escape the culture of fast food and the values implicit in it: that food should be cheap and easy; that food is fuel and not communion. the culture of the kitchen, as embodied in those enduring traditions we call cuisines, contains more wisdom about diet and health than you are apt to find in any nutrition journal or journalism. plus, the food you grow yourself contributes to your health long before you sit down to eat it. so you might want to think about putting down this article now and picking up a spatula or hoe.

9. eat like an omnivore. try to add new species, not just new foods, to your diet. the greater the diversity of species you eat, the more likely you are to cover all your nutritional bases. that of course is an argument from nutritionism, but there is a better one, one that takes a broader view of “health.” biodiversity in the diet means less monoculture in the fields. what does that have to do with your health? everything. the vast monocultures that now feed us require tremendous amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to keep from collapsing. diversifying those fields will mean fewer chemicals, healthier soils, healthier plants and animals and, in turn, healthier people. it’s all connected, which is another way of saying that your health isn’t bordered by your body and that what’s good for the soil is probably good for you, too.",dallen,2007-01-28 10:25:01,reddit.com,43,straight: het

the climate in the past has varied, with ice ages, glacial and interglacial periods, but we are seeing a rate of change that is extremely rare if not unheard of. many species that are not able to migrate rapidly enough will likely go extinct. tropical diseases will reach more northern latitudes. agricultural regions will shift. all changes that will require a great deal of effort to adapt to as humans.
we may not like uncertainty when making decisions, but we have mechanisms that do. even if you can't predict the date that your house will burn down or the exact likelihood it will, you'll get insurance. if it's built with bricks, or you install a sprinkler system, the likelihood that it will burn down is less. that is how we should look at the uncertainty and make decisions that reduce both our risk and the risk to the rest of the biosphere.",ursine,2007-01-28 13:23:35,reddit.com,5,straight: het

for the better part of the last thousand years, it has been customary to distinguish military jurisdiction from civilian jurisdiction by the use of a flag.  since every ship for hundreds of years has carried a visible flag, it was mainly useful for one ship to determine if another was a civilian or military one.  similarly, military tribunals, office buildings, etc., would fly flags with gold fringes around them as well.

go into your local government office, esp. court rooms, and you will see nothing but flags with gold fringes.  this is because our nation is technically under military jurisdiction since at least 1939 (some claim lincoln never issued the orders to remove martial law back in the 1860s).

why don't you actually look up some facts?  it is scientifically proven that all human races have evolved equally with only very minor differences, and there is a very good evolutionary reason for it.  homo sapiens went through a near-extinction event 75,000 years ago as a result of the toba eruption.  this reduced humanity to a small population. also, since that time there has been considerable migration and cross-breeding, so genetic diversity has been largely eliminated, to the point where it is highly debatable even to talk about 'races' for humanity in the way we do for other species - there is just too little consistent genetic variation.  this is not to say that there is no variation - we can clearly see that in terms of skin colour, build and so on, but overall it is extremely small.

c11i6u,t1_c11i4c,"listen. first of all, get over two things:

a) nazi germany was, well, crazy... but they weren't isolated. france, england, russia and almost all european countries collaborated with germany for the holocaust. i know this is completely aside the point in this conversation, but keep that in mind. it's important because one part of europe was vilified while the other was sanctified for highly political reasons which i don't care to discuss, and doubt you do either.

b) jews weren't the only ones exterminated. it's publicized that way because israel has the loudest ever propaganda megaphone. i'm not denying the numbers, but i am saying that nowadays you don't ever hear the number of gipsies, homosexuals or even blacks that were killed in the holocaust.  (including roughly 2 million christian poles, and almost 1 million gipsies)

 now, i could argue that given those numbers, the the hutu/tutsi conflict was more perverse than the holocaust because the tutsis specifically wanted to anhialte one single tribe, the hutus, and they went about methodicaly doing that at roughly 1000 heads a day.

 whereas the germans were doing it to jews, christians, gipsies, blacks and homosexuals. i know you want to claim it was specifically directed at just your person, but 6 million compared to 2 million is quite a significant ratio.

i call israel a tolerant country because it is: it tolerates the presence of its neighbors, inside and (usually) outside its borders.  tolerance doesn't mean love or support, it simply means that one will accept and allow their neighbor to exist.  hamas does not want israel to exist, and they cite in great length excerpts from the protocols of zion in their charter.  that is not tolerance in any way, shape or form.  how can a ""bi-state"" region exist when one potential side refuses to grant the other the right to exist?

i never said all arabs wanted to kill all jews - i think 80 - 90% are ready to ""tolerate"" israel, actually.  it's that 10% that scares me, because that is all it takes to start a genocide.  if israel disbanded its military tomorrow, hundreds of people around them would inflict violence on israeli jews - genocide, by definition.

simply because the katyusha rockets aren't as efficient as a suicide bomber does not mean that the willingness to kill jewish civilians does not exist.  same with some israelis - they are nowhere near perfect, and an extremist in a tank is very dangerous indeed.  my main issue with most of the comments are that they assume israel is the sole offender in the conflict, that if they simply went away, there would be peace in that area of the world.  and i believe that to be wrong.  the hatred on both sides is extreme, and blaming israel wholeheartedly won't solve the problem.

so when people are attacked (or killed by disease or something similar) then if i'm going to invest something in helping them then it becomes a much more compelling thing if i'm going to get something in return. the us probably won't get much of anything for helping starving people in africa besides warm fuzzies, but attacking people who attack them there's a whole lot more to be gained.

c11ijn,t3_11hlr,"an interesting article.

i have some general points of contention with the article.

i find fault with some of its comparisons. i'm not sure russian losses in wwii have much to offer as an analogy to the deaths of 9/11.

consider, it is a difficult argument to make, it seems to me, to say that america faced any legitimate (physical) threat in the 20th century. this is important, because the entire argument of the article seems to be that, compared to what it has taken to prompt previous u.s. military adventures, the u.s.  has overreacted and jumped the gun in terms of its military endeavors in the war on terrorism.

in support of my claim above, pearl harbor was a strategic strike. it was not the first step towards domination of the u.s., but a (massively miscalculated) strategic move to remove an obstacle to japan's ambitious desire to domiante the pacific. basically, i'm saying it had limited goals and was not representative of a japanese desire to dominate the u.s. or to threaten u.s. interests or american lives outside the realm of the pacific rim.

while i'm not an historian, and despite the numerous alternate history sci-fi books that would lead you to believe otherwise, i think it would be difficult to imagine japan as a threat to the continental united states during wwii. it would be difficult to provide strong proof to their intent to attack major u.s. cities or to invade parts of the contiguous 50 states and it would certainly be impossible to prove that as a realistic, feasible goal of theirs. obviously germany posed even less of a threat to american lives in america.

so what was at stake for the u.s. in wwii? the minimal pacific holdings and america's economic interests?

do such truly outweigh by that much what is at stake, in terms of the forward looking threat from islamo-terrorists, in the war on terror?

notice, i don't want to debate whether our response and methods and tactics are actually achieving their goals of making us safer. i'm only challenging the article's point that the magnitude of our reaction is somehow historically disproportionate.

when looking at world war ii we can of course broaden our definition of what was at ""stake"" for the u.s. we can assign the u.s. responsibilities for protecting the world from 'evil'. we can talk about ideologies and the human suffering occurring in china and europe and the world occupied by the axis. but speaking of good versus evil, that seems to play right into the arguments of the current neoconservatives. clearly the long term, world wide threat of islamo-terrorists is greater than the actual physical threat to the united states.

not to downplay the threat of islamo-terrorism, but it goes without saying that the evils occurring during wwii far overshadow the evils posed by islamic fanaticism. i just want to point out i'm not trying to draw an analogy between say, the holocaust, and the current terrorist activities of those who pervert islam. despite that, my point remains, seeing as the u.s. response in the ""war"" on terror was dwarfed by the u.s. military response to the evils of the axis powers. they remain arguably proportional. 

in anycase, while i can't agree that invading iraq was in america's true best interest, i don't think that the magnitude of our response has been comparatively inappropriate. 9/11 was a major tragedy. it can (and should) only be compared in light of other american events and other american responses. we may have made poor choices in terms of execution and strategy but the ""war"" on terror is the right thing.",txmed,2007-01-28 15:31:30,reddit.com,12,straight: het

look, whether you think the atrocities committed against the palistinians are on a par with the holocaust or not, the simple fact is that the people killed in the holocaust didn't do it. being dead is an iron-clad alibi, no? the mayor's actions are a bit like showing up at somebody's funeral and telling the mourners that they should be remembering the guy that the deceased's nephew killed instead. it serves no purpose other than to insult.

i actually agree with your argument that modern [global] economic health is not dependent on the american economy the way it was during the great depression.  you are absolutely correct, but in a way that is contrary to your intention.  in fact, by any sane criteria, the modern global economy is far more inter-dependent than it was during the great depression.  we even have a term for it; globalization, with which i am sure you are familiar.  i will not further belabor this point inasmuch as i suspect that you have already made a decision regarding your stance on the subject, and nothing i can say will shake your conviction.

as it turns out, you are not proposing anything new to most intelligent americans when you argue that there are problems with the current economic structure not only of the us, but of the world in general.  there are many problems, and as the world's largest economy you would be right to suggest that the onus for responsible change lies with america.  however, to paraphrase charles bukowski, before you start slinging hate-horse-shit in the public park, you damned well better have something superior with which to replace the edifice you are so hell-bent on tearing down.  

six months ago i spent a couple of months in the uk and ireland.  while most people i met with were not as vociferous as you, i did encounter a great deal of poorly informed anti-americanism that at its heart seemed to focus on the idea that as evidenced by the current presidential administration and its insane foreign and domestic policies, america is fucked.  my invariable response was to argue that all the cards have not, so to speak, been dealt, and that it is a mistake to think of the us as a homogeneous or intentional entity that is capable of having imperial designs in the sense of historical monarchies of the past.  in point of fact, american views regarding the us role in global affairs are at least as varied as are those in europe, probably more so.  

which brings me to another point; that europeans are accustomed to thinking of nationalities in discrete terms that have no relevance in truly large countries (with the possible exception of china, but that is a different matter.)  no, in fact, while it may be meaningful to speak of irish or german or italian sentiment in general terms, to say the same thing of indian or indonesian or american or even brazilian sentiment, is to completely miss the point that these are countries that are so big, are so culturally diverse, that generalizations have no meaning.  what is culturally and politically true, for example, in my liberal west-coast state (not california), is almost certainly not true in alabama or mississippi or montana.  

finally, as an atheist, i agree wholeheartedly that the state of religious belief in america is unfortunate.  where i disagree with you is in your implied assertion that this a losing battle fought against those who cannot or will not see reason.  in fact, while i would not expect a euro-zealot to be aware of it, the encroachment of christian ideology into government has recently been dealt several heavy blows by the us federal judiciary.  the point?  they are losing.  every day the voices of reason make a little more headway in the struggle for public opinion.  

you are completely mistaken.  maybe you have read too much noam chomsky.  chomsky is a great thinker, but without his work is leavened with the numerous well-reasoned objections of other great thinkers, he is apt to lead one astray.  the us is the first truly large democratic nation state this planet has seen.  it looks like india will be the next.  the eu may soon become cohesive enough to deserve the appellation of nation-state, but right now, it is more of a  loosely-knit federation.  i do not say that the us is perfect, i simply argue that for large powers, it's the best thing we have going.

c11kux,t1_c11ko8,"&gt; well, it is unclear (from the article) if those muslims actually want to encroach on rights-liberties of non-muslims.

this is true. but in every other example we've ever had in the past 100 years, when it is possible for the muslims to impose their rules on non-muslims, they do so without fail.

&gt;if that's the intension, that should obviously be impossible to do.

it should, however there is no decent way to do this that doesn't seem to infringe on liberties. should muslims become whatever the requisite majority is in the uk, or twist the rules to their favor through parliamentary procedure, they can change laws however they like.

&gt; however, if some muslim voluntarily wants to follow the (personal) laws of sharia (no pork, no alcohol, pray 5 times a day etc, donate 10%(?) to charity etc..), that should be his/her ""religious freedom"".

you may be unfamiliar with what this really means. in practice, it goes far beyond the basic tenets of islam, and some practices are at odds with current laws. particularly those crimes against islam which carry the death penalty in sharia. 

&gt; the above study/poll was conducted by an obviously biased party (right-wing think tank policy exchange). so, i would take this with a grain of salt.

i do not doubt that these douchebags exagerrate things. i've seen it myself. i do not deny that they hope the whole clash of civilizations thing happens, and they're generally the sort that want war with iran no matter what.

but this doesn't mean that there aren't real issues.

&gt; and if the implication is to punish the muslim minority for (voluntarily) following their religion without encroaching rights/liberties of non-muslims,

this is a little disingenuous. there are two problems here, that they may very well feel the need to deny civil liberties to non-muslims, and that their sharia laws may be antithetical to the laws of a civilized nation. it's difficult for a person like myself to not get honor killings and fgm and punishments like rape confused with what the technical/theological rules of sharia are... but then, there are millions of muslims all over the world that seem to have the same problem.

let's say all that is bullshit though (for instance, the grand mufti in egypt or whatever he is, went on record to say that fgm is always wrong, and a crime against the girl it is done to). what would ""if some muslim voluntarily wants to follow the (personal) laws of sharia (no pork, no alcohol [...]"" mean?

should a mullah be allowed to go around, policing those british muslims that fail to adhere? can he enforce it? if he doesn't, what does it really mean anyway? hell, there are quite a few non-muslims that might not drink and eat pork already. so it's no big deal, it's not like the uk is getting ready to outlaw following sharia, everyone is free to follow it if it is as benign as you suggest. but when they claim to want to live under it, i have the feeling that they mean that it should be enforced somehow. the government must not give up control, or even share it, to enforce laws/rules. doing so will become a slippery slope, i'm sure.

worst yet, i'm afraid that even if they are happy to ignore non-muslims and ""mind their own business"", it will lead to all sorts of injustice and corruption. in amish communities throughout the us, for one reason or another, the local authorities will allow the amish to police their own... and who knows how many children are molested and abused because of this.",NoMoreNicksLeft,2007-01-28 22:46:54,reddit.com,2,straight: het

for instance, did you know that ethnic minorities have a much younger average age than the majority in the uk?  what do you think that would do to the crime figures?  and how many other factors like that do you think contribute to crime statistics?

by focusing on their skin colour alone, you are taking a very thin slice of the overall picture and removing all context.  your interpretation of the statistics is about as valid and meaningful as noting that over half of all crimes are committed by people whose given name begins with [n-z], therefore we can halve crime by forcing everybody to have names beginning with [a-m].",Bogtha,2007-01-28 23:18:52,reddit.com,8,gay: homo

chinese currency is pegged on us currency. in recent year  us currency has become cheaper as compared to most commodity producing countries. this means that chinese were buying expensive raw products and had to sell them to us at the sme price (actually cheaper because of oversupply). chinese have been loosing money all these years. chinese banks have the highest non-performing assetts in the whole world. banks are forced by the govt to loan money to these state run factories which produce stuff for us and loose money. last year chinese govt infused more than 500 billion dollars to keep these banks alive. even after that these banks are not very healthy and very soon there will be a need for another infusion. becasue of trade imbalance with us chinese central bank has been forced to pile around one trillion us dollars. question is where from is the chinese govt bring all the money to finance all this: us securities, internal bank infusion, high investment on infrastructure projects.

the question that you immediately raise is whether a person who wants to harm themselves can, by definition, be considered sane. considering that sanity is a concept that is underpinned by our own views on morality. if somebody would do something abhorrent to us, then it is our nature to consider them insane.

i would consider a person determined to disable themselves (and i use that word perfectly validly, because the intention is to remove the one's own ability to stand and walk) can only be considered equivelant to someone who wishes to commit suicide, or to a teenager who wants to cut the skin from their arms. these things are, without exception, the result of mental trauma of one sort or another. the human brain is wired to protect itself and its body, not to harm itself over such conceptual concerns as 'self-image'.

how does ghc push me towards compilation?

 1. it's the default action.

 2. there is no command line to ""execute"" haskell code as a script. you need to fake it by -e ""main.main""

i believe the ""solution"" to many mental disorders can be found by answering the question:  which is easier to change, the mental model, or reality. 

schizophrenics have mental models of people that don't exist.  reality can't change to accommodate the voices they hear, so we have to somehow change their mind.  so far, the best we can do is with somewhat crude drugs.

anorexics think they're fat.  counseling is very successful at improving their mental image of themselves.

c11ri2,t3_11rer,"c++'s greatest problem in this regard is stl dll hell (and dll hell in general).  this is less of a problem under linux and osx where some standardization of the stl exists, but under windows different *compilers* (and even *compiler versions*!) can give you totally incompatible stl libraries.

as a result, it is not safe to, for example, return an std::vector object as the result of a method across a dll boundary unless you are only distributing your libraries in source code form.

i'm creating a c++ api for a commercial library right now.  i am, for the sake of convenience and sanity, implementing stl in the library interface.  however, since the library must be ported to windblows i am creating and manipulating stl structures in *inline* methods and using various hacks to pass the information from the library to those methods using private methods that return pointers to low-level c data structures that can be assured to be portable.

the stl needs to be standardized badly.  some other things about c++ calling semantics need to be standardized on a per-platform basis.  if you are working on a given platform (linux, osx, windows, etc.) you need to be able to be certain that you can pass around stl structures, throw exceptions, etc. regardless of whether you're building your code with watcom, gcc, or microsoft's compilers.

there was muhammad (the prophet), he had 3 friends (abu bakar, umar + usman), he also had a confidant, cousin + son in law (all rolled into one - i am keepin it brief so ..) who was ali . when muhamad died , his friends + their followers wanted ""power"" (they were not evil or anything, just thought they wud be better leaders) but some people thought ""ali"" (who was also a noted general) would make a better leader. so the friends came together (remember kids 3 &gt; 1) and they ruled peacefully for some time, now when those 3 died, their party nominated their ally (mawia) to be king, half the people wanted ali to be king, but mawia was installed. they had a war , ali was sabotaged .. they both died a bit later. now mawia had a son named yazid (angel) who ""inherited"" the throne but people still wanted ali's son hussien (muhammad's grandson) to be their leader, so yazid's allies ""tricked"" hussein and lured him away from his strong hold (mecca), hussein believed him (come on the guy's name means angel =] who wudn't trust an angel ;) ) but yazid being the ""angel"" that he  was sent his armies and ""slaughtered"" hussein + hussein's family (including women and children) after surrounding them in a field and literally starving and denying them food and water. i believe it was a battle of 1000 (h) vs 100000 (y). hussein's (muhammad's grandson (the person whose picture, muslims forbid you to ""imagine"")) head was severed from his body and put on ""display"" @ yazid's palace. so hence hussein's followers split off and became shias ( party of ali). the rest (not necessarily the followers of yazid, includes people who took no side, were uninformed of hussein's fate) are called sunni.

don't drink the kool-aid. xul is rich compared to plain ol' html, which is rather pathetic here in 2007. (it really only needs a couple more widgets, but it needs them badly.) xul is pretty weak against a ""real"" desktop toolkit. compare [xul](http://www.xulplanet.com/references/elemref/) vs. [qt](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/classes.html), [wxwidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/manuals/stable/wx_classesbycat.html#classesbycat) or [gtk](http://developer.gnome.org/doc/api/2.0/gdk/index.html) (nearly one entire _documentation concept_ for every three or four xul tags).

xul's not in the same league, and relatively speaking, falling behind.

if anything turns me off about xul right now, it is its long history of being horribly, horribly oversold. using it to build a real app that isn't somehow tied to the web and mozilla is suicidally stupid, and a lot of naive or excessively-trusting developers would be saved a lot of pain if people would stop pretending otherwise.",jerf,2007-01-30 00:09:50,programming,11,straight: het

stewart constructs a straw man here and then beats it down, saying that cheney's party's (""cruel"") standards should be held up to his family. what he doesn't happen to understand (or worse, understands but chooses to ignore) is (a) that cheney has shown unconditional love for his daughter, (b) that being a part of a political party doesn't mean accepting and embracing every facet of it, or (c) that it's quite unfair to say that cheney should have these standards held up to him (even though the homosexuality is his daugher's, i'll emphasize) when he doesn't embrace them himself.

so stewart has made cheney out to be some type of hypocrite,  saying that his party's ideologies and his daughter's behavior are contradictory. well, i think it's safe to say that cheney and his lesbian daughter (both republicans) disagree with the party on this issue. what's more is that none of this has anything to do with cheney himself, directly.

this is simple below-the-belt attacks from a man who should know better. shame on stewart. it's not like there's not easier ways to attack cheney (haliburton, shotgun to the face, etc.). anybody who has to resort to abusing the love of a man's child is either clueless or cruel.

1. how would i respond if the only thing that changed was skin color? (if you put a white person in the context you discussed above, would your position change? in this case, i would imagine not).

2. is the environment informing your position? (if you were sitting at a nice restaurant and saw the same individual across at another table, you would probably think they are a successful media mogul.)

3. is it really class?

the most important response to these, however, is not simply finding ways to prove to myself that i am not racist or classist (even if i am wholly in the right). the important part is finding ways to alter the environment such that making judgements on race or class are not correlated with the negative outcomes that we fear.

i can't remember the context itself, i believe it was a movie, but a canadian citizen mentioned that they did not fear walking on the street at night because they knew that there was nothing that a person in need could get from them that they could not get from the government. government safety nets were available, accessible, and thorough enough that making a judgement about a thug on the street needn't happen at all.

whether dca has any efficacy against certain cancers more than present therapies remains to be seen.  but even with this question, it's worth asking why the private cancer charities aren't pouring lots of money into dca if it's the wonder drug that is promoted in the other article that's currently on the reddit hot page.",txfer418,2007-01-30 10:29:39,reddit.com,10,straight: het

speaking of libertarians, atheists, and the dalai lama, i thought i'd point out two examples of prominent atheist libertarians being dogmatic and ignorant asses: the episode where they take on religious leaders and icons, they attack mother teresa and gandhi (to be fair, both of them had some sizeable issues and flaws, from the way teresa handled her money and appeared in public with a few dictators to ghandi's early racist writings about africa, but they obviously did more good than harm by several miles)...

but then they try to attack the dalai lama, implying that he and the tibetan monks exploited the people that lived around the temples for labor and food, and unfairly concentrated wealth (nevermind that a cursory education of buddhism will tell you that a monk's vows include never owning anything more than robes, a bowl, shoes, and maybe a watch and some trinkets). they also make fun of him for socializing with celebrities and raising money for displaced tibetans. then they attack him for ""working with the cia"", when all he did was accept their aid in helping evacuate and re-establish the tibetans and fund the tibetan resistance.

c11xas,t3_11wcf,"so the heart of this article is that,

&gt;what irritates me about the hysteria some bloggers are whipping up over this is that it is at its heart basically paranoid conspiracy mongering, and the reason this story has any legs at all is because people are inherently distrustful of big pharma. **there are some good reasons for this and many reasons that boil down to little more than an inherent distrust of big corporations**

...

&gt;what is most pernicious about the conspiracy-mongering stories being spread about dca is that it builds false hope. people with cancer hear about this drug, and they think **there's an amazing cure out there that's being withheld from them because of the greed of big pharma. that's a very distorted version of the true situation.**

of course earlier the author admits the real problem is that the results may not be patentable, which might limit corporate profit. but not to worry maybe we can patent the specific use!!

&gt;4. lastly, there was nothing stopping the investigator from patenting the idea of using dca to treat cancer. i know someone who is doing just that for a use of a drug that's fda-approved for treating something totally unrelated to cancer. indeed, i sincerely hope that michelakis has, in fact, done this, because now that his results have published it's too late; the cat's out of the bag. if he had done that, he could then have licensed his idea to whatever pharmaceutical company was interested, and that pharmaceutical company would then have had a patent on the use of this drug to treat cancer. **if michelakis hasn't done that, well, i applaud his idealism (or curse his naïveté); he shot himself in the foot and made his idea less appealing to industry.**

so you go the open and available to everyone route for a ""cure"" and you have ""shot yourself in the foot"". that right there is the real reasons there was so much blog outrage. and neither bravetoaster, clarion, zenosrevenge, sketerpot, acrophobia, kermityfrog, suleyman3, see a problem with this, as they are so glad for the defense of corporatism. yeah!! 

let's be honest, its a very successful phase i trial, with a very novel approach. the reason we heard about this article is entirely because he was having problems getting funding. 

how do we determine if a drug will be effective. first it's got to pass animal models, which it did with flying colors. is it a cure? not till fda approval, but a similar drug on a corporate based patented track would certainly be generating a lot of buzz and be mentioned as a huge source of future revenue by any big pharma company. which is why this discovery is generating backlash. is it wise to limit the hype until we get through phase ii and iii, absolutely, but that's not the real purpose of the article.",smacfarl,2007-01-30 11:05:48,reddit.com,-4,gay: boi

c11xic,t1_c11wcj,"&gt; my original statement, that people are going to be put out of work is fairly well understood and accepted - if you increase the minimum cost of hiring someone, but a business has no corresponding increase in income, then businesses aren't going to be able to hire anyone.

it's not that simple. of course, everyone agrees that at least one person will lose his job or not be hired if the minimum wage is increased by $2. how about $1? how about $0.01?

you claimed only a few would benefit of a $2 raise, while the rest would lose their jobs. that's a pretty big claim, and you should back it up or let it go.

&gt; what i think a job is worth is irrelevant - the only relevant point is how much the employer can afford to pay.

i didn't ask for your personal opinion of the value of the job, but was talking about the value provided by the employee to the employer. to make it clear what i meant, a job that is worth $5 per hour for the employer is one that is profitable for the employer at that rate. 

what the employer can afford to pay is really not the issue, what's important is whether it's profitable for him or not. obviously there are some cases where the lack of capital for the employer means he can't exploit every possible opportunity for profit, but when considering minimum wage i think it's irrelevant.",wicked,2007-01-30 11:40:06,reddit.com,1,straight: het
c11xlk,t3_11x14,"&gt; in actual fact, properly leveraging internet search utilities (google, forum searches, and so on) requires three things:

&gt;   3. you have to know how to work a search engine

all true, but i was in pretty much the same situation as him, and he's missing two very important bits out:

4: you have to have a shred of common sense

5: you have to not be completely lazy

for instance, if somebody asked a question that is answered in the faq, i used to politely point it out and provide a link to the specific faq that answered their question, noting that it would probably answer a lot of their other questions too.  it was fairly common that the person either kept asking *until you pasted the answer in* (ffs!  they are incapable of clicking on a link?) or they repeatedly asked followup questions that were answered on the same page directly beneath the original question (they don't think to keep on reading if they want to know more?).

essentially, it boils down to one nasty fact: in most fora, there are enough people who value saving *seconds* of their time over wasting everybody else's that virtually everybody who knows what they are talking about but doesn't have the patience of a saint burns out and quits.

now if the subject field is large enough to have numerous experts, hopefully the rate at which people burn out is matched by new contributors.  if not, eventually it withers into a bunch of newbies talking amongst themselves and occasionally figuring something out between them.  in the end, the beginners who aren't stupid and lazy are disadvantaged by those who are.",Bogtha,2007-01-30 11:55:02,programming,12,gay: boi

as for tibet, i consider a reliable account to be given by the late chogyam trungpa rinpoche in his early-life autobiography, born in tibet.  trungpa was a tibetan tulku and lama who was forced to flee due to chinese occupation, came to the west, was educated at oxford, and build a successful and controversial following here in the states.  in born in tibet, he says straight up that there was plenty of corruption in tibet and in the tibetan system of lamas.  but, he also said there was a lot of genuine wisdom as well.  so i'm sure it was a mixed bag, just like any political system / religious system, and to my mind, probably less barbaric than most.

you can't underestimate, however, the influence of china in shaping themselves as liberators.  china has a long history of crafting public opinion through repressive information control, and i hope i don't need to cite sources for that!

as for the modern dalai lama, tendzin gyamtso, his real teachings are pretty down-to-earth, and he has done a fairly fantastic job of working with the pr-crazy world, including celebrities, scientists and influential world leaders to bring incredible awareness to his situation and forward what he feels are the important parts of tibetan buddhism.  for the most part they are strikingly integrative and humanitarian.

and then:
""mejia sued orlando regional in january, asking that it be forced to surrender information about any other patients with the same type of infection and related medical problems, such as toxic-shock syndrome and gangrene.
she has not filed a malpractice suit.

one of her lawyers, e. clay parker, said friday that he thinks the type of infection mejia contracted was 'a systemic problem' at south seminole. he said he needs information about any other cases to determine whether infections were properly reported to state authorities and dealt with.

circuit judge clayton d. simmons ruled that florida's constitution required the hospital to release records.

'any strep case would be relevant,' he said.

that was a victory for mejia.

'we're very pleased with the court's ruling,' parker said.

still in dispute, though, is how many and which patient records the hospital must provide.

hospital attorney jennings 'bucky' hurt iii urged the judge not to order the release of hundreds of patient records. 'we have the privacy issue,' hurt said.

he asked that the release be limited to patients who were at the hospital near the time of mejia's hospitalization.

otherwise, it could cost millions of dollars if the hospital company had to surrender 2,200 records, the number of patients who suffered from the same disorders as mejia, he said.

'we have spent hundreds of hours investigating this case,' hurt said. 'we cannot find any other person in proximity to her with strep a.'

when asked if he believed mejia got the infection at south seminole hospital, he said: 'i don't think she did. . . . she had a very unique form of strep a.'

the judge predicted lawyers would be back in court soon to argue again over which case records the hospital company must release.""

the fud part is linking all these facts as if each lead to the next with 100% certainty.

i agree that that's a serious problem, but, again, it's a separate problem from one of whether the government or some subset of the individuals in government should have the legal right to do things that other people don't.",randallsquared,2007-01-31 07:00:01,reddit.com,1,"straight: het, straight: het"
c123nm,t3_123kz,"i know for a fact that volkswagen produces some of the most fuel efficient engines. i myself own a 2004 1.2 vw polo (gasoline) which is not reputable for fuel economy, but i can achieve 6 liters per 100 kilometers.

&gt;the current record in fuel economy of production cars is held by volkswagen, with a special production model of the volkswagen lupo (the lupo 3l) that can consume as little as 3 litres per 100 kilometres (78 miles per us gallon or 94 miles per imperial gallon).
(...)
for example, the current model skoda octavia, using volkswagen engines, has a combined european fuel efficiency of 38.2 mpg for the 102 bhp petrol engine and 53.3 mpg for the 105 bhp — and heavier — diesel engine.

another fuel efficient car is the smart fortwo.

&gt;an interesting example of fuel economy is the popular microcar smart fortwo cdi, which can achieve up to 3.4 l/100 km (69.2 mpg us) using a turbocharged three-cylinder 41 hp (30 kw) diesel engine. the fortwo is produced by daimlerchrysler (and mercedes).

source of these quotes [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuel_efficient)

i'm not a motor head, but the prius and other such hybrid come across as a publicity stunt. better fuel economy (although maybe not emissions) can be achieved today with cars like the diesel lupo. 

besides, in terms of aesthetics... there is a reason why the prius isn't common in europe.

c123vp,t1_c123f5,"you should realize that the law is very analytic and exact; in many regards, it takes a similar mind to do law than it does to work in the sciences.  just the same, a historian must be, in a sense, ""scientific""; the study of history requires great attention to detail, synthesis of results, and willingness to re-evaluate old hypotheses based on new evidence.  i am not sure what you mean by capitalizing science, and saying even math is not equal to it; do you mean science is somehow above math?  no doubt they are different; the original poster was aiming at establishing a certain anyalytic mindset that distinguishes the humanities and the sciences.  for my part, i would say math is the queen of the sciences, on which they all rest.  math does have its experiments and conjectures; but, unlike the other sciences where old theories are torn away to make room for new ones, the edifice of math continually grows upward.

c124tw,t3_121e5,"as a webcomic author who grew up on calvin &amp; hobbes, i am, like dave_au, desperately curious what he would think of this new medium.  he really cared about the future of comics and up until his retirement he talked about various ways comics could be brought to the public on their own terms.  he suggested separate publications that carried large-form comic strips.

&gt;if comics can be so much, why are we settling for so little? can't we expect more from our comics pages?

&gt;well, these days, probably not. let's look at why:

&gt;the comics are a collaborative effort on the part of the cartoonists who draw them, the syndicates that distribute them, and the newspapers that buy and publish them. each needs the other, and all haves common interest in providing comics features of a quality that attracts a devoted readership. but business and art almost always have a rocky marriage, and in comic strips today the interests of business are undermining the concerns of the art.

&gt;. . . as the syndicates will tell you, no cartoonist is forced to sign the ridiculous contracts the syndicates offer. the cartoonist is free to stay in his $3.50 an hour bag boy job until he can think of a better way to get his strip in the newspapers. simply put, the syndicates offer virtually the only shot for an unknown cartoonist to break into the daily newspaper market. the syndicates therefore use their position of power to extort rights they do not deserve.

and:

&gt;here, then, is the situation: despite the proven popularity of the comics, newspapers print them miserably, while syndicates have taken it on themselves to control, exploit, and cheapen their product. between the two, cartoonists all but abandon the artistic responsibilities of their craft. somehow, i can't shake the idea that this isn't how cartooning is supposed to be... and that cartooning will never be more than a cheap, brainless commodity until it's published differently.

well, we've found a way to publish it differently.  the web has created a way for cartoonists -- a handful, for now -- to make a living off their creations.  the situation for someone doing niche humor -- like i am -- is completely different now.  a decade ago, if you wanted to do jokes for 1% of the population (say, programmers), your only real opportunities would be getting a gig with a trade magazine, college zine, or something like that, since you couldn't go through normal syndication routes.  now, you put it online and you can reach whatever audience as you want.  this is a huge change, and creators are only just shifting to figure out how to work in it.  

first it was gamer comics (the most successful webcomic is still penny arcade) and the anime community.  but people are just starting to explore the potential of the medium.  there are comics exploring mural-like artwork such as [a lesson is learned](http://www.alessonislearned.com/) and [copper](http://www.boltcity.com/copper/) (the latter of which i bet watterson would think quite highly).  there are comics exploring interesting intentionally-fixed frameworks, like [dinosaur comics](http://qwantz.com/), [partially clips](http://www.partiallyclips.com/), and [wondermark](http://wondermark.com/) --  a comic built from illustrations from rare antique books.  so i think this is just the start. 

now, given his focus on artwork, i don't imagine watterson would be too impressed with what i draw (the prospect of his ever seeing any xkcd strips just mortifies me).  but at the same time, i'm doing it the way i want to do it, and that's all there is to it.  but he's completely cut off from the world, as he is content to be.  no mail is forwarded to him, and as far as i know he's just living in the woods in ohio painting with his father.  there are some good articles about him, including one (which i can't find right now) in which the author goes to ohio to try to find him.  this is, of course, frustrating for those of us who want to know what observations about the present day he might have.

&gt;newspapers can do better. syndicates can do better. cartoonists can do better. the business interests, in the name of efficiency, mass marketability, and profit, profit, profit are catering to the lowest common denominator of readership and arc keeping this artform from growing. there will always be mediocre comic strips, but we have lost much of the potential for anything else.

because of an incident which happened with a slave of king yannai (called alexander or janneus in greek sources, 103-76bce), who killed a man. 

simeon the son of shetah insisted that king yannai takes responsibility for the deed of his slave and that the sages administrate god's justice. king yannai came before the great assembly (or sanhedrin) and sat down. simeon said, ""king yannai stand on your feet and let them give testimony regarding you. you do not stand before us but before he-who-spoke-and-the-world-was (i.e. god), as it is stated, the two parties shall stand before the lord, before the kohanim and the judges who will be in those days. (deut. 19:17)"" king yannai said, ""i will not act as you say but as your colleagues says."" so simeon turned to his right (where the 70 judges are), but they looked down to the ground. he turned to his left (where the 70 student-judges are), but they looked down to the ground. simeon said to them, ""are you preoccupied with your thoughts? let the master of thoughts come and punish you."" then gabriel came and struck them to the ground. at that time they said, ""a king does not judge and is not judged in court.""

let's assume the statistics are correct.  then anyone making less than $85k (or $50k) qualifies for one of of the less than median-valued homes.  there are *many* nice homes available in the us priced less than $250k.  in most places in the usa, you can do rather well less than $150k.   if you're willing to trade off a nice neighborhood for a run-down one, you can easily do less than $100k.

i'm guessing the statistics are misused anyway; its not clear in the article if the author is consistently comparing nationwide averages, or city averages, or mixing them up.",quantum-mechanic,2007-01-31 16:48:45,reddit.com,-1,gay: trade

why? because religions *are* stupid, and because reality and facts matter, and imaginary friends are best relegated to fairy tales or the mentally ill.

c128ls,t1_c124tv,"alas, you have missed the point.

you have not only misunderstood the arguments i used to support my position, you have actually failed to grasp what my position *is*. 

you seem to believe that i am saying ""we do not have free will"".

what i am actually saying is that the question ""do we have free will?"" has no answer, because, while it appears to be well-formed, and seems to mean something, when we unpack it, it's just as empty and meaningless as the questions ""how high is green?"", or ""what sound does three make?"".

i made those technical terms into links for a reason, hoping that you might follow some of them, and understand at least some of what i had to say. but you're convinced, somehow, that you and i are the first to think about this, and that i couldn't possibly be quoting established, proven, concepts in mathematics and computer science. 

let me try a simpler alternative explanation.

in order for a hypothesis to have truth-value, it must be *testable*. in other words, unless a proposition has measurable or observable consequences, it is not true, and also not false. it is meaningless. 

your proposition is that i have ""free will"", which is a hypothetical entity that resists semantic unpacking, is causa sui, acts without being acted upon, etc.

now, name one *observable* thing that i might do, if i had this ""free will"", which i could not be predisposed to do, by a deterministic or stochastic brain which lacked such an entity.

okay, now name one thing that i might do if i had a deterministic or stochastic brain, which i could not decide to do, with my ""free will"". 

now, at long last, do you finally understand what ""undecidable"" means? the question is moot. we cannot reach the answer by anything we can do with our brains. we can believe what we want to believe, but it's an exercise in self-deception, because we *can't* know, by the very definition of being us. 

in the words of william gibson, ""[we are], in a sense, he that knoweth not the name.""

you seem to be fumbling towards this understanding, when you talk about the turing test. but then you miss the point by using the term ""soulless robots"". 

the turing test is a test for sentience, not ""free will"". alan turing's genius, in devising this thought experiment (it was never intended as an actual test), is that he grasped the very thing that you have failed to, that is: untestable questions aren't questions. 

in other words, the ability to feign sentience, and actual sentience, are not ""more or less the same"". they are not ""functionally equivalent"". they are *precisely one and the same thing*. 

therefore, anything that a thinking being made of meat can have (""free will"", a ""soul"", ""consciousness"", whatever), a thinking being made of silicon dioxide wafers can also have. 

robots are not necessarily ""soulless"" unless we are. (and i would argue that there is not a shred of evidence for the existence of a soul.)

most of your reluctance to avoid leaps of wishful thinking regarding the human consciousness and experience seems to be grounded in a misplaced fear of being ""controlled"", of being a ""robot"". this is misplaced. it's nonsense to be afraid of your brain controlling you. you don't *have* a brain. you *are* a brain.",Whisper,2007-01-31 17:48:46,reddit.com,0,straight: het
