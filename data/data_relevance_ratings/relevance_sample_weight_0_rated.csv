362110,"edit: formatting.  my reviews for the other sets, in case anyone's interested in reading them:  **skull warrior**  personally, the colour scheme of trans-light blue, gunmetal silver, and trans-orange is fantastic. it works especially well in the legs and torso of the skull warrior. the set is also the only truly asymmetrical figure of the summer 2015 wave in terms of appearance, as it evident with his limbs. the swapping of the limb pieces for the legs gives skull warrior a much much rawer appearance and makes it look more like a warrior. i'm not sure why the claws are there since they honestly don't provide much in the way of stability, but i guess they look nice and help to balance out the colours.  the sticker on this figure is actually the only one that doesn't throw me off the look of the set. however, the red band across the top of the chest piece is definitely out of place. the arrangement of the armour on his arms is actually typical of most archers, with the bow hand being less armoured than the draw hand for better accuracy when aiming. yes, this is not a typical bow or archer, since its undead and there is no draw string or arrows, but it's definitely a nice touch. the bow itself is essentially an enlarged version of the protector of jungle's bow. there's also another weapon attached to his back should he run out of studs to fire. however, the articulation of the set is hindered due to the limited movement when holding the bow. the trans-light blue pieces on the bow are the same as those used for the legs of skull scorpio. they function better as bow limbs than as actual limbs, which i thought was funny.  while there is definitely a nice collection of technic pieces, particularly in the bow and torso, the mocing potential of skull warrior is not that impressive. but this is only a minor concern and has no effect on the set's appearance whatsoever. in fact, the skull warrior's appearance is great, in my opinion. the pairing of the colour scheme and archer-like appearance gives skull warrior an excellent standing among bionicle's second generation sets.  definitely one of my favourites, i give skull warrior an 8.5/10.  **skull slicer**  after already acquiring skull basher, i was not surprised to see that skull slicer was actually smaller than my initial prediction. the inclusion of trans-lime green in this set is wonderful, in my opinion. i'm quite fond of the trans-lime, gunmetal silver, and trans-orange colour scheme. as is typical with the new sets, skull slicer makes user of a variety of technic elements for the torso, giving this set a pretty decent mocing potential. however, he has 4 arms, which means that he has 4 ball joints! the mocing potential of this set is much greater than i expected.  i'm no fan of the stickers on these chest pieces. i feel that they detract from the overall image of the moc. i can see the kind of look they were going for with the sticker's design, but it doesn't suit the set's heavily skeletal theme. this brings me onto another point, the limbs. i understand that skeletons are skinny and this is what their limbs would look like, but man, these limbs seem very lazy. the 6 limbs consist of 24 pieces in all (excluding the armour on the upper arms), which gives an average of 4 pieces per limb. this is, in fact, larger than the average for a creation with the standard limbs (excluding armour), which would be only 3.5 pieces.  i'm aware that these figures may not mean much to some of you, but to me they indicate thrown-together limbs that make the moc look skinny instead of skeletal. it's just a bit uninspiring.  the overall look of the moc is, well, a skeleton with 4 arms. it achieves this relatively well, but i think this mainly lends itself to the trans-lime rib cage piece. the use of the armour on the upper arms is a nice touch. i prefer the look of the gunmetal silver hf piece with the claw sticking out of it because it gives skull slicer a much cleaner, intimidating look. i'm not a fan of the other armour piece. it's quite clunky and doesn't suit the theme of the set. one positive i have to point out is the weaponry. i like the look of the grappling claw, which also contains some handy technic elements. the other 3 blades are also quite nice, and i can see them being used on a variety of mocs. the use of the liftarms on the feet for stability is a nice idea, but it unfortunately does not help much in my experience. i often had to have the set lean forward or bend its legs significantly to reduce the risk of it falling over due to its top heaviness.  overall, i'd give skull slicer a 6.5/10.  **skull basher**  he's honestly a lot smaller than i expected, as shown by the comparison with [tysion](http://http://custombionicle.wikia.com/wiki/tysion) in the slideshow above. however, that's not much of a criticism since his size fits the average for the new wave. i really like the inclusion of purple in this sets, which provides people with a lot more mocing options. the large horns and smaller spike pieces will be particularly useful.  i've never really been a fan of the stickers on some pieces, and this guy is no exception. the colours on the sticker itself don't actually match the colour scheme of the set (which is great, by the way). so the sticker's a bit of a distraction more than anything. his weapons are pretty cool. nothing particularly outstanding, but they are nice.  skull basher's overall look is fantastic. you really get the sense that he is some kind of undead minotaur. the use of his horns and the spread of the armour around his body really help to emphasise that feeling, which is something that i honestly wasn't expecting when i began building him.  he's generally quite stable, though the funky mechanism does weigh quite a bit and makes him somewhat top-heavy. since the surface area of the foot piece that actually touches the ground is quite small, he's easily knocked off balance. to counteract this problem i just pose him with his arms forward. speaking of the mechanism, it's quite strange in the way it works. the movement of the arms is fairly irregular, but i do quite like it.  overall, i'd give this guy a 7.5/10.  **skull grinder/kulta**  i'm not exactly sure what he is suppose to be, but i like whatever it is. as with skull basher, the skeletal look really comes through, particularly with the use of those bone pieces that actually look like bones.  the terminator-esque mask is definitely my favourite part of this set. it just looks great. definitely a lot of mocing potential for that piece. he's honestly not *that* different from skull basher in terms of structure. the armour pieces are identical except in colour. however, that is to be expected of sets in the same wave.  regardless, skull grinder is a great figure. in terms of stability he's quite sturdy, though suffers from the same problem as skull basher in that he's top heavy. again, the low surface area of the foot doesn't help here, and the fact that his right side is much heavier due to the weapon also leaves him off balance. in spite of this, he's still relatively easy to pose.  i like his large weapon, though it does strike me as too big. the other weapon also just seems like something added on to give his left hand something to hold, but it looks good. as encountered by others, his gear function is like that of the masters, but suffers due to the weight of his weapon and weakness of the shoulder connection. *but*, i didn't encounter much of a problem with holding his arm up or anything.  overall, i'd give skull grinder a score of 8/10.",0,,

808464,"same struggle here. there's a lot that can be done with 90s looking black plastic music equipment to hide the fact that it looks like, well, what it is, i think. hanging things like cloth, tapestries, something on or around it, small art objects on or near that distract.   cable ties, zip ties. make sure the wires aren't everywhere. i find that with all the music gear in my tiny nyc apartment, being able to see the baseboards around things, and having the cables very well managed, is very important. and having the theme of the room or space not just suddenly stop at the music area. for me, that means having little amps and casio keyboards as decor items.   it's tough. pics?",0,,

639431,"i'm sorry but i cannot limit this to 4 sentences. please don't shake me until the change falls out, or turn all of my possessions upside down.  ---  **in general**, there are 4 types of purebred or greater dragons, and a smattering of lesser dragonkind. no dragonkind creature has advanced intelligence like they do in lotr or d&amp;d - in megalomania they are all beasts who operate on instinct, not quite as sapient as a primate.  **green/rusty copper scaled dragons** are the most populous of all dragon types. they around as large as elephants, with fair wingspans suited for short flight. they possess one gas sack for fire breathing, and of all greater dragons, their fire breathing is second best. their lifespan measures at around one century. they breed in broods of 7-10 eggs, but around 20% of infant dragons perish due to the environment, lack of food, and many other reasons, poaching included. of the greater dragons, their horns, claws, and fangs are the sharpest due to an evolved need for weapons tough enough to kill other dragons.  **red/fire dragons** are the most aggressive of the greater dragonkind, lashing out automatically at anything that isn't a fire dragon. they are similar to green dragons in size. their wings are somewhat weaker due to slightly heavier bodies, and so prolonged flight is out of the question. they evolved to have two gas sacks, allowing for immensely hot fire breath that can be used in quick succession. as such, they evolved scales that are almost completely heat proof. they lay in clutches of around 3-5 eggs, but they suffer higher mortality rates due to poaching. fire dragons lifespans last around 120 years.  **silvery/gold-like/platinum dragons** are the most docile of all dragonkind. they are slightly longer but somewhat thinner than green dragons, and possess wings suitable for marathon flight. they are somewhat serpent like with lithe limbs and smooth scales. they can breath fire, but know how to breath the gas out of their sacks in forceful bursts, able to snort high-pressure gas to blow things down instead of burning them. they lay eggs in large clusters - as many as a dozen - but they are the weakest physically both overall and at birth, leading to the highest mortality among greater dragons. these dragons have been observed to engage in basic problem solving, showing the highest degree of intelligence of all dragonkind, greater and lesser. they live the longest at nearly two centuries.  **black dragons** are the most reclusive of the greater dragons, preferring to nest alone or with just their own offspring. they are the largest, heaviest dragons, and as such are totally incapable of all forms of flight - their wings are vestigial. they possess the hardest scales and strongest bodies of all dragonkind, able to brush off nearly any blow with mild annoyance. due to pressure from their skeletons (evolved to support their heavy weight) and their muscles, their gas sacks don't work right. instead, a toxic mucus is produced, which is spat in massive loogies that function similarly to acid. like fire breathing, they can only due it so often in a day. they only lay eggs in singles or pairs, but are the most protective, and as such black dragon hatchlings have never been observed in the wild. they have the shortest lifespans at around 80 or so years.  - **drakes** are lesser dragons, unable to fly due to their vestigial wings. they are easily mistaken for fire dragons, an evolutionary trick on their part to capitalize on their cousin's success. breathing fire as wantonly as they do makes one think there is no difference. they are in fact ~~much smaller with~~ thinner and less muscular with weaker scales. drakes breed rapidly, and are the most poached of all dragonkind. this is the only lesser dragon to be the same size as greater dragons.  **wyverns** are lesser dragons with large wings in lieu of arms, but tie with silvery dragons as the best fliers. wyverns are fairly small amongst all dragons. they cannot breathe fire, as they lack gas sacks. they are shown to be solitary, breeding only in small 'valors' and foraging together rather than as larger groups.  **wyrms** are serpentine dragons with no wings, known for harassing beaches, shorelines, and shallows. they are roughly hippo sized. their scales are grayish in color, and rather sleek and aerodynamic. they lack a fire breathe, but are by far the most athletic and energetic of dragonkind. they have the highest sprinting speed of all dragons by a wide margin.  it is said at one point there was **a violent blue-scaled dragon** that roamed fogel for some years. it is said to be the size of a tiger, bear a 10 foot prehensile tail with a spear tip, and be an exceptionally good climber and swimmer. rumors say this monster *breathed lightning* onto its prey. this beast was only rumored in fogel, and only during a 30 year period, so it is thought to be nothing more than a local legend.",0,,

161068,"there's a lot of stigma and even hatred toward fat people, and i think it's even worse for women, considering the amount of value placed on women's appearance.  i hear negative comments about fat women all the time (almost on a daily basis since i've started using reddit, but i've also heard it in my personal life too)---a woman being""fat"" is one of the most common turn-offs that i hear from men. i hear men saying that their girlfriend/wife gained weight and they're no longer attracted to her. i've seen men write ""no fatties"" on their profiles on dating sites. fat women are often the butt of jokes. i've even heard a number of men who were attracted to an overweight woman express reluctance to date her because they were worried about what their friends/family would think/say.   so, it's pretty obvious that being fat is unattractive to most people.   however, i think the issue arises with the question: what is considered fat?   in my experience, many women have a skewed perception of what ""fat"" is.   the topic of weight/dieting/exercise comes up quite often among women. it is something that many women worry about. i mean, i can't speak for all women, but its something that comes up in every group of women i interact with on a regular basis (friends, coworkers, family, etc.).   growing up, my mom would often talk about how she needed to lose weight (she's 5'2"", 120 lbs) and was on some diet or another. my sister had an eating disorder; she would call me fat, and when i would say, ""no, you're fat!"" (i was like 12), she would force me to stand on the scale and then she would to prove to me who the fat one was.   my friends don't talk about weight too much, but comments like, ""ugh, i feel so fat"", or ""do i look rolly-polly in this?"" before we go out on the town, etc. are said from time to time.  my coworkers are the worst though. i work in a predominately female profession (nursing) and something to do with weight comes up almost every shift. ""ugh, i haven't been to the gym in two weeks!"" ""i've been eating so badly lately"", ""wow, you look like you've lost weight! what are you *doing*?"" ""your lunch looks so healthy, you're so good!"" ""ugh, my scrubs are too tight, i'm getting fat.""   the thing is, the vast majority of these women are slim to average sized women. i rarely hear overweight/obese women complain about their weight (i'm not saying that there aren't some who do, but i think a lot of fat women don't like making comments about weight because they don't want to draw attention to their weight).   for some slim women, its probably just a worry that they could get fat (rather than actually seeing themselves as fat), but i think for a lot of other slim women, its that they set a very high standard for what they consider the optimal body for themselves. they may just have the tiniest pot-belly and feel like because of that, they're fat and need to lose weight. sometimes its that they're a great weight, but they could tone up a little---but they still see themselves as fat. it's quite strange for me to hear these comments because i spent most of my life being actually overweight/obese, and these women have the type of body that i would dream of having myself.   i think, obviously, the media plays a very large role in what we view as attractive/ideal. the images affect both men and women's perceptions, and that leads to women having unrealistic expectations for themselves, and men having unrealistic expectations for women (which we're aware of). it's not just that women in the media are thin, but they're often portrayed as even thinner than they actually are (photoshop).   i think that many women also use ""numbers"" to assess their bodies, which also can negatively affect a woman's view of herself. i've heard many women express wanting to be a certain weight (without much regard to their height) or wanting to be a certain size (some women will never be a size 2 or 4, simply because of their body type, but they see that size as ideal).   i read a study awhile back (the only source i found was on [fox news](http://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/04/06/women-trade-1-year-life/))... it's not the best study because it was a small sample size and the average age was 25, but here are a few of the findings:  &gt;the survey found that 16 percent of young women queried said they'd trade a year of life for their ideal body weight and shape. ten percent were willing to trade two to five years, and 2 percent were willing to trade up to 10 years of life away. one percent said they would give up 21 years or more.  &gt;the majority of the women surveyed were dissatisfied with how they looked, the researchers found. although 78 percent of the women sampled were normal weight â€” or even underweight â€” 79 percent of the survey group said they wanted to lose weight. only 3 percent said they'd like to gain weight.  &gt;negative thoughts about body image were almost universal: 93 percent of the women said they had negative thoughts about their appearance within the last week. almost one-third had those thoughts several times a day. almost half of all women surveyed said these pressures weren't entirely internal: 46 percent had experienced ridicule or bullying because of their appearance.  &gt;many women were also willing to make other sacrifices for the ideal body, the researchers found. about 13 percent said they'd give up $8,138 a year in salary in return for their perfect body. eight percent would give up a promotion at work, and 6 percent would give up earning a degree with honors. nine percent were willing to give up time with friends and partners, while 7 percent said they'd trade in time with their family. another 7 percent said they would sacrifice health to reach their ideal weight.  sorry for the long post, but yeah, women feel a lot of pressure to be thin.",1,-1,1

816844,"i grew up as a thin girl. i am 5'5"" tall and have a very slight frame. i ran track&amp;field as a 1 and 2 mile distance runner through high school. i was vegetarian and then vegan plus straight edge into adulthood.  when i turned 20 i got a boyfriend and moved to las vegas. he drove me around a lot and since he wasn't vegan eating out was difficult. in a year i switched from a vegan diet to a vegetarian one. i remember my first cheese pizza and how i felt bloated, fat, greasy after eating 2 bites. after 2 years i was a size 18 or 20. my diet was horrible. as a vegan i could eat damn near anything, so long as it was vegan, and almost all my food was made from scratch. i could eat 10 pounds of tofu all day long but eating 1 size small pizza with cheese/toppings for dinner isn't something normal people should/could do! (get a cheeseless pizza and while still unhealthy it makes a huge difference)  at work i got written up for being slovenly or out of dresscode. i went to the mall where i overheard younger girls talking about me. one of my bigger problems with the weight gain is that i was also busty. i don't know how big because when i got measured for bras i was told that i was a 36d or even maybe a dd since the places i went to didn't carry my actual size. (i was measured when i dropped to 140 pounds and i showed up there as a 34g or a 34h! i can only imagine what kind of crazy bra size i was when i was pushing 200lbs)   because of my chest i had to buy clothing at layne bryant or i bought size xxl in dresses. i mainly looked like i was wearing a tent. i found myself scouring thrift stores for 50s vintage dresses but shopping for my body was super hard. i always showered and wore perfumes, still do, and paid attention to my hair however the feedback i got at work was that i was ""unprofessional"" in reviews. that i dressed poorly even in my business business attire. i had a limited wardrobe and i was young. it felt like i could never find anything that didn't scream frumpy fat girl in shops. i wore size xl in men's shirts because of my chest. i couldn't even find conventional women's dress shirts that buttoned for me in any size. i didn't have typical ""fat girl"" proportions.   once i went to lunch with friends and one girl was a size 00 and one guy was of average build. my partner at the time was obsessed with skinny girls who were size 00. i made a typical remark of a fat girl, ""i wish that i was thinner."" the girl said, ""you're not fat! i'd call you curvy."" a lot of people told me i was curvy. that's just a polite way to tell a girl she's fat which made me really hate my body. i never hated my body before and actually was really strong about not giving in to weight related pressure until the business world, dating world and 2000-era of hipsters in tight clothing world came to the forefront of my life.  in 2005 i began to diet and focus on weight loss. i had to get weighed for a job and i was scared (early 2005~) and clocked in on the scale at just over 200 pounds. i'd never been that fat in my entire life. i wanted to die. no one believes me now when i tell them i weighed this much.  [this is my before and after photograph](http://i.imgur.com/3x97m.jpg)  i became weight obsessed for 2005 all the way through 2006. i counted calories, fat, carbs you name it. i looked at thinspration! i measured my worth in what size pants i could get into at x-deadline. i took weight loss pills. i began to work out 5 days a week for 3 hours. i went from a size 12 that summer 2005 to a size 2 that fall of 2006.   i had been dieting through my preparations to also have a breast reduction. yep, took weight loss pills all through the process of having major surgery. when i was losing weight i couldn't get my chest to go away and i still felt fat. while i have no regrets about the surgery (i was a 32h still at the time of surgery) i made the choice to do it when i was at my high weight of 200 pounds. in the 2nd photo i had just bought size 2 jeans and my chest was ~32d still healing from surgery.  [this is my infamous photo](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/139/325765552_d3c594837b.jpg)  on christmas eve of 2006 i weighed in at 95 pounds. i am 5'5"" tall in this photo and wearing size 00 or 25 seven for all mankind jeans in it. friends, female, commented i ""got too thin"" but men overall have commented, ""damn gurllll, you fine!!!"" or that i am perfection. i am the ideal woman. i got so much attention as i lost weight.  chubby girls post-op begged for my weight loss secret and commented in envy they wished they could surgery to ""look thinner like me"" which for me was 7 pounds removed from my boobs. after surgery i worked out more intensely and ate even less. i became size obsessed because i got so much attention. men began to smile at me everywhere i went from work to the bus stop to local shows. people wanted to be my friend suddenly. dudes flirted with me (i was single) and girls at the mall commented that i was ""so cute!""  [i weigh around 105 pounds here](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/120/291299750_42cb6542fe_o.jpg)  this is about how my body looks right now and has for years. the male attention i get on my body alone is mind blowing. i'm 35 years old and never in my life before have i had so many body comments....  there are girls and guys who have met me and assume i was always this thin. most of the girls who are heavier than me make comments that range from ""eat a fucking sandwich"" to ""i was your size when i was eight"" to ""i fucking hate you."" (about clothing that fits me or how i am dressed because i looked good in everything/etc) a lot of overweight girls have iced me out in my peer circle. a lot of men i've dated focus on my body first. they feel totally fine making body evaluations.  one guy said if i gained 20 pounds he would consider me to be ""too fat"" and thus unattractive. i gained ~5 or so pounds while we dated and was freaking out about the weight. i remember him making me stand on a scale on morning, he was weight obsessed himself, and the number being 115 pounds. i was afraid he was going to tell me i was no longer attractive since we met when i was ~105 pounds. i was really close to his threshhold.  this is how it feels to be even a former fat girl.",1,-1,2

741142,"awh thank you!  right so iâ€™m gonna ramble a lot because i like talking about this and find it interesting so feel free to skip to the end if you just want the exercise tips ðŸ˜„  ok so the â€˜tonedâ€™ look that we often see on celebrities is a combination of both low body fat percentage, and a decent base of muscle mass.   everyoneâ€™s body is different, so itâ€™s absolutely true that genetics will play a part to some degree. in terms of the arms above, there are several things at play that all come together to get these arms.   firstly, people with stockier builds, and thicker bones relative to their height, will have a harder time getting arms like this, while people with lighter, longer bones relative to their height, will find it easier. this is because muscle doesnâ€™t develop visually in exactly the same way on every body, as some people have longer â€˜muscle belliesâ€™ (this is the name of the shape and length of muscles, determined by where the muscle attaches at each end), some peopleâ€™s muscle bellies will look longer and leaner, whereas other peoples will look deeper and rounder.   for example, someone else here has commented ballet as a way to get these types of arms, and while itâ€™s true that some people may develop these arms just from ballet, the main reason why we would associate ballet dancers with people who have this body type is that many ballet dancers already have the genetics that fit the ballet aesthetic (light bones, long muscle bellies), so when they build muscle, theyâ€™re building it in a way which enhances the traditional â€˜ballet physiqueâ€™.   similarly, if you look at the difference between long distance runners and sprinters, long distance runners tend to be lighter, smaller, more wirey, while sprinters tend to be larger, muscular, more powerfully built. would we say that they became this way because of the sport they chose? or would we say that the people who tend to excel at these sports (and therefore serve as our visual representatives), already have the genetics and body types considered beneficial to excelling? most of the time, the answer is a bit of both.   we canâ€™t change our genetics, the length of our muscle bellies, or our bone structure. but we do have control over how much more muscle we grow, which muscles we chose to develop, and how much fat covers these muscles. the reason iâ€™m mentioning this is because itâ€™s easy to get frustrated thinking â€˜well iâ€™m doing the same sport/exercises as x person and i still donâ€™t look like them!â€™ thatâ€™s because the results you want need to be tailored to your specific body type, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.   for example, iâ€™ve already stated that in order for my arms to look as lean as the girls above, iâ€™ve had to get down to 19.5 bmi, but for you it may be 21 or 22 bmi, or 18.5, it really depends on your individual fat storage. youâ€™ll know when youâ€™re low enough, because youâ€™ll start to see the outline and separation of the muscle, and everything will start to feel firmer.   but losing weight by itself will just give you skinny arms, without the â€˜humpsâ€™, so you need to make sure that youâ€™re targeting the muscles that your specific body type will benefit from (for example my shoulders are less developed than my biceps and triceps, so i focus on shoulder specific exercises a lot).  if you donâ€™t want to overcomplicate things, most people will benefit from general upper body lifting, compound exercises, lifting heavy. find a 2 or 3 day programme and stick to it consistently. this will be perfect for the first year at least. then when youâ€™ve built a good base, youâ€™ll see which areas need work and you can add in specific exercises which focus on each area you want to develop. honestly i would say the best thing i ever did was invest in a personal trainer, someone to keep you focused and to help show you how to do the exercises correctly and with good form! if you canâ€™t afford a trainer then go with a friend who knows what theyâ€™re doing, and if you donâ€™t have a friend who lifts then make sure you spend a few hours researching on youtube the correct form for each exercise, you donâ€™t want to waste energy doing it wrong. also - lift heavy! (you can lift heavier than you think, you should be really struggling to push out the last few reps for each set). and try to increase the weights you use every 1 to 3 weeks, this is called progressive overload and this is what will drive muscle growth. eat enough protein (1g per pound of body weight is a good amount to aim for). i hope this helps!! please ask more questions if thereâ€™s anything i havenâ€™t explained properly, and apologies if iâ€™m stating things you already know or are already doing! ðŸ’ª",1,0,0

573720,"send petition to singapore government too as its hypocritcal stand should also be condemned. it is providing the life line to the burmese military leaders and big-time drug lords while hanging the small time drug runners. it has blood on its hands.  http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/web-of-cash-power-and-cronies/2007/09/28/1190486569946.html?page=fullpage  web of cash, power and cronies  eric ellis september 29, 2007  singapore isn't just skilled at mandatory executions of drug traffickers, running an excellent airport and selling cameras on orchard road. it also does a useful trade keeping burma's military rulers and their cronies afloat.  much attention is placed on china and its coming hosting of the olympic games as a diplomatic pressure point on the rampant burmese junta. but there is a group of government businessmen-technocrats in singapore who will also be closely monitoring the brutality in rangoon. and, were they so inclined, their influence could go a long way to limiting the misery being inflicted on burma's 54 million people.  collectively known as ""singapore inc"", they gather around the $a150 billion state-owned investment house temasek holdings, controlled by a member of the ruling lee family.  with an estimated $a3 billion staked in the country (and a more than $20 billion stake in australia), singapore inc companies have been some of the biggest investors in and supporters of burma's military junta â€” this while its government, on the rare times it is asked, suggests a softly-softly diplomatic approach towards the junta.  when it comes to burma, singapore pockets the high morals it likes to wave at the west elsewhere. singapore's one-time head of foreign trade once said as his country was building links with burma in the mid-1990s: ""while the other countries are ignoring it, it's a good time for us to go in â€¦ you get better deals, and you're more appreciated â€¦ singapore's position is not to judge them and take a judgemental moral high ground.""  but by providing burma's pariah junta with the crucial equipment mostly denied by western sanctions, singapore has helped keep the junta and its cronies afloat for 20 years, since the last time the generals killed the citizens they are supposed to protect.  withdraw that financial support and burma's junta would be substantially weakened, perhaps even fail. but after two decades of profitable business with the trigger-happy generals and their cronies, that's about the last thing singapore is likely to do. there's too much money to be made.  hotels, airlines, military materiel and training, crowd control equipment and sophisticated telecoms-monitoring devices for its secret police â€” singapore is manager and supplier to the junta, and the ""cronified"" economy it controls.  it's impossible to spend any time in burma and not make the junta richer, thanks to singapore suppliers' contracts with the tourism industry. singapore's hospitals also keep burma's leaders alive â€” 74-year-old junta leader than shwe has been getting his intestinal cancer treated in a singapore government hospital, protected by singapore security. singapore's boutiques keep junta wives and families cloaked in armani, and its banks help launder their money and that of burma's crony drug lords.  much of singapore's activity in burma has been documented by an analyst working in prime minister john howard's direct chain of command, in the office of national assessments. andrew selth is recognised as an authority on the burmese military. now a research fellow at queensland's griffith university, mr selth has written extensively on how close singapore is to the junta.  often writing as ""william ashton"" in the authoritative jane's intelligence review, mr selth has described in various articles how singapore has sent the junta guns, rockets, armoured personnel carriers and grenade launchers, some of it trans-shipped from stocks seized by israel from palestinians in southern lebanon.  singaporean companies have provided computers and networking equipment for burma's defence ministry and army, while upgrading the bunkered junta's ability to network with regional commanders â€” so crucial as protesting monks take to the streets of 20 burmese cities, causing major logistical headaches for the tatmadaw, the burmese military.  ""singapore cares little about human rights, in particular the plight of the ethnic and religious minorities in burma,"" mr selth writes.  ""having developed one of the region's most advanced armed forces and defence industrial support bases, singapore is in a good position to offer burma a number of inducements which other asean (association of south-east asian nations) countries would find hard to match.""  singapore's foreign minister, george yeo, is the current chairman of asean.  mr selth says singapore also provided the equipment for a ""cyber war centre"" to monitor dissident activity while training burma's secret police, whose sole job seems to be ensuring pro-democracy groups are crushed.  monitoring dissidents is an area where singapore has particular expertise. after almost five decades in power, the lee family-controlled people's action party ranks behind only the communists of china, cuba and north korea in leadership longevity, skilled in neutralising opposition.  ""this centre is reported to be closely involved in the monitoring and recording of foreign and domestic telecommunications, including the satellite telephone conversations of burmese opposition groups,"" mr selth writes.  singapore government companies, such as leading arms supplier singapore technologies, dominate the communications and military sector in singapore. ""it is highly unlikely,"" mr selth writes, ""that any of these arms shipments to burma could have been made without the knowledge and support of the singapore government.""  he notes that singapore's ambassadors to burma have included a former senior singapore armed forces officer, and a past director of singapore's defence-oriented joint intelligence directorate, people with a military background rather than professional diplomats.  he writes that after the 1988 crackdown, when the junta killed 3000 protesters, ""the first country to come to the regime's rescue was in fact singapore"".  when i interviewed singapore technologies chief executive peter seah at his office in singapore, i asked about the scale model of an armoured personnel carrier made by his company on his office table. he said st sold the vehicles ""only to allies"".  does that include burma, i asked, given that singapore controversially helped sponsor the military regime into asean?  mr seah was non-specific: ""we only sell to allies and we make sure they are responsible."" he didn't say how. st and temasek don't respond to questions about their activities in burma.  singapore is so close to burma that one of its diplomats there wrote a handbook for its business people there. matthew sim's myanmar on my mind is full of useful tips for singaporean business people in burma. ""a little money goes a long way in greasing the wheels of productivity,"" he writes.  a chapter headed ""committing manslaughter when driving"" describes the appropriate action if a singaporean businessman accidentally kills a burmese pedestrian. ""firstly, the international businessman could give the family of the deceased some money as compensation and dissuade them from pressing charges. secondly, he could pay a myanmar citizen to take the blame by declaring that he was the driver in the fatal accident. an international businessman should not make the mistake of trying to argue his case in a court of law when it comes to a fatal accident, even if he is in the right.""  mr sim says many successful myanmar businessmen have opened shell companies in singapore ""with little or no staff, used to keep funds overseas"". the companies are used to keep business deals outside the control of burma's central bank, enabling singaporeans and others to transact with burma in singapore.  he may be referring to junta cronies such as tay za and the drug lord lo hsing han. lo is an ethnic chinese, from burma's traditionally chinese-populated and opium-rich kokang region in the country's east, bordering china. he controls a massive heroin empire, and one of burma's biggest companies, asia world, which the us drug enforcement agency describes as a front for his drug-trafficking. asia world controls toll roads, industrial parks and trading companies. singapore is the lo family's crucial window to the world, as it controls a number of companies there. his son steven, who has been denied a visa to the us because of his links to the drug trade, married a singaporean, cecilia ng, and the two reportedly control singapore-based trading house kokang singapore.  a former assistant secretary of state for the us bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, robert gelbard, has said that half singapore's investment in burma has ""been tied to the family of narco-trafficker lo hsing han"".  eric ellis is an australian journalist and correspondent in south-east asia.  ============================================ "" ...'the videos and photographs of what is happening on the streets of yangon and other cities in myanmar have evoked the revulsion of the people throughout south-east asia and all over the world,' (singapore prime minister lee) said, noting that the junta's actions had implications not just for the country, but also asean and the region.""  singapore daily, straits times, 1 oct 2007  link:  http://www.straitstimes.com/free/story/stistory_162941.html",0,,

370115,"for those who may get a log in here is the whole shebang: starting in may, articles will be reorganized under four broad, new sections â€” one each for short takes, columnists and commentary, long reporting pieces like the cover articles, and culture â€” each with less compulsion to touch on the weekâ€™s biggest events. a new graphic feature on the last page, â€œthe blufferâ€™s guide,â€ will tell readers how to sound as if they are knowledgeable on a current topic, whether they are or not.  newsweek plans makeover to fit a smaller audience  by richard pÃ©rez-peÃ±a when us airways flight 1549 glided safely onto the hudson river last month, newsweek did what news organizations have done for more than a century â€” it sent reporters and photographers to the scene. considerable effort yielded a modest article on newsweekâ€™s web site, and nothing in the printed magazine. if a similar episode happens six months from now, editors say, newsweek probably will not even bother. newsweek is about to begin a major change in its identity, with a new design, a much smaller and, it hopes, more affluent readership, and some shifts in content. the venerable newsweeklyâ€™s ingrained role of obligatory coverage of the weekâ€™s big events will be abandoned once and for all, executives say. â€œthereâ€™s a phrase in the culture, â€˜we need to take note of,â€™ â€˜we need to weigh in on,â€™ â€ said newsweekâ€™s editor, jon meacham. â€œthatâ€™s going away. if we donâ€™t have something original to say, we wonâ€™t. the drill of chasing the weekâ€™s news to add a couple of hard-fought new details is not sustainable.â€ newsweek loses money, and the consensus within its parent, the washington post company, and among industry analysts, is that it has to try something big. the magazine is betting that the answer lies in changing both itself and its audience, and getting the audience to pay more. a deep-rooted part of the newsweekly culture has been to serve a mass audience, but that market has been shrinking, and new subscribers come at a high price in call centers, advertising and deeply discounted subscriptions. â€œmass for us is a business that doesnâ€™t work,â€ said tom ascheim, newsweekâ€™s chief executive. â€œwish it did, but it doesnâ€™t. we did it for a long time, successfully, but we canâ€™t anymore.â€ thirteen months ago, newsweek lowered its rate base, the circulation promised to advertisers, to 2.6 million from 3.1 million, and mr. ascheim said that would drop to 1.9 million in july, and to 1.5 million next january.  he says the magazine has a core of 1.2 million subscribers who are its best-educated, most avid consumers of news, and who have higher incomes than the average reader. â€œwe would like to build our business around these people and grow that group slightly,â€ he said. â€œthese are our best customers. they are our best renewers, and they pay the most.â€ in the first half of 2008, the average newsweek subscriber paid less than $25 a year, or 47 cents for each copy â€” less than one-tenth the $4.95 newsstand price. newsweek wants to raise that average to $50 a year, mr. ascheim said, adding, â€œif you canâ€™t get people to pay for what they love, weâ€™re all out of business.â€ from their invention, newsweeklies have been under assault by quicker media, forcing them to ease away from the â€œwhat,â€ toward the â€œhowâ€ and â€œwhy,â€ and more recently, to â€œhereâ€™s what to do about it.â€ for decades, the magazines evolved quickly enough to keep huge readership and healthy profits. but in the last couple of years, circulation and advertising have plunged, and the weeklies have cut news staffs. time magazine, the nationâ€™s first and largest newsweekly, remains profitable, though its sales are down, too, but newsweek is struggling and u.s. news &amp; world report has become a monthly. editorially, newsweekâ€™s plan calls for moving in the direction it was already headed â€” toward not just analysis and commentary, but an opinionated, prescriptive or offbeat take on events.  the current cover article argues that americaâ€™s involvement in afghanistan parallels the vietnam war, and a companion piece offers a plan for handling that country. newsweek also plans to lean even more heavily on the appeal of big-name writers like christopher hitchens, fareed zakaria and george will. starting in may, articles will be reorganized under four broad, new sections â€” one each for short takes, columnists and commentary, long reporting pieces like the cover articles, and culture â€” each with less compulsion to touch on the weekâ€™s biggest events. a new graphic feature on the last page, â€œthe blufferâ€™s guide,â€ will tell readers how to sound as if they are knowledgeable on a current topic, whether they are or not. the magazine will replace its thin paper with heavier stock that is more appealing to advertisers and readers. it will also put more emphasis on photography. pages of a mock issue that mr. meacham displayed in his office on west 57th street in manhattan show a cleaner, less cluttered layout that has more open space and fewer pages that seem an uninterrupted sea of words. the plan turns on raising the amount, for each reader, that newsweek can charge advertisers, and attracting more ads for luxury goods. it also promises sharply lower costs for printing, distribution, marketing and customer service. newsweek executives hope they are creating a new niche, but the magazine will not have the terrain to itself. to varying degrees, it will be plying turf already worked by the economist, the new yorker, the atlantic and others. ad buyers to whom newsweek gave a partial preview of its transformation said the magazine had to try something new, and that ordinarily, they would consider its plans promising. but most advertisers are cutting back, making any change more of a risk. â€œitâ€™s no secret that thereâ€™s just less money out there, so even if readers react very positively to the changes, itâ€™s a difficult time,â€ said scott kruse, director for print investments at mediacom us. â€œthe core categories in the newsweeklies have been automotive, financial, tech and pharmaceutical, and all of those are underdelivering in a major way right now. so theyâ€™re going to have to bring in new advertisers from new categories, and i just wonder where all those ads are going to come from.â€ roberta garfinkle, senior vice president and director for print strategy at targetcast tcm, who also got a glimpse of the new newsweek, said, â€œi give anybody credit in this difficult environment for saying, â€˜what weâ€™re doing doesnâ€™t work anymore and we have to change our model.â€™ â€ â€œdo i think theyâ€™re on the right track? probably, and theyâ€™re certainly on a better track than they were,â€ she said. â€œwill it work? we have to wait and see.â€",0,,

912819,"my parents owned a ranch in my youth. often time travelers would drop by and ask to spend the night and in return they'd help out with chores around the ranch. it was a kind of rest and relaxation center for burnt out time travelers who needed some peace and quiet.  i loved living on the ranch, there was always something to do, what with all the animals and crops. the real reason i loved it were the travelers though. the time travelers were a curious bunch. at first glance most of them looked no diffrent than anyone else, just a stranger passing by. most of them had a little peculiar sense of fashion, perhaps, no doubt classy in some other time or place, but all in all, they were just people.  there were a few regulars that would come in from time to time. then again, ""regulars"" is a strange term for a time traveler. sometimes they were old, sometimes young. sometimes they had never seen me before, even though i knew them well. sometimes they had lost a limb in a great battle, sometimes they had amazing technology that i don't doubt won't be invented for centuries. the one thing they always had was a good story.  one day a man i'd never seen before came walking down the road in the middle of the day, the flare of a cigarette sticking out from underneath the shadow of his large hat. sweat is dripping down my face, making my shirt stick to my back, but i wave and great the man gladly.  ""looking for a place to stay, friend?"" he takes a long drag from his cigarette and nods slowly. not a talker then, that's hardly anything new around here.  ""my folk are inside, they'll take care of you."" something about him piqued my interest, even more than the other travelers. he was wearing a thin, gray tunic and plain, gray linen pants. i always made a game of it, whenever a new traveler showed up. ""when did he come from?"" i called it, but this one... this one was hard to place.  the mysterious man ended up staying for a couple of weeks. he helped around the ranch, but he always took to himself, never saying a word to anyone. i would watch him whenever i could, watch as he worked, as he ate, as he drank, trying to figure out who this walking riddle, this great mystery was. sometimes he would catch me looking at him and i'd see a hint of a smile from the shadow underneath that hat, the hat that he always wore.  the last night, the night before he was going to leave, he beckoned me over. it was late at night in the bar. it was a big room, more like a tavern than anything, but sometimes it would come in handy when it got crowded. time travelers were never much for booking ahead.  tonight, it was almost empty though. i was sitting in one corner, sipping on a drink i had nicked from the kitchens, staring at the myterious man, the ember of his cigarette illuminating his rough features. he beckons me over and i glance quickly across the room. i can hear my parents coversing vividly in the other room, no doubt they will be busy for a while, so i scuttle over to his table and take a seat across the table from him.  ""so what do you want to know?"" he has the gruff, raspy voice of someone who has been smoking for a long time.  ""isn't it hard being a smoker when you time travel? what if you go back before they invented cigarettes? what about the future? do they have cigarettes then?"" he chuckles to himself, his raspy voice making it sound more like a cough.  ""i don't smoke.""  ""really? i don't think i've seen you without a cigarette in your mouth the last couple of weeks."" he takes a long drag, blowing elaborate smoke rings into the air before he answers.  ""only when i'm on vacation. if you had seen the things i've seen, you'd need a cigarette too."" i lean forward intently, hanging on his every word.  ""what things, what have you seen?"" he glances over towards the voices coming through the wall.  ""i could show you."" there is an unmistakeable mischievous grin on his lips.  ""show me how?"" my mind is racing with possiblities, an image of the man running around in ancient rome holding a video camera, commenting the scenery as he goes, like a wildlife photographer.  ""i could take you."" i lick my lips nervously, i don't think my parents would approve of me taking of through time with a stranger, but i'm only 16, i've got to get a chance to live my own life. i take a large gulp of liquid courage from my half empty cup.  ""alright, when?""  ~  five minutes later, i'm outside, a backpack with supplies slung over one shoulder, ready to go. i thought about saying goodbye to my parents, i had no idea where i was going or when i'd be back, but in the end i decided against it, i didn't want to risk them trying to stop me. besides, the man told me ""i'd be back before i left"" with a grin.  ""you ready, kid?""  ""i'm ready.""  ""hold on tight, then."" he stretches out one of his arms for me to hold. he reaches into his pocket and pulls out an old pocket watch. the watch seems to have more arms and knobs than it should, but it hardly looks like anything advanced. he begins twisting and turning the knobs, pressing one here and another there.  ""there."" i was just about to ask what he meant by that, nothing had happened, but then i noticed the world around me had changed. i was so focused on the watch i hadn't even noticed we were suddenly in the middle of a busy street. it wasn't so much a street as a dirt road, filled to bursting with people and horses, lined with wooden hovels and stands selling wares.  ""fresh fish! only two silvers!""  ""serve all your fur needs here!"" the cries of the salesmen mix with the chatter of the hundreds of tightly packed people milling about, paying no more mind to us than anyone else. the man in the hat makes his way through the crowd with determined steps, dragging me behind him. we squeeze our way out of the crowd into a smaller, less crowded street.  ""where are we? *when* are we?"" i ask, looking around at the shoddy stone and wood buildings.   ""tamworth, 648. now hurry up, we don't have much time."" he drags me along, keeping a steady pace. he seems to know where he's going, so i can only assume he's been here before. but why? why tamworth? i don't even know where that is. why 648? i was never very good at history, but we seem to be in a time of knights in shining armor, damsels in distress, that kind of thing. it looked dirtier and a lot less impressive than in the stories.  ""halt!"" two halberds, glinting deadly in the sun block our way.  ""i want to speak to the king. it's important."" the guard on the left grins stupidly back at the man in the hat.  ""and i want to fuck the queen, but that ain't gonna happen either, is it?"" the other, thicker man on the right guffaws, almost dropping his halberd.  ""your name is donald, you grew up on a farm not far from here. you never wanted the military life, you were supposed to be a fisherman, like your father, but things changed when your mother died. you had a falling our with your father and ended up answering a call to arms, just to get away from it all. now will you please let me enter, i must see the king."" the guard on the right stopped laughing a long time ago. he was pale as a sheet when the mysterious man finished and simply nodded, leading us up towards the stone castle situated on a hill above us.  ~  ""why should i listen to this blabbering fool?"" the man sitting on an ornate throne at the end of the room spit the words out as if he's insulted by our very presence. he's a young man, twentyfive perhaps, lean and muscular. he has a wicked sneer on his face, the sneer of a man who has killed someone for interuppting his nap before and would do it again.  ""there's a man who wants to kill you.""  ""a man wants to kill me?"" the man on the throne lets out a shriek of laughter, as if it was the funniest thing he'd ever heard.  ""i am penda, king of mercia. every east angle and bernician in the world wants to see my head on a spike.""  ""you don't understand. there's a man in the castle that's been sent to kill you. the moment we leave this room is when he will strike. if you don't keep your guards in here, he will kill you.""  ""who are you? why should i trust you?""  ""i am a prophet, a messenger from god. i see visions of the past and future in my dreams. i know what you ate last night. what your plans for the war against the east angles are. when you will die.""  ""and the child? who is he?"" i was so caught up in the act, in the charade the man in the hat was playing that i had forgotten about myself. why was i here?  ""he is noone. just a boy."" the wicked sneer returns to the face of the king.  ""ah, just a boy... you won't mind if i kill him, then?"" he flashes the blade of a golden knife, slashing the air suggestively with it.  ""no!!"" i'm surprised at the desperation in his voice, after all, we hardly know each other.  ""he's my son.""  ~  they caught the would-be killer and as a sign of gratitude we were allowed to keep our heads. we were also given chambers in the castle to sleep in, just like that the mysterious man was the king's advisor. that night when we were lying in bed my head was swimming with questions. why are we here? how does he know all these things about the people here? why did he decide to bring me along? who is he, anyway?  ""are you awake?"" a tired grunt answers me from the darkness.  ""i'll take that as a yes."" he grunts again. after a long and awkward silence i ask the question i had wanted to ask most of all for the last few hours.  ""is it true? am i your son?""  ""no... your parents are home at the ranch."" it had only been a few hours, but i had already forgotten about them. it felt like a life time ago that i left the ranch, so much had happened since.  ""who are you then? i don't even know your name."" there's a long silence and just when i had given up hope that he would answer me, he finally does.  ""sam. my name is sam.""  ~  it turns out time travel was nowhere near as exciting as i thought it would be. over the next couple of weeks the novelty of life in the middle ages starts to wear off and i realise it's not much diffrent from my own time. sam spends his days whispering secrets in the ears of the king and meanwhile i'm left all alone to wander the castle. maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if i had anyone to talk to, but the guards and nobles wandering the castle, even the servants working in the kitchen refused to talk to me. they saw this strange boy with his strange clothes come from nowhere, following the nameless prophet. whenever i get close they shy away and as soon as i turn my back they whisper and point.  sam was even more of a disappointment. i thought maybe he took me with him to teach me, to help me become a time traveler myself, but he was just as reserved as always. he spent most of his time at the king's side, but whenever he had time for me, he would sit in silence, creating more questions than he answered. who are you? who was the man who tried to kill the king? how do you know everything about this place? why won't you help me, talk to me? one night when we were sharing a silent meal i had decided i had finally had enough.  ""what are we doing here?"" sam pauses for a moment, then continues scraping up the last bits of soup from his bowl with a piece of bread.  ""you can travel to any point in time you want, yet you manage to land yourself in the biggest cesspool of wasted time the world has ever known. if you expect me to stay, you've got to give me some answers!"" i slam my fist in the table, trying to emphazie that i mean what i'm saying.  ""look, kid, what you've got to understand about time is this. just because you can travel through it doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with it. there are rules, things that need to be done and things that can't be done. now please, finish your meal. we won't be here much longer.""  ""i'm not a *kid*. either you take me back home or you tell me why i'm here. or i can just walk, try to make a life for myself in this place.""  ""now look, i need your help, just stick around until tomorrow night and it will all make sense."" i point at him accusingly with my spoon.  ""not good enough, not good enough! maybe i'll see you in another life!"" i stride towards the door without looking back.  ""wait!"" i freeze with one hand on the door, waiting in tense silence.  ""you're not my son... i am your son.""  ""i... what? no i don't have a... but...""  ~  i'm hardly any wiser after our little chat, but atleast it convinced me to stay until the next night. my head is swimming with even more questions now. can it really be? can he really be my son? i mean, i don't even have a son, but i suppose it's possible. time travel and all that. does that mean i can't die? what if i go jump off a cliff? will that mean he was never born, so he never appeared at the ranch and never took me to this place? but then i wouldn't have jumped, would i? this is starting to hurt just thinking about.  i'm lying on the back in my chambers, waiting for the night to come when i start hearing strange sounds in the distance. people running and shouting, doors slamming and the unmistakeable sound of steel clashing on steel. a bell can be heard ringing throughout the castle and suddenly the door bursts open.  ""stay here, don't leave this room under any circumstances until i come and get you, alright?"" sam bursts out the door again as quickly as he came. for a moment i'm tempted to run out, to chase after him. a sword fight in a castle, this is the kind of thing i time traveled to see. now that i'm here, the fear of getting stabbed seems much more real, however, so i push a heavy box infront of the door and sit down on the bed, listening to the sounds of battle growing steadily closer.  there's a loud thud as someone tries to open the door. thud, thud, thud. someone is slowly pushing the box away from the door with every tackle until a ragged, wild looking man can squeeze half his face through the opening.  ""what do we have here? aren't you going to let me in, boy? i just want to rape your corpse, that's all."" the man laughs maniacally. i look around desperately for a weapon as the man begins tackling the door again. the best i can find is a thick book i was trying to read earlier, before i found out the weren't much for fiction in this day and age. i grab the heavy book in both hands and position myself behind the door, ready to strike when the man breaks through. with a final thud the man slams into the door, one last time, shoving the box out of the way, letting the door swing open. when the man enters he looks up at me in surprise and before i can hit him with the book, he falls to the ground, blood already starting to pool underneath his body. behind him in the doorway is sam, bloody sword in one hand.  ""let's go.""  ~  sam is pulling me behind him through the dark corridors of the castle while men are fighting all around us. we avoid the fighting as best we can, but sam make quick work of those who bother us, both the castle guards and the others. i get same feeling i got when we first arrived here, that he knows exactly where he's going and this is all part of some grand scheme that i'm not in on.  ""in here!"" he hisses shoving me down a shadowy stonecase, leading down into the dungeons. we make our way past cell after cell, some of the prisoners scream for help, for mercy, for death, while others lie on the floor, unconscious or dead already. finally sam seems to find what he's looking for and stops.  ""listen to me, we don't have much time. i want you to have this."" he fishes his pocketwatch out of his pocket and puts it in my hand, closing it tight with his.  ""but, i can't... won't you need it?""  ""no. the first rule of time travel is you can never interact with yourself, not ever. this one is year, this one is day and this one is place, you'll figure it out."" he indicates the little knobs on the watch. you can never interact with yourself...? i have no idea what that means.  ""in the cell you'll find the man who tried to assassinate the king when we first came here. i want you to take him and get out of here. don't wait, don't think, just do it. go!"" i can hear footsteps coming down the staircase, so i hurry into the cell to find the man on the floor, bruised and bloody, but still alive. i turn him over to get a good look at him and i almost fall over backwards in shock. at first i think it's me, he has the same slender build, the same hair, he even looks at me in a familiar way, but then i notice his eyes. his eyes are green, so he can't be me. i can hear the muffled voices of two men talking to sam outside. don't wait, don't think, just do it.  ""hey, i'm gonna get you out of here, just hold on tight."" i hear steel clashing on steel outside and a sudden cry of pain that is unmistakeably sam's. don't wait, don't think, just do it. i'm twisting the knobs of the watch fervently, trying to remember which one was which. the man at my feet grab my arm weakly and whisper without strenght.  ""thank you... i'm sam."" suddenly the world twists around me, the prison cell turning into a blur, as if i was seeing everything through a foggy pane of glass. a moment later the blur is gone and i'm standing in the middle of a sunlit forest, nothing but trees and grass as far as the eye can see.  ~  we spent the next few weeks together in the forest. i still don't know where or when we were, but it was peace and quiet, which is exactly what sam needed to recover from his wounds. i spent the days hunting and fishing in the woods, the first few days we would go hungry, but i learned quickly, hunger will do that to you.   in the evenings we would sit and talk around the fire. i would tell him about home, about my parents and the ranch and all the amazing stories i had heard from travelers over the years. it turns out he had no idea time travelers existed, but i suppose experiencing it yourself makes it easy to believe. he would tell me off the life he lead, back in the 7th century, his hopes and his dreams, his mother and his father. i neglected to mention that the father he spoke so highly off might be me, i didn't feel worthy of all that praise, i hadn't done anything to deserve it. sometimes i caught him giving me a funny look though, a look that said he knew more than he let on.  our friendship grew with time and soon sam was strong enough to walk. we would fight with sticks for fun and for practice. he had always wanted to be a squire as a child, so he had practiced his sword play since he was just a baby, making me an easy target. it felt like a dream, sometimes, a dream that i would wake up from if i blinked, but i never did. one night, something worse happened. sam decided to tell me what happened, how he ended up in the king's prison.  ""you met the king, didn't you? an evil man."" the campfire sends a flickering light across sam's face, illuminating his enraged frown.  ""he wanted to keep the old gods, the pagan gods, when the land was turning to christianity, one by one. when he heard a small town bordering his own lands changing religion, he decided it was time to do something about it. he came charging down the hills with hundreds of men in full armor."" he spit into the fire making it hiss and crackle.  ""we were farmers, none of us knew how to wield a sword and they butchered us like pigs. burned our houses, raped our women and... they flayed mom and dad, let them hang out for all the world to see. a warning they called it. my father was not even religious."" i try to comfort him, to support him, but the words stick in my throat. all i can think of is my own flayed body hanging at a stake while hundreds of people cheered on as they watched our houses burn.  the next morning, things were back to normal. we both seem to have decided to ignore what happened last night and instead we spent our morning meal, some left over roasted squirrel, discussing our plans for the future.  ""i think i'm strong enough now. i think it's time we leave this place.""  ""where do you want to go?""  ""you know, i've always wondered what the future looks like.""  ~  it almost started to feel like home, the little camp in the forest, but i'll be glad to leave. i am off to explore history with a good friend, what could be better? this is what i wanted when i left the ranch, after all. after studying it carefully i think i've finally figured out how to work the watch, two of the knobs control time, year and day, while the other controlls location, using coordinates like a gps. since neither of us have been to the future before, *where* we end up isn't important. the important part is *when*. january first, 2500, here we come. i spin the knobs to the correct position, click the last one and the world turns to a blur again. a second later the world is back in focus. we both let out an audible gasp at the magnificent vision before us.  ""it looks so... futurey..."" sam mumbles under his breath, looking around at the sprawling city we landed in the middle of. it really did look 'futurey'. all the buildings and the roads around us seemed to be as one, all flowing in to each other, all with the same sleek, minimalistic design in gray and white. the buildings stretch high into the sky above us, looming over us ominously. along the roads vehicles hovered past us at lightning speed, dangerously close to hitting us. the roads seem to be flowing freely through the air between buildings and below us is a dizzying drop. other then various other roads, criss crossing between buildings, i can't even make out the ground from here.  ""i don't think we're supposed to walk here, we'd better find somewhere we can head inside."" a little way down the road i spot a double door with a sign above it reading '7-eleven'. huh, those are still around then. we hobble along the road towards the store, trying to keep as close to the edge as possible without falling off.  we make our way inside the store, barely managing to avoid being run over by those speeding maniacs, and the door lets out a comforting tingle-ling as we enter. atleast this much looks familiar i think to myself, it looks like any old 7-eleven from the 21st century, but sam is looking around at the lottery tickets and the candy bars in awe, as if he had never seen the like before. it might have something to do with the fact that he had never seen the like before.  there's a tingle-ling and a loud rush of air as the door swings open behind us, and i turn around to see one of the hovering vehicles speed through the door, come to an abrupt halt at the entrence and suddenly sprout legs. the bizarre machine begins to fold in on itself, becoming smaller and smaller, until it's gone, leaving only a man standing where the hovercraft was a couple of seconds ago. he ignores our gaping stares and goes through the shelves picking out the items he wants as if this was an everyday occurance.  ""we need to find a library or something, somewhere where we can find some information about this place."" sam is sniffing on a can of soda, trying to determine it's contents.  ""what's a library?""  ""never mind, just... follow me. and try not to break anything."" i walk up to the counter of the store and an overweight man in a sweat stained tank top greets me.  ""welcome to 7-eleven, what can i get for you today?"" he drones on mindlessly, not moving his eyes from the magazine in his lap.  ""i was wondering if you could tell us where we might find a library?""  ""don't know no libry."" i spot the rows of cigarette packages above us and decide to change strategy, remembering that sam used to smoke... or will start to smoke..  ""fine, i'll just have a pack of smokes.""  ""that'll be 12 credits."" he takes a pack of smokes and hands it to me, still keeping one eye on his magazine. crap, i forgot i don't have any money.  ""i, uh... don't have any credits.""  ""just place your hand there and it'll be put on your tab."" he indicates a hand shaped hole in the counter infront of me. i place my hand in the hole obediently and it immediately starts blinking and beeping wildly, which finally catches the cashiers attention, making him drop the magazine.  ""the hell is this? you don't have a chip? where did you say you were from again?""  ""uhm... i didn't. we're not from around here. tourists. yep."" i withdraw my hand from the machine but it continues to beep wildly. the fat man seems to press a button in the rolls of fat on his arm and proceeds to speak into his wrist.  ""there's two guys in my store without a chip, if you could send someone over, that'd be great.""  ""alright, that sounds like our cue to leave, it's been nice knowing you, but we'd better get going now!"" we run for the door, but before we can reach it two hovercraft come zooming in to the store, fold up and reveal two men in blue and black with a patch that reads 'police' across their back. desperately i begin to fish out the watch in my pocket.  ""no chip detected, permission to kill granted."" a robotic voice seems to come from a device in the hand of one of the officers and they grab for their guns. just as they fire i press the final knob, making the red laser flying through the air towards us twist and turn into a blurry red mass. a second later we're rolling in the grass of a familiar looking forest, laughing like crazy. somehow, coming so close to death makes you feel more alive than ever.  ~  over the next few weeks we travel through time after our every whim, never staying in one place long. we explore ancient rome, sail with pirates across the seas and even venture back into the future, although more carefully this time. there's a tension growing between us as time flies by and one night, back in the forest it comes to a breaking point.  ""why did you come back for me? why me and not someone else? who was the man you were with when you saved me? i think it's time you told me the truth."" it's clear by his deliberate choice of words and the way he looks me in the eye across the flickering fire that he has gone over this a thousand times in his mind. part of me wants to tell him, to just open up and tell him everything, about what happened at the ranch, about the man he would become... about him being my son. but another part of me, the stronger part, wants to carry the secret to my grave. i finally have a good friend and the whole world is our playground, i don't want to let anything ruin that.  ""i can't tell you... i just can't.""  ""bullshit you can't!"" he spits angrily on the ground.  ""why won't you just tell me? i'm not stupid you know, i can see we look alike. are we brothers? long lost relatives? i've seen the way you look at me when you think i'm not looking.""  ""does it really matter? can't we just adventure, explore, live together?""  ""of course it matters! how can i trust you when you won't tell me anything? if you won't tell me what's going on, i'm going back!"" sam is on his feet now, his voice rising with every word.  ""you want to go back because 'i don't tell you everything'? what are you, twelve?""  ""give me the watch, or i'm going to take it from you."" he states it calmly as if it's settled and my heart sinks in my chest. i did not want it to go this way.  ""no, come on. just sit down and relax. we can talk in the morning."" without another word he walks over to me and starts to search my pockets. i struggle and try to push him away, but he overpowers me easily and eventually finds the watch.  ""bye then."" his face is hard, not with anger but with determination as he spins the knobs on the watch.  ""wait!!"" i lunge forward, grabbing hold of his legs and the world begins to blur. i'm lying in the mud, still clutching his leg. he kicks me off into the mud and stares me down, without mercy. tears are streaming down my face and i crawl towards him, but he backs away slowly.  ""goodbye."" he says with finality as he twists the knob of the watch.  ""wait, sam! you're my... son."" but the figure is already gone in a flash, leaving me alone in the mud. in the distance i see a familiar stone castle on a hill, surrounded by a town and i can't help but to laugh. laugh at the irony of life, laugh at the fact that, out of all the times and all the places in history, this is the one where i was left to live out the rest of my life.  ~  [bam! done! might go into more detail about some more of their time traveling adventures at a later date, but for now i'm feeling pretty complete with all of this! hope you enjoyed and thank you for the kind comments/gold! don't forget to check out /r/storytellerbob for more awesome stories! :)]",0,,

862472,"the problem with statements like this is that ""average,"" ""thin,"" ""chubby,"" ""fat,"" ""skinny,"" ""fit,"" etc etc etc is that they're all super subjective, they're culturally determined, and in the few cases they can be quantified in any way that goes beyond 100% opinion, they *change*.  i am on the thin side, but whether i see myself as ""skinny"" or ""average"" is determined entirely on which situation i'm in.  i'm 26 years old and have never had children; while my appearance may not be ""the average"" for women in general (for all american women, period, it generally averages out to about a ""size 16""), it is quite typical for women in my demographic to be about my size.  the area i live in also tends towards thinness as a beauty standard, and people are much more likely to chase that standard, resulting in a lot of thin women around.  i feel quite average where i live now, because a lot of women look like me and wear my size.  where i'm from originally, the standard is more towards curvaceous women, leading women to strive for *that* standard instead, so i do feel ""skinny"" when i'm back home.  when i visit some parts of the south, people will flat out call me out for my weight, as being thin is not sought after in the same way.  when i visited new york city, on the other hand, 10 years ago and probably 10 pounds lighter, shop employees would all but call me fat to my face, because thinness is much more valued and expected there than pretty much anywhere else i've ever been.  so from the experience of someone who most frequently wears a size 4, i absolutely *have* felt average.  i have also felt a bit thinner than desirable, way too skinny, and positively porky on different occasions.  and really, the terms used to determine what is ""average"" in terms of weight are so very subjective.  remember when i said the average american woman is a size 16?  yeah, ignore that, because that metric *doesn't make any sense*.  a size 16 in one store may be a size 10 in another, or a size 22 in a third store.  it also only takes into account the dress or pant size, not the shape or height of the person wearing it.  i know women who wear size 16 clothes and seem very heavy to me, and i know women who wear size 16 clothes that strike me as actually on the slimmer side.  if all of those women are average, that still means that both women who appear heavy and women who appear slim are ""average.""    the final thing is, as humans, we really do tend to see ourselves and our immediate social circle as the baseline.  we think we're average no matter what.  if there is one single person fatter than us or skinnier than us, we're ""just average.""  this reminds me of one of those extreme weight loss shows, where a woman dropped from like 700 pounds to in the 300 range.  she was obviously pleased with the progress, but wanted to keep losing to be at a certain weight.  her peers from the weight loss clinic were telling her to stop because she was already ""skinny.""  while that was obviously not right of them to do, it made sense: if you're 350 pounds and so are all your friends, the 300 pound girl *is* skinny to you.  logically, why does the skinny girl want to lose weight? she's already thin, she's already succeeded!  i admit do the same thing to my friends who are smaller than me who want to lose weight; they're already skinnier than *me*, so why should they want to be thinner?  my friends who wear size 16s do it to the girls who wear size 12s.  the logic is really ""i am average, anyone smaller than me is skinny, anyone bigger than me is heavy.""  we live in our own bodies all day, so why wouldn't we think we're all pretty much average?",1,-1,1

673947,"practically speaking, there are two metrics by which we gauge progress in the fitness realm.   1. aesthetics - how pleasing we look.   2. efficiency - how much we lift, how fast we run, etc.   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;  **aesthetics**   how good you look is determined by two things primarily; your *proportions*, and your *body fat level*.     *proportions*   generally speaking; as a male you want a low [waist-to-chest ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physical_attractiveness) (meaning your waist is smaller than your chest),   and as a female you want a low [waist-to-hip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physical_attractiveness#waist.e2.80.93hip_ratio) ratio (meaning your waist is smaller than your hips).      to make this effect pronounced:   as a man you want to develop a larger upper body (chest, upper back, and upper arms) in proportion to your mid-section.   and as a female, you'd want to emphasize your hips by building up your upper legs (thighs and butt) while keeping your waist small.    there are other proportions in what we consider aesthetic (like leg-to-body ratios, facial symmetry, and others); but the most important is the waist-to-chest ratio, and the waist-to-hip ratio.   to measure your progress scientifically, you would have to use a tape measure and record your proportions frequently.   many however, use a more intuitive method; by simply looking in the mirror, or by taking pictures frequently.   how meticulous your method of tracking progress, is entirely up to you.         *body fat levels*   the second contributing factor to aesthetics (besides proportions), is how much fat you carry.   body fat is primarily stored over the muscles of your body, just underneath your skin.   body fat obscures the shape and definition of your muscles, and having more fat generally lowers your physical attractiveness.   the reason for this, lies on a subconscious and sexual selective level.    at glance, we assess the physical fitness in members of the opposite sex.   having low body fat levels, allow others to accurately gauge the features and qualities of your body.   and this allows others to determine if they want those features in their children.    having low body fat goes hand-in-hand with proportions.   and having low body fat, along with pleasing proportions may signal superior genetic fitness.   and this makes people want to fuck you.    measuring body fat is not as simple as using a tape measure,   some methods rely on using a tape measure but they are not accurate.  likewise, measuring body weight is not an accurate way of measuring body fat levels.   the gold standard is something called a [dexa scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual-energy_x-ray_absorptiometry).   the price to perform this measurement ranges between 50-300 usd.    barring dexa scans, the most accurate method of measuring body fat levels is by using a method developed by the [u.s. navy](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kurilla5.pdf).   [here is a calculator.](https://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/body-fat-calculator-navy)   essentially it's a formula that uses both tape measurements and body weight.    practically speaking, just like proportions, many people measure their body fat progress by looking in the mirror or taking frequent pictures.   how meticulous your methods of tracking progress, is entirely up to you.   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   **efficiency**   how efficient you are depends on what exactly you're doing.   most people choose weight-lifting as their method of increasing physical fitness.   in this case, efficiency is a measure of how much weight you can lift, at a given body weight.   we call this: strength.   there are two types of strength, *absolute strength* and *relative strength*.      *absolute strength*   the simplest type of strength to measure.   you just measure the amount of weight lifted in a given lift (irrespective of body weight).    the highest weight class in international powerlifting federation is the 120 kg+ (265 lbs+) weight class.   the most  absolute weight lifted, belong to competitors in this weight class.   likewise the highest weight class in the world's strongest man competition is 136 kg+ (300 lbs+).   and only those in the highest weight class, showcase the strongest feats.  in terms of absolute strength, they are among the strongest humans this earth has seen.     but there are two problems.   one, competitors in the highest weight class have high body fat levels.   two, relatively speaking (weight lifted/body weight), these contenders are not as ""strong"" as others in lower weight classes.      if how much you lift is more important than how you look, then look no further. focus on lifting more weight, which will lead to you getting bigger (both in muscle and fat).    however, if you're looking to get stronger *and* leaner, then the next section on relative strength is important to you.         *relative strength*   this is a measure of how much weight you can lift, related to your body weight.   the simplest method widely used is: ""amount lifted"" / ""body weight"".   the larger the ratio, the stronger you are, relatively speaking. so you could track your strength progress by dividing your lifted weight by your body weight, and then seeing if that number is increasing.    but this method is flawed.    [if you have some time, check out this excellent article by the impressive greg nuckolds](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/whos-the-most-impressive-powerlifter/)      the flaw is that in terms of relative strength, people with lower body weights have a natural advantage in lifting heavier loads.   this is due to something called [allometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allometry).    an example from the article by greg nuckolds:   &gt;""ants routinely carry more than 20x their bodyweight for long distances, and modeling research shows that an ant could theoretically hold about 5000x its own weight   (after which point its neck â€“ the weakest part of its body â€“ would snap).      &gt;bjÃ¶rnsson, on the other hand, wowed people in early 2015 by carrying a 640kg (~1400lb) log, roughly 3.5x his bodyweight, for five steps.   iâ€™m not exactly sure how much weight it would take to crush a human,   but i assume it would be a shade less than 400,000kg (882,000lbs) â€“ about 5000x the weight of an average-sized person.""    relative to ants, humans are pitifully weak. and if we want an accurate method of tracking relative strength, we must develop a formula that brings both ant and human to a level playing field.   practically speaking, allometric scoring levels the playing field between the lightest lifter and the heaviest lifter.   the formula:      allometric score = weight lifted x (bodyweight ^-2/3)      is a much better way to track your strength as you lose or gain weight.   of course there are some flaws with allometric scoring, but it's the best method of tracking your strength that i've found.      how meticulous you want to be, is entirely up to you.   most people just track how much they lift. other people track their lifts and body weight.   few use allometric scoring.   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;    **in conclusion**   there are two categories of tracking progress: *aesthetics*, and *efficiency*.    aesthetics - measured by your proportions, and your body fat levels.   * proportions are measured by waist-to-chest ratio for men, and waist-to-hip ratio for women.   * body fat levels are measured by dexa scan, u.s. navy method, or by picture/mirror (ordered by most accurate to least accurate).      efficiency - measured by absolute strength, or relative strength (assuming you lift weights for physical fitness).   * absolute strength is measured by how much weight you lift for a given exercise.   * relative strength is measured by your allometric score: allometric score = weight lifted x (body weight ^-2/3), or your ""weight lifted / body weight"" ratio. (ordered by most accurate to least accurate).    good luck, god speed, and it's only as complicated as you want to make it.",1,1,0

488723,"&gt;what do i do at the gym to lose weight?  show up (assuming you are eating right). seriously though, it doesn't make that big of a difference what you are doing, as long as you're consistently active and eating clean.  and with respect to your physical size, changing how much fat you are carrying around is much, much easier than changing how much muscle you have on you. i'd recommend lifting heavy things now, and go with free weights. my thinking is that since its easier to lift heavy things when you are heavy, you should do that now while you are still heavy. the alternative is cutting down your weight, then adding weight back on to put on muscle, and cutting weight again. not nearly so much fun as simply having muscle in the first place to show off when you cut weight. muscle contributing to energy consumption is another plus, too.  &gt;when i started going to the gym i got told that you can turn fat into muscle so do weights. then i read an article about how that's totally impossible because fat cells and muscle are two very different things.  you should be lifting weights anyhow. if nothing else, to avoid losing muscle mass as you slim down. heavy people are stronger than lighter people, all else equal, since they move heavier bodyweight around.  oh, and compound lifts with free weights are what you want to be doing. they're hard enough that they'll give cardio benefits - not only are you putting out a large power output during the lift, but you're also going to be increasing your blood pressure due to the weight and exertion. this causes the heart to work harder, which improves cardiovascular function.  tl;dr go lift free weights, adjust your diet for what you want size-wize, and don't worry about getting too much muscle because its pretty much impossible.",1,-1,
901263,"africa is a strange land. that's a rather bold claim, though, so i won't let it go unsubstantiated.  i suppose the story started when i moved into my new apartment a few years back. i was coming off a nasty break-up at the time, so i was pretty depressed. but i figured the newness of my situation would help. a new city, new people, and most importantly, a new job -- i was excited; i was ready to pull myself together and be *happy*.  the apartment was bland. white walls and no furniture -- i had no money after the move. it was going to take some time to spice the place up. it didn't help that the apartment building was in a bad part of town: looking out the window, i regularly witnessed robberies and muggings. pretty messed up, and it didn't help with my depression.  but aside from my home, life started getting better. i had a decent job at burger king, which was in walking distance from my apartment. i know, not many people would call flipping burgers a ""decent"" job, but hey -- it payed. and my co-workers were freaking hilarious. (that's another story -- though i will give some advice: don't eat at the king.)  so life went on. working my butt off, buying things for my apartment, eating, sleeping. dreary at times, but simple -- i like simple. i'm a simple man.  until norton came by.  norton was an old friend from my ""previous"" life. so i was a little surprised when he showed up at my apartment, trying to bum a dollar. to this day i don't know how he got my address -- i asked him multiple times but he just shrugged the question off. kind of creepy.  anyway, nort has never exactly been a hard-worker. he's an intelligent guy; i first met him in high school. top of his class, and he never even tried. to be honest, i think his lack of motivation coming out of high school was due to his troubled family life. he was always having problems with his parents in one way or another.  so here he is, needing financial assistance. to say i was perturbed is putting it lightly. he was a friend, but i had put my old life behind me -- i was trying to start over from scratch; i didn't need a slacker mooching off me every chance he got. that's something i've never understood about *seinfeld* -- how can jerry afford to feed kramer all the time?  to top it all off, he was wearing a filthy coat and sporting a light beard. this guy seriously looked homeless. if you saw him on the street, ""bum"" would be the first word that sprung to mind.  he starts telling me about his many adventures since he dropped out of college. (lol, i think he was there for about a month.) all the places he'd been with his pothead friends, all the amazing canadian beer he'd drunk. the way he was going on, it sounded like he was living the high life.  ""but man,"" he said to me, ""the illest place i've been yet is africa.""  ""africa?"" i sputtered.  at this point i was wondering if he'd taken one too many hits of lsd. he was rambling pretty badly, slipping from one topic to another, but it had all made some sort of sense until he got to talking about africa.  ""yeah,"" he said, ""me an' marco were goin' down there an' seein' buffaloes."" he laughed. ""marco's like all photographer, you know.""  yeah. ""like all photographer,"" indeed. i didn't know ""marco,"" but i was a little surprised that nort would have a friend with a hobby that didn't involve getting wasted.  okay, i'm not stupid.   ""there are no buffalo in africa,"" i told him, smirking. nort may be a drain on society, but he has his moments.  he looked around blearily for a moment, then corrected himself. ""oh -- yeah. giraffes, right.""  ""so who is this marco guy?"" i asked.  turns out marco was a wildlife photographer for some nature magazine. it might've been ng, but i don't remember for certain; this was a while back.  apparently marco met nort in a bar in canada. nort got into trouble by hitting on marco's girlfriend, but nort's suave demeanor got him out of the situation and won him a new friend. so he said.  this, of course, didn't explain how nort tagged along to africa with him.  i probed him further (alien abductees, that's the prompt for a flashback; message me if you remember anything), and in about an hour i had gathered information regarding a late-night poker game and some drunken bets -- turns out nort was a better player stoned than marco was drunk.  nort was pretty proud of the accomplishment. ""it was easy, man, easy; i was smooth as a buttered chick'n racin' down a waterslide,"" he said with a big grin on his face.  ""how much did you win?""  ""too much."" he laughed. his good memories seemed to be sobering him up. ""marco polo couldn't pay it all. so we cut a deal.""  nice deal, getting to go to africa on someone else's dime.  but then things got really interesting.  ""yeah man. we're goin' there 'gain, too. this month.""  ""again?"" i said, amazed. i didn't see how that could be possible. this guy can't even brush his teeth every day, and he's making multiple trips to africa? ""how?""  nort leaned in real close. i could smell the alcohol and cigarette smoke on his breath. gross. ""skills,"" he muttered.  ""what?""  he laughed again. ""i. have. secrets."" yes, he said it just like that. ""but!"" he shouted. ""i didn't just come here to bum money, bro."" he punched me on the shoulder and smiled. ""wanna come?""  was he kidding me? did i want to go to africa?  hell ye -- wait. i was broke. i doubted marco had the cash to --  ""yah man, he's got a gamblin' addiction or somethin'. sucks at poker. said i could take a friend this time.""  i was excited, to say the least.   now, before i fully delve into the oddity that is the african continent, i would like to say some good things about it first.  africa is drop-dead gorgeous. imagine playing *far cry 2* on the highest settings, and then quadruple that. africa is 100% photo-realistic. but the photos don't even do it justice. i'm telling you, you have to see the savanna grass shimmering in the sunlight first-hand to truly appreciate its beauty.  and the sounds! wherever you go, the chirps and calls of animal life will follow you. unless you're in the city, in which case it sounds like a city.  now, after we got off the plane, marco had to stop by some dude's house to discuss their pretentious tree-hugging professions. we decided, quite rightly, to meet up later. when you're in africa for the first time, the last thing you want to do is go inside. even though it's hot. there's too much to miss.  nort and i bummed around the city for a bit before deciding to head off into the wilderness. i know, i know. what was i thinking? africa's a bleeding continent, man!  well, i'm still alive, aren't i?  i mentioned savanna grass. that's what bordered the city: a huge savanna. hippos, lions -- yeah, all there. what of it? we walked for an hour or so, nort slightly high and nauseous. he doesn't like flying. in planes, anyway.  the sun was hot on our backs, the grass brushing against our bare legs. we stopped a few times under trees, sharing shade with all manner of creatures. i'm also pretty sure we saw a cousin of nessy surface in a lake once.  this is all fine. it was fun, and as the sun began to set, we began heading back to the city.  then it happened.  it was all a blur, really -- as we walked under a cluster of trees i was hit in the head with something heavy. sharp pain coursed through my skull. i was out.  my head was throbbing painfully when i awoke, like a couple of elephants were stomping around destroying brain tissue. i opened my eyes, wary of what i would see.  i saw -- nothing. nothing at all. someone had put a blanket over my head.  i tried moving my arms, my hands, my legs, but i couldn't. i was tied down.  at that point my mind was racing. i began to imagine all sorts of possibilities -- had a tribe of monkeys kidnapped me? was i going to be gangraped by primates? or perhaps this was the work of terrorists. would i be held hostage, forced to star in propaganda videos, and then have my head sawed off? frankly, i hoped it was the latter. the former was too degrading.  but then the blanket was thrown off, and what i saw was worse than anything i could have possibly imagined.  my stomach was huge. it bulged up in front of me, a mountain of flesh.  someone had fed me. someone had fed me massive amounts of food; i was going to explode. i would be used as an example, a warning to the american people of the dangers of obesity.  ""hahaha...""   i turned my head to the right at the sound of a creepy, raspy laugh. an african man came into view, carrying a syringe in his hand.  ""how do you like your new appearance?"" he said in a heavy accent. ""it appears you are having troubles, my dear sir.""  i eeked out a cry of protest. ""what have you done to me?"" i gasped.  he knelt down and spoke to me, eye to eye. ""you are carrying an alligator baby. the most blessed of crocodiles: eeshmun. the next full moon, he will hatch out of your body and wreak his vengeance upon the world.""  i won't lie, i panicked. i struggled desperately against my restraints.  i was the virgin mary of some sick cult!  next thing i knew, i heard a couple loud gunshots. syringe man ducked, looked this way and that, and bolted.  a couple men rushed in and cut the ropes binding me.  long story short, the authorities had been keeping an eye out on this guy for months. they finally caught up to him that evening, but he had already put the parasite crocodile inside me. luckily, one surgery and very long recovery later, i was able to function in society again.  true story.",1,-2,

it blatantly tells you it's bad to be fat. obese is not a freaking ""euphemism"", understatement or substitute. there is nothing ""soft"" about it which is why you hate it. are you so dumb you don't know what the word ""euphemism"" means?  euphemism (n) -a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing.  obese/overweight are the correct, blatant, ""blunt"", and ""harsh"" words. which is why you fa's hate being called this. being told ""you're class 3 morbidly obese"" is blunt and true. the truth hurts and euphemisms make you feel better about something. that's why you call this shit fat acceptance, size acceptance or fat activism instead of what it truly is; the probesity movement.  *examples of correct terms:* fat, overfat, overweight, obese, class 2 obese, class 3 obese, morbidly obese,  the only ""soft"" words for fat are not used medically. they are used by fa's, people talking about themselves, coddling friends/families/lovers of fat people, the fashion industry and the modeling industry. the only word used both correctly and as a euphemism is the word ""fat"" itself.  examples of actual euphemisms often used to describe a fat person;

139081,"depends on your diet.  2200 calories a day of fatty foods high in sodium, fat, and cholesterol affects your body differently than 2200 calories a day of vegetables, lean meats, and fruit.  it also depends on your build - some people are built with heavier frames than others.  if your one of these people, you're never going to get ""skinny"" unless you go on a really serious diet (see christian bale and the machinist).    all things said and done, i would invest in a fat caliper and body measuring tape so you can calculate your overall percentage body fat based on your height, weight, and measurements.  when people want to get thin, what they really want is to lose body fat.  so if you want to get thin - you probably want to be around 10% body fat (for a male).    dieting and biking will get you there - but (at the risk of sounding weird on the internet) you'll look weird naked.  you'll have toned legs, whereas your upper body won't be in balance with the exercise your legs get and it'll just look strange.  its the same reason you see track runners on the bench press - overall muscle balance in your body greatly increases overall strength and endurance.  that's why i would suggest adding a moderate lifting program to your routine.  you'll balance out your body, and you'll gain muscle while losing fat, which will make your overall appearance more ""slim"".    also - watch the fat % and not the weight!  i've known people who look 10 times better after 6 months of lifting and eating right, but their weight actually went up.  that's muscle weighs more than fat, and as you replace the fat with muscle, you're replacing it with denser, heavier tissue.  it doesn't really matter if you don't lose weight but you are at 8% body fat - you'll look/feel a lot better.  hope this helps.  if you want a good overall intro to weight lifting - try stronglifts.com.  you don't necessarily have to follow that particular program, but it gives a lot of intro advice on nutrition, how much to eat, and how to perform various exercises.    **almost forgot - check your bmr (basal metabolic rate).  google bmr calculator - this value represents the number of calories you would burn in a day if you did nothing.  you can calculate your caloric intake on that.",1,-1,2
428569,"the pain was both hot and cold.   i stared at the spear protruding from my chest. the heat magic made my blood stains sizzle. i could smell it, the burnt flesh and fluids.   it was odd, getting cooked from the inside out. i didnâ€™t try to make a habit of it, but this would have been the eighth time this has happened. it was most likely my image.   a overweight, harmless, and smiling idiot. not far from the truth, but not the full truth either.   i made face as the smell hit me. i did not smell delicious. not enough spices, and far too much heat. which was sad as i was well marbled with fat.   the red spear tip began to lose its shine. the magic feeding the magic weapon was now cut off, and thus the residual magic dissipated.   a wet slorping sound filled my ears as jonas pulled the spear back out.   i stretched, and twitched as muscles complained. my pain receptors fired off. my body let me know that not only had i gotten stabbed, but i was also lightly cooked on the inside. the pain was heaviest in my left lung.   i turned, and saw jonas staring at me. his mouth agape as not only was i not dead, but i even shaking my head at him. i was not falling over as he had expected.   jonas. fire abilities. a low, 2nd tier channeler. he needed a tool use his magics.   â€œhow the fuck are you still alive!?â€ jonas asked as he stared at his spear. the blackened chunks of flesh clung to it. there shouldnâ€™t have been that much stuff.   â€œjonas, what the hell is wrong with you?â€ i asked as i felt my children slither within.    the flesh ateusacer of isosaria were already eating the dead flesh. then another group moved and started repairing me. stitching me back together, and using their brethren as filler if needed.   â€œah, jonas my old friend,â€ i began as i scratched at my open wound. i wasnâ€™t even bleeding anymore. â€œwhat the hell do you think planer travels meant?â€   jonas stared back at me, his expression a picture perfect example of a moron.   â€œit means i have left our world, our universe, and traveled to other ones. not bad for the maggot-moron, or a bug-boy,â€ i smiled at jonas. my old friend. a childhood pal.   it was why i had hired the man. to give him a bit of free coin and to catch up on old times. i was now sad that the rumors turned out to be true.   jonas who was now reedy, and â€˜guidedâ€™ others through the falken woods. jonas, and his new friends. men i didnâ€™t recognize. did i know them?   ah, it didnâ€™t matter. not anymore.   â€œthe pay was ten gold coins jonas. easy money,â€ i sighed. i liked jonas. he was a good kid back then.   instead of this gruff, scruffy, thin man. i recalled a chubby cheeked, laughing kid. my friend who once helped me against name callers, and told me that my ability to talk to insects was neat.   â€œyeah, easy money!â€ one of jonasâ€™s friends hollered and another laughed.   they say ignorance was a power, and i understood that well. i was still like these fools. poking at something greater then their minds could understand.   my defining quest in life was like this. challenging impossible odds. the difference was that i had much, much better help.   i pulled up my sleeves, revealing the pale and unblemished skin. three of four people before me laughed. jonas no longer looked confident as the situation dawned on him.   i got stabbed and didnâ€™t die. they had weapons, and i was currently unarmed. jonas felt like he was in danger despite having a magic spear.   {wake, my beauties} i sang out and raised my arms.    razer sharp wings pierced through my skin. they erupted from my very flesh, yet no blood or tears appeared. so fine was their wing's edge, they could cut flesh and leave no damage.   well, cut was too harsh a term. separate the cells was more accurate. then the cells could re-link with only micro damage done.   my most precious princesses. three on each forearm. purple phoenix papillon. each was the size of my hand, and that was with their wings stretched out.   they looked like butterflies, if butterflies were outline in pearlescent purple. the color shimmered in the light, and could change hues depending on the angle.   the wings were translucent. so fine that unless you smudged them, they were invisible. yet they could whisk through the air at speeds the defied logic. zipping past griffins as if they were newborns.   their bodies looked as if it got carved from amethyst. though they were nowhere neat as soft as that gemstone. it required either intense magic of the seventh class to even hurt them.    enchanted metals were a good second choice. though melee was a fool's choice.   they fluttered their wings in anticipation. it was only my will that prevented them from acting sooner. from attacking sooner.   the six were unique even among their species. princesses that could each evolve into a queen. then, with sovereign blood, they could become empresses.   empress class purple phoenix papillon. a silly name, but considering that alone, they could kill eldritch dragons and eat their flesh. these beauties were no joke.   though the reason why they stayed with me was.   they thought i was yummy. a warm, fluffy sandwich.   not that i complained too much. anyone educated ran, and everyone dumb died before them. it was the reason why i was both fat, and wealthy.   when they hungered, they could reduce my weight to a fifth within seconds. so i needed to eat a lot.   which meant money. yet what was dangerous to one such as i?   i could waltz through poisoned fields, my lungs filtered by the mog maggots of rulg. i could make a pretty penny on rare creatures or herbs.   if i knew where precious stones or ores lay, my burrowing unkulu wyrm could swim to them, and bring them back to me.   a dragon with a hoard or treasure? my pretty princesses could eat it, and i would clean up everything else. though we did avoid elder and ancient dragons. no sense in being unnecessary risks.   jonas snickered.   it broke me from my loving gazes as i looked over each of my beauties.   â€œi donâ€™t care if you got pretty little butterflies. you always were a berk!â€ jonas laughed. his braying cough was extra loud in the still air.   jonas frowned, and looked to his side. torky usually laughed at his insults.   torky wasnâ€™t laughing because of a little butterfly. he wasnâ€™t large, but the butterfly was able to lift him. it was currently sucking the very life force from the man.    jonas swiveled around, and his other two friends had the same, silent fate.   jonas screamed as he saw his friends, his pals, wither before his eyes.   his final moments were the sign of a shimmering purple thing. then a sharp stab. something that went deeper then flesh and bone.   i sighed as the complaints of the last two girls filled my senses. they were hungry but there was no more food.   {those who had to wait, can get something from me!} i said as i patted my stomach. the two girls did a loop in the air, fold up their wings and dove into my stomach. i could feel them move and eat. it didnâ€™t hurt, but it did lightly tickle.   the other four, sensing something amiss, immediately stopped. they dropped their subpar meal and rushed over. they had felt the pleasure of their two sister and they also dove in.   these little, selfish butterflies. where they little flying pigs as well?   i giggled as they did not hold back. how such small things were able to eat so much boggled my mind. my princess piggies.   i giggled at the joke. it got followed up by another tingle ran up my spine.   on a good day, i couldnâ€™t see my toes. in moments i looked down and i could see my ribs. the sagging skin wasnâ€™t cute at all.   i wiggled it, and folded it up and pressed it against my stomach.   {skin. much. loose. fix} i sent into my bone marrows. the flesh ateusacer would eat the extra skin and leave me looking good. i would also have sculptured muscles if my princesses didnâ€™t eat so much.    if my body was not near death, which it almost always was, i would have been handsome. with a body that artists desired to capture in stone.   i stared at the dried husks that were once people.   i made my way over and picked them clean. it was low quality gear. weapons, armor, and the odd ring. it wasnâ€™t worth anything.   so sad. their most prized possessions were like shiny stones in my eyes. interesting, but worthless.   even jonasâ€™s prized spear was a simple forged magic weapon. common enough to only be worth a few coins. was it worth lugging to the capital to sell?   meh. i would do it to spite the man. sell it for bread money.   i giggled as someone tickled an organ. the girls were usually good about not crippling me, so ignored it. i began to walk back to the horses.   it was going to be a nice ride back to the capital. for my horse that was. i had lost a lot of fat. i would guess a hundred pounds in the last ten minutes.   i whistled a tune as i made it back to camp.   the soup was bubbling, and the bread warm on top of the pot lid.    there was enough for five, which mean that i could finally have a proper meal here.   then it was time to head back to my journey.   the celestial jade honeycombs were located in the apidea planes, right?   the rare crystal honey would help my girls grow into queens. which they wanted and i wanted. then they could begin to kill dragons on their own, rather then as a group.   i wanted them to become empresses. a legacy that would define my life. a goal that had me traveling far and wide.  â€”â€”â€”â€”  author's corner:  thanks for reading!",1,-2,

839891,"yes, now here's an old slashdot troll to amuse everyone:  rob malda is a 26-year old white male with a stocky build and a beard. his head is shaved. he responded to my ad to be interviewed for this article wearing only leather pants, leather boots and a leather vest. i could see that both of his nipples were pierced with large-gauge silver rings.  questioner: i hope you won't be offended if i ask you to prove to me that you're a nullo. just so that our readers will know that this isn't a fake.  rob: sure, no problem. (stands and unbuckles pants and drops them to his ankles, revealing a smooth, shaven crotch with only a thin scar to show where his genitals once were).  q: thank you. that's a remarkable sight.  (laughs and pulls pants back up). most people think so.  q: what made you decide to become a nullo?  (pauses). well, it really wasn't entirely my decision.  q: excuse me?  the idea wasn't mine. it was my lover's idea.  q: please explain what you mean.  okay, it's a long story. you have to understand my relationship with michael before you'll know what happened.  q: we have plenty of time. please go on.  both of us were into the leather lifestyle when we met through a personal ad. michael's ad was very specific: he was looking for someone to completely dominate and modify to his pleasure. in other word, a slave.  the ad intrigued me. i had been in a number of b&amp;d scenes and also some s&amp;m, but i found them unsatisfying because they were all temporary. after the fun was over, everybody went on with life as usual.  i was looking for a complete life change. i wanted to meet someone who would be part of my life forever. someone who would control me and change me at his whim.  q: in other words, you're a true masochist.  oh yes, no doubt about that. i've always been totally passive in my sexual relationships.  anyway, we met and there was instant chemistry. michael is a few years older than me and very good looking. our personalities meshed totally. he's very dominant.  i went back to his place after drinks and had the best sex of my life. that's when i knew i was going to be with michael for a long, long time.  q: what sort of things did you two do?  it was very heavy right away. he restrained me and whipped me for quite awhile. he put clamps on my nipples and a ball gag in my mouth. and he hung a ball bag on my sack with some very heavy weights. that bag really bounced around when michael fucked me from behind.  q: ouch.  (laughs) yeah, no kidding. at first i didn't think i could take the pain, but michael worked me through it and after awhile i was flying. i was sorry when it was over.  michael enjoyed it as much as i did. afterwards he talked about what kind of a commitment i'd have to make if i wanted to stay with him.  q: what did he say exactly?  well, besides agreeing to be his slave in every way, i'd have to be ready to be modified. to have my body modified.  q: did he explain what he meant by that?  not specifically, but i got the general idea. i guessed that something like castration might be part of it.  q: how did that make you feel?  (laughs) i think it would make any guy a little hesitant.  q: but it didn't stop you from agreeing to michael's terms?  no it didn't. i was totally hooked on this man. i knew that i was willing to pay any price to be with him.  anyway, a few days later i moved in with michael. he gave me the rules right away: i'd have to be naked at all times while we were indoors, except for a leather dog collar that i could never take off. i had to keep my head shaved. and i had to wear a butt plug except when i needed to take a shit or when we were having sex.  i had to sleep on the floor next to his bed. i ate all my food on the floor, too.  the next day he took me to a piercing parlor where he had my nipples done, and a prince albert put into the head of my cock.  q: heavy stuff.  yeah, and it got heavier. he used me as a toilet, pissing in my mouth. i had to lick his asshole clean after he took a shit, too. it was all part of a process to break down any sense of individuality i had. after awhile, i wouldn't hesitate to do anything he asked.  q: did the sex get rougher?  oh god, yeah. he started fisting me every time we had sex. but he really started concentrating on my cock and balls, working them over for hours at a time.  he put pins into the head of my cock and into my sack. he attached clothespins up and down my cock and around my sack. the pain was pretty bad. he had to gag me to keep me from screaming.  q: when did the idea of nullification come up?  well, it wasn't nullification at first. he started talking about how i needed to make a greater commitment to him, to do something to show that i was dedicated to him for life.  when i asked him what he meant, he said that he wanted to take my balls.  q: how did you respond?  not very well at first. i told him that i liked being a man and didn't want to become a eunuch. but he kept at me, and wore me down. he reminded me that i agreed to be modified according to his wishes, and this is what he wanted for me. anything less would show that i wasn't really committed to the relationship. and besides, i was a total bottom and didn't really need my balls.  it took about a week before i agreed to be castrated. but i wasn't happy about it, believe me.  q: how did he castrate you?  michael had a friend who was into the eunuch scene. one night he came over with his bag of toys, and michael told me that this was it. i was gonna lose my nuts then and there.  q: did you think of resisting?  i did for a minute, but deep down i knew there was no way. i just didn't want to lose michael. i'd rather lose my balls.  michael's friend restrained me on the living room floor while michael videotaped us. he used an elastrator to put a band around my sack.  q: that must have really hurt.  hell yeah. it's liked getting kicked in the balls over and over again. i screamed for him to cut the band off, but he just kept on going, putting more bands on me. i had four bands around my sack when he finished.  i was rolling around on the floor screaming, while michael just videotaped me. eventually, my sack got numb and the pain subsided. i looked between my legs and could see my sack was a dark purple. i knew my balls were dying inside.  michael and his friend left the room and turned out the light. i lay there for hours, crying because i was turning into a eunuch and there wasn't anything i could do about it.  q: what happened then?  eventually i fell asleep from exhaustion. then the light switched on and i could see michael's friend kneeling between my legs, touching my sack. i heard him tell michael that my balls were dead.  q: how did michael react?  very pleased. he bent down and felt around my sack. he said that it felt cold.  michael's friend told me that i needed to keep the bands on. he said that eventually my balls and sack would dry up and fall off. i just nodded. what else could i do at that point?  q: did it happen just like michael's friend said?  yeah, a week or so later my package just fell off. michael put it in a jar of alcohol to preserve it. it's on the table next to his bed.  q: how did things go after that?  michael was really loving to me. he kept saying how proud he was of me, how grateful that i had made the commitment to him. he even let me sleep in his bed.  q: what about the sex?  we waited awhile after my castration, and then took it easy until i was completely healed. at first i was able to get hard, but as the weeks went by my erections began to disappear.  that pleased michael. he liked fucking me and feeling my limp cock. it made his dominance over me even greater.  q: when did he start talking about making you a nullo?  a couple of months after he took my nuts. our sex had gotten to be just as rough as before the castration. he really got off on torturing my cock. then he started saying stuff like, ""why do you even need this anymore?""  that freaked me out. i always thought that he might someday take my balls, but i never imagined that he'd go all the way. i told him that i wanted to keep my dick.  q: how did he react to that?  at first he didn't say much. but he kept pushing. michael said i would look so nice being smooth between my legs. he said my dick was small and never got hard anymore, so what was the point of having it.  but i still resisted. i wanted to keep my cock. i felt like i wouldn't be a man anymore without it.  q: so how did he get you to agree?  he didn't. he took it against my will.  q: how did that happen?  we were having sex in the basement, and i was tied up and bent over this wooden bench as he fucked me. then i heard the doorbell ring. michael answered it, and he brought this guy into the room.  at first i couldn't see anything because of the way i was tied. but then i felt these hands lift me up and put me on my back. and i could see it was michael's friend, the guy who took my nuts.  q: how did you react?  i started screaming and crying, but the guy just gagged me. the two of them dragged me to the other side of the room where they tied me spread eagled on the floor.  michael's friend snaked a catheter up my dick, and gave me a shot to numb my crotch. i was grateful for that, at least. i remember how bad it hurt to lose my balls.  q: what was michael doing at this time?  he was kneeling next to me talking quietly. he said i'd be happy that they were doing this. that it would make our relationship better. that kind of calmed me down. i thought, ""well, maybe it won't be so bad.""  q: how long did the penectomy take?  it took awhile. some of the penis is inside the body, so he had to dig inside to get all of it. there was a lot of stitching up and stuff. he put my cock in the same jar with my balls. you can even see the prince albert sticking out of the head.  then they made me a new pisshole. it's between my asshole and where my sack used to be. so now i have to squat to piss.",0,,

573378,"even if you post another 100 of those links, it won't prove anything. some of those are trolls, and some of those are mentally challenged. it doesn't prove anything. go make a tinder profile with an ugly girl, you will get 17 000 matches of guys better looking than her. go do the same with an ugly guy, you will hardly get any matches. i can't believe that you don't know the basic supply and demand mechanics of the dating market. it is clearly skewed in favour of women.   &gt; but if the only girls who are interested are 3s, guess what? you're a 3.   simply wrong. i am a 6. nobody can say i am less than a 5. the girls who show interest in me are no higher than 3. it was not always like this. when i was high school age, girls on my own level (5s and 6s) used to show attention to me. this is more proof that i am indeed a 6. however, as you move past that age, girls' tastes change: they want a big guy instead of a good looking guy. body over face. this is why justin bieber was so popular with teen girls but not older girls. i could write a thesis on this, so you just have to take my word for it. i have been observing couples for the past 7-8 years and my findings also lead to this conclusion. so being a skinny guy makes your value drop immensely in the dating market, however, being a super skinny girl doesn't. this imbalance causes my situation: 6/10 face getting attention only from 3/10 faced females, and they are also too skinny like me, or some are fat. so no, you are wrong. i am not stupid. i know where i stand. i can tell the difference between a 6 and 3. you don't know how many people, all sexes and all ages have told me ""you are a pretty good looking guy... if only you were not so skinny"" or a variant of that phrase.   &gt; i know lots of women who like skinny guys, or don't mind them. i have never in real life ever met a woman who prefers chubby men. i'm sure there are some female chubby chasers out there, but i have literally never met one.   i think you are confused. i think you mean ""slim"" guys, basically, guys who are thinner than average. that is not what a ""skinny"" guy is. a skinny guy is actually ""skinny,"" and that is the worst trait by far to have as a male. it is as bad as being obese. and no, i don't mean anorexic skinny (anorexic skinny would be the equivalent of obese), just skinny. obviously most women don't want a guy to be chubby or fat, but as long as he is not obese, many women will still give him a chance. but with really skinny guys (not anorexic), it is virtually impossible to get a girlfriend, unless, you settled for a girl much lower than you face-wise (aka a 6/10 faced male going out with a 3/10 faced female). i have been observing couples for the past 7/8 years, and i have seen hundreds of non fat girls with chubby or fat guys, and i know for a fact some of them were not rich. yet i have never, ever seen even a super skinny girl with a super skinny guy like me. if i saw this, they were under 18, which i already addressed earlier in my post. i am not just talking out of my ass, i have carefully analyzed over 5000 couples in the past 7-8 years, because i literally found it so strange that i was having such a tough time in the dating market: i simply didn't know how on earth a girl would prefer a fat, ugly, bald, short, unfunny, unintelligent guy to me. but after analyzing thousands of couples, i finally realized: it is due to my skinniness.   &gt; again, according to who? it's like louis ck says; ""it's not up to you. you don't get to decide that."" you know who decides if you're attractive? other people. you know who decides if your jokes are funny? other people. do you know who decides if they find your personality novel? other people.  i agree with you: other people do find me funny and intelligent. that is why girls friendzone me. if they did not enjoy my company, they would call me creep and not want to be around me. i even had this one girl always touch me in a flirty way, but soon i found out i was her ""cute teddy bear"" and that she was dating a tall fat ugly dumb guy who sounded like a mutated horse and was awkward. i am not stupid, i know how to judge my own worth relative to others. when i say i am funny or intelligence, i am not just talking out of my ass. i really don't care if you don't believe me, i have no reason to lie. this is further proof that only my body is causing girls on my own level to not give me a chance: as long as they prefer fatter/bigger guys, there is nothing i can do.   &gt; if all she's looking for is casual sex, why shouldn't she fuck men who are much more attractive than you? who would you rather fuck for a one night stand? melissa mccarthy or scarlett johansen? you're lying to yourself if you're saying you'd pick the less attractive girl. hell, you just said you wouldn't give 3s the time of day.   i never disagreed with this. i am not blaming girls who want only casual sex who do that. i am blaming society that it caused girls to pursue only casual sex, instead of focusing on relationships. because when that becomes the case, the 80/20 rule kicks in, and obviously, this is detrimental to the overwhelming majority of the male population. also, another problem is that it is not just girls who want casual sex who do this. girls who want long term relationships choose guys the same way they choose guys for casual sex: only based on physical attraction. this is simply wrong, and they realize that too, but only after they get pumped and dumped a million times. they don't learn their mistake until 50 guys after.   &gt; this is so ironic coming from you. you have a supply/good to offer (yourself), but nobody (who is good enough for you) is demanding it. and rather than realizing that you're over-valuing the good (asking for more than you're worth), you're trying to say that all the demanders are wrong. it's not you, asking for too much. 50% of the population simply doesn't see your value.  i never said that all the demanders are wrong. i am just frustrated that being skinny is such a bottleneck. i mean ffs, i can guarantee that 95% of girls who choose a fat, ugly, bald, unfunny, unintelligent guy would be better off with me than with that guy, yet they don't even give me a chance. i don't know why being skinny is so bad to be a 100% black and white total bottleneck. i have no other problems. in fact, i am above average in almost all other aspects. why do i have the same value as an obese guy when i am much better? it is not optimal to be a skinny guy but it is much better than being obese, so why is my value not higher? why are short, ugly, fat, unfunny, unintelligent guys worth more than me just because i am skinny, it is not like being a fat guy is a good thing either, especially when they are inferior to me in all those traits. also, what frustrates me more is that for some reason there is so much demand for the girl who is me in female form. i am talking same exact face level out of 10, and same exact body, relatively converted to a female, aka super skinny. i personally don't even find super skinny girls attracted, they are not feminine enough, however, i am not a hypocrite, i understand that i am skinny myself, so i will go out with them. everybody deserves their equal, however, skinny guys are the only ones who don't get this opportunity. however, i just don't get guys who are not skinny who go for unattractively skinny girls. these guys are so lazy and such settlers it is disgusting. they are knocking me out of the dating market because they are such settlers. if i was a big guy, i would go for curvy girls, not skinny girls. yet they are monopolizing the dating market.   &gt; that is laughable. i'm literally laughing.   then you are a bad person. you are a misandrist. if a girl was going through this problem everybody would support her and call all men pigs for making this her reality. yet nobody calls out females for their unfair and greedy hypergamous greed. yet people ridicule men for complaining about the unfair dating market and not wanting to go out with a girl who is 3/10 when he is 6/10 himself. and lol at anyone who says i am ""mean"" for calling girls 3/10. yea ok.. which one of you girls would go out with a 3/10 guy if you were a 6/10 yourself?

236415,"&gt;not saying there isn't a biological reason but i think a huge part of attraction is the influence society has on you, what you grew up hearing was sexy. i mean back in the day being overweight meant you had money and was powerful = attractive. there's a lot of women who like the dad bods because mass is more attractive than skinny.   you mean back in the day, like when the ancient romans and greeks crafted beautiful, lean sculptures of healthy men and women with lean, muscular physiques because that was deemed attractive?  or maybe back in the day, during the renaissance, when guys like michaelangelo continued to construct similar sculptures like ""david"" designed to show the beauty of the human form?  yes, there were *some* cultures at some points where being an obese emperor was viewed as attractive because of the fact that it meant that you weren't starving. it is facile to state that ""back in the day being overweight"" was attractive, in a general sense.  was it attractive to the spartans, who had all their children training hard in gyms in early childhood?  but sure. the 21st century's contribution to the art world is going to be michaelangelo's *dad bod, accompanied by diabetty in her rascal.*  **edit:** and this is coming from someone who is fat/obese, and who wants to/needs to lose 30-40 lbs because it is unhealthy, i have a fatty liver, i get tired out walking up flights of stairs, and feel like puking when i lift weights. and because i am currently much less attractive now than i was 3 years ago.  but i just got back from an interval run outside in the sun, and i feel awesome. because i'm taking steps to work on this very real problem.  the ""dad bod"" is not attractive. it is the body of a man that has given up. it is not ""more attractive than skinny."" the only type of girl i know that actually finds it attractive is a girl that is overweight herself, and wants to be with a man who is equally fat as her, so she won't feel any more insecure about herself. and the two of them can feel safe in their unhealthiness together.  the only other exception to that which i've encountered has been fit girls, but who have abandonment issues with their fathers, who were distant or not present, and now they like cuddling up to the guys with a belly and a beard because it reminds them of what they missed.  women being attracted to ""dad bods"", which are essentially flabby bodies with excess fat and lack of muscle, are an exception. and they don't tend to be fit themselves.  when was the last time you saw a fit, attractive young women (you know, the type who wears leggings and loves yoga and squats and posts gym selfies on instagram) dating a guy with a dad bod - *unless he is rich or powerful, or at least really funny or interesting or hard working?*  in those cases, i highly, highly doubt that those women are *actually* physically attracted to the dude's flab. they are just **willing to overlook a guy's dad bod, or skinny-fatness, because his body is less important to them than other factors.** whereas men are highly visual, and care way more about appearance than women do.  it's not to say that women don't care about appearance. they do. but appearance isn't the ""be all, end all"" for women that it is for men.  lastly, try flipping your idea that ""mass is more attractive than skinny"" around to women.  have you ever seen a fit, good looking guy dating a fat girl? like, *actually dating in a real relationship, not just hooking up with drunkenly in a one night stand because the guy is horny?*  i highly doubt you have, and if you have, i bet it's incredibly rare.  why? because men don't find ""mass"" more attractive than skinny. and if you look at artwork over the last 10,000 years, you'll see that that is true both for depictions of men and women. pretty much the only exception is the work of reubens, who basically had a bbw fetish, and the venus of willendorf sculpture, which is a fertility goddess with exaggerated proportions and which is carved from the perspective of a pregnant woman looking *down* at her body, resulting in larger-looking body parts.  how many ancient egyptian hieroglyphs and sculptures featured obese people or fat pharaohs? how many hindu temples feature obese people fucking on the walls? even the fat buddha sculptures that everyone knows are not the general representation of siddhartha. they are just *one particular iteration of his image, designed to represent a particular purpose.*  for men, look at the ancient roman sculpture ""laocoon and his sons"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laoco%c3%b6n_and_his_sons  does that look like a bunch of dad bods to you?  for women, look at paintings of nudes from europe after 1500. are they generally proportionally healthy looking bodies? or are they overweight and obese?  sure, they may not look as completely ripped and muscular as today's swimsuit models, but they still aren't ""fat"" or flabby. look at works by titian and rembrandt and renoir. look at titian's ""venus of urbino"" from 1538. look at botticelli's ""birth of venus."" the women all tend to have an attractive hip to waist ratio around 0.7.   and yes, even marilyn monroe had that same ratio. despite the fact that she may not have been quite as ripped *compared to the incredibly lean swimsuit models of today*, she still had a lean, thin, healthy body and healthy body weight. and despite tumblr and myspace and facebook claims that she was plus-size, that kind of thinking is truly delusional and ignorant of how sizing has changed since the 1940s and 1950s.   here are some of her measurements:  &gt;august 2, 1945 &gt;blue book modeling agency &gt;5â€™ 6â€, 120lbs &gt;36-24-34 &gt;â€œsize 12â€  &gt;february 8, 1954 &gt;dod id card &gt;5â€™ 5 1/2â€, 118lbs  &gt;august 5, 1962 &gt;la coroner medical report &gt;5â€™ 5 1/25â€, 117lbs  source: http://themarilynmonroecollection.com/marilyn-monroe-true-size/  lol. a size 12 woman today is likely around 175 lbs. not even close to what marilyn weighed normally. and even though her weight fluctuated, at her heaviest, she still only got to around 140 lbs.  and how many ancient sculptures of female gods like artemis or in the babylonian tradition are obese? how was boudicca represented in brittanic lore? is she a fatty? how about the amazonians?  or how about aztec and incan women, represented on temple sculptures? are they morbidly obese? do they look like they would not be able to fit in a row boat?  yes, maybe the dad bod, or the ""mom bod"" (i.e. a flabby, overweight mom body) might be attractive to a small portion of the population, and yes, maybe there are some chubby chasers out there, but generally, if a fit, active, lean, healthy girl is dating a fat guy, it's because she's willing to overlook his fatness in light of other features, not because she is actually sexually attracted to his flab.  and fit guys are not generally attracted to fat girls, unless they are in the extreme minority of guys who are into bbws, or are just trying to stick their dick somewhere warm for the night.  it's so funny to hear you say that ""mass is more attractive than skinny"".  you sound like mac in ""it's always sunny in philadelphia"" trying to justify his increasingly bulging belly.  yes, mass is more attractive than skinny, if it's *muscle mass* being cultivated. not if it's flab.",1,-2,

550361,"for archiving purposes only, i have copy-pasted u/\_demetri_â€™s story from the linked thread just in case the moderators of that subreddit remove his post.  - - -   satan sunk her teeth into a foot-long subway melt and tongued the greasy bacon as it slid down her throat.   today was a special day, so satan had splurged, crawling up to the surface of the earth, and ordered a special sub from subways.  she was in subway franchise number 551 to shoot a commercial advocating the now famous subway diet, and here she was feasting on a sub sandwich well over the six gram limit.  forbidden condiments splashed across her demonic tongue.  *how ironic* she thought, *how deliciously ironic*, as the turkey and ham fought with the cheese over the right to stimulate satanâ€™s taste buds first.  her complimentary sandwich finished, satan made her way to the makeup chair, her long red hair swaying from side to side around horns.  as the minutes passed, her tired satanic skinny whore countenance was transformed, beneath layers of creamy goo, into a stunning visual of perfect devilish whorishness.   she glanced in the mirror and took in her own beauty.  she was ready.   ready to meet her idol, her sandwich guru, the hunk of fatty flab.  jared fogle.  yes, the evil god that had trundled his way across satanâ€™s tv screen on many lonely nights.  satan thought about jared, and her hand slid down her pants.  a production assistant escorted satan to the set.  he brought her to an unusually large chair screwed into the floor and pointed to it.  satan, well aware of the standard subway seats recognized this one as a fake.  ""i donâ€™t understand, why canâ€™t i just sit in a regular booth?""   the pa smacked her red rear end.  ""shut up and sit down, ya dumb satanic bitch. just get your lines in your head â€˜cuz weâ€™re about to start filming.""   satan sat down and sulked.  her daddy, god, had never talked to her like that before.   her mommy, jesus, had never been so forceful.  it was hurtful, yet it excited her.  she slid her hand down her pants.  the director of the commercial named demetri approached the set and called for places.  demetri noticed satanâ€™s hand down her pants and commanded the cinematographer to tilt up a bit.  satan was getting nervous.  her guts twisted beneath her perfectly flat stomach, with itâ€™s creamy red complexion.  this was her first time before a camera.  she was about to star in a commercial and she had never even been in a school play.  there had been times when satan considered a career in adult films in hell, but the purely vignette kind where there would be no lines involved, save for the the lines of coke snuck in between double-wang fuckstorms.  satan did her best to suppress her nervousness.  she squirmed in her oversized chair.  ""striking,"" demetri called out as he switched on the movie lights.  satanâ€™s eyes struggled to adjust to the brightness.  she focused across the restaurant.  a shadow emerged.  it lumbered seductively across the sticky subway floor and sat itâ€™s big-boned rear end next to satan.  ""how do you like these chairs? there made big, so that we appear smaller, slimmer, sexier.""  it was jared.  if satan had been nervous before, she was terrified now.   her claws shook.  her stomach turned, and her breasts quivered.  how was she to act?  what was she to say to her idol, her *other* god, her tv toughguy.  jared set his heavy hand upon satanâ€™s thigh and whispered comfortingly in her ear, ""i have a pickle cock.""   satanâ€™s tension faded.  she felt warm and loved all over, from the tip of her toes, to the tips of her big, brown, satanic nipples.  the director demetri called for quiet on the set.  all that could be heard was the thumping of satanâ€™s heart and the wheezing of jaredâ€™s breathing.  soon both sounds were drowned out by the whirring of the camera motors.  the director yelled action, and satan proceeded to extol the virtues of subway, and the greatness of jared, her role model, her inspiration, her six-foot-two, two-hundred pound, dream fatty.  her lines flew subconsciously from her sensuous, sharp toothed mouth as she thought of nothing more than this man, this god, this jared.  all that man, all that sexy.  she was obsessed with the diet that he had passed on to her (and who knows how many others) but she secretly wished that jared had never dieted.  he was so hot now, so sweaty and hot.  he was also attractive.  how much more attractive must he have been in all his obese glory, before the diet had stripped away so much sexy.  ""thatâ€™s a wrap."" the director demetri made his way to the pisser to snort some blow as the rest of the crew broke down the set.  jared turned to satan. ""i wish it were a turkey wrap.""  satan tilted her head. ""what?""  jared rubbed his belly. ""demetri said â€˜itâ€™s a wrap,â€™ and i said i wished it were a turkey wrap.""  he rubbed his belly again as he saw visions of turkey wraps and pudding cups dancing before his spectacled eyes.  if there was one thing jared liked, it was fatty foods.  oh how he yearned for them.  it was hard to tell from observing jaredâ€™s beautiful, yet slightly overweight, fat loving chubster body, but the gumpy stud hadnâ€™t eaten anything over six grams since 1998.  the two phantom turkey wraps lowered, hovering side by side, dripping with honey sauce, as the two pudding cups centered themselves in front of the wraps.   jared was transfixed, aching for their tasty goodness.  he reached out and grabbed them.  the production crew had faded out of view.  satan sat there.  satan wouldnâ€™t have said anything even if she had known what to say.  it was a dream, a dream she did not want to wake from.   she sat there in silent ecstasy as jared handled her perky turkey red breasts.  he was in another world, a mystical realm populated by himself, turkey wraps, and pudding.  satan was in a physical world of hands, breasts, and stirring juices.  her seafood and crab sub was fresh and moist between her asiago cheese thighs.  suddenly jared snapped out of his hallucination. ""woh, i think i need something to eat.""  he noticed his hands on the devilâ€™s breasts.  he did not move them.   the production crew left to go eat at taco bell, and the two subway dieters were alone in the subway restaurant.  minutes passed.  jared, always the gentleman, removed his hands from satanâ€™s breasts.  she was still speechless, not knowing how to act in the presence of her idol.  should she play coy?  or should she just undo his size 42 belt, grab his meatball sub, and mow down on it like a satanic whore sucking so much cack?  ""hey, what do you say i make us lunch?"" jared walked behind the counter and masterfully produced to six-inch veggie delight subs.  satan was impressed.  how did jared know that, out of the whole below-six-grams subway menu, the veggie delight was satanâ€™s favorite?   no one could have told him.   surely there was some sort of cosmic connection.  the gods of love had conferred, satan thought to herself, and they had made the destination of jaredâ€™s subway train satanâ€™s vast station.  he was the â€˜râ€™ train, and she was the 34th street stop.  she watched as jared devoured his veggie sub, made another footlong one, devoured it, and drank 32 ounces of diet faygo rootbeer.  the brown liquid dribbled jaredâ€™s chin.  satan couldnâ€™t take it anymore--the fatboy was too much sexy.  she jumped across the counter, licked the faygo from jaredâ€™s weak chin with her long tongue and ripped off his shirt with her sharp demon claw like nails.  ""make sure to lick the underside of my man boobs,"" cried jared. â€œi love children, but you will do.â€  satan ravaged every inch of his pasty torso until she could not resist the urge to splurge any longer.  she depantsed the manly tower of two-hundred-twenty-five-pound losing doughboy and went for his white-bread love bun.  she spent about ten minutes looking for it before she gave up.",1,1,
944058,"the authors are flaunting their ignorance and stupidity. a randomised, controlled trial needs a control group: some participants don't get the treatment. and the assignment to the treatment group or the control group had better depend on something irrelevant such as the toss of a coin, or we will be in trouble when we try to work out cause and effect.  the authors further imagine that the treatment group and the control group have to be similar in size, that is, the randomisation has to be fifty-fifty. this is completely wrong.  if you wanted to set up a randomised trial of parachute effectiveness you could arrange that 99.9999% of the jumpers were assigned to the treatment group and 0.0001% were assigned to the control group. after 10 million jumps, you would have 10 splattered controls and a statistically significance result.  the biggest difficulty in arranging this is in distinguishing the experiment from what sports parachutests do anyway. when you jump out of the plane and pull the ripcord it is like rolling a dice with a 1 in 250 chance of your main shute failing. whoops! you have become a candidate. you cut away and try the reserve. reserves are more reliable. very roughly one time in 4000 you find yourself assigned to the control group. good luck.  american sports parachutests are basically repeating this randomised controlled trial every four years. see  http://www.uspa.org/about/page2/relative_safety.htm  ok no-one is writing this up in the bmj, so it doesn't have the red ribbons and gold braid of a randomised controlled trial, but it does have the substance. there is a control group and assignment is randomised. a rct purist can put his hand on his heart and say: my belief in parachutes is evidence based.  there is another problem with the article. the authors are annoyed at being asked to provide evidence in the form of rct results for treatments in which they have faith. so they write a sarcastic article. the key ingredient is a treatment which is accepted even though there is no rct testifying to its effectiveness. notice the role of controversy in their article.  if a controversial treatment, whose efficacy is doubted, is given a free pass, and allowed into the repetoire of approved treatments without a rct, the authors can say ""what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. our favourite treatment should also be exempted frpm the rct requirement even though it too is controversial.""  notice the direction of the implied comparison. if the treatments that are exempted from the requirement for rct evidence are more controversial than their favourite treatment, then their argument is correspondingly strong. they can say ""you shouldn't be bugging us for evidence, you should be focusing on those over there whose anecdotes are thinner and less plausible than ours""  keep your eye on the direction of the comparison. if they start talking about less controversial treatments, their argument is correspondingly weaker. they might object to demands for rct evidence to support their favourite treatment, but there is something quite natural about the ebm nazis coming for the less convincing treatments first.  if they were doing a straight presentation this would be obvious. you show up the hypocrisy of the ebm nazis by drawing attention to the free passes they give to treatments that might be no good and they are all the more embarrassed if the treatment is especially weak. unfortunately the authors try to be sarcastic. so they turn things around. their logic skills are not up to the job and they get the logic of the comparision the wrong way round. yes, going after a treatment whose efficacy no-one doubts is good comedy, but the more certain the treatment they ridicule, the weaker their argument.",0,,

(probably it is wise to be just a little bit careful doing that, and keep in mind that the physical limits of your body's endurance haven't actually changed.  remember to drink water.)  but what's even more fun is having conversations with people, because everybody is *so interesting*.  you may see a total stranger, and immediately, instinctively, make eye contact, and smile, and converse, because (1) you are tremendously interested in who they are, what they do, where they come from, what experiences they've had, what they are thinking and feeling, etc... and (2) you have infinite social confidence and a total lack of inhibition, so the conversation flows effortlessly.  this is what i like most about the experience -- my biggest weakness (social awkwardness) is now completely 180-degrees reversed.  if you are a natural extrovert maybe you will not notice as much of a difference.  other thoughts: music sounds amazing.  dance to it, or sing along, depending on the type of music.  people are more attractive.  do you remember the scene in ""requiem for a dream"" where jennifer connelly stands naked in front of a mirror?  it's a bit like that.  physical contact feels good.  have someone give you a backrub.  brightly colored moving lights are fun to look at and tend to make your eyes do a flickering-from-side-to-side thing that is mildly pleasant.  the ""peak"", where these effects are strongest and you feel completely enveloped in joy, comes on very quickly and lasts about an hour.  it subsides gradually, and for the next two hours you are calmer -- still social, still having a great time, just not totally mind-blown.  compare this to the effects of alcohol.  drunk people are generally obnoxious, aggressive, and stupid.  mdma doesn't reduce your coordination, slow your reflexes, or impair your judgment the way alcohol does, and it instills a deep sense of respect and empathy for other people.  no one is aggressive on it.  we would have a better society if more people did it.  how many drugs can you say that about?  after three hours you may experience a ""come-down"", whose intensity can vary from person to person and from pill to pill.  usually, for me, coming down just means going someplace comfortable and relaxing and just chilling out for a bit.  try taking a hot bath.  an unusually bad come-down carries a sense of *ennui* -- there's nothing new under the sun, everything we do and say is ultimately fairly pointless.  you're not suicidal or anything, just sort of withdrawn and apathetic.  often, at this point, i will take a second pill.  the effects of the second pill are about half as strong as the first, but it's still a great time.  if i take two pills, i am up all night.  if i only take one, i may get a couple hours of light, restless sleep.  if i take a third pill, i barely feel it at all.  i hardly ever take three pills.  the day after, i feel something hard to describe, i would call it a vague sense of uneasiness.  i can function ok, but something just feels ""a little bit off"".  (it's much, much better than a hangover.)  for two or three days following, my mood is slightly elevated.  some people experience the opposite.  i've been taking mdma about once a month for more than a year.  i haven't seen any negative effects, and it's just as much fun now as it was when i started.",0,,

812359,"there are plenty of cartridges that be used for what you want. everyone is recommending a .22lr, .223r, .308w and a 12 gauge and for good reason. this is the most common ammo, meaning you get more choices for firearms and ammo brands, popular ammo is usually always cheaper, and these calibers will take down just about anything in australia.  im not sure about any youtube videos, but i can explain some ammo terminology for you.  caliber - this refers simply to the diameter of the projectile (and diameter of the bore in your firearm barrel) .223 is smaller than .308 since its a smaller number.  generally the larger the animal, the bigger the caliber you want as larger and heavier projectiles have more energy, leave bigger entry holes, and expand more so you can make cleaner kills on larger game.  smaller projectiles are usually faster and cheaper, so good for small game. just because a cartridge is high caliber doesnt mean its suitable for your needs as it doesnt refer to case size, for example a .357 is thicker than a .308w, but the overall case size is a lot smaller, so youd much rather use the .308w for deer.  grains - unit of measurement for projectiles and gun powder. you may come across two packets of .308w ammo, one says 130 grains and the other 150gr. this is telling you the weight of the projectile. generally higher grains are better for hunting larger game, and the reverse.   shot size - if you ever do decide on a 12 gauge, shot size refers to the size of each individual pellet, higher numbers mean lots of smaller projectiles, while smaller numbers mean fewer but larger projectiles.   for example, on clay targets you can use 9 shot as you have more projectiles to hit the damn thing as youre not concerned with making a clean kill on an inanimate object.  on quail, most would use either no.6 or even 8. the projectiles are slighter fewer, but bigger in order for great shot coverage, but still enough mass in the projectile for a cleaner kill.  on rabbits or hares, you will see people use no.2, 4 and 6. again you have less overall pellets, but larger pellets which have enough energy to down what ever you hit.  you will go all the way down to 1, 0, 00, 000 and then slugs.   target/match/hunting ammo - you may be looking to pickup ammo and see ""target"" and think ""ooh that must be accurate im grabbing that."" and while that may be true, most of these target/match ammo are terrible for hunting as they are designed to stay in shape as opposed to expanding like hunting ammo.   on a packet of ammo you may see the words ""quick expansion"" or ""controlled expansion"" quick expansion means the projectile expands just about instantly on contact with the target for quick energy transfer, making it a great choice for smaller game.  controlled expansion means the projectile expands slower, this is perfect for taking down larger game like deer, as the projectile will mess up the internal organs on a good shot as opposed to expanding on his hide and muscles.  other info - what type of hunting are you doing? if youre going to be walking around, you need to pay attention to the weight of the firearm youre looking at. it may feel lightweight in the shop, but after carrying the damn thing for a while it gets heavy. you may see a firearm with a ""target"" barrel or one with a ""lightweight"" and while heavy barrels are great for target shooting, you really dont want to be lugging one of those around.   scopes - youre probably going to put a scope on the .22lr, .223 and .308 so you should be having a look at them as well.  if you see a scope that says 3-9x40, the 3-9 refers to the magnification range, while the x40 is the size of the objective lens, which lets in more light but will make the scope bulkier. most people grab either around a 3-9 or 4-12 magnification for hunting rifles as this is enough for both closer range and longer range shots. lower magnification can lead to smaller and lighterweight scopes, there are some real small and lightweight 1-4 power scopes.",0,,

272503,"sorry to hear your insurance company wouldnt cover the surgery. granted, the therapist idea would involve some time and effort, it did work for my friend. he said it was suggested to him by somebody who was familiar with dealing with insurance companies and cosmetic surgery.  apparently, there are a fair amount of procedures done by cosmetic surgeons that generally arent covered by insurance, but when the patients pushed back and got  other doctors involved (in this case, the shrink) to state that it went beyond just a cosmetic 'fix' and that the issue was creating significant psychological distress, the insurance companies will sometimes give in, thinking that spending a couple thousand bucks for the surgery would cost less, overall, than many years of psychotherapy, depression meds, etc.  im not exactly up to date on what the surgery costs nowadays. have you researched pricing at all? i think there are a couple different ways now that they can remove it. one is more of a traditional method where they make a slight incision beneath the nipple then kind of 'cut' out the excess growth, and another method which is closer to a kind of liposuction, i believe. one of my friends had the older method done about 12-15yrs ago and i think it cost him like $3k or so, but im pretty sure its a bit cheaper nowadays. he had a small scar under each nipple, but wasnt too noticeable.  when you say your right pec is bigger than the other, do you mean just the nipple area?(like an inch or so around it) or does it kind of effect a larger portion of the pec?  the fact that you never really noticed any sensitivity around the nipples in the past is good news. it means you probably arent as sensitive to estrogen as you might think. also, you might handle androgens better now that you are leaner, too. the fact that you were heavier when you were younger certainly exacerbated the estrogen issue. i forget the exact biological explanation/process that causes this, but for whatever reason, carrying excess fat with cause testosterone and other androgens to 'aromatize' (convert to estrogen after a certain point) much more than if you were leaner.  this is why men who are overweight tend to develop ""man boobs"" (which are quite different than actual 'gyno'.) because the extra estrogen tends to direct increased fat deposits around the breast area (just like how heavier women tend to develop much larger fatty breasts that you can actually feel a difference between...normal fat tissue tends to be a bit firmer).  so now that you are leaner you will almost certainly produce less aromataese enzyme, which is what was the enzyme responsible for converting the excess testosterone you started to produce during puberty into estrogen.  hopefully, this should allow you to use the test/dbol without as much of a problem than if you had used it when heavier.  this also happened to one of my earlier workout partners. when we were growing up he was a bit heavy through grade school and into high school. not too heavy, but definitely noticeably overweight. he also developed slight gyno during puberty. into his mid-late teens he started working out and lost a good amount of weight. so when he started using steroids in his early 20s he could use 500mg/wk of testosterone without any extra problems, even without nolvadex.  you will read a lot of guys says that to lose fat you 'must' take certain steroids rather than others, and while certain drugs do have different attributes that can make them somewhat a better fit for fat loss or weight gain, the truth is that you can just as well lose fat on any of them. again, it really comes down to caloric intake/expenditure. too many other guys dont seem to get this and wonder why they arent losing fat when they take winstrol/anavar/tren/whatever, when the problem is that they simply forget that you cant lose fat without dropping those calories. which is exactly why probbs use bulking cycles, then switch things up towards a contest and restrict calories severely to burn fat before the show. using the steroids during a 'cutting' cycle doesnt add any extra muscle, really, it just helps to retain what muscle you have by trying to keep your body in a condition where its preferring fat over muscle as fuel.  ive had huge success dieting with large doses of anadrol when the standard thinking is that you can only use anadrol for bulking, which is bullshit because there's nothing better than a very strong androgen for maintaining lean mass while really restricting calories. and any excess water that may be retained on those type of drugs is quickly lost when you stop using the drug, or add drugs to handle that excess estrogen.  so you do have the right idea, though our bodies vary so much throughout the day depending on what we've eaten, physical activity, stress, amount of sleep, etc...it all effects whether our bodies are creating muscle or burning it for fuel.  best bet, is that if your main goal is to lose fat, then target that. make it your entire goal. dont try to hard to both gain muscle and lose fat during this cycle. because of the variances in our bodies due to changing conditions each day (as stated above) there's going to be times during the cycle where some days you will burn fat, other days when you gain muscle, others when you will break even. so we all will see some gains/losses as we progress. you may just want to pick one as your main goal this time and  then you can always go the other direction in your next cycle.  it's not impossible to accomplish both at the same time, but when first starting out it will be far easier for you target one goal. especially with test/dbol. you'll find it a little easier when you get more experience under your belt to gain lean mass while dropping some fat when using some of the other drugs. things like gh make it easier even for clueless guys to have a fair shot at accomplishing both goals.  personally, i always use test, tren and eq at all times (and mean that literally...i stay on gear year round sometimes for up to three years or so at a time in some cases) and then i add or remove certain other drugs to that combo throughout the year depending on whether im trying to gain mass or lose some fat for the summer.  and while i can just as easily gain mass or lose fat while using just the combo of test, tren and eq, its just a little easier if, for instance i add anadrol during bulking (which im also on right now) and in spring, i'll remove the anadrol and add maybe winstrol, then clenbuterol and t3.  i also use gh year round, too, which at 8-10iu a day makes it easy to remain very lean and even still lose fat while bulking and eating pretty much whatever (i hate dieting....so i admittedly take excess dosages of certain drugs to make up for my sloppiness in diet. and steroids are cheap enough for the most part that as long as im not having any health issues, why not?? after 20+ years of taking steroids you get kinda tired of dieting too hard, etc...i like my pizza, giant steaks and ben&amp;jerry's too much...)  so as far as a 'magic' drug, there really isnt one drug that will do it all, but many will say that growth hormone is the closest thing to it if you use it right. it's not always cheap and it can take months to start to see decent results, gh is awesome for fat loss. even after years of dieting and working out, i, too, had that aggravating small amount of extra fat at the lowest part of my abdomen that was just frustrating as fuck because i couldnt get rid of it, even while dieting and taking other drugs.  but when i finally tried gh about 15 years ago, bam! i burned right through it. wasnt overnight, mind you, but it was suprisingly quicker than i thought it would take.  so that's something to keep in mind. a lot of guys here would jump on you and bash you if you said you wanted to use gh as a beginner but they would be fucking idiots. all too often the self-proclaimed 'gurus' on forums like this would say ""gh isnt for novices! you should only use gh after you tried everything else, or gained years of experience with other steroids first!"" etc and other total bullshit like that. gh is fucking far safer than almost all the rest of the drugs we take (though pretty much all steroids are way the fuck safer than most of the scare stories would lead you to believe) and in fact, gh was primarily used in growth deficient children for decades and even now is prescribed to people in almost every stage of life. from 8 year old kids to 98 year old ladies. side effects are rare as hell.  the only reason i would suggest maybe waiting before trying gh is that you might find that one of the cheaper options might do the job. no sense spending extra cash on gh if 6 months of test/tren/eq or some clenbuterol and t3 might get rid of that fat.  in fact, you may want to try clen and t3 after you finish this cycle. you could also use them during the cycle, too, if your main goal overall is an all out assault on losing that fat (novices will find it hard to tweak their diet correctly for gaining muscle while on t3) clen and t3 are pretty damn cheap, too. even a couple months worth of clen would cost you maybe $30-40 and the t3 might cost a bit more depending on how much you wanted to take. but there's no need to jump onto those drugs right now. they are also very safe when used correctly, but if you havent researched them yet, check them out at some point.",1,-1,
490521,"q&amp;a compiled: 2/7/2012 @ 11am est some questions are edited slightly for length.      removed some duplicate questions.      op's proof. [hospital badge](http://i.imgur.com/1xg6u.jpg)      **i am not op**. i am simply reformatting all the questions and answers in this thread for easy browsing.     question | answer  :-- | :--  what is the strangest body you ever examined | recently i examined a fetus that had no heart, as a consequence the entire upper body did not develop. it was basically only legs. | what death under suspicious circumstances has disturbed you the most? | in one case i could not find any cause of death during the autopsy, i reported it as an unknown cause of death. days later, the police found out the deceased had been choked with a pillow by her granddaughter. just to clear things up, i deal with non-violent deaths, the violent ones are done by police doctors, but sometimes a case comes in as a natural cause of death and during the autopsy (or later, as above) we find out that it was not natural.  | raw brains. squishy? do they have a unique (sweet?) smell? |the consistency is akin to a hard pudding or flan. don't really smell like anything, but we use maks during the autopsy. | what is the strangest thing you've ever found in someone's stomach contents? | nothing really strange in the stomach, but once i found a whole steak lodged in the trachea of a person who choked. |  what cause of death is the most difficult to deal with? | no particular cause of death, but corpses in decomposition are always bad. |  you get to choose how you die. how do you want to go? | i quote tyrion lannister: ""in my own bed, at the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and a girls mouth around my c**k."" |  what is the most violent death you've ever dealt with? | i've seen some cases of car accidents that were pretty nasty. |  what is the most unusual mode of death you've ever encountered? |  i saw a aneurism that burst to the lung and the person bled to death from the mouth/nose, that was pretty weird.|  is it possible to swallow so much semen that your stomach ruptures and you die? i ask this for a friend... | rofl! i guess, but probably not from a single man. the stomach capacity is about 1 litre, but it stretches a bit more, and the person would have to hold everything in without throwing up, so i'm guessing if your friend could hold down about 2 litres of smen, it could burst. of course, stomach capacity varies from one person to another, so it could be more. i don't recommend it, but it would make a hell of an er story. |  what can i do to make any autopsy that might be performed on my body a more pleasant experience for the pathologist?  i was thinking of implanting a small piece of metal somewhere in my body that says, ""hello and thank you for performing this autopsy. love, willravel"" | just tattoo it on your chest :d. and being thin actually helps. obese people are hard to fit in the examination table and the fat makes it harder to dissect the organs. you could also tattoo your medical history in your chest or other easy to read place, since most doctors do a crappy job filling out the autopsy requisition form. |  i recently lost a friend to a heroin overdose. could you tell me what happens? did she die in pain? | it's not really my area of expertise, but i guess not. heroin depresses the central nervous system, so i'm guessing that she just kind of slept.  |  what's the most ironic death you've seen? | i don't recall any case particularly ironic in itself, but once i did 2 autopsies in a day. both patients complained of heartburn and chest pain, then suddently died. the first was attended by a cardiologist who thought it was a heart attack and the second by a gastroenterologist who thought it was an ulcer. the first patient had a peforated ulcer and the second had a heart attack. |  **follow up**: do you think they would have lived if they had been under opposite doctors? | hard to tell, but if they switched doctors, maybe. if the guy with the ulcer went to the gastroenterologist, his diagnosis would have been correct, but he might still have died. both died soon after arriving at the doctor, who knows? |  any bodies that have insects/eggs inside? | yes, when they are decomposing it's unavoidable, there is always some maggots, bugs and eggs. but i have also performed an autopsy on a man who had fly larvae in a ulcer in his groin when he was alive. |  any women who still look pretty eventhough they're dead? | it's hard to judge, ocasionally you see a woman who might have been pretty when she was alive, but that's just the thing, dead people are just different, they could have been supermodels when they were alive, dead bodies are just dead bodies i guess. maybe i'm just desensitized. |  ever see a body twitch or move? | i've never seen a body move, but before my time, there was a case in which after the organs in the torso had been removed, when they were opening the head to remove the brain, the body jerked violently. the professor performing the autopsy and the resident that was with him burst out of the room in panic. turns out the saw the technician was using was short-ciruting and had sent an electric jolt throught the body. the technicians still laugh about the look on the professor's face. |  most shocking death you've seen (the aftereffects of, that is)? | car accidents are usually the most gory ones, you see heads smashed in, dismemberment and stuff like that, but really, i'm quite used to it. |  also, would you consider yourself completely desensitized to gore and violence? | the gory part doesn't really affect me anymore, but the smell of decomposing bodies is still very nasty. |  a konp fun fact: | we're biologically hardwired to have our stomachs flip and feel a need to vacate the area when we smell rot and decomposition. back in the hunter gatherer days it would have prevented the spread of contagion.  |  was there any autopsy in which you were affected by enough where it changed/affected you or your life? | no, i don't recall any single one being a life-changing event. but i learn something from all autopsies i perform, and some affect me emotionally, like kids and teenagers, i'm always saddened by the loss of potential, you know? like, they could become so many things and that is wasted. but so far i haven't performed any autopsies powerful enough to bring about an epiphany. |  i was wondering what was the biggest mistake as a pathologist, or an early embarrassing mistake or something when you were first starting out? | i once overlooked a breat tumor in a biopsy. luckly for me the attending physician got the repport before the patient did and called me to tell me he was sure the tumor was in the specimen he had sent me. and indeed, when i went back to the specimen, it was there. i started paying much more attention on gross examination after that. i still feel bad about it though. luckly for the patient, the margins were free and it was a low grade tumor, but it's still no excuse. |  what is the biggest penis you have seen? | i once saw a pr0n movie where a guy a huge one. but in the autopsy room? i don't know, i guess we don't really pay attention to things like that, most people don't die because of their penises. |  what's a typical day for you? | i work most days at the hospital with biopsies, so i wake up and go to the hospital and work all day behind a microscope. but once a week i work on the autopsy service i mentioned, on home call. i get called in whenever a body is brought to the service, i go in, perform the autopsy and go back home. |  what's the most interesting or weirdest autopsy you've had experience with? | the most interesting autopsies from a medical point of view are the unusual presentations of disease. i mentioned the aneurism that burst into the lung already, but other interesting cases include a heart lymphoma (it's pretty rare) and a huge melanoma metastasis to the liver, the liver weighted over 7 kg (it usually weights about 2 kg). |  how often do you get stumped--as in, you just can't figure out what killed your subject? | every once in a while we get cases where we can't figure out what happened. it's usually old patients who probably had some type of heart arhythmia, since you need to see the heart beating to diagnose that, when they get to me, i'm pretty stumped. i'd say 1 in 10 cases or something around that. |  anyone ever wake up while you were doing your job? | nope. the bodies take a few hours to get to our service usually and by that time they are cold, rigid and presenting hypostasis, so we're pretty sure they are dead. |  follow up: my mom apparently was pronounced dead on arrival from a car accident before i was born but woke up and was trying to find a place to take out her contacts when a nurse came in and promptly freaked out. didn't know how frequently things like that happened. | i've heard of cases like that, but i've never actually seen one. i hope no one ever wakes up on me. lol |  i read an article last year that suggested that a high amount of people who die in car accidents have small, undiagnosed tumors. have you seen any truth to this? | it's probably true. there are several types of tumors (benign or malignant) that are asymptomatic. this is one of the reasons full body scans are not recomended, you may find tumors that would never give any problems to the person. |  **follow up**: what about if you are having wacky symptoms but all of your blood work comes back clean? | then the question was wrong. someone once said something like ""to know the answer first you need to know the right question"". blood work should be used to confirm a clinical diagnosis, it should not be used to diagnose problems. many diseases might not have any specific results on blood tests. talking to your doctor usually helps a lot, if your doctor doesn't want to take his time in talking to you and examining you properly, then perhaps you should find another doctor. i know it's hard to know which doctors are good or not, but that's a tip. good doctors take their time listening to history and examining the patient before ordering a huge number of tests. |  ever found anything strange up someone's butt? | nope. but a friend of mine found a zuchini, it was so big the guy perforated his colon with it. he said he slipped and fell on it. |  weirdest thing you've found in a persons body? | there was also a surgical pad that was forgotten inside the body of a patient years ago. it had formed a huge mass in the abdomen that was clinically diagnosed as a tumor. the patient died of unrelated causes (pneumonia, i think), but it was still weird. |  who requests autopsies? | it varies according to local legislation. here in brazil there are 2 types of autopsies, for medical purposes and forensic autopsies. medical autopsies are requested by doctors who don't know the cause of death of a given person. forensic autopsies are requested by the police in cases of violent/suspicious deaths. i believe in the uk and other places this works differently. |  any crazy deaths? anything that might win a darwin award? | well, i remember only one darwin award worthy event, a was a guy who climbed in a sugar cane grinder to clean it, because some stuff got stuck inside, but did not unplug it first. while he was cleaning, the cane or whatever came loose and he was sucked in. it wasn't pretty. there was not much to perform an autopsy on. |  **follow up**: if the cause of death is pretty apparent, like in this man's case, what is the purpose of his autopsy? why was it ordered in the first place?| all violent/suspicious deaths go through an autopsy for legal reasons. they need to have it on record for trials, etc. in this case it was a work accident, the family might claim the employer of the guy didn't provide him with necessary protection/training, etc. the autopsy report is part of the evidence in the case. in natural deaths, when the cause of death is apparent an autopsy is not needed |  **follow up**: so what did you do if there wasn't much to cut open/look at? | i didn't perform the autopsy, i was just there when the guy arrived, it was performed by the police doctor, but he just noted down the several lacerations, dismemberments, etc the guy had suffered and signed the death certificate. it's pretty standard procedure for them. they observe and report (i think it's a legal medicine motto). |  what's the training like? | you go through pathology residency, where you learn how to examine the organs (how to dissect and cut them) and how to analyse the microscopy slides afterwards. in brazil it takes 3 years, i understand that it varies according to the country. |  a planification fun fact: in some places in the us, it's actually a politically appointed position. there was an excellent [frontline documentary on it a few months ago](http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/arts/television/01postmortem.html). | in the us there are coroners, that position doesn't exist in brazil. the cases are sent to autopsy directly by the police or by the physician who attended the deceased. but the same problems occur here, in our service it's a little better, but the doctors working for the police don't have to pathologists and some are very negligent. in an ideal world, each area of forensics would be handled by an expert in that field, a pathologist to perform autopsies, a gynecologist for rape cases, etc... we're still far from that, unfortunately. i read an article last year that suggested that a high amount of people who die in car accidents have small, undiagnosed tumors. have you seen any truth to this? | it's probably true. there are several types of tumors (benign or malignant) that are asymptomatic. this is one of the reasons full body scans are not recomended, you may find tumors that would never give any problems to the person. |  what drew you towards pathology as a specialty? | i thought about doing forensic medicine and figured pathology would be a good start, before doing anything specific on forensics, but during the residency, i realized that i liked surgical pathology better, so i'm just a pathologist now. but i still like the forensic stuff lol. |  what is the most disturbing thing you have seen? you must have seen a lot of crazy shit.. whats one that sticks out in your mind? | the weird stuff usually becomes anedoctes to tell other pathologists. what really sticks is the sad deaths. last week i performed an autopsy on a 15 y/o girl who died wearing a wristband for nossa senhora do bonfim, before you tie that wristband you make a wish, and when the band breaks it comes true. that wish will never come true. |  what is something that you'd be able to find during an autopsy, but couldn't find while the person was alive? | in the autopsy room itself, i can't think of anything like that, but there are tumors that are misdiagnosed through imaging techniques and can be better diagnosed just by actually looking at them on gross examination. histology is still better than imaging exams for detecting several types of disease, but really, one supports the other, the information from the imaging exams helps us make better diagnosis. and you wouldn't want to waste a lot of money performing expensive imaging techniques on a body anyway. and it's way harder to make the contrast circulate after you're dead. |  **follow up**: an unfortunate anecdote by joggle1 | i, unfortunately, have a pretty good example. my wife (who was 24) had been experiencing shortness of breath from time to time since moving to denver a bit over a year ago. we thought it was perhaps due to the altitude. still, i was worried so had her see a doctor. the doctor did a basic exam and chest x-ray but didn't find anything. one night, she was breathing quickly while laying in bed. it went away after a few minutes, but still seemed pretty odd. i asked a doctor friend of mine the next day and he told me that unless she's having symptoms when she's at the hospital, they likely won't find the cause because there's just too many things that can cause shortness of breath. he told me to take her to the er room if it happened again. he also told me that sometimes they don't find the cause until there's an autopsy. i never saw her have those symptoms again. however, a few months later, she collapsed and died while alone at home from a pulmonary embolism. my doctor friend later told me the exact test that would have found the blood clots in her lungs, but it's an expensive ct scan that isn't performed unless the doctor already has reason to suspect an embolism. |  does a person's lung that smoked for his whole life really look that disgusting as in some anti-smoking ads? | it could, but the ads push it a bit, they show the worst of the worst they could find. |   have you ever done an autopsy and came to zero conclusions? | yes. those cases end up as ""unknown cause of death"". according to the literature it might happen in up to 20% of the cases. |  why perform autopsy's on people when it's extremely obvious why/how they died? is it a ""law"" thing? | in natural causes of death, it's not necessary, if the cause is obvious, the attending physician can sign the death certificate. in violent/suspicious deaths, it's necessary because the autopsy report could be needed in trial or for investigation. |    ever had to do an autopsy on someone that you knew? if not, what happens in that scenario? | never happened to me, but i imagine i would ask a colleague to perform the autopsy. |   what is a preventative health step that many people overlook that performing autopsies has motivated you to adopt? | obesity and smoking are probably the top two things i see in the autopsy room that are related to the causes of death. i'm trying to quit smoking and i'm thin(ish), but honestly, autopsy room shows you that you could go any moment, so on the other hand it makes you think you should enjoy life while you can |  how often do you find undiagnosed genetic abnormalities - single ventricle, dextracardia, stomach in the chest, etc.? | in stillborn fetuses it's quite common specially small heart malformations. in adults it's quite rare. |  when does rigor mortis set int? in various csi shows the stiffs are not stiff at all... | 1-2 hours after death |  have you discovered any murders or suicides that were unsuspected before the autopsy? | in one case, i couldn't figure out the cause of death and i reported it as unknown cause. days later, the police found out the granddaughter the choked the woman with a pillow. but there was nothing in the autopsy suggesting it, which is strange because asphyxia usually leaves some clues. in another case, we found a massive hematoma associated with a skull fracture in am elderly man. i don't know what the investigation concluded, but it was definetly not a ""natural cause"" of death. |  is it your job to put the bodies back together when you're done? | we put the organs inside the body after the examination and sew it up. we deliver the body clean and ""closed"", but it's the funerary home that makes the body ""pretty"" for the wake with make-up, flowers, etc. |  how common are autopsies in brazil? only for deaths where the person is young or the cause is uncertain or suspicious? can doctors or families request them? | most big cities in brazil have an autopsy service, but many places still don't. some places don't even have regular doctors, let alone pathologists. so i'm guessing it's not very common in brazil as a whole, but it's improving. autopsies are supposed to be performed only when the cause of death is unknown, suspicious or violent. we perform autopsies for natural causes of death and the police performs the autopsies on suspicious/violent cases, sometimes we pass our cases on to them if we find something strange and vice-versa. usually doctors request the autopsies, but if the family wants it, it can ask the doctor to forward the case to us. but usually, the families just want to mourn the person, so the quicker they can get the death certificate, the better. and that means no autopsy. |  where do you have your lunch on a typical day? | i usually have lunch at home, since i work on home call. but if you're wondering if we eat on the autopsy room, then the answer is no. that's just gross. lol |  i dated a mortician briefly. she said that occasionally (rarely) the bodies would makes noises and even move a little, but that it was a natural thing. truth to this? got story to go with it? | i've heard the tales also, but never saw anything like that happen. |  if you had a fresh body with no trauma, no clues to begin, what is your jumping-off checklist of things to look for? | we examine the major organs, most deaths come from some problem in one of them. i usually begin by opening the trachea to make sure the person hasn't choked (it's more common than you'd think) then we weight the organs in the chest and abdomen and examine them all. then we move on to the brain. most causes of death leave some morphological ""clue"" behind. when we can't find any, we sign it as an unknown cause of death. sometimes histology helps, but usually if you can't find anything in the autopsy room, you won't find anything later. after a while, examining the organs becomes pretty automatic, it goes fast. |  what is the largest tumor you have ever seen someone with? have you found any crazy parasites living inside of people? what is the strangest cause of death you have ever seen? | the largest tumor was a melanoma metastasis in the liver wheighting at 7 kg and about the size of a basketball. a colleague found an ovarian cyst weighting 18 kg, but that was before my time. no crazy parasites, but i have seen tapeworms, roundworms, fly larvae and cysticercus. strangest causes of death would be the whole steak lodged in the trachea and the aneurism that burst to/inside the lung and the person bled to death from the mouth/nose. |  why did you decide to become a pathologist? | initially i wanted to work in forensic medicine and i thought pathology would be a good background. during the residency i liked the work as a pathologist better and gave up on forensics. i still like the forensic part of the job, though, i guess that's why i keep working in an autopsy service (and working from home once a week doesn't hurt either, lol). |  this is kinda weird, but have you ever gone home and realized you may have tracked some guts or fluids into your car/home/person that may have gotten underneath your scrubs? | i once dropped some blood on my shoes, just a few drops. but that's about it, and i was a resident, so i was still kind of sloppy. i usually try to keep my workspace as clean as possible. we have a water hose next to the examination table and a constant water flow on the table, to wash the blood, fluids, etc away, so it's reasonably clean. |  how many autopsies do you perform in a typical workday? | usually 2-3 autopsies. we only perform autopsies on people who die in our city (about 600 thousand inhabitants). the smaller towns in our region are handled by another service which does a little less than us (about 1-2 autopsies per day). |  what is the most disgusting thing you've seen at your job? | once i saw the technicians scooping out buckts of maggots out of a body. that one takes the ""most disgusting"" award for sure. |  have you ever come across situs inversus (reversed/mirrored organs)? | not a situs inversus totalis, where all organs are mirrored, but i've seen a heart on the right side twice. |  what is medical education like in brazil? | we have good schools and bad schools, i guess it's the same everywhere. in brazil the best schools are in public universities. private ones are only after profit, so they'll basically let anyone get a diploma as long as they pay. the medical board tries to close that type of school down, but doctors are not good as good as university owners at lobbying i guess, lol. |  biggest regret as a pathologist? | the biggest regret i've had was missing the tumor on a breast specimen (i've talked about that somewhere here). i think that's the same regret as a human being, it showed me i was being neglectful and it's something that still bothers me every time i think about it (thanks guys... jk). |  when you are watching an autopsy on a tv show or movie, does it bother you? | every time they perform a biopsy on house it annoys me, they pick a slab of tissue, put it on a slide and voilÃ¡ it's microscope ready. it makes people think slides come out that fast, there's no processing needed. i think some surgeons at the hospital buy that, because they send the sample over and call imediatly afterwards asking about the result. god damn you, house md! |  **follow up**: how do the biopsy slides need to be processed? | the material collected from the lesion (or whatever) needs to be fixed in a fixative medium (usually formaldehyde) for a certain amount of time (varies according to the size of the specimen). then areas of interest are selected (this is done during the gross examination of the specimen), then sliced thinly (about 2 mm thick). these slices go through a series of chemical baths (alcohol, xylene and paraffin) to make the tissue ready for being embeded in a paraffin block (most labs don't use actual paraffin anymore, but that's beside the point). this block is then cooled and sliced in a microtome in slices about 5 micron. these slices are then placed on glass slides and stained with the adequate stains. after that, a mounting medium is applied and a coveslip over the mounting medium. that is roughly the process and i'm skipping a few steps, lol. there are, of course, automatic machines that do all that, but it still takes a few hours in the least to make a slide for microscopic examination. |  is the pay good? | since i work from home, if you count the time actually spend doing the autopsies versus the money i get, it's pretty good per hour. but overall, not really. and the hospital pay is terrible lol. i might leave the hospital soon because of that. there are services that pay really well, but i graduated in this hospital so i'm getting mixed feelings about leaving my ""alma mater"" lol. |  ama table guy, where are you? | am i the table guy? [edit: i believe i can help you out there ;] ) |  when you first started out, did being in such close contact with the corpses bother you? | we have contact with corpses during med school, so by the time you get to residency, you're already used to it. never had any trouble sleeping (except today, because i'm here answering you guys, lol). didn't affect me emotionally at all. on my first autopsy i got chewed by a professor because it was at night and i hadn't done any autopsies before, and she expected me to know stuff already because she thought i had already done autopsies in the morning. unfortunately, that was a slow day and i didn't do any in the morning, so late at night, she comes to the autopsy room and is like ""why haven't you began the autopsy yet?!?"" lol but she was nice when she understood i had no idea how to perform an autopsy. |  a med student did an ama a year or so ago. he said the most interesting part of an autopsy was the little differences in every body. like, some people lack certain muscles (without ever knowing), or the organs are mirrored. could you give some more examples and tell us how common things like that are? | small variations are very common, the most common arrangement of the veins in the arm, for exemple, happen in only about 20% of the people, so only 1 in every 5 people have the ""normal"" veins. but major alterations, like mirrored organs are pretty rare. |  does anything gross you out? | maggots. |  do you believe in ghosts/spirits/supernatural? | i don't, because... well, i guess i've never seen anything that would make me believe that. i mean, if a ghost showed up in my living room, and i could prove i wasn't insane, wait... it's a bit of a catch 22, isn't it? |",1,-1,1

""why is there a fat person in this group, im disgusted."" to simple comments such as ""fat"" or ""gross."" i even hear, ""if she keeps dancing like that, she'll def lose weight"". those comments honestly have me cackling since i've been dancing my whole life. i've just been cursed with a shitty metabolism and obesity problems from the white side of my family.  has getting into k-pop changed my perception? yes. i was already leaning towards the korean view of beauty, but starting a joining a dance team has definitely hit me in the head with those standards. i've done some research in college and have written a paper on the concept of beauty standards in korea. i could definitely conclude that there is a very very heavy push for people to have the ""ideal body type."" i can say that over the years there have been more and more people not conforming to that, but the looming idea that being skinny makes you a better person is definitely still there. i'm moving to korea in a few yrs to work and say that i am afraid that i won't be able to lose weight by then and suffer socially.   i will say it is a bit silly to compare yourself to someone who works as a person who must keep up with the ""ideal"" beauty standard. as much as i don't want to say it, this is ~kinda~ what kyla signed up for. i'd just wish she wasn't so young to hear it. i love love love that kyla is her size, but she definitely isn't going to hear the end of it when it comes to her body image. :(",1,-1,1

755252,"title is a little ambiguous.  are you comparing which of the two is more difficult to get sexy from, or are you asking ""is it more difficult to get sexy from an overweight [and] weaker state, [compared to someone non overweight and not weak]?  the latter of the two questions is obvious; assuming that the basic definition of sexy is someone who is cut, fit, and toned, then obviously someone who is not overweight will have an easier time getting to a sexy body than someone who is overweight.  the former of the two questions is less so; both will take time and effort to get to a sexy body with muscle. a weaker body (which i will assume is an anorexic, malnourished body) will have a hard time due to the fact that gaining muscle is really slow. like 1-2lbs of muscle if you're lucky kind of slow.  an overweight body will just have to lose the weight, which can be done much faster. generally, overweight people, if not morbidly obese, have larger amount of muscle already, considering that they have to be able to move around much larger amounts of mass constantly. see ""the biggest loser"": most of the winning contestants at the end look actually quite fit and sexy due to the muscle they already had. they just needed to lose the fat. of course, losing fat is not easy either, and motivation issues might make this harder.",1,-1,1
460403,"&gt; bradley universityâ€™s womenâ€™s studies   funny, men and women both get fat, why isn't the men's stu... oh.  anyway, let's get it from the [horse's mouth](https://bradley.edu/sites/bodyproject/fatism/skinny/). (love that url.)   &gt; there are two commonly held assumptions about fat. one is that it is unhealthy to be heavy.   increased risk of... well, damnear everything fatal. so this is a valid assumption.  &gt; the other is that if they tried, heavy people could lose weight.   if they tried and didn't half-ass it? they'd lose something. they'd *have* to. they won't go down to being twigs, but you can't tell me that someone hit 300 pounds entirely by accident. the extra mass didn't materialize by itself - someone put it there.  &gt; these assumptions help to reinforce stereotypes of heavy people as being lazy, undisciplined, unhealthy and gluttonous.  but if the assumptions are valid, what does it say about the stereotype? and even if the stereotype is false, it doesn't invalidate those two assumptions.  &gt; in general, weight loss methods prove to be ineffective for most people, and may in fact pose serious health risks making the cure for obesity worse than the condition itself.   exercise and eating vegetables is dangerous? oh, come on, there's gotta be *some* vegetarians and vegans in your department, how'd that get past them?  &gt; the truth about fat and health  the difference between social science and real science  &gt; the new england journal of medicine reports that â€œthe data linking fat with death and the data showing losing weight to be healthy are limited, fragmentary, and often ambiguousâ€ (kristen 2000: 67).          someone got that paper? because that half-sentence quote tastes distinctly of fresh-picked cherries from here.  &gt; chronic dieting causes weight gain and may eventually make weight loss a physical impossibility.  ok, what's chronic exercising do? or are we assuming everyone who tries to lose weight is a fad dieter?  &gt; studies have found an association between weight loss and weight fluctuations and an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.  ""weight loss and weight fluctuations"". wait wait wait. fluctuation is gain *and* loss. why couldn't i say, with equal validity, ""studies have found an association between weight gain and weight fluctuations and an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease."" i got as many study citations as you!  &gt; significant health problems and fatalities sometimes result from weight loss surgeries.  yeah, everyone needs to undergo surgery before they start walking a mile a day.  &gt; many obesity â€œcuresâ€ have been found to cause harm.  what, like the shit i get in my spam folder? they sell ""herbal viagra"" too, so i could as easily say that a hard dick is found to cause- oh fuck i'm giving them ideas.  &gt; studies have found that when heavy people were fit, their death rates were nearly the same as people who were considered lean and fit.  define ""fit"". we talking sumo wrestlers, active and strong big guys, or have we just adjusted ""heavy people"" so far downward we include those built-like-a-barrel guys who powerlift? mikhail koklyaev might be ""heavy"" at 350 pounds, but he's deadlifted well over twice that. i certainly hope his demographic isn't being included with the people who kill a bucket of kfc in a sitting.   &gt; risks of diabetes and heart disease were reduced for heavy people who engaged in regular exercise and practiced sound eating even if they did not lose weight.  if you're gonna yell at me, i'm gonna ask point blank: how many ""heavy"" people engage in regular exercise and sound eating?  &gt; studies have identified over 100 genes that contribute to the etiology of obesity (kristen 2000: 69).  yes, you can be dealt a bad genetic hand. you want to shut me up? show me the percentage of obese people who eat more calories than they output vs. those who have the ""fat genes"" (big bones?).  &gt; another inaccurate assumption that is commonly made about heavy people is that they must have poor dietary habits and do not engage in physical activity.   your last two assumptions weren't inaccurate. you just claimed they supported a stereotype then attacked the stereotype, poorly. make your next strawman out of drier materials, the wet stuff doesn't ignite well.  &gt; people who are thin are not automatically healthy because they are thin.   true. anorexics, for one. people recovering from a long disease are also often thin.  &gt; nor is their thinness an automatic indication of good nutrition and adequate exercise.   but it's not an automatic indication of the opposite either. and if you have to play the odds, i know what it's *more likely* to indicate.  &gt; moreover, with good nutrition and exercise one may be heavy and still be fit and enjoy good health.   ok, a challenge. an average heavy person (and i mean average - half the people of his/her weight are less healthy and half are healthier) vs me: my weight's on the high side of normal, and i have a knee injury so i'm not even average or that fit. we start on the ground floor of a skyscraper and climb stairs until we can't. not until someone wins, but until we have to give up. who will win and by how much?   &gt; a growing number of scientists agree that weight is not the determining factor for poor health, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity are.   and what are the primary physical indicators of poor nutrition and lack of physical activity?   &gt; this is true whether an individual is heavy or thin. nevertheless, health insurance is denied to many large people because of their size. if health coverage is granted, they are often forced to pay higher premiums compared to those of average weight.  surprised you didn't try to sell socialized health care there.  &gt; weight prejudice and medical practice  &gt; many heavy patients report distressing experiences with health care providers. (http://www.fwhc.org/health/fatfem.htm)   (follows link.) ""fat and feminist large women's health experiences"" aaaaaaaaaand into the trash it goes. anecdote is not the singular of data, even when you call it an autoethnography.  &gt; physicians and health care providers frequently focus solely on an individualâ€™s body size rather than their actual health problem.  how often are they wrong? tell me how many healthy fat people there are.  &gt; heavy patients are commonly advised to lose weight regardless of their state of health. and while a thin person is given medication or other appropriate treatments, a heavy person with the same symptoms may simply be told to lose weight.  well, yeah. would you rather doctors ignore an obvious symptom and assume every obese patient with heart problems has, say, congenital defects? look, my aunt died two days after leaving the hospital with her new baby. completely unrelated to her recently giving birth as it turns out, but when my uncle rushed her to hospital the er doctors spent too much time focusing on that and by the time they started expanding their focus it was too late. it really sucks and i wish they'd realized it sooner but i can't rationally demand that doctors look at every new mother who collapses and immediately ignore her reproductive system as a potential source of the problem.  &gt; even though the u.s. department of health and the world health organization agree that dieting   eating smaller portions and cutting out junk food? or hopping from atkins to paleo to south bronx paradise in the span of two months?  &gt; and weight lose surgery   ""loss"". nitpicky but damn it, hire a proofreader, you're a fucking college department.  &gt; can be dangerous to human health,   trees can be dangerous to human health if you stand under them in a lightning storm. context please.  &gt; patients healthfulness continues to be determined by their body mass index regardless of the lack of scientific evidence supporting its use.   you got a better metric? you got some double-blind studies where doctors make more accurate diagnoses of randomly-chosen patients if anything relating to weight is carefully scrubbed from the records they're using to make the diagnoses? you got a hypothesis that could be falsified, or are we all here to pull down the statues in front of the hospital now that we finished at the confederate war museum?   &gt; current medical technology has only a 10% success rate in treating obesity.  what about non-technological solutions like eating smaller portions and sticking to an exercise regime?  oh god, there's like a dozen more pages of this shit. nope, i'm done. if they wanted to shut critics up one good study showing fat people live healthier lives would go a long way. this is just prattle to cover the fact that they can't do that.",1,-2,

""hush now, thunder child. all's well. besides, i'm afraid you're too skinny for her tastes."" he chuckles as he continues his petting. ""not that it is much comfort for you!"" his amused look vanishes as he turns his gaze to the cavern's mouth, his reason for coming to this forsaken place. pursing his lips, he adjusts his sword belt, the tooled leather over the silk sash tied around his waist, the green tail of it swaying softly as he moves about. his turned down boots squelching in the mud, he marches on towards the entrance.   the sucking sound of mud turns to the staccato fire of spurred boots on granite as he enters the cave proper. he pauses in the antechamber, thumb looped through his belt, admiring the dagger-like formations strewn about. scattered across the cavern's floor is a carpet of bones, titanic carcasses that went extinct ages ago on the mainland. deer larger than any draft horse lay broken in piles, aurochs that dwarf any dieter ever saw also grace the ossuary. here and there, human skeletons as well. almost all died wearing armor, chain-mail and rusting plate girding them. spent arrows and broken spears lie like detritus on the stone floor. swords clasped in bony fingers are faded under a patina of weathering, their owners never letting go of their weapons even in death. dieter takes a step forward. his boot crunches underneath. lifting up his foot as he glances down, he sees a tiny skull, barely the size of his two fists together. no teeth line its jaws. an infant.  *""good evening, lord dieter. this is a... pleasant surprise. what brings you to my domain?""*   with the voice comes a wave of rot. the scent of a thousand corpses  bloating under the summer sun hits his nostrils, churning his stomach. a swarm of bats bursts out the cave in a river of black fur, eclipsing the setting sun. dieter stands still, unfazed by the sea of chittering rodents as they fly past his face. the last stragglers exiting, he refocuses his gaze to his speaker.   ""good evening, mordnacht. i've come to speak with you-""  *""of course you have, child. why else would you come? sit, sit. i'm sure there is a clear place among my things for you to rest on.""*  she sweeps a massive wing across the gigantic cavern, even hidden by the animal carcasses, there is enough fallen soldiers to fill a battalion. dieter picks his way between the piles of refuse before sitting on a heaped pile of banners, mildew and moths having destroyed most of the color and images. he glances down at his armrest, a faded flag of red, turned a dull pink by the weather. on it is what appears to be a golden griffin, the eagle's head and lion's tail long missing. he looks up, at the ten foot long snout above his head. fangs as long as his arm jut from furless jaws. massive ears point forward while eyes glow like embers at him. mangy fur covers what is left of its hide, long gaping holes in its rib cage reveal the lack of organs within its chest.  *""i apologize for not being prepared for guests. i believe i have a tea set among my treasures but alas, no tea. i still have some deer left, very fresh, only two days old...""*  ""that is quite alright. i ate before coming here. thank you though, it is appreciated.""  a hissing chuckle, like granite scraping on granite.  *""ah, i was only teasing. i'm well aware my diet is... peculiar to man. but if you are at all interested....?""*  ""i'm quite well. i assure you. thank you."" he says almost hurriedly. ""i have questions, about me.""  *""ah.""* she scrapes her claws on the stone, the sound like blades being drawn across an anvil. *""what is it you ask?""*  ""i was thinking, if i had not come here. to queen malvina's kingdom i mean. what would have happened to me?""  the beast is silent for a moment before sighing in a resigned manner.  *""it is the curse of man to dwell on what-could haves and maybes. go down deeper into the gallery. see that passage way to the left? take it. go further into the cave. you'll know what you seek when you find it.""*   it gestures with a swish of its tail, flicking to the mention passageway.  dieter rises from his tattered throne, nodding his head in thanks. more bones crunch underfoot as he weaves around the deepest portions of the sea of bones. reaching the passage entrance, he gazes up at the mammoth size of it, four time the height of a man, and just as wide. above it is carved in jagged script the lines, ""know thyself."" glaring up at the stone words, he steps forwards and under the eve, disappearing from the creatures view.     cold fingers trace along the slick walls, the smooth stone gliding under his calluses. dieter hears nothing save for the sound of his own footsteps, no creatures, no water dripping. silence.    for an hour he walks in complete darkness, blacker than any night imaginable. so it is to his relief that light spills from the end of the tunnel, beckoning him onward. he breaks into the run, coursing down the narrow path before exiting into a room open to the air. blessed cool air blows into his face, wicking away sweat. he gazes around at the empty grotto bare of anything except for the sandy ground.  ""hello?"" he shouts, his voice echoes off the cliff walls. ""anyone?""  ""hello, dieter"" his blood freezes. breath paused. he is intimately familiar with that voice.   he slowly turns around, boot digging a divot into the sand as he pivots. there, to his growing horror, is him.  his doppelganger is dressed for battle, a steel cuirass covers his chest while a lobster-tailed helmet is covering his head. scars run across his face, drawing his lips into a hideous sneer. a chipped saber rest in his fist, the razor edge shining in the moonlight. his gray eyes, while the same color as dieter's, are as cold as ice. a feral smiles crosses his other's face.  ""what's the matter? you look like you've seen a ghost.""  laughter erupts behind dieter. whirling, he spins to see another self. this one is in chains, the manacles rubbing his wrists and ankles raw. his hair hangs stringy and tangled as does his beard. he wears but a coarse tunic of undyed wool, his feet bleeding. his eyes, though gray, are dim and weak.

682181,"literally no one in this thread understands how health or evolution works holy shit.   natural selection is not a â€œnatural instinctâ€ to choose the â€œhealthiestâ€ mate, it is literally just the process of the gene pool changing due to some genes being passed on during reproduction and others not. very â€œunhealthyâ€ genes can be selected for in some circumstances and very â€œhealthyâ€ genes can be selected against in others, and it really just depends on a combination of balance in the ecosystem and a little bit of pure chance of what individuals end up reproducing. do you think peacocks with heavy and noticeable tail feathers are naturally more â€œhealthyâ€ because they get selected for more often? no, and iâ€™m fact peacocks with larger and brighter tail feathers often are more likely to get killed by predators, and yet we still have that trait around. it has absolutely nothing to do with health, unless a gene causes individuals to die or become infertile before they reproduce.   even if it did have to do with health, studies have shown over and over again that people who are overweight actually tend to live longer and be healthier than people who are â€œnormalâ€ weight or underweight. part of this has to do with the fact that fat is very important to human metabolism! heavyweight lifters tend to have more fat than bodybuilders because fat stores energy that can then be used by the muscles during exertion. it also creates a layer of insulation, aiding with thermal regulation, and provides extra padding to protect the internal organs, so people who are overweight tend to survive more accidents than underweight people do.   and anyway, it is not by any means â€œnaturalâ€ to be more attracted to thin people. itâ€™s a very extensively recorded cultural shift. people didnâ€™t tend to be fatter in history because â€œthey didnâ€™t know about the health detrimentsâ€, people were fatter because if you were wealthier you could afford to eat more and do less. in fact, it has been recorded in many cultures through much of history that fatter people were more attractive, because it was a sign of wealth and prosperity. you want to talk about â€œselectionâ€? to people in history, you had a better chance at surviving and producing offspring if your partner was fat.   the reason weâ€™re so obsessed with thinness in todayâ€™s world has to do with a number of factors: first, tuberculosis epidemics pre-1900s had a symptom that caused rapid weight loss and weakness. this often affected nobles as well as lower class people, but nobility still had to maintain an air of superiority even while sick. thatâ€™s why it actually became fashionable to be gaunt-thin and deathly pale, because they were turning symptoms of a deadly illness into fashion statements.   despite medical technology making great progress since then, this ideal has persisted. one of the reasons for this is industrialization. once everything started becoming manufactured and mass-produced, canned, frozen, and fast foods became astronomically cheaper than fresh produce. this also meant that artificial preservatives, sugars, salt, and fats became present in large amounts in cheaper meals. during the great depression, people were working more and earning less, so they didnâ€™t have as much time to cook or as much money to spend, so canned foods (that often strip a lot of essential nutrients) became a staple for poorer families.   this still persists today because family trends tend to continue (if your family ate poorly you are also inclined to eat poorly), the economy is seeing a massive hit while fresh produce is still expensive and fast food and frozen meals are still cheap as dirt, and generally people who are wealthier (and therefore have more time to devote to exercise, more money to spend on nutrition and a personal trainer, and generally have less stressors that can lead to weight gain) tend to be thinner. so when all the wealthy celebrities and well-off media influencers can show off their toned abs and skinny frames? thinness is idolized and fatness is scorned.   anyway, if fatness was about being healthy you wouldnâ€™t see fat people laughed at for going to the gym or eating salad, and you would see more thin people scorned for smoking a six pack a day and living on greasy fast food and beer. that in itself should be enough to prove that the attractiveness or lack thereof of body size has never genuinely been about health. i personally am bordering on obese, but i exercise regularly, lift weights, do cardio, and go out of my way to choose healthier options, drink lots of water, and get a regular sleep cycle. however, my family has a genetic disposition to be overweight, i suffer from depression and anxiety, and i have a lot of stress in life due to financial and occupational concerns. i have a lot of factors keeping me at a steady weight despite my efforts to live a genuinely healthier life, and meanwhile i know people half my size who have admitted to me that they have never stepped in a gym, get four hours of sleep a night, and eat junk food periodically.   so op, youâ€™re doing just fine. this is not and has never been about health or natural selection. this is about social constructs of attractiveness based on arbitrary standards that can, will, and are changing.   if anyone wants sources comment below. iâ€™m on the bus and i donâ€™t have time to dig them all up right now so iâ€™ll get to them later.",1,1,

235220,"this is a thorny issue that i've been struggling with, too. on the one hand, in the area/ time i was growing up, a *lot* of the body image focus was on the damage eating disorders can cause. obviously, by eating disorders, they were talking about anorexia and bulimia. no one discussed or addressed binging or comfort eating, unless it was to draw the path to how binging leads to purging, which is unhealthy.  so now we're all adults, and suddenly the focus is on our national obesity issue. part of me wonders if this isn't a bit of a backlash to our national obsession not simply with being ""thin and pretty,"" which was bad enough in it's own right, but with our national obsession on focusing only on the bad eating habits/ eating disorders formed in the pursuit of being ""thin and pretty.""  so now we're having this backlash of people who disdain ""picking at your food,"" ""eating small portions,"" ""eating rabbit food."" we're having this societal backlash where simply eating smaller portions or even actually enjoying healthy foods is seen as being overly body-conscious and borderline eating disorder.   i read this magazine article a few months back at the doctor's office, i'll try and find it and edit in a link when i have a minute. but it was about this woman who knew she was a little overweight, but thought of herself as ""big, beautiful, and sexy."" she talked about how she described herself in terms like ""curvaceous,"" and ""bold,"" and ""big but beautiful."" she had an awesome self-body image, and was proud of being a larger-sized woman.  but at the same time, she felt ~~sad~~ wistful. less energy, often out of breath, not as active as her husband, kids, and friends. she often ate while they engaged in physical activities -- sitting on the park bench eating while they played tag at a picnic type of deal. always on the sidelines, but never pushed there -- just self-relegated, and she believed herself to be happy. she considered herself happy. no one nagged her about her weight, no-one told her she was gross or fat.  i forget what the turning point was. i seem to recall that she saw some annual photographs side-by-side, but it may have just as easily been a doctors appointment or something. all i know is that at some point she looked at pictures of herself (pictures included in the article) and said, ""i'm not big and beautiful. i'm obese. i need to change.""  so she did this lifestyle change advocated by the magazine (which was why she was featured in an article), that involved smaller portions, healthier alternatives, and more activity. not major changes like going from twinkies to the south beach diet, but smaller lifestyle changes that overall added up to a healthier, more active life.  and she lost weight. she lost a lot of weight -- i forget exactly how much, but it was in the 150 range, going from a woman with arm-flaps and jowls and a belly roll to a woman with a fit, active (and still curvaceous -- big boobs and hips!) body.  it really highlighted to me the difference between obese and curvaceous, and the damage being accepting of obesity as a valid body image is. none of us would be okay with a 5'7"" 90-lb anorexic telling us to accept her the way she is, that she's fine and doesn't need help and she's just naturally thin. we'd look at her emaciated ribs and sharp cheekbones, her overly-large starving eyes and say, ""yeah, no, we're getting you to a doctor. come on.""  so why is it that we look at a 5'7"" 280 lb woman and go, ""okay, you're just super curvy. that's fine.""  i'm even allowing for different body types there -- i'm 5'7"" and 160 lbs, about a size 12, and i'm about 25 lbs over my personal desired body type. but then again, my bra size is in the b to c range, and i'm pear shaped. i carry my weight well, with most of it being in the tummy, hips, and thighs. i want to, for myself and the lifestyle i live, get to about 140 lbs with more muscle tone, but that's more to do with the fact that i like living an active lifestyle and don't like getting out of breath on a trailwalk.  i'm allowing that there are 5'7"" women out there with a lot more curves than me, women with dd bra sizes and bubbilicious butts. and you know what? i know women like that. i'm friends with women like that. these women have told me they're overweight because it's just their body type, and that nothing helps, and that they've tried ""every exercise program,"" or ""every diet,"" and they're just built this way.   and one by one, over the past two years, these women have started losing weight. they've gone from size 16's and 18's down to size 12's and 10's. one went from an 18 to an 8 in two years. how? they finally made that actual lifestyle change to smaller portions and daily exercise, and their bodies just finally went from overweight/ obese to a healthy size. these women are an inspiration to me, as well as a very clear message: overweight/ obese is no more beautiful or necessary to accept than underweight. both are results of poor activity levels (whether too low or too high) and malnutrition.   **tl;dr** our goal shouldn't be body acceptance regardless of size/health. our goal should be healthy eating, healthy lifestyles, healthy bodies. moderation in all things.",1,-1,

""crippled preferences""? are you telling me that the majority of men have maladaptive sexual preferences? i think darwin would disagree with you.  &gt; also: i don't think it's what ""most men"" find ideal. it's not a coincidence that models usually are thin.  models are selected according to female tastes, not male tastes. men in general are attracted to women of average build, rather than rail-thin models:  ""american men and women viewed nine female figures that varied from very thin to very plump. the women were asked to indicate their ideal for themselves, as well as their perception of what men's ideal female figure was. in both cases, women selected a figure slimmer than average. **when men were asked to select which female figure they preferred, however, they selected the figure of average body size**. american women erroneously believe that men desire thinner women than is the case.""   https://blackboard.newpaltz.edu/bbcswebdav/users/geherg/glenn_geher_continuous_works/psy_558_mating_psychology/buss_2003_ch3.pdf  ""average"", by the way, is size 14 - substantially bigger than the woman you consider ""chubby"".  &gt;it gives evolutionary cripples an advantage, yes  if they have an evolutionary advantage, then they are not by any definition ""evolutionary cripples"".  &gt;yes, but not all women are fat as some are able to take care of their bodies.  i'm not describing fat women. i'm describing women with *a little* extra body fat. such women appear to be more fertile.  &gt;medicine gives them an advantage  what ""advantage"" does medicine give them?  &gt;you don't need more than you need.  well... clearly. my point is that women, at least, need more than you seem to think they do. skinnier is not better. it isn't healthier. it isn't more attractive. *average* is better, and healthier, and more attractive.  &gt;chubby women have mroe fat than they need. that's undisputable.  if you consider the woman in the red bikini ""chubby"", then they certainly don't have more than they need. that woman is average-to-small. her body is healthy and extremely attractive.  &gt;fat was needed back then and people who were able to store fat were a valid mating preference. that's why there are fat people and why some people like fat people.  that's not how it works. male preferences adjust themselves according to abundance of resources:  ""a manâ€™s image of the perfect romantic partner varies depending upon whether he is feeling hungry. thatâ€™s the conclusion of a newly published study, which finds **peckish males prefer females who are heavier**, taller and older.  the research, published in the journal of social, evolutionary and cultural psychology, confirms and expands upon two previous papers: a 2005 study that concluded **heavier women are preferred in cultures with scarce resources**, and a 2006 british study that found **hunger influences judgments of female physical attractiveness**.""  http://www.miller-mccune.com/culture-society/hungry-men-love-larger-ladies-3445/  ""fat"" is only preferred in times of hunger.

382704,"&gt;i'm going to go out on a major limb here and assume that you're probably overweight as well.  above average weight but only slightly, i'm very tall and male.  but yes i could probably lose some weight.  &gt;a healthy person probably wouldn't go to these lengths to fight for an issue like this.  i also fight for womens' rights, gay rights, and love to debate other more controversial topics such as bestiality and paedophilia, but i fall under none of those groups.  &gt;people want to be fat? hey, i guess that's their own decision now, isn't it?  yes.  &gt;my problem is the way obesity represents our society in the bigger picture... lethargic, lazy and entitled as a whole  i'll give you that for obesity, but would like to point out firstly that obese is different from overweight, especially if you're calling this girl overweight (i notice you avoided actually saying that) and secondly that this is still not a valid point for attacking my first contention that anyone should have the freedom to choose their own lifestyle unless you are suggesting that public image is more important than personal freedom.  &gt;but i maintain that if she spoke to any m.d. about her weight, they would all tell her that if she lost some weight, she would be healthier.  i concede this point to you.  i am not claiming to be anything of an expert on the subject so will assume this to be true.  however you're going to need to go through the logic with me that this attacks my second point that she is not justified in her choices.  i am standing by my contention that the lifestyled protrayed by her body size is absolutely fine on the grounds that it causes her more happiness than misery.  &gt;i don't find overweight people attractive. i recognize some do, for god-knows-what fucking reason.  humans beings have a tendency to often find other human beings (of their sexual preference) attractive.  often large parts of the body, especially sexual organs, buttocks and breasts, further arouse the voyeur.  &gt;this is your only vessel that you have to carry you through this life, and you are treating it like a used honda that hasn't had an oil change in 15,000 miles, never cleaned the trash off the floorboards, and someone used their finger to write ""wash me"" in dirt on the side.  interesting analogy,  i would argue that it is a bit of a straw man, since we are not talking about a person with terrible hygeine, drug abuse and self harm, just a person with a larger body that is quite possibly due to less exercise than the average person, and/or a different diet.  i would argue again that everyone has the right to their own lifestyle.  you may not agree with this lifestyle, but saying  &gt;that's not hot  is not justified, without making sure people know this is just your opinion.  this girl got over 600 upvotes.  that should be evidence enough to show you that a significant number of people disagree with you.  i for one would fuck her brains out.  not that i have a ""chubby fetish"", i like a lot of ""normal"" or ""skinny"" girls as well.  but i appreciate the female form in a lot of shapes and sizes and so do at least [7,500 other redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildplus/)",1,-1,

she doesn't deserve anything, she's fat! oh what, an out of shape guy is hooking up with a hot skinny girl? oh, you go dude, props!   in fact let's look at the meme title: ""scumbag fat girl"". and she describes herself as curvy. so let's take op's word she's totaly fat and trying to play it down! oh and because it's not like anyone has ever misrepresented themselves on the internet, especially on a dating website. nope.   first comment, sitting at +288:  &gt;average female profile stats: *fat, 5 foot tall, two kids from different dads, no job, chest tattoos, smoker, favorite hobby: pizza*  &gt;""i want a real man, who is 6 feet tall and in great shape.. if you can't handle me at my worst.. you don't deserve my best""   &gt;x 10000000 profiles   &gt;ugh  instant fat and female hate. the average female profile is that?

let's shower her in praise, maybe she'll like me! to the rescue!  &gt;a lot of boys (like me) think that well formed small boobs are much more attractive than big ones. and a girl with muscles? great! &gt;don't bother about their opinion, if you're fit you're sexy  she didn't show any doubts about her attractiveness and i have no idea what she looks like, but she's not as fat and that's all that matters!  &gt;i forget where i heard this but: big boobs on a fat girl are like a six pack on a skinny guy...it doesn't count.  if you're fat, you lose the privelage of your boobs being attractive! look, you're not even a sexual object to men anymore, and because that's the only thing reddit sees women as, that means you're nothing (but a whale, right?)  oh and this one at +116. it reads exactly like a men's rights advocate post...except a not-fat people advocate!  &gt;it's the fat acceptance movement. instead of ""yeah, you shouldn't be a dick to someone just because they're fat"" it became ""lel bbw 4lyf fuc them skinny bitches, like skeletons""  curse the fat acceptance movement, people being ok with their body and self esteem?? fuck that, they're fat they shouldn't be ok with anything! oh and guys i'm a professional, i know for a *fact* that people accepting themselves turned into shaming skinny girls. definitely. every person advocating fat acceptance does this.   +32 on this one  &gt;""curvy"" people tend to make fun of normal sized (and good looking, let's be honest) people for being ""skinny"" and ""anorexic"". i guess it's a defence mechanism for trying to make up for their own lack of self-esteem and self confidence. it's sad, when they in most cases actually are the ones having problems, both physically and mentally  biotruths coming through! these fat people, not only are they ugly, but they hate on skinny girls because they have no self confidence. what, a fat girl with confidence??

405443,"there's no best. the categories are so broad and cover so many different firearms suitable for so many different purposes, it's impossible to even begin to answer the question as you've asked it. as an example, an anschutz 2013 is a bolt-action single-shot .22lr target rifle. it costs about [$4000](http://www.championshooters.com/store/product.php?productid=1046) and is probably the best rifle for any smallbore target shooter, whether beginning or competing in the olympics so long as cost isn't a concern. is that the best bolt-action rifle for you? you're going moose hunting? it's utterly useless.  i'm going to list some categories that i think are relevant and some good options in each. they are not the categories you asked about because i don't think you asked about very useful categories.  **.22lr** - everyone should have a .22 because the ammunition costs about 1/10 what typical centerfire pistol cartridges cost. this is good for target shooting and hunting small game. there are .22s in every price range and for every purpose - even some for which the .22 is poorly suited, like self defense. i'm recommending general-purpose .22s here.  * .22 pistol - of what's currently on the market, i like the browning buckmark and ruger mk. iii. if you like cowboy-style single-action revolvers, the ruger single six is a fine gun. if you like spending money, the s&amp;w 617 is a beautiful 10-shot double-action revolver. you can't go wrong with any of these. handle them all in a store, and go with the one that feels best to you.  * .22 rifle - see above for why you might want one. i like the ruger 10/22. some people say the marlin 795 is more accurate. marlin bolt-action .22s are cheap and accurate.  **defensive pistols** - for carry and home defense. caliber is a subject of debate here; the popular options are 9mm, .40s&amp;w and .45acp. 9mm has the cheapest ammunition, the least recoil, and holds more rounds in the same size pistol, but some people feel that it isn't as good at stopping bad guys as the other two. .40s&amp;w is in the middle for cost, capacity and recoil. depending on which theories of bullet effectiveness you subscribe to, it's either the most effective, or between 9mm and .45. .45 has the highest cost, lowest capacity and most recoil, but it makes the biggest hole. under some theories of bullet effectiveness, .45 is more effective than 9mm or .40.  * full-size defensive pistol - this is the type of pistol a police officer would carry. it is suited to home defense and open carry. concealed carry is difficult, but generally possible with heavy clothing. most pistols in this category over $400 or so are as accurate as any shooter in a combat situation and reliable, though you should probably avoid inexpensive [1911s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m1911_pistol), as there tend to be quality and reliability issues with low-end models in that style. i'm personally fond of the fn fnx because the ergonomics and controls work well for me. perhaps a glock, s&amp;w m&amp;p, springfield xd, taurus 24/7, sig, beretta, walther or ruger sr works better for you. the most important thing is that you find the grip size and control positions natural. there are very few current models with serious problems, but it wouldn't hurt to ask here about something specific you're considering.  * full-frame compact pistol - this is the above with a shorter grip and slide to make concealed carry easier. it has less weight and a shorter barrel, which translates to less power, more recoil and more noise. all the above advice applies here.  * dedicated carry pistol - while most of the above designs have double-column (sometimes called ""double stack"") magazines that hold 10 to 19 rounds, these usually have single-column magazines that hold 5-10 rounds. they tend to be slim, lightweight and easy to carry concealed. some are chambered in full-power cartridges like the above, but many use the less powerful .380acp - a shorter 9mm. you should shoot a few of these before buying, as full-power cartridges in such small guns have stiff recoil that may be problematic for some shooters. kahr makes a wide range of guns in this class in varying sizes and calibers, as well as a choice between metal and polymer frames. the various kahrs are my favorite pistols in this class, but there are a number of other good options. ergonomics and comfort are perhaps even more important here than above.  **big-bore revolver** - this is for defense against dangerous animals, and possibly to hunt big game if you're willing to get close, or if you have to in a survival situation. i'm a big fan of the 6"" s&amp;w model 629 .44 magnum. it's not the most powerful gun in this class, but it's not too big and heavy, accurate and has a very smooth action. .44 magnum ammo isn't the cheapest thing there is, but it's cheaper than other calibers in this class. power is 2-3x that of a defensive pistol and about half that of a typical big game rifle. recoil is heavy, but not beyond what most people can handle for a few shots. if size and weight or concealment is an issue, a 4"" model 329 is smaller and lighter, but will have extra recoil because of the lightweight alloy frame. the ruger redhawk is also a fine pistol, and costs a bit less. for more power without much more weight or size, the ruger super redhawk and taurus raging bull are decent revolvers in .454 casull. if that's still not enough, the s&amp;w model 500 in .500 magnum hits as hard up close as a full-power big game hunting rifle. it weighs about a pound more than a 629 and doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in a hip holster.  **defensive/offensive rifle** - a military-style rifle for ruining someone's day. there's a choice to be made between intermediate-power (usually .223 or .5.56 nato, which are almost, but not quite the same thing and not safe to substitute for each other) and full-power (usually .308 or 7.62 nato, which are usually, but not always safe to substitute for each other). for an intermediate-power rifle, the standard advice is to buy an ar-15 or build your own. they're so ubiquitous and customizable that you can have just about anything you want on that platform. building an ar is its own thread, and i'm not an expert, so i'll stop here. full-power rifles tend to be bigger and heavier, with more recoil and more expensive ammunition. there's not much difference up close against unarmored humans, but they're more effective at long range, against body armor and against vehicles. the fn fal and m-14 are popular options for full-power rifles. i was really impressed with the kel-tec rfb i saw in a store recently. it's a bullpup design, which means the action is in the back of the gun, making for a very compact package. the disadvantage is that t's new, so it's reliability is unproven, and it's a bit pricey.  **big game hunting rifle** - a rifle, usually bolt-action intended for hunting deer, moose, elk, bear and other large animals. this advice is for the average medium to long range hunting scenario, and doesn't apply to close encounters with dangerous game. there are quite a few good options in this category. i like the remington model 700 myself because it has a very fast [lock time](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lock_time), which makes it slightly easier to shoot accurately. there are very few bad guns in this class though, and scope choice is probably more important than rifle choice. many calibers will work well. .308 and .30-06 are probably the easiest to find, and .308 might allow you to share ammo with your defensive rifle above, and are still powerful enough for anything in north america. looking at lighter calibers, .243 works great on deer with less recoil, but is a bit light for anything larger. .223 or 5.56mm will work fine for deer with proper bullet choice, but isn't legal in all states. going heavier, .300 winchester magnum hits harder, especially at long range. 7mm remington magnum has very low bullet drop at long range. .338 winchester magnum hits a lot harder, and is a good choice if you're primarily hunting very large game. all things considered, i'd get a .308 if i had a defensive rifle in that caliber, and a .30-06 if i didn't.",0,,

925797,"i think that what we have here is a bit of a miscommunication.  i don't think that as an agnostic theist, my belief in god is the same as a typical jew or christian or muslim's belief in god.  i don't believe in god as defined by any religion, because i don't believe people have the mental capacity or even basic knowledge necessary to fully comprehend what would be required of a deity's consistency.  i just recognize that the universe is beautiful and with what i've learned of probability, i have reason to believe that it was not chaos that gave rise to everything.    that is the extent of my belief, and i call it a belief in god.  i do not dispute science whatsoever unless it is scientifically incorrect (just as any scientist or indeed, logician would).  so there was a big bang?  okay, if we believe in that theory, what caused that bang?  causation is how we reverse engineer the universe, and without a cause for something, we have reached a point which we cannot bridge.  we have reached the limit of human knowledge.    from my frame of reference, it makes no difference whether i use this to justify that there is or is not a god.  i have done both, and i am happier with the god concept.  this is entirely absent religious process.  i do things that i consider spiritual because i find them emotionally fulfilling.  i go for walks in the woods, and i climb mountains.  i enjoy the world, and just as humans before me have been for centuries, i am nearly cowed by the wonders i see.  but i happily continue pursuing them every day.    you told me not to stretch to discussing only fanatics, and i agree.  it is a wise thing to do.  ""the opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or not."" - eric hoffer  i don't care whether or not there's a god, because it doesn't effect me.  i believe that there is because i feel like my life is a constant blessing and wonder at the concept.  but i am not religious.  do not lump me with fanatics.  only a fanatic would believe the premises for the war in iraq.  the us government is bullshit.  i don't think cynicism should always be avoided because i'm an intelligent person.  i realize where it has value, and where it doesn't.  there is no practical difference in the way i live my life whether i believe in god or not except that i am happier to do so.  so why not do what feels good?  i'm not even christian, but you're addressing me with that ghandi quote.  i use that ghandi quote on christian priests when i debate theological concepts with them in which i do not even believe.  i examine with them the difference between christianity as christ envisioned it and christianity as paul envisioned it.  i examine with them the validity of paul.  the epistemology of religion is incredibly interesting from a psychological standpoint, and from a mythological and historical standpoint as well.    religion has spawned some of the most amazing advances in philosophy and humanity across history.  some of the world's greatest men have been atheists, but some have also been religious.    it isn't religion that inspires war.  it is power.  greedy men use religion to acquire power over weak minds.  religion is not the same as belief in god.  i believe in god, but i do not have a weak mind.  therefore, i am not religious.  do you understand?  i have made no argument in favor of organized religion.  i have made an argument in favor of the individual benefits that can be had by utilizing specific religious and spiritual beliefs and traditions.  anything humans do on a large scale breeds corruption, wars, robbery, loss of lives, and wastes of time.  this is not a trait of only religion, and if all atheists think that, then they're missing the bigger picture.    look at 4chan.  look at the massive scale of that piece of internet, look at the habbo raids, and the epic fail, and the suicidal myspace emos, and yes, all the time wasted by it.  a little bit of internet never hurt anybody, but a lot of 4chan kills billions of unborn children on the keyboards of thousands of anonymous internet users.  so much genetic material wasted; or is it? i suppose they're sowing their seed for charles darwin.  history may never know.  i hope no one ever decides to write a period piece on 4chan.  imagine that movie in 2050.  *shudder.*  in all seriousness though, another solid example of this is the us government.  humans working on a large scale again: favors are getting passed around, people are losing their lives for the organization and not receiving just compensation for their families.  the wounded do not receive just compensation for their injuries.  it is a madhouse of corrupt capitalism.  humans on a large scale again: baseball.  look at the yankees and tell me that something isn't going on there.    this isn't to say that the us government has not done good things, or that baseball has not been fun, or that 4chan hasn't been amusing sometimes.  i think that you're making the classic mistake of assuming that because two things correlate (or don't), that one caused the other (or didn't).  we don't have evidence that there is a god, but we also don't have evidence that we know everything, so it doesn't matter whether we believe in one until we know better.  that's a very simple concept, and when you take it to extremes and start talking about organized religion and fanatics and canonized belief structures, you're missing the point.    but isn't that what you were trying to tell me?  as for george bernard shaw and being drunk and deluded: so long as it makes a person who feels awful feel better, and so long as it hurts no one, what exactly is the problem with a little bit of delusion?  if a person is especially peaceful, what's wrong with a lot?  plenty of science has come to be due to altered states of mind and delusions.  look at how the double-helix structure was discovered.    yes, the right to believe in spiritual concepts and personal religion is just like the right to smoke cannabis.  you can put whatever you want into your body if it makes you healthier.  for some people, it works: therefore, it's wrong to ban it just because some people use it wrong.  the same principle applies to gun laws.  the same principle applies to all technology that has a peaceful, beneficial purpose.  of course now i'm thinking of nuclear power.  the potential for extremism should not sour you to something, you just need to know how to partake of it in enough moderation to receive the benefits with a minimal number of the negative side-effects.  you could over-dose on calcium.  this does not mean that you shouldn't consume it.  a little bit of alcohol every now and then reduces your risk of heart disease.    you should probably read a little bit more buddha or at least commentary on buddhism.  it might broaden your perspective.",0,,

576543,"wow.  way to fall into the same trap you accuse others of landing in.  i mean, your points are reasonable straight through ""key point 2.""  although i don't necessarily agree with everything you say, your premises seem sane and somewhat thought-out.  then you completely lose it.  after half a post complaining about the lack of science in most online resources, you post four ""facts,"" but the only one you provide credible support for is the barrel-length issue.  1. yep, barrel length is important for energy.  unfortunately, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference in choosing a caliber, because everything scales pretty consistently.  a longer barrel gives you more power, but the relative ranking of the calibers doesn't change much.  for instance, [.380 acp](http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/megraphs/380auto2010.html) is consistently weaker than [9x19mm](http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/megraphs/9mm.html).  from any given barrel length, the 9x19 has 50% more energy than the closest equivalent .380.  and the [.45 acp](http://www.ballisticsbytheinch.com/megraphs/45auto.html) has more energy than either, but shows a much greater percentage drop with a shorter (&lt;5"") barrel.  so in the small guns you're likely to carry daily, the lighter rounds you seem to dislike actually perform *closer* to their average capability than the big rounds you favor.  2. it's probably true that a heavy slug penetrates more deeply than a light one, although i think your concerns about overpenetration are unfounded - ballistics gel tests show very similar overall penetration for the common calibers.  the lighter, faster bullets have less surface area and don't slow down as rapidly, while the heavy, slow bullets have more momentum but much more surface area, and so they are slowed more quickly and end up penetrating the same.  but anyway, if you like light bullets, why do you like .45?  why is a heavy-for-caliber 147 gr slug moving at 1000 fps from a 5"" 9mm unwise, while a light-for-caliber 165 gr slug at 1100 fps from a .45 seems like a good idea?  it's still a heavier bullet moving faster, so you should be more concerned with overpenetration.  3. if you actually look into the sources, the wikipedia article isn't very strong support for hydrostatic shock at handgun power levels.  the only articles specifically listing handgun performance are from the czech republic and have no article text available for review.  there's plenty of evidence that hydrostatic shock is real at rifle power levels, but not much support behind even 10mm and .357 providing the same effect.  and half of that page is practically marketing material for bullet and cartridge manufacturers.  4. unless we're talking shotguns, a bigger hole doesn't do much for your chances of hitting something vital.  [it seems that](http://www.btfh.net/shoot/bullet-test-7.html) good .45 can expand to around 0.9 inch, and good 9mm can expand to 0.78 inch.  the larger .45 will hit something that the 9mm misses, only if the 9mm missed by less than the difference in radius between 9 and .45.  so a .45 lets you shoot a whopping **0.06 inches** further from something vital than 9mm does.  or, we could look at it another way - 8 rounds of .45 has a total wound surface area of 5 square inches, and 17 rounds of 9mm has a total surface area of 8 square inches.  seems like i'd be more likely to hit something important with 8 sq.in. of coverage than with 5. . .  actual final thoughts:  use the round you're most comfortable shooting, because once you get reliable penetration, the size of the hole means fuck-all compared to how accurately you can position the hole.  and remember that you get bonus points for having more do-overs in the magazine.",0,,

105541,"sure. thereâ€™s a few to go through though!    iâ€™ll start with the â€œbiggestâ€ which is the taastallir: from taastalla, these are sort of my stand-in for humans, they are roughly our size, maybe a bit bigger, with biology and appearance heavily inspired by satyrs (i very much wanted to stay away from the traditional tolkien-esque cast of elves, dwarves, goblins and orcs and give some of the b-team mythological creatures a shot). averaging somewhere between 4-6ft for females and 5-7ft for males they are by and large broad and portly, with thick fur around their head, neck and extremities, four eyes, two on each side of their â€œgoat-ish human-ishâ€ head with horizontally aligned pupils (like goat which makes them world-class horizon scanners) and horns of varying shape and size depending on genetic heritage (similar to how face and skin differentiation occurred in us). they are the most culturally imperialistic and are the ones who led the way with the whole exploration of the sea and discovering the other peoples and places out there, as such; their maps, charts, units of measurement and written language became adopted as the international standard (making my life much easier, which was considerate of them!).  next, on samarkuur there are the samarkir (naturally enough). these i based off of the aztec depictions of deities, they are an avian race roughly 4 feet tall covered in a thick coat of colourful feathers, with short, stubby black parrot-esque beaks and five eyes total, two small beady yellow eyes on each side of their head for depth perception and focus, and a larger eye, with no pupil in the middle of their head which is used to determine colour. in terms of culture and society, they breed so rapidly and their territorial instinct is so strong they are naturally war-loving since itâ€™s how they avoided overpopulation and extinction. they have a strong warrior culture around which an individualâ€™s plumage (grown similarly to a viking warrior-braid) denotes their station in society, with those at the top looking like monstrous brazillian carnival dancers. outside of warrior culture their next biggest strength is trade, and construction, which led to huge numbers of them migrating to taastallan colonies and cities as traders, fighters, and builders.   next up, wÃ¼dir and bethelgir. both from wÃ¼ltut. they emerged pretty much simultaneously, the wÃ¼dir are inspired by old english spriggans (more commonly recognised from the elder scrolls series) in that they are mostly fleshy and human-esque, with leathery olive skin and a short plump body shape except for their skin becoming gradually thicker and harder and more gnarled as it gets down their limbs leading to their arms and legs appearing tree-like. their noses are flattened with slit nostrils and their two eyes a bright red have vertically aligned double pupils. averaging at about 5ft with females being far more common than males they have the sparsest population of any major race, and are the least ambitious in terms of exploration or conquest, their only major military endeavour being to fend off taastallan colonisation which ended in a peace agreement and a set territory being marked out as a trade-port connection between wÃ¼ltut and taastalla, allowing the wÃ¼dir to become famous across all places touched by taastallan expansionism for their food, which was adopted as a favourite nearly everywhere. because of this booming trade, the port grew and developed into the capital city of wÃ¼ultut and became home to the largest university in the aurora thanks to their neighbours. the bethelgir are a subterranean race of people with thin, gaunt bodies and elongated limbs, allowing them to live along the walls of the vast caverns beneath wÃ¼ltutâ€™s surface. they developed the technology to harness the power of the aurora even before the taastallans, but turned their vision inward deeper into their own planet rather than out into the sea. their entire culture is dependent on the near worship of the aurora and all technology that harnesses its power. their cities are powered by it, their machinations and machines run on it, and when taastallans first made contact with them, they took to their sea-faring technology like ducks to water and almost immediately began improving it with their own method of harnessing the power of the aurora around them, and began to design their own ships, which were large monolithic masses of rock propelled through the sea. like the samarkir they adapted to life in a multi-national world, usually sticking to technology, engineering, or ship building.   next: heartlanders and deeplanders. deeplanders are denizens of any area that exists far enough away from the heart for them to become twisted and mutated by the corrupting effect of the deep. they have no pre-defined appearance, biology, number of eyes/limbs/mouths, all of which are dependent on their island of origin, mostly being insectoid/cephelapodic in nature. their largest population and only main trade port exists in the deeplands. despite appearing monstrous to early taastallan sailors, the deeplanders, by and large, are relatively peaceful, mostly concerned with maintaining their small and scattered fishing communities. being creatures from the deep they are unaffected by it and do not live in fear of it as the other races need to, as such, can colonise places much further from the heart than taastallans even dare sail to. historically itâ€™s rare for any significantly large group of deeplanders to express violent tendancies or to go to war, but in the few instances it has happened the consequent nightmarish scenes deterred any future conflict from would-be attackers. apart from being excellent fishers thanks to their ability to get much closer to the deep where the largest schools of fish dwell, the deeplands are also home to a bioluminescent long-grass called leidaweed, which when chewed allows non deeplanders to ward off the corrupting effects of the deep, which they export to taastallans. deeplanders tend not to live far from the deep, partly for their own comfort, but also due to the poor reception they get when attempting to integrate into society like other races do. heartlanders are essentially the opposite. they are from the scattered islands closer to the auroral heart than anywhere else. they are tall (7ft-ish) and thin, with feline-esque features and large, vertical-slit eyes. they are highly individualistic and much like the taastallans they initially used complex engines to move along the aurora but in much smaller craft often for just one-three people used for fishing and hunting. they are almost indistinguishable from each other to any non-heartlander with a near uniform appearance and little or no vocal distinction. they have an immense dislike for deeplanders and view anything that comes from outside the â€œpurityâ€ of the auroral heart like them as corrupted and unclean. as such they remain ultimately isolated from much of society established between other races.   finally (i really wasnâ€™t expecting this to be so long), we have the gaalir and the braxi. both from gaalâ€™brax, the braxi are the indigenous people who, by the time taastallan explorers reached their land had long since been subjugated and enslaved by the gaalir. braxi are the most human-like in terms of actual appearance, but with alabaster-white skin, gaunt, pointed features and pointed teeth. their eyes are black with white irises and their hair is thick and wiry like frayed copper wiring, their eyebrows extending to the sides of their head and then protruding out as long whisker-like strands. they have one female for a village worth of males, with a social structure similar to bees. the queen, who is roughly 3-4 times the size of the average male gives birth to 5 or 6 males at a time, and as she grows old or

269406,"i bet a question that salvation army and goodwill employees never pose is ""who farted?"" because it always smells like farts. there's something about the musty odor of some thrift shops that just reminds of a really old, ancient, decrepit fart. like one that had been sealed up in a box, hidden away into the corner of an attic and undiscovered until old aunt sally finally kicks the bucket and her money grubbing children scour the house for valuables.  one of her kids begins to slowly open a corner of the box to peer in when a remnant of aunt sally's famous meatloaf slaps them in the face. they seal the box back up and haul it off to the local donation dumpster. soon, it will find a home amongst old out of style clothes, board games based on long-cancelled tv shows, and random computer wires for peripherals that no one even remembers.  and me. despite the odor, i can't stay away from thrift shops. i'm not a hoarder, which is what a hoarder would say, but truly i'm not. i first began to hit the local salvation army when i got a job at a certain retailer that requires brown pants and navy blue shirts (hint: it rhymes with wal-mart). this was a time in my life when i lived solely on rice, ramen, watered-down milk, and the most basic of cable packages. funds devoted to brand-new clothing was out of the question, especially before my first pay check (which if i recall ended up being a pretty sweet $318 before taxes, for two whole weeks of work).  so the day before my first official day of employment, i headed off to the local salvation army. i wear size 32x30 pants, so naturally i grabbed a pair of 40x26. typically i wear a medium sized polo; i snagged an xxl. i headed off to the fitting room. the only one available had a broken mirror, no hooks, and a sign reading ""please throw all unwanted items on the floor. thx -- management.""  i put on the polo first, it felt like i was swimming in daddy's shirt. it'll shrink. i then pull up the pants to my waist, i glance down and see my wiggling toes and a good six inches of my shin. i laugh out loud at the ridiculousness of not just these stupid pants, but my life.  ""how is this funny, harold?""  i look up. an overweight man in a light blue button-down whose threads are being put to the test by the beer belly enclosed in it.  i feel lightheaded. like when you drive home from work and after you park in the driveway and think ""holy shit, how did i get here? did i sleep drive?""  the menacing figure shakes his sweaty fleshy face and asks again ""huh? what's so funny?""  i start to stutter and barely get out ""heh... oh... these p-pants. so big.""  ""jesus christ, harold. get your shit together, finish this cart or i swear to god this is it, this is your last chance!"" he swivels around, pretty light for such a large pear-shaped man, and waddles off with quick little steps past the rows of milk.  rows of milk? why is their milk in salvation army? i fully look around, taking in all 360 degrees. i'm surrounded by milk and cheese and yogurt and more milk. it's cold. i look down. my polo is tighter, and the ends of my pant legs lead to black square shoes that look like something my uncle fred would wear when his bunion was acting up.  i see a glimmer to my left and turn towards it; a large metal door showing my reflection. i look like i'm 5 feet tall and if someone were to describe me as a furry bowling ball, i probably wouldn't argue too much. i take a couple of steps closer to the door. i see an old man, maybe mid-late 60s, head shaped like a charcoal artist's rendition of a lumpy cantaloupe, a plumpy little torso with short stubby arms and legs.  i take on step closer to the door, noticing a name tag hanging from my left breast. i try to read it. oh, it's backwards. duh. i look down and flip it around. harold - sales associate. wal-mart.  i look back up at the door and stammer, ""oh boy...""  ""oh boy is right! get that cart out there and work like your life depends on it. cause it does!"" the slender figure of an older woman guides me towards a stocking cart containing a mess of cardboard boxes. she opens the glimmering metal door and shoos me out. i head down a long dark corridor, passing by pallets with towering, precariously leaning box upon box. i see a light up ahead, coming from two giant double doors.  when i get out i'm blinded by artificial light, screaming children, and that familiar sense of dread. i struggle to maintain the cart, barely getting it to go straight. it makes a loud squeaking noise which is abruptly interrupted when i ram into something. i peer around the side of the cart because i can't see over it. it's the giant pear man. this time i take in his name badge. ronald - asst. mgr. wal-mart.  ""pull the cart! don't push! never push! you know this! strike two!"" the pear barely manages to keep from foaming.  ""sorry... ronald."" i slowly reply, making eye contact with my head tipped down in shame. he just glares at me.  i notice one of the boxes says ""krft amrcn cheese sngl,"" so i head toward the cheese section i see clearly ahead of me. pulling the cart. wow, this is easier. pear had a good point. i stop by the kraft cheese slices. there's about 5 different varieties in an unfathomable selection of sizes. i go to lift the box from the cart and almost drop it. man, i'm weak. or, maybe harold is weak? i remind myself of the strange dream-like world i'm actually inhabiting, but i push on.  i can't figure out how to open the box. i claw at what appears to be an opening, but my fingernails just dig into the cardboard. i feel someone watching me. i glance over and it's ronald the pear, with the same exact glare.  i turn my back toward him so he doesn't see me struggle with the box. ""c'mon box, fucking open. open sesame."" i try to claw at the box again. a small hole appears! i dig my finger into the tiny opening and try to rip across, placing my weight on one side of the box. i push harder. the box tears open and out flies 20 packages of kraft american cheese, spilling a good 5 feet in every direction.  ""that's it!"" the pear is rushing toward me.  i panic. what the hell am i even doing here? i bolt off toward the produce section. my body is not moving fast. my body? not my body. harold's body! that's how i got here! i tried on those old fart clothes!  can i be thinking clearly? am i really going to have to disrobe to be me again? as i run by the deli case, i catch another glimpse of ""me."" it's that short little weird body again. i look like a walking bomb-omb but without the grace.  it's now or never. i throw off the polo.  ""harold! your shirt! holy shit what are you doing?!"" the pear shouts behind me.  no turning back now. i veer off and head for the checkout. i try to take my pants off while running and begin to lose my balance hopping along on one foot. i get one pant leg off when i completely lose balance. just as i begin to pull the other leg off i fall to my back. i feel like an upside down turtle. looking up while pulling the khaki pant leg left over my heel, the pear appears above me. ""you're fir...""  i'm in the fitting room again. i'm covered in sweat, but in the reflection of the busted mirror i can see that i'm me again. i quickly put my clothes back on and throw the over-sized polo and khakis into the corner of the fitting room.  i don't tell anyone what happened. i just decide to push forward. work this job, get a steady paycheck, go back to school, get my life in order.  for my first day at wal-mart, i break dress code and show up in a black polo and black pants. i look like an ugly male version of audrey hepburn in funny face.  ""you know you're supposed to wear navy blue and brown, right?"" the trainer at orientation asks/informs me.  they guide me to the backroom, through a long walkway, overfilled with stock. we reach a large sliding door, which when the trainer opens, reveals a cold, gray, cubed room, filled with dairy products.  the trainer points ahead. ""this is sue, she'll show you around."" from behind a wall of milk crates appears the slender figure of an older woman.  she offers her hand to shake and gently asks ""oh, you must be harold's replacement?""",0,,
453032,"but being ""healthily underweight"" pretty much has the same number of health risks as being only a little overweight too. there's a reason why the term underweight exists in the first place and why the term applies to a certain height and weight on the bmi scale. because it's not within the healthy weight range. it's hypocritical to say that one side counts as ""healthy"" even though it falls out of the limits of what is actually deemed healthy, and the other side, despite it having the same distance from the ""healthy"" value as the skinny bmi, is considered ""unhealthy"". having a little bit of excess fat (not to the point of rolls), which is what mildly overweight looks like, really shouldn't have any significant impact on your health as you age, just as being slightly underweight does, especially if the overweight person exercises. if fat in and of itself was the only problem here, then ""skinnyfat"" people with a healthy bmi/weight, but almost no muscle would be at risk for all of the things that you claim slightly overweight people are at risk for due to having the same body fat %. you don't see anyone flipping their shit over people who have a healthy bmi but are loaded with fat on their bodies.   if a bmi of 17 was actually healthy, then the range for healthy weight would be extended to include 17 as it's lower limit. having a bmi this low isn't great for continuing optimum health either. yes, there definitely are some people out there who can keep their bmi at this value and be very healthy as they continue to age because they probably eat a very balanced diet with tons of nutrient rich veggies/proteins/etc. i consider this to be the same sort of thing as when people who are extremely muscular and athletic have bmis that are well into the ""overweight"" range, but have little to no body fat. both people are getting the nutrients they need and have no body fat surrounding their organs, but they both fall outside of the ""healthy"" range.   however, if you've ever listened to any ""naturally skinny"" person, they'll go on and on about how much unhealthy crap foods they eat which shocks them as to why they're not larger than they are. these foods have little to no nutritional value. if they continue to eat like this over time (even if it's at a low caloric number), they're missing out on *a lot* of important nutrients that which an absence of these nutrients will cause disease. for example, osteoperosis is a big one.  i guess the point i'm trying to make is that despite the fact that being underweight definitely involves having little to no fat surrounding one's organs, which is ultimately healthier than it being present around organs, being underweight is *still* not a good thing on the body. i'm assuming you're a guy so i guess it's probably more true for you guys that being underweight is better...but there are more health risks to being slightly underweight for women. women's bodies in general simply need a higher body fat percentage than men do in order to be healthy. for example, the [the chart](http://www.builtlean.com/2010/08/03/ideal-body-fat-percentage-chart/) on this webpage. if a woman was slightly underweight and had the body fat percentage of ""essential fat"" that is acceptable for men, then that would *not* be healthy.   so my point is, for a really good amount of slightly underweight individuals (who claim they eat like shit) cannot, by definition be considered healthy, like you've claimed they can be. this doesn't mean you can still be very skinny at a healthy weight. this happens all the time! my best friend is 6' and 150lbs but appears very thin. people assume she's underweight, but she's not. people are deemed underweight, aka at a weight that is less than optimal, simply because they don't eat enough to meet their body's caloric need to function healthily. if what they ate *was* enough then the bmi scale would have to be altered to include a lower number as it's lower limit for the healthy range.   in addition, there's also no reason to get in a tizzy and berate people who are slightly overweight (like many people on reddit do) just because they have a slightly more than optimal body fat percentage. i feel like the hate for slightly overweight people here on reddit is really hypocritical and disturbing because this particular weight group has a significantly less financial strain on the health care system (which is these people's main argument) compared to other groups that people on this site exhibit little to no hate for (eg. smoking cigarettes). because let's be honest, slightly overweight individuals are not going around having heart attacks left right and center like obese people are. that argument only really stands for obese people.   **edit:** i just want to add too that just because i'm acknowledging that being underweight doesn't technically count as being a ""healthy"" weight, it's still no excuse to tell someone to ""go eat more"" or that they look ""sickly"" or whatever. it's rude to berate people regardless if they're underweight or overweight. you don't know their story/life or why they overeat/undereat. let their doctor worry about their body weight health. i've literally seen people on reddit say ""i hate when people tell skinny people to eat a burger!!! they can't help their weight!!! plus that's bullying to make fun of someone's body!!!!"" and then literally in the same fucking comment call someone a ""fatty"". i know the opposite happens irl too (as per stupid fb memes), but seriously, these people need to practice what they fucking preach if they feel so strongly about it. i also don't believe that we should promote being ""obese"" as an okay body type to strive for (ie. tess munster or whatever her name is), and i really hope you don't take this comment as meaning this. however, again i think reddit overreacts to the actual impact women like her have on societal beauty standards for women, as most women promoted in the media are either a low ended healthy bodyweight, underweight, or extremely underweight. what body type should be glorified, then? healthy. which, against popular belief, does in fact include quite thin women like my friend i mentioned earlier in my post. no, healthy thin people would not be excluded if we were to strive for this. my point is, people should strive for a **healthy weight**. they shouldn't strive for slightly overweight or slightly underweight because it falls outside of what is actually healthy. i hope that makes sense.",1,0,0

777699,"i am sure that i am going to be downvoted for this, but most of the bmi haters are people who are overweight or obese who don't want to face the fact that they need to lose weight. rather than take responsibility for their own bodies, they would rather place the blame externally. this is a common defense mechanism but in the end it is ultimately childish as refusing to accept what *is* only hurts the person in denial.  the article posted by the op is a prime example of that logic. the author states that a female that weighs 180 pounds at 5' 5"" is not obese. sorry, if you weigh 180 pounds as a 5' 5"" female, you are at a significantly heightened risk of meeting an early and due to heart attack, stroke, and/or many forms of cancer (particularly breast cancer).  i'm not a fat hater either, just stating the facts. people hate bmi because they confuse being ""overweight"" and being ""obese"" with being unattractive. this of course is an error, as there are plenty of sexy women with a bmi of 30. the stigma of overweight = unattractive is inaccurate, but just because bmi does not correlate to standards in attractiveness does not change the fact that women (and men) with a high bmi are more likely to die of chronic disease at an earlier age than their thinner counterparts.  this stigma developed because at some point it became fashionable and a status symbol to be thin. having a bmi under 25 is used as a status symbol by some petty people to feel superior to and more attractive than their heavier peers. predictably, this has caused backlash in women who have a bmi over 25. the rallying cry for larger women was, ""hey, we can be sexy too!"", which is true. larger women are often sexy. the problem is that at some point this backlash shifted from ""real women have curves"" to ""there are no downsides to being heavier, bmi is broken"". just because the media is starting to ""get it"" that men like bigger women as much as they like thin ones does not mean they get to skip the bad health effects of carrying extra weight.  men are much less vocal about bmi and that is because men tend to be much better at denying reality. ""bmi of 32? it's cause i'm jacked!"" no, you're not. i've spent thousands of hours in a gym and the number of times i've seen men with a bmi of 32+ that couldn't stand to lose a few pounds of body fat can be counted on my fingers.  the male denial of being overweight is particularly ironic because most men would be happy to get with slightly heavier women, whereas women nearly universally find themselves less attracted to fatter men. this is not my personal opinion but rather is supported by research. there are a few chubby-chasing women out there but there has actually been significant amount of research showing that women prefer men with a bmi of around 22, and a bmi of 25+ is a significant detractor. the genetic basis for this is pretty simple: women that have a little extra fat are more likely to carry pregnancies to full term should food supplies be scarce. men who are overweight tend to typically just be less fit than their leaner counterparts.   even being slightly overweight is not ideal for longevity. there are large numbers of studies that show a weight loss of just around 10 pounds in those with a bmi above 25 but under 30 can cause significant improvements in markers of immune function as well as significantly lower blood pressure.  the final question, and rebuttal: why do people with a bmi of 25-30 have lower mortality rates than those in the 18.5-25 range? this is not because fat is protective, but rather because all-cause mortality is a biased statistic. practically everyone that dies from a chronic disease loses weight before their death. people who are overweight when they contract such a disease will almost always lose weight before their death.  tldr: if you're bmi is 25+, you're overweight. sorry, i know it sucks, but it's true. you're not as muscular as you think you are and you certainly are not ""big boned"" or just a ""naturally big person"". this does not mean you are unattractive (in fact. you may be even more attractive than at a lighter weight). it just means you are more likely to have a heart attack, a stroke, or get a number of types of cancer.",1,-2,

(i starved myself and never slept and exercised 3-4 hours a day.) when i ran out of adderall, i slowly started gaining the weight back as old eating habits crept back. then i traded in exercise for becoming a true alcoholic and addict. then at 30, i decided to get sober. i gained 60 pounds or so in 6 months of being sober. i was heavier than ever. now i have almost 2.5 years sober and i've developed healthy habits with the help of ww to get me started and hold me accountable to weigh ins--stopping weighing myself is the worst thing i could have done. i eat mostly whole, natural foods. lots of green veggies and lean protein. i count every calorie, and i pay attention to my macronutrients. i exercise 2+ hours a day and get at least 20,000 steps daily. i have worked up to all of this over the past year and a half, and it's a journey. i'm close to my goal weight, but this time i realize i'm never ""done."" never. this is for life. the second i think i've ""made it"" is the second i start gaining it all back. maintenance is the hardest part because it's forever.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu5emnn/) describe the easy moments. i don't want the hard ones because it's just get trough them. oh, and by the way i hope you lost fat, not muscle to get there. do you look muscular?|i am constantly working on toning. i'm really lucky, for what i've put my body through, i don't have a ton of extra skin. my arms are my least favorite part of me as i have the batwings, but i also have big biceps and toned legs and an almost flat tummy. i just started being able to see the outline of my ribs again. my shoulders are very toned. 40% of my calories are from lean protein to avoid muscle loss and promote muscle gain. the easy moments were discovering how much i love veggies and finding healthy ways to cook them. also, going to farmers markets and discovering ways to exercise that are fun--like various classes at the gym, hiking, and dance classes. also, realizing how walkable my area is. i never drive if i don't have to anymore.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu5esr4/) i have a question regarding dieting, how do you deal with sugar cravings?|the sugar cravings are the hardest part, and the current bane of my existence. i'm definitely addicted to artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols. i have crystal light-like additives in all my water--and i drink about 200 ounces of water a day. i also chew sugar free gum whenever it's around. i actually leave it in the car or i'll eat it like candy. it's a problem i need to take ahold of.  i limit my sugar intake most days to a cup or 2 of fresh berries in the morning with breakfast, and then no more sugar all day (except whatever is naturally occurring in my vegetables) or the cravings continue all day. the fake sugar makes it worse, also, i should mention, and i know i need to quit it.  every once in a while i overdo it with sugar, on a special occasion, and then i go through a week of hell detoxing from it. i get extremely depressed, anxious and irritable. but after about 4 days of detoxing, if i stick to 1-2 servings of fruit in the morning, and then no more sugar, i survive it.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu5hjh7/) did you have more success with men heavy or thinner?  how many partners have you had?|my boyfriend is definitely a ""chubby chaser,"" but he's been with me through thick and thin--no pun intended.  when i was over 250 pounds, that's when i noticed that people weren't as attracted to me. under 230, a lot of attraction from all types of people. (i'm 5'9, i carry it well, and not to toot my own horn, but i have a very pretty face.) when i was under 175, i felt like everyone was attracted to me, but i also was very far gone on drugs and alcohol by this time, and my boyfriend at the time-who was very fit, and i was with from 230 pounds to 160 pounds broke up with me at my thinnest because i had completely lost myself to my eating disorder. at one point i yelled at him, ""what, do you want me to get fat again?"" to which he replied, ""you weren't even that fat!"" which shocked me, because i have defined myself as fat my entire life, and always assumed (and still assume) that this is the first thing everyone thinks about me.  finding partners has never been a problem for me. i was quite promiscuous in my 20's. (i'm into women as well as men.)|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu5i5mn/) how much sex have you had since you dropped the weight? when i start to cut and drop 70lbs, i am a ferocious boner that walks...scratch that...i meant to say runs!|so this time around, i was too ambitious with exercise and calorie cutting when i was close to 300 pounds. after less than a year of being in conservation mode, my ovulation stopped, no period, and with that, my sex drive is barely existent. it kind of sucks, and i hope i get all this back with time.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu5kq74/) what is your ""why""?  what keeps you driven to keep it off this time?|the way that my weight and my relationship with my body and food has defined my life---i'm sick of it. i'm sick of it being everything. i'm ready to start a new story. i don't want to keep re-reading the same chapters over and over. i want to see how the book ends. ultimately, a happy, healthy mind for me leads to a happy, healthy body.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu5yxqb/) how do you gain 100lbs back? how didn't you stop yourself at gaining 20lbs?  how do you feel about people who are in amazing shape?|i gained it back by thinking i was cured. i stopped weighing myself. i slowly decreased my exercise until eventually i just stopped exercising. i drank a lot. netflix a lot. it happened over the course of about 5 years. i had gotten into a relationship with someone who ate like crap, and slowly my bad eating habits turned back into full on not giving a shit when i got sober. i'm an addict, and my food addiction has always been my worst addiction. when i quit drugs, alcohol and pills cold turkey, food was all i had left, and that put me back from just overweight to morbidly obese again. when you're bottom heavy, you can wear leggings and flowy skirted dresses for a long time before they start to feel tight. i mean over 100 pounds lost, and the leggings i wore 105 pounds ago still stay on, they're just baggy. stretchy clothes will stretch with weight gain, and when it happens slowly and you have bdd, it's easy to be in denial.  i admire people who are in amazing shape. i ask them for advice. i love working out with them. i've learned that a sculpted body takes time, discipline, patience and it's a lifestyle. looking good and being healthy, especially as we get older, takes work. i also try my best not to compare, because i will never be without stretch marks, cellulite or some loose skin, and my body type, no matter how hard and long i train, will still be what it is. i definitely do get jealous of people who are able to get fit without the ""baggage"" of a life of previous obesity and yo-yoing.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu62s53/) what was your doc?|what is a doc?|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu6boz5/) what kind of veggies do you eat? i can only take so much broccoli and salad!|i love all the veggies. my favorite for taste are eggplant, mushroom, zucchini, cauliflower rice and mushrooms. i also love sweet bell peppers, but i really have to watch my sugar intake because i'm addicted to sugar, but for someone else, these things are great snacks. if i want volume, it's lettuce and cucumbers and mushrooms, these i feel like i get the most amount of food for the least amount of calories.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu6byas/) drug of choice|adderal. anything that helped me to not eat, but adderal was my downfall. quickly followed by xanax.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu6dcj5/) what would you do if you lost weight and your hollywood crush wanted to sleep with you?|i am sure iâ€™d be flattered.|[here](/r/ama/comments/cewjsd/im_a_32_year_old_woman_who_lost_over_100_pounds/eu6jfbc/)  --- [source] (https://github.com/johnsliao/ama_compiler)",1,,

445062,"you got it, you understand this better than most people it's absurd to believe you will look like a starving 90 pounds emaciated guy for losing 5% body fat just because you don't have built the 20 pounds of extra muscles that requires more than year of bulking while also getting fatter.  i have the best testimonial possible, because it's from a guy who doesn't lift weight. my friend is a dancer, he needed to be lean for dancing faster and better. he never lifted a weight and never will. his weight was normal but he had 17-18% body fat. he cut his calories and without building any extra muscles because he wasn't lifting weights at all, in two months he lost 13 pounds and got to 12% body fat. he doesn't look emaciated he looks bigger, without the fat even his small muscular mass looks bigger, he looks healthier, leaner and better than ever and get compliments from girls. he feels better too.  so you see even people who don't lift, the majority of the world population doesn't lift, still cut calories when they have extra fat, they don't wait to be obese before cutting. and all of them end up looking better, leaner, in spite of not even an ounce of extra muscle built.  anyway from all the testimonials i have read it takes two months for the typical skinny-fat guy to get to an healhier lower body fat. rusty says that skinny-fat people are so close to having a very good looking body, they just need to increase the intensity of their training and cut their calories.  here are some example of skinny-fat people cutting and what how they ended up. the time frame of their transformation is always 2 months more or less.  http://i49.tinypic.com/ofyd5d.png  http://i45.tinypic.com/mh4q6o.jpg  http://i50.tinypic.com/1zdw7kn.png  http://i50.tinypic.com/2d1wd94.png  i see a lot of skinny-fat guys succeeding with a cut and most of them flirted for years with bulking, lean bulking, strarting strength and i always read the same sentence from them ""i wish i had started to cut years ago!""    some quotes about cutting first:        ""skinny but with a gut which looks awful on skinny dudes. skinny-fatiâ€™ve been there. a couple years ago i was eating 7000 calories a day for a little while in a misguided attempt to finally put on some muscle. which is a higher priority to you right now?

887453,"#####&amp;#009;  ######&amp;#009;  ####&amp;#009; section 15. [**anatomy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megalodon#anatomy) of article  [**megalodon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megalodon): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;  &gt;among extant species, the great white shark is regarded as the best analogue to megalodon.  the lack of well-preserved fossil megalodon skeletons led scientists to rely on the great white shark as the basis of its reconstruction and size estimation.   &gt;due to fragmentary remains, estimating the size of *c. megalodon* has been challenging.  however, the scientific community has concluded that *c. megalodon* was larger than the [whale shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whale_shark), *rhincodon typus*. scientists focused on two aspects of size: total length and body mass.  &gt;the first attempt to reconstruct a megalodon jaw was made by [bashford dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bashford_dean) in 1909. from the dimensions of this jaw reconstruction, it was hypothesized that *c. megalodon* could have approached 30 metres (98Â ft).  better knowledge of dentition and more accurate muscle structures,  led to a rectified version of dean's jaw model about 70Â percent of its original size and to a size consistent with modern findings.  to resolve such errors, scientists, aided by new fossil discoveries of *c. megalodon* and improved knowledge of its closest living analogue's anatomy, introduced more quantitative methods for estimating its size based on the statistical relationships between the tooth sizes and body lengths.   some methods are mentioned below.  &gt;in 1973, hawaiian [ichthyologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ichthyologist) john e. randall used a plotted graph to demonstrate a relationship between the enamel height (the vertical distance of the blade from the base of the enamel portion of the tooth to its tip) of the largest tooth in the upper jaw of the great white shark and its total length.   randall extrapolated this method to estimate *c. megalodon's* total length. randall cited two megalodon teeth in his work, specimen number 10356 at the [american museum of natural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_museum_of_natural_history) and specimen number 25730 at the [united states national museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_museum_of_natural_history), which had enamel heights of 115 millimetres (4.5Â in) and 117.5 millimetres (4.63Â in) respectively.  these teeth yielded a corresponding total length of about 13 metres (43Â ft).   in 1991, richard ellis and john e. mccosker claimed that tooth enamel height does not necessarily increase in proportion to the animal's total length.   &gt;in 1996, after scrutiny of 73Â great white shark specimens, michael d. gottfried, [leonard compagno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leonard_compagno) and s. curtis bowman proposed a linear relationship between the height of the largest upper anterior tooth and total length in the great white shark. the proposed relationship is: total length in metres = âˆ’ (0.096) Ã— [ua maximum height ([mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millimetre))]-(0.22).   gottfried and colleagues then extrapolated their technique to *c. megalodon*. the biggest megalodon tooth in the possession of this team was an upper second anterior specimen, whose maximum height was 168 millimetres (6.6Â in). this tooth had been discovered by compagno in 1993. it yielded an estimated total length of 15.9 metres (52Â ft).  rumors of larger megalodon teeth persisted at the time.  the maximum tooth height for this method is measured as a vertical line from the tip of the crown to the bottom of the lobes of the root, parallel to the long axis of the tooth.  in layman's terms, the maximum height of the tooth is its slant height.   &gt;in 2002, shark researcher clifford jeremiah proposed that total length was proportional to the root width of an upper anterior tooth. he claimed that for every 1 centimetre (0.39Â in) of width, there is approximately 4.5 feet (1.4Â m) of the shark. jeremiah pointed out that the jaw perimeter of a shark is directly proportional to its total length, with the width of the roots of the largest teeth being a proxy for estimating jaw perimeter. the largest tooth in the possession of jeremiah had a root width of about 12 centimetres (4.7Â in), which yielded 16.5 metres (54Â ft) total length. ward asserted that this method is based on a sound principle that works well with most large sharks.   &gt;in 2002, paleontologist kenshu shimada of [depaul university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/depaul_university) proposed a linear relationship between tooth crown height and total length in great white sharks after conducting anatomical analysis of several specimens.  this relationship is expressed as: total length in centimetres = a + bx, where a is a constant, b is the slope of the line and x is the crown height of tooth in millimetres. this relationship allowed any tooth to be used for the estimate.   the crown height was measured as maximum vertical enameloid height on the labial side. shimada pointed out that previously proposed methods were based on weaker evaluation of dental homology, and that the growth rate between the crown and root is not [isometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isometry), which he considered in his model.  furthermore, this relationship could be used to predict the total length of sharks that are morphologically similar to the great white shark, such as *c. megalodon*.   using this model, the upper anterior tooth (with maximum height of 168 millimetres (6.6Â in)) possessed by gottfried and colleagues corresponded to a total length of 15.1 metres (50Â ft).  in 2010, shark researchers catalina pimiento, dana j. ehret, bruce j. macfadden and gordon hubbell estimated the total length of *c. megalodon* on the basis of shimada's method. among the specimens found in the gatun formation of panama, specimen number 237956 yielded a total length of 16.8 metres (55Â ft).  later on, shark researchers (including pimiento, ehret and macfadden) revisited gatun formation and recovered additional specimens, the specimen number 257579 yielded a total length of 17.9 metres (59Â ft) on the basis of shimada's method.   &gt;in the 1990s, marine biologists such as patrick j. schembri and staphon papson opined that *c. megalodon* may have approached a maximum of around 24 to 25 metres (79 to 82Â ft) in total length,   however gottfried and colleagues proposed that *c. megalodon* could likely approach a maximum of only 20.3 metres (67Â ft) in total length.    currently, most experts acknowledge that *c.megalodon* reached a total length of more than 16 metres (52Â ft).      &gt;gordon hubbell from [gainesville, florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gainesville,_florida) possesses an upper anterior megalodon tooth whose maximum height is 184.1 millimetres (7.25Â in).  in addition, a megalodon jaw reconstruction contains a tooth whose maximum height is reportedly 193.67 millimetres (7.625Â in).  this jaw reconstruction was developed by fossil hunter vito bertucci,  who was known as ""megalodon man"".    &gt;gottfried and colleagues introduced a method to determine the mass of the great white after studying the lengthâ€“mass relationship data of 175Â specimens at various growth stages and extrapolated it to estimate *c. megalodon's* mass. according to their model, a 15.9 metres (52Â ft) long megalodon would have a mass of about 48 [metric tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tonne) (53 [short tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_ton)),   a 17 metres (56Â ft) long megalodon would have a mass of about 59 [metric tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tonne) (65 [short tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_ton)),  and a 20.3 metres (67Â ft) long megalodon would have a mass of 103 [metric tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tonne) (114 [short tons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_ton)).    &gt;a team of japanese scientists, t. uyeno, o. sakamoto, and h. sekine, discovered and excavated partial remains of a megalodon, with a nearly complete associated set of its teeth, from [saitama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saitama,_saitama), japan in 1989.  another nearly complete associated megalodon dentition was excavated from [yorktown formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yorktown_formation) of [lee creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lee_creek), north carolina in the united states and served as the basis of a jaw reconstruction of *c. megalodon* at the [american museum of natural history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/american_museum_of_natural_history) in new york city.  these associated tooth sets solved the mystery of how many teeth would be in the jaws of the megalodon in each row. as a result, highly accurate jaw reconstructions became possible. more associated megalodon dentitions were found in later years. based on these discoveries, scientists s. applegate and l. espinosa published an artificial [dental formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dentition) (representation of dentition of an animal with respect to types of teeth and their arrangement within the animal's jaw) for megalodon in 1996.   most accurate modern *c. megalodon* jaw reconstructions are based on this dental formula.  &gt;the dental formula of *c. megalodon* is: 2.1.7.43.0.8.4.   &gt;as evident from the formula, *c. megalodon* had four kinds of teeth in its jaws.   &gt;   &gt;* *anterior* - a  &gt;* *intermediate* - i (megalodon's tooth technically appears to be an upper anterior and is termed as ""a3"" because it is fairly symmetrical and does not point mesially (side of the tooth toward the midline of the jaws where the left and right jaws meet), but this tooth is still designated as an intermediate tooth.  however, the great white shark's intermediate tooth does point mesially. this point was raised in the *carcharodon* vs. *carcharocles* debate regarding the megalodon and favors the case of *carcharocles* proponents.)  &gt;* *lateral* - l  &gt;* *posterior* - p  &gt;megalodon had a very robust dentition,  and had a total of about 276Â teeth in its jaws, spanning 5Â rows. [paleontologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paleontologist) suggest that a very large megalodon had jaws over 2 metres (7Â ft) across.   &gt;in 2008, a team of scientists led by s. wroe conducted an experiment to determine the bite force of the [great white shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_white_shark), using a 2.4 metres (8Â ft) long specimen, and then isometrically scaling the results for its maximum confirmed size and the conservative minimum and maximum body mass of *c. megalodon*, placing the bite force of the latter between 108,514Â n (24,400Â lbf) and 182,201Â n (41,000Â lbf) in a posterior bite. compared to 18,216Â n (4,100Â lbf) for the largest confirmed great white shark,  and 5,300Â n (1,200Â lbf) for the placoderm fish *[dunkleosteus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunkleosteus)*.   &gt;in addition, wroe and colleagues pointed out that sharks shake sideways while feeding, amplifying the post-cranial generated forces. therefore the total force experienced by prey is likely higher than the estimate.  the extraordinary bite forces in *c. megalodon* must be considered in the context of its great size and of paleontological evidence suggesting that *c. megalodon* was an active predator of large whales.   &gt;megalodon's exceptionally robust teeth are [serrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serrated),   which would have improved efficiency in slicing its prey's [flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flesh). paleontologist b. k. kent suggested that these teeth are comparatively thicker for their size with much lower slenderness and bending strength ratios. their roots are substantially larger relative to total tooth heights, and so have a greater mechanical advantage. teeth with these traits are good cutting tools and are well suited for grasping powerful prey and would seldom crack even when slicing through bones.   &gt;gottfried and colleagues further estimated the schematics of megalodon's entire skeleton.  to support the beast's dentition, its jaws would have been massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of the great white, which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. the jaws would have given it a ""pig-eyed"" profile.  its [chondrocranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chondrocranium) would have had a blockier and more robust appearance than the great white.  its fins were proportional to its larger size.  scrutiny of the partially preserved vertebral megalodon specimen from belgium revealed that *c. megalodon* had a higher vertebral count than specimens of any known shark. only the great white approached it.   &gt;using the above characteristics, gottfried and colleagues reconstructed the entire skeleton of *c. megalodon*, which was later put on display at the [calvert marine museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calvert_marine_museum) at [solomon's island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solomon%27s_island), [maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maryland) in the united states.    this reconstruction is 11.5 metres (38Â ft) long and represents a young individual. the team stresses that relative and proportional changes in megalodon skeletal features are [ontogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontogenetic) in nature in comparison to that of great white, as they occur in great whites while growing.  fossil remains of *c. megalodon* confirm that it had a heavily calcified skeleton while alive.   &gt;  ---  ^interesting: [^megalodon ^\(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megalodon_\(film\)) ^| [^megalodon ^\(genus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megalodon_\(genus\)) ^| [^megalodon: ^the ^monster ^shark ^lives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megalodon:_the_monster_shark_lives)   ^parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^nsfw](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=autowikibot nsfw toggle&amp;message=%2btoggle-nsfw+ciycnl6) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=autowikibot deletion&amp;message=%2bdelete+ciycnl6)^. ^will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(faqs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^magic ^words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",0,,
403509,"i have severe body issues, and i think a good deal of them can be attributed to how i have been raised. though i don't place all blame there - i have choices, and i have made some bad ones.  my mother has been anorexic nearly all her life - after being raped by her school's football team at 15, she developed anorexia and was hospitalised on the verge of death some time later. she's never fully recovered. she's handling it better now, but she's still sick and it's too late to help her.   my dad, on the other hand, is a fat guy. he hasn't always been that way, but after he broke his spine, he couldn't work so much, and eventually became unemployed when the kids started coming along as he couldn't handle it all at once.  my parents split when i was 13, and it was incredibly messy - badmouthing each other, mum's abusive boyfriend she moved in before dad was moved out (the rest of that is another story, however)  now, when i was younger, my dad has this thing about me clearing my plate. even though i was just 7 years old and had a meal as huge as his. he'd make me sit at the table for hours, once or twice breaking the plate over my head, hitting me. i had to eat or be punished. however, he judged me for being chubby - ""pumbaa"" became a nickname, and i hated it. my mother, on the other hand, simply loved me less for being tubby (i noted this when i realised she only showed an interest in my sister when she was leaner, and when she started treating another sister less well when she got tubby [she's just hit puberty ffs!]).   my weight fluctuated for years. i generally kept a healthy weight or just a little chubby, but i resented myself and my body. i stayed with an emotionally and verbally abusive boyfriend when i was 15 (he was in his 20s), and one night he sexually assaulted me in a way that made me wish he'd plain raped me instead (i am not diminishing any sexual assault or rape, but what he did to me hurt *me* more than i think forced sex would). up until i was 16ish, i stayed normal/chubby. then, i just stopped eating. i didn't want to stop eating, i just wasn't hungry. i became a shut in. the only thing i ate was the dinner my dad brought to me in my room (which i barely left for months on end), and i'd throw half of it out the window to the dogs. i rapidly dropped to 47kgs on a 5 foot 2 inch frame. wide hips and shoulders, my ribs stuck out enough that you could see how misshapen one is (i don't mind it, and it's not an issue, it just looked awkward). around this time, i met mr whoooah online. he offered me so much support and care, i started changing my ways. i'd eat small snacks throughout the day, i grew confident, i fell in love with him. and my mother, who i'd not spoken to for over two years, who i had resigned to keep out of my life, wanted to see me. the boyfriend was in jail, so i agreed.   i somehow ended up living there almost a year, looking after her and any siblings who visited, making sure she ate with us and doing all the cooking. but the boyfriend came back. i was stuck, but didn't want to move back with my dad yet (isolation) as i went to tafe (like community college, i suppose), made new friends, and saved up to see mr whoooah who lived overseas (i did go see him last june, it was wonderful). i decided i'd like to gain some weight. and i did so. i got to a healthier weight, went to see mr whoooah - but when i came home, i gained some weight due to likely depression and the implanon i'd had put in before leaving. my mother got ruder, more malicious. she's talk about me behind my back, complain every time i went to eat anything. eventually she kicked me out. she did this by telling my dad so while i was visiting him, and he told me (shouting and calling me names, for some reason) as he dropped me off at her empty house (she was out somewhere). i tried to argue a point with her on the phone, wanting a week to organise alternate accommodation. she said no. i asked for 24 hours to collect my things. she hung up, but my young sister (only 9 or 10) told me she went to the boyfriend and laughed about calling the cops on me if i was still there in 24 hours, and said she'd burn my things.   now, i'm back with my dad. i'm fat (not obese, but big). every time i go to eat, he mocks how fat i am. i don't remember the last time he called me by my name - always ""chubblebutt"", ""pumbaa"", ""fatty"", ""lardarse"" and ""useless fat cunt"". when i tell him it hurts me and destroys my self-esteem and confidence, he laughs and says it entertains him. i have nowhere to go from here, right now. i am stuck, broke, no license, no qualifications to work or anywhere to work even if i had them, few friends, and i haven't left the house in months. if i try to diet or exercise, he mocks me. if i'm happy about losing a kilo, he points out all the rest.   i gained my weight rapidly, so i now have stretch-marks i fear will never disappear. i have severe issues with food - always too much, or far too little. i have never really loved my body, but when i remember how i felt when i was small or healthy weights, i miss that. i didn't know what i had when i had it. i was underweight and still thought i was fat, for gods sake. i see how pretty, happy and slender i was, and i hate myself for not seeing it and holding onto it for dear life. i didn't know i was so happy until i was unhappy again.   i go out of my way to try support all five of my siblings regarding diet and relationship to food. i go out of my way to make them feel good, even if it means bending the truth a little. but i never lie for the sake of positivity. i was lied to in the other extreme, the negative, and i hate what that did to me. i tell my pubescent sister that i gained weight too at her age, that i grew up really pretty, does she remember? then i made some bad choices and put on weight, and that now i'm making good choices again. sometimes she offers to come on walks with me, heh. and i have a young brother, who is (to be brutally honest), fat. do i mock him? no. do i make him feel guilt with every bite of food he eats no matter how hungry he is like my mother? no. when i feed him, to i feed him a gigantic plate of food? no. i tell him he'll grow up to stay just as handsome, and that he's got a lot of growing left to do. i tell him that he's going to need that bit of weight when he does all his big growing up, and cite his big brother now being taller than me as an example of how he'll grow. i tell them all that i love them, always will, and i am trying to lead by positive example. i don't know how well i'm doing, but it has to be better than my parents.  [siblings ages and genders are: me, 19(f), 17(f), 16(m), 12(f), 9(m), 7(f)]   *edit: holy shit, i didn't realise this was so long. i'm sorry! but if you bother reading this, thank you for your time.*",1,,

962428,"america - texas (austin, houston, countryside, west texas) :  * favorite food: fried foods and tex-mex. mexican food itself lacks a wide range of vegetables, however texans converted it into these cheese-covered, sour cream ladened monstrosities. tasty, but incredibly calorie-dense. texas' soil and climate is very diverse, but they don't support a large variety of vegetables and fruits. corn, onions, tomatoes, grapefruit, peppers, pecans, and prickly-pear cactus are the easiest to grow.   * portion-size: texans have strong state pride. this pride can manifest as ""texas-sized"" or ""only for true texans."" what this really means is enormous portion sizes. instead of 5 oz steaks, you purchase 20 oz ones. instead of a 20 oz drink, you purchase a gallon.    * exercise: texas is very large and has a very low population density compared to other areas of the us (ignoring the midwest). this, combined with a lack of reliable public transportation in their cities, leads to a driving and largely sedentary population. there are pockets of more active individuals in areas that encourage activity (farming, austin), but it is largely a culture that drives and sits.   * drinking: drinking is a popular pass-time  * standard of beauty: there are several because of the many different kinds of populations in texas. the young, light-skinned, curvy (in the traditional sense) latina in popular in many areas. the southern-belle tall, big hair, curvy, medium-large frame, with a slightly hefty (but normal) weight is popular in farming and more rural regions. men who are manly, cowboy/football types are popular in the country. the pale-skinned, thinner, toned, overly-masculine male is also popular in some areas.   * dieting: the idea of dieting is frowned upon. leaving food on your plate is rude/selfish/sinful. losing weight is seen as unhealthy. parents overfed their children. many cultures within texas encourage eating until in pain. the idea of unbuckling your belt after a meal is funny and encouraged. there are areas of texas (like austin) which are subject to absurd diets or pseudo-science. fat-logic and ""conditions"" are far more dominant.  ""it isn't my fault."" ""i'm big-boned""  are generally excuses. in generally people here are both taller and have much larger bone structures than the average american, disregarding the fat aspect.   * groceries: texans have less home-cookers than states like florida or pennsylvania, but more than big cities like boston, new york, or chicago. groceries stores are all over, with incredibly reasonable prices (go heb!). there are many specialty stores (like central market, mexican marts, butchers, asian supermarkets, whole foods). however, from my experience the majority of people shop at heb. the large houses (storage space) and ability to drive to obtain food allows for warehouse shopping. there are only a handful of food deserts in the major cities.   america - massachusetts (boston):  * favorite food: dunkin donuts. no... boston has local foods like clam chowder, but seafood (fresh) is very difficult to come by. local chains like dunkin donuts, legal seafood, and papa ginos are popular. i have only noticed a trend towards food swamped in butter, sugar, and/or heavy cream. there are a lot of immigrants in boston, so a lot of different cuisines (usually remade into american-style) are available. tex-mex/mexican food is terrible.   * portion-sizes are smaller than texas, but usually enough for two people. when locals serve food, they also tend to be heavy-handed on portions. many take half home to eat later.   * exercise: boston is a more mobile city than texas with a half-way decent transit system. however, it is also very dense. having a car becomes necessary only 4-6 miles outside city center. the areas around boston host much more inactive people, less runners (which is popular here), and more cars.   * drinking: drinking, although somewhat popular as the town hosts a variety of amazing cider houses and breweries (like sam adams), is not nearly as prevalent as texas.   * standard of beauty: standard american or hollywood actors (little to no tan though). overall averagely fit guys and girls on the skinnier side. preppy fashion or being fashionable is more important than in texas. though, this isn't new york, so it isn't that big of a factor.  * dieting: people here are very prone to fat logic and fad dieting. mothers in this area will overfeed you. not finishing your plate is rude. they do not encourage gorging, which was nice. people here have small-average bone structures. their heights are also closer to the american averages.   * groceries: boston has wicked bad food deserts, price gouging, and lack of access to basic food items. the majority of bostonians do not know how to cook. ability to purchase cooking utensils is also very limited. therefore most people here tend to eat out. fresh or frozen vegetables are difficult to find, rotten or expired, or extremely expensive in the inner city. bulk shopping and warehouse shopping are difficult (long lines) to impossible. small apartments and lack of access discourages the practice.   japan - tokyo, osaka:  * favorite food: fish, rice, noodles, and soups. they have a variety of vegetables available, though these are not accessible when eating out. home-eating includes a lot of vegetables and soups, like sukiyaki or a simple miso soup. soba is a favorite is some provinces of kanto. sweets are not nearly as sweet as american foods, although red bean paste is used very liberally. dairy is not common.   * portion-sizes: portions are sized for one average person. a small woman may have difficulty finishing some plates. usually satiety is met without feeling overly full. most meals are about the size of an average appetizer in america, depending on the american restaurant. some mothers overfeed while complaining about your weight &gt;.&lt;.   * exercise: japan is an exceptionally mobile country. getting a driver's license and owning a car in japan is expensive. they also have an amazing public transportation system that includes an national rail network that goes to many smaller, rural areas. this means many people favor walking, biking, or public transit over driving, even in the country-side. they do not, on average, engage in extra exercise like running or weight-lifting.    * drinking: drinking is a social experience. beware of japanese people. they will definitely get you drunk. however, their drinking would be considered lightweight to other countries and states i have lived in. in texas it was common to knock back 10-15 beers on game day. a big night out in japan is usually 2-3 before they are trashed.  * standard of beauty: depends on where you go. japan is a big country. in general tokyo and osaka are very thin. one of my friends wanted to get to a bmi of 14. the country-side favors more healthy range bmis. most woman i met were either just normal weight, or underweight. young, small-framed, small heads, large eyes, good legs, and low weight is popular. toned or fit woman are not seen as attractive. overly busty is seen as slutty. overly curvy (in the traditional sense) is often interpreted as overweight or obese. men have two stages. an ikeman/jpop teenage stage which is usually praised for being thin, more feminine features, and a lightly-toned (but not overly developed) body. more manly features are desired as the men grow older.   * dieting: they generally skip meals instead of exercising. they are very, very small-framed compared to americans, mexicans, or canadians (sorry, i've never been to europe).  it is very common for family and friends to call someone out for being fat or overweight. they will also encourage weight-loss. they don't really have fat logic like america, more like nutritional misinformation. they generally agree in cal in and cal out, but some of them don't really seen the purpose in nutrients. seriously you think its ok to skip meals so you have have wine and cake later?? really? fad diets happen, but are generally disregarded by most people as snake oil.  * groceries: groceries are very accessible, regardless of where you are located. specialty shops are common. food prices are similar to suburbs of boston, but might be expensive compared to other areas of the world. sugar is more expensive than meat, so sweets and candies are less common. home cooking is very popular and most of the population knows how to cook. there is good accessibility to both fresh ingredients and tools for cooking. local dinner pickup options are usually made fresh daily and generally contain balanced meals. vegetables are easy to find. fruits can be oddly expensive. bulk shopping is rarely done because of lack of space in homes/apartments. warehouse shopping is rare.",1,,
385728,"i don't see how banning television is a ""wacko political view"" just because most people don't perceive the harm. i see it as a logical extension given what television does to the human mind and its inherent undemocratic nature. we ban lots of technologies because they cause more harm than good, for example lawn darts and drugs. people refuse to take this logic to television because of the political power that television offers and the large number of addicts.   my main point is that this is not a black and white freedom of speech issue because of the nature of the medium being altered. if chavez starts to ban specific newspapers or the internet, then venezuelans would have a cause for serious alarm. i just don't think that futzing with television stations raises the alert status that much.",0,,

950818,"lol, iâ€™ve grown up being consistently mistaken to be lighter than i was (at my heaviest, people assumed i was about 20 kg lighter, even medical staff would be surprised to hear my weight. my gynecologist even accused me of not looking fat because i was â€œtallâ€ relative to her other patients when iâ€™m like, 161 cm, and everyone else is just even shorter). the weights of fictional characters, celebrities, and even other people my age seemed unreal because how could people be so light when weâ€™re almost the same height??? but it seems that i have also always been bigger boned (i can look â€œfitâ€ because my skeletal frame is large enough that fat doesnâ€™t seem to hang off of my frame, i donâ€™t look â€œroundâ€ but instead a little soft everywhere) and things seem to check out with other bigger boned people i know. bmi would likely call all of us overweight or even obese (but there is a variant that accounts for frame size which i trust more, however bmi in general isnâ€™t appropriate for people with muscles) whether weâ€™re a little chubby or clearly lean and athletic. wished i could check my fat percentage to confirm tho.   looking at the people closest to my height, i can see why someone with a smaller frame would weigh that much. francios is pretty obviously tiny and delicate-looking so they must be very light for them to look so thin. in my preteens i was about that weight and i was already a bit chubby. i donâ€™t think i could ever reach that weight again without being severely underweight because my skeleton seems to have filled out since my teens. max is also fairly believable because he looks really narrow and small for a guy (dudeâ€™s shoulders are so narrow and heâ€™s barely wider than luna at the torso). his weight is likely attainable for me and i would have arms as thin as his look but iâ€™m fairly certain that my rib cage would be visible since iâ€™m bigger boned than he is. i have issue with kohaku though because sheâ€™s supposed to be strong and athletic and she doesnâ€™t look small (unless sheâ€™s next to someone like tsukasa) so i would have expected at least 60 kg for her even if she was shorter than i expected.  another thing to consider is *where* people carry their weight because it seems that if itâ€™s mostly in the leg area then most people wouldnâ€™t notice it. luna looks like she could be so light since sheâ€™s waif-ish at the torso but her weight is heavily concentrated on her bottom half so it isnâ€™t unbelievable for her to weigh more.",1,0,0

769742,"&gt;i can't believe you actually think it is that simple.  look, energy doesn't come from nowhere.  if you don't give your body fuel, it'll start to eat itself.  if you give it too much, it'll store it as fat (and possibly pass it through your stool, this is why it floats if you have a very fatty meal).  no matter which way you slice it, if you cut your intake, you cut your fat storage.  john walker gives a [great analogy](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/rubberbag.html) for this.  if you have real evidence that this is not the case, please post some articles (preferably from respected medical journals, but for now we'll accept anything).  &gt;which ought to tell you something about how effective said help is.  exactly, you can't fix the problem for people if they are the problem.  people themselves hold the power to fix the problem but choose not to.  whether this is due to a feeling of helplessness or depression is open to debate, but it's still a problem they have control over.  &gt;no they don't. a kid in grade school who becomes fat, possibly just temporarily because of changes in and around adolescence, immediately gets scorn. there's nothing ""prolonged treatable health"" there. hell, i remember a kid who just looked fat for a week because of an allergic reaction and that got him tons of abuse.  i don't get why it is so hard to recognize that the reaction isn't based on a rational, carefully calculated ""impact on me"" decision, but rather an immediate, visceral reaction to the visuals.  kids are cruel, they also make fun of people with acne, glasses, or red hair, the clothes they wear, their accent, their skin colour, anything that makes them different.  i'm not talking about adolescent children who don't have an understanding of life, society, politics, science, or biology.  &gt;i don't get why it is so hard to recognize that the reaction isn't based on a rational, carefully calculated ""impact on me"" decision, but rather an immediate, visceral reaction to the visuals.  i've already stated this point several times, but perhaps with petdance and not you.  i'll copy and paste:  when we realized that obesity can become costly and is detrimental to health and quality of life, society establishes a norm of thinness. in this way, we develop social norms.  these social norms, are that impulse you may see in children, or perhaps some less-civilized adults.  this impulse is based on the ""impact on me"" calculations.  we as people make many calculations every second, you calculate trajectories of flying objects while playing catch, not aware of the intense math involved.  judging costs to you as a society is roughly the same type of calculation.  for a more in-depth look i suggest reading [richard dawkin's self gene](http://tinyurl.com/selfishgene) as he explains this as well, and much better than i can in a reddit comment.  &gt;where do you think the money comes from to fund these industries to ""help"" people lose weight? from the skinny people?  tax dollars, so yes, skinny people, dumb people, rich people, smart people, and fat people.  again, maybe you don't read my responses, but in most civilized countries including my own, health care is given to all, this includes help losing weight if you are morbidly obese.  &gt;actually, maintaining it doesn't require any excess calories at all. i don't get why people think this. aha! so you must have some idea on how the math of calories works.  so if you eat less calories than you burn, you'll lose weight.  even if it takes a good period (a few weeks) for the body to realize that your not in a famine, your just eating regularly now.  &gt;but i thought you were off that definition and on to this thing you made up about people who are 150 lbs overweight.  then don't bring it up.  &gt;so, just to clarify then: people who are morbidly obese are lazy slobs and a burden on society, deserving of all the abuse and vitriol that comes there way... and if you are just obese, no big deal?  first, stop building a straw man.  second of all, if you are obese, take it as a warning to adjust your eating habits accordingly.  if you are morbidly obese, seek help, get healthy for yourself, your family, friends, and society as a whole.**again, please note the order of priorities.**  &gt;the point of the demonstration of that specific situation is that the assumption that people who are overweight got there by a simple process of eating too much and are too lazy and aren't doing anything about it and therefore are somehow deserving of scorn is not at least faulty some of the time, and therefore ought to not be applied as a line of prejudicial thinking all of the time.  we know that obesity is from taking in more calories than you burn.  thus if you are still eating 2500 calories but only burning 1900 and do this for years.  your going to get morbidly obese.  every 2500 calories is a pound.  it'll add up fast.  how else do you explain obesity?  a fat fairy?  it's about people's habits.  whether it's 'fair' that some people can eat a gallon of ice cream and not gain weight is irrelevant.  life isn't fair.  kids may have picked on you or your friends, it's over now, get over it.  it's getting harder and harder to even respond to your comments.  they lack substance, knowledge and cites of any kind.  anecdotal evidence is moot in most circles, including reddit.  if you want to break out the medical journals i'm game, i got several hours to spend on research, and got almost unlimited access to any established journal out there, so fire away.",1,-2,

134785,"the general rule is to get the largest arm you can comfortably and reliably shoot and carry concealed (if carry is planned). that doesn't tell you much, since depending on your size and confidence level, that can really vary. there is no shame in only being able to safely handle a small gun; ignore ego and the advice of people who seem to fetishize size and power. the person who wants to espouse or dismiss a certain caliber is frequently an idiot.         for a handgun, one chooses between revolvers and (semi)""auto"" pistols-  both fire one shot per trigger pull. revolvers are, generally, cheaper, simpler, require less maintenance, more reliable, but bulkier - lumpy - and with lower ammo capacity. autoloaders are smaller, thin and flat, have potentially larger magazines, and need to be cleaned more often and kept relatively free of debris. some people have issues with biting and limpwristing; where the moving slide of an auto cuts the web between thumb and pointer, and where a weak grip prevents the pistol from reloading itself. some calibers are common to both types; others are usually seen only in one or the other, due to the design of their case rims.         there are a number of rounds considered underpowered for defense - .22lr, .25 acp, .32 acp. underpowered rounds may still kill - a human is suddenly, irrevocably dead in a single quick second - but they may also wound without neutralizing the threat in time. knowing that the person may die in an hour isn't any good for self defense. they have to be out of commission now, or forget the whole thing. their death isn't the goal; your safety is, and their death is only a sadly necessary prerequisite to that. only about 20% of gsws are fatal, due to typically quick medical response among other things. a weak gun is still a threat, and can't be ignored safely. if you can have nothing else, have one rather than nothing. guns designed for small calibers - mouse guns - can be tiny. some fit in a cigarette packet. they are also surprisingly loud - less frame metal to absorb the shock - carry few rounds and can be difficult to shoot accurately. large, heavy guns of small caliber are easy and pleasant - which is why they're suited to recreation. for defense, they have neither the power nor the concealability.           the next step up - .38, for a revolver, .380 in a (semi)""automatic"" pistol - is considered the bottom rung of effective defense calibers; the weakest serious contender. this is followed by 9mm, .40 s&amp;w, then .45 acp. these are the mosr common, easiest to find, most sensible choices. this is where you should start. a revolver in .38 special often also allows the use of .357 mag - the two rounds are the same size, unintuitively. a 9mm glock auto pistol can hold as many as 17 rounds; whereas a revolver rarely holds more than 5-7 shots unless it's of a smaller caliber. tiny pistols in relatively larger rounds are a poor choice - to effectively handle a round like .45 acp, handguns should be ""full-size"" although the early 90's saw a fad for mini 1911's, shrunken versions of .45 guns, and numerous ""derringer"" style guns fire large rounds. these guns max out the ""power"" and ""concealability"" ratings at the expense of handling. do not buy one. it will be painful to shoot, difficult to control and innacurate. some are frankly unsafe, in my opinion. you will not practice as much as you should. scale the size of the gun up with the caliber. .40 s&amp;w is pricier and varies in popularity. 9mm is a century old worldwide standard of absolutely acceptable strength.         larger rounds, like .357, .44 mag, 10mm and the like are not good choices; unless large wild animals must be accounted for as threats, such as bear, feral pig and mountain lion. they kick too hard, cost too much, and may overpenetrate - walls, not just targets. the guns that fire them are large. for a home defense only situation, with no adjoining neighbors or children's rooms - a .44 or .357 would be fine. pistols are fine for home defense; they are maneuverable, easy to store and retrieve, powerful enough, and accurate indoor distances. rifles may offer potentially higher capacity and power; but this is less important than ease of use indoors in my opinion. a mid-power mid-size pistol is both effective home defense and carry defense; a rifle is effective home defense and may have hunting utility, but isn't acceptable carry defense for nonfloridians. unless you want one for hunting or recreational shooting anyway, my advice is to buy a smallish to medium .380 acp/.38, 9mm or .45 acp pistol, call it home defense and your carry weapon in one. train with it often, ideally under a certified instructor for longer than required. take classez voluntarily in addition to any required. then, if you need another - say, if one person is travelling and one home - buy another of the same pistol. i know that's no fun, and here i don't even take my own advice, but the novelty of a different new tool isn't as important as the familiarity that means competence.      ammunition varies in weight and power, even in the same caliber. ""hotter"" loads have more powder, and thus power, and can push heavier bullets - they are longer, not wider - and self defense loads are among the hottest, with the most reliable ignition. cheap bulk ammo for target use may have lighter bullets, less powder, and sometimes less reliable ignition - ""primers"". some rounds may be marked ""+p"", for increased pressure, and can be used only in guns - usually revolvers-  with the same mark or rating. using them in others may be dangerous. very old guns may be unsafe; older models are often not ""drop safe"", ie, modern guns don't shoot if you drop them, vintage pistols sometimes can. cheap older guns which have been abused may have minute cracks in the frame that can lead to catastrophic failure. some may have been modified in unsafe ways, such as overly light trigger pulls or sear smoothing. some cheap, shit-brand guns were never safe to fire, as late as the 1970's. for sd use, for all these reasons, purchase new, or gently used from a trusted dealer. brand isn't as important as some think. some brands have mixed legacies. an older remington is a good gun, a newer one, no. taurus revolvers are acceptable; taurus autoloaders should be avoided. ruger is generally a safe bet; colt has rarely dissapointed. walther is good. springfield, kimber and sig are expensive quality. kel-tec, hi-point, lorcin and bersa are all cheapos, some of which are okay. bersa seems to be a good value, according to web jibberjab. never shot one. glock is basic and reliable, if somehow unpalatable to many aesthetically and in fit and feel.       . a bright, powerful flashlight is a big deal - you need one for home defense, whatever your firearm choice. spend up. something that takes the 30$ 123 batteries, not a 2aa maglight. spend 400 on the gun, but 200$ on the light. it may mean the difference between firing at a murky threat and identifying your drunk friend pranking you, an assailant with a gun hitting you and missing you, or a would-be assailant running off without having the legal hassle of a discharge.",0,,

343039,"okay, but what *about* the reverse situation? you're not illustrating where this alleged harm comes from.  thinness is social currency, like it or not. i'm not thin, and i can say with absolutely certainty that there is a major difference between the scenario in which a skinny girl talks about how she can't fit into clothes from a notorious fashion company that promotes thinness within its ranks *and* for its consumers... and the scenario in which a fat girl talks about how she can't fit into the same notorious brand which, again, is famous for promoting thinness. they're not the same. not even close. one has social currency and attention attached to it. the other is just an honest evaluation of a shitty fashion company.  if someone curvy were to post a video about how they don't fit into bm jeans, the context would be different, because the idea of *buying* jeans implies that you intend to fit into them. the curvier person would then have a complaint: ""bm's jeans do not fit me, a person of x size. therefore they are not inclusive.""  with someone underweight, the situation is *entirely* different. you seem to want to take the socioeconomic context out, when that context is the very thing ruffling people's feathers. again, whether you like it or not, there are attributes and ideas associated with thinness that are inherently absent when dealing with heaviness. one of those attributes is the concept of attractiveness. people who are thin are almost universally considered more attractive than their heavier peers. they are also considered more sexually desirable, more competent, healthy, smart, capable, trustworthy, amicable, and more active. this has been proven using the scientific method time and time again. *like it or not.*  regardless of whether these things are true in reality, the collective consciousness has agreed, happily or not, to assign thin people more positive traits than negative ones.  fat people are assumed to possess the opposite traits. heavier people are often thought of as lazy, stupid, out of shape, unkind, unattractive, gluttonous, angry, unfriendly, and lacking in self-control. hurts! but i don't make the rules. again, these preconceived notions and subconscious beliefs have been proven across all demographics and cultures time and time again. it's a universal clusterfuck of wrong.  if you don't believe me, there are *countless* books and publications on this phenomenon. i assume that you're clever enough to know that i'm telling the truth when i say this, though, so please do your own research and don't make me scour amazon for books like those of aubrey gordon or jia tolentino. (although these are great reads.) the information is out there.  what this means is that, again, *like it or not*, our culture sees fatness as something to be cured, fixed, healed, or shoved into a dark corner and hidden. if someone were to post a video on tiktok about how small bm's jeans are on them, the unspoken subtext inherent in the video is ""you're doing it wrong; get skinnier and you'll be able to fit into those jeans.""  in contrast, when an extremely thin person posts a video about how they're *too small* for bm's already tiny jeans, they are socially if not literally applauded, and their ""plight"" becomes seen as an accomplishment. the reaction under these circumstances becomes ""you're doing it right; the jeans don't fit, but *you* do - you fit into society's ideal of what is beautiful so good job.""  and whether that mindset is healthy or not is irrelevant when we're discussing the phenomena of humblebragging. because the fact is, this is how our hivemind thinks. it just *does*. does it suck? yeah. is it wrong? absolutely. but so are nuclear weapons and we can't just sit around in denial that they exist. we have them. we might even use them someday. instead of acting like the fat vs thin divide doesn't exist, we have to be aware of how harmful those subconscious messages are and combat them.  that is what the people on this thread are trying to do. they're saying ""no"" to the idea that someone thin can go online and playact a ""problem"" with her clothes not fitting when we all know she could go to any store with smaller jean sizes and her ""problem"" would be fixed. the fact that brandy melville, notorious for their fatphobia and one-size-fits-all approach to clothes, is up for debate makes these videos even more insidious. because not only are the girls saying ""i'm too thin to fit into these jeans,"" they're saying, ""i'm too thin to fit into the *tiniest* jeans."" and that means something to people.  the issue we have in this post is that *these girls have no issue*. it is not a fucking problem that someone's bm jeans do not fit because the person trying them on is too small. and these girls *know* that. they know that being thin is a desirable trait and they know that brandy melville markets itself as being a clothing line for ""slender"" young women. they *know* that society prefers svelte, even skeletal girls compared to obese ones. they *know* they're winning the game. and they have no qualms about playing humble and innocent on the internet where they are *bound* to get attention in order to reaffirm that shit for themselves.  heavier girls often struggle to feel like their bodies belong in a landscape that only idealizes and worships thin bodies. for a heavier girl to post a video where her brandy melville jeans don't fit would not only take courage (because the internet is *notoriously* unkind to people who do not fit the beauty standard), but it would be a completely different kind of video. the person making it would not be showcasing their body or using it to get attention because, like i said, our culture just doesn't give a fuck about women's bodies unless they're dressed up or skinny. no, the focus would be on brandy melville and how the jeans fit! just like it says on the tin! there wouldn't be any subversive humblebgragging because the girl would have nothing to *brag* about. i'm not saying all of tiktok would see her as a massive hideous beast or that she *would* be a massive hideous beast. i'm saying that they'd be paying attention to the issue at hand, not thinking about how skinny or pretty she is.  when you've overweight and talking about how your clothes don't fit you, that is all people see. they see a review of a company. that's it. that kind of video would be honest. that kind of video would not be manipulative or deceitful or some kind of attention-grabbing thirst trap like these tiktok girls make. it would be a normal fucking vid and no one on here would have a problem with it.   so you see, the mindset we have is that these girls know better and are triggering others by feigning ignorance about how desirable their bodies are. that's it. that's all. what you seem to have an issue with is the sad but true *fact* that our society treats women with thin bodies and women with fat bodies differently. *periodt.*  trying to defend these tiktok girls is taking the experiences of everyone who's been triggered by them and saying that their experiences don't count. which is most believable? the voices of those with eating disorders who feel tricked and hurt by this tiktok bullshit? or the voices of the girls *in* the tiktoks who are playing with the very loaded subject of weight while pretending they have no idea why people might feel strongly about it? i mean, bm was even in the press awhile back for being a triggering dumpster fire. how much more suffering do you need?  i don't know why you're defending the ""i'm too small for these jeans"" rhetoric as if the person in question were genuinely suffering, but i can tell you for a fact that being so skinny most clothes don't fit is not suffering. i've been there, many members of my family members have been there (my mom really struggled to put on enough weight as a teen), and i have friends who have been there. literally *none* of those i asked said that the experience was one of suffering.   they (like these girls on tiktok!) knew others admired their bodies and, yes, they liked it.",1,1,-1

(as far as i know i am the only one who has publicly made that connection.)  here it is   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epbczadfpk0  i'm just saying...  please note that amateur lifters usually have a wire running to the ground and are tethered to the ground with string becuase they cannot lift the crude heavy power supplies amateurs use to power them. that's why in most video they stop rising and strain agaisnt string on the ground.  you will notice however the small one accelerate very quickly when turned on - almost instantly.  once you go bigger however you can easily use gas generators and flame jet generators to power a larger one that can lift its own power supply and cargo. they scale quite well as you can see from the mouse lifter. more cells equal more total lift even on a crude dc powered lifter which is the least efficient from of lifter.  furthermore becuase the surrounding air is pulled around the aircraft and it sort of part of the motor itself it doesn't have drag or shockwaves like a regular airplane which tries to ram itself through that air. thus it can fly much faster and more quietly with less sonic boom.  incidently an ionocraft lifter makes a hissing noise when flying and in dark light sometimes the ions on the edges of the metal surfaces glow. this matches description of many ufos which makes me believe people have seen such craft built by people right here on the good old earth - no ufo's or aliens needed.  lifters that will fly right on your carpet are simple to build.  literally you need an old computer monitor, some tinfoil, balsa wood and piano or magnet wire. because they are powered by high voltage there is danger of electrocution.  some also say they emit xrays when operating just like the high voltage cathode ray tube of a tv so be careful.  there is a lot of speculation about secret craft built with this technology becuase as the inventor major de seversky said in his early video it has all kinds of military applications. it can hover over cities and defend agaisnt missiles. it flies silently and when powered from the ground can stay up forever. they can accelerate like on other aircraft can. since jets and gas engines are limited in altitude by the oxygen in the air these are an interesting alternative for ultra high flight. incidently he invented the joystick to control his craft using it to control different power level to each side of his ionocraft.",0,,
478098,"yea, the atmosphere would cause a whole heap of damage to structured life, with one side always cooling and the other always heating. there would be an expectation of some wobble, like how the moon wobbles a bit, and this could have some interesting impacts. for instance, some of the green ring would see a noticeable difference in a ""day"" and ""night"" period. these could be expanded by wobble patterns that could help differentiate times of the year. that said these effects would be much less noticeable than on earth, so it might take much of the (assumed) civilizations to notice it. i would bet navigation would be much more difficult at first over medium sized distances. i would definitely keep the annual wobble though, because it gives a reason for the atmosphere to also travel from top to bottom, rather than just side to side since one side gets warmer than the other, then it switches. an oblong ish planet might also help explain why all the water didn't get drawn to one side of the planet through tidal forces too. i know its way hotter in the desert zone, but i dont think evaporation could compete with that force, but with an oblong planet the centerish zone at least pulls closer to the center of gravity, which could reasonably be stronger than a solar tidal force. annuel wobbling would still then be a strong enough force to create seasonal dry seasons as instead of daily tides, you would have yearly tides where water flows a little to one side. actually this movement of water would slowly drain energy from the wobble, but with only 33% surface coverage it would take a long time to be noticable.   note that on earth, deserts are caused by mountain ranges blocking h2o transport, and i'm not sure if you have shown a massive ring of mountains keeping water out of the desert land. further, the warmer region would constantly be attracting atmospheric movement, and you would expect low air pressures the further sun side you got. because of this, i would suggest putting just a couple of mountain ranges in the desert, this would be the largest accumulators of rain water, and they would drain into what would become a (massive) river to the ocean ring. so you would have the ice wall draining into the ocean ring, and the desert rain water draining there. you could do something interesting and say they don't reach the same point so you could logically explain having 2 ocean rings with habitable land between them, but its not necessary. these massive rivers could have some historical significance too, since they are a supply of water in desert, but incredibly dangerous to live or build near. i mean can you imagine that kind of flood?   you should also take into consideration how some areas will see constant sunrise/settings, as the light has to travel through so much of the atmosphere. also notable that shade would be a constant. a crevice in shadow wont be lit, hardly ever, although shade would be common.   being near a red dwarf would mean closer proximity to be in a goldilocks zone (as op pointed out) but still the proximity would only cause tidal locking if the planet was misshapen, which is simple more likely closer to a star. due to the red dwarf not having peak radiation at the ""yellow"" color, i would also expect much of the plant life to find peak color efficiency at green. solar radiation shifting to about 100 nm longer wavelength is ok, the ozone (o3) and other atmospheric particles still don't absorb much in this area, the rayleigh scattering would still show a blue sky, but still more white or reddish than on earth. the star would also appear bigger since it has to be so much closer to keep water melted. but where green plants on earth reflect green photons, the deficit of high energy radiation may shift optimal absorption colors to reflect more of a blueish tinge. notably, since the planet is tidal locked, plants in constant sunlight might appear much brighter and reflective, with edge regions appearing darker. (o2 actually does absorb about 750 nm range, and your red dwarf puts out more at this spectrum. im not sure what energizing o2 would mean for a planet, but it might make natural chemicals reaction more common (so more o2 breaking apart and forming h20, but i dont think this would be significant) much of the plant life i would also expect to take into account constant, directional sunlight. if our trees had that i would expect hotter zones to have protected sides, so bark facing one size and light-absorbing leaves only sprouting in relative shade. (although competition with other trees for light might not make this that common) other plant options would be more protective coating on parts meant to absorb light. you might even see cone like plant structures where light would get bounced into tubular, rigid parts, so only a fraction of the light gets used; essentially a plant that makes its own shade. alternatively, in wet zones you could have constant plant growth and death. all these plants seem incredibly fragile to climate change though since they are constantly bombarded by radiation. they have to find uses for it or they die, and cover is too rare to be part of evolutionary expectations.   further if you have a planet be tidally locked to the sun, it really shouldn't be that spherical. it should be more potato shaped, which would give a gravitational reason to be locked like that. now most of the bigger planets smush themselves into pretty spherical shapes with gravity, so you usually only see tidally locked objects in smaller forms. you could go along with some history where the planet got smashed long ago and kept an oblong feature, but its also good grounds to make gravity weaker, which would also argue for a weaker atmosphere. (but not necessarily. mars for instance would have had an atmosphere for a significant part of its life, but constantly ""leaked."" perhaps this planet is new fairly new, or maybe there is some major gas bubbles under the surface that are continually releasing, perhaps shaken up and brought to the surface due to the early smashing the planet got. and of course gas bubbles being whatever you wanted. could be oxygen rich, but even lighter elements would make oxygen stay longer since o2 and o3 would sink below the others and wouldn't be at risk)  i like the ice wall where water would keep freezing at but the atmosphere would keep supplying. that said, if this was originally a very water heavy planet, the ice wall could have grown enough to impede the atmospheric transfer, at least for heavier air particles like humidity. this would make the air near the ice wall way more dense and heavy, and there would be unimaginably strong winds. (as the air would be pushed at the icewall but more and more of it wouldn't make it over.)  now if we went with the constant internal gas leak into the atmosphere, there are some interesting questions about which side of the ice wall they are coming from, or if its uniform on both sides.   you could view the green ring of the planet to have some really interesting life with lighter gravity and heavy density of air (which you could say has plenty of reasons for being oxygen rich, as more get added to the atmosphere and elements like hydrogen and helium being the parts that get discarded by weak gravity) while gravity strength doesn't have to play an important role, animal life size will depend on oxygen content. (usually) if we take the gas leak idea you can do very interesting things by making oxygen content irregular. low o2 periods favoring small, high o2 with massive creatures. if you shift this from low to high quickly you can have everything living together before species all die off. if (say human like, bipedal, medium size with hands good for tool working) some intelligent, sentient race developed in lowish o2 levels, then o2 levels increased, their tool making could be a significant enough advantage to compete with larger animals. this would lead to this sentient race living alongside massive and weird, (not even always efficient since high o2 can be a natural explosion of life) creatures, while also breathing super rich air, far more energy efficient than what their bodies would require. a utopia for those who could dominate an area, minus the expected large scale natural disasters. if you assumed low mass planet with constant atmospheric leak though, you would be setting a clock on its life bearing capabilities.   some history i would include (whether you use a planetary gas leak idea or not) would be massive cold front when parts of the ice wall break. 2 different atmospheres with different temperatures and densities finally meeting each other would be locally apocalyptic, and at least small versions would be likely to happen somewhere on the planet with regular frequencies. big ones- especially if tectonic movement was involved, could pose some biblical foundations. due to the very stable and energetic conditions plants would be usually subject to, i would think these natural disasters would see further damage with widespread plant death and ecosystem upheaval.  as you advance your race into late stage histories, it seems pretty reasonable to take metal like resources from the dark side of the planet, but you would need to either have deep mining tunnels or space craft to access it. i would think the ice wall would have conditions too poor to really fly or drive across, even if you went over it. definitely stay clear of that cold front. solar panel research could lead to some super potent energy influx obviously, but if you use the planetary gas leak idea you could throw in a couple of significant historical surges from ""easy energy"" booms.    i got kinda interested in the idea and took a project that wasn't mine a bit further than necessary. [i also drew a shitty picture.](https://imgur.com/a/xlceeog) could be more of a circular wobble too, i just cant draw in 2d so i didnt attempt 3d.",0,,
389913,"actually, the lack of technological development in north american natives is *easily* explained by geography.  for one thing, there were, relative to those available in eurasia, very few plants or animals suitable for domestication.  for another, since the americas constitute a much smaller land-mass, a relatively much smaller amount of crop domestication occurred as a result of diffusion from one culture to another.  the great example of this is corn, which was domesticated independently in three separate regions of the americas; the mississippi basin/eastern woodlands, mezo-america, and andean south america.  why didn't the earliest domestication of corn in mexico simply disperse to the north and the south, thus giving the andean and mississippian cultures a much earlier start at the large-scale agriculture game?  simple; to the south lay impenetrable jungles and some of the most rugged mountainous terrain on the planet.  more to the point, to the south lay an equatorial zone that could not support corn cultivation as it was then understood.  corn didn't simply travel to the north either for similar reasons having to do with some of the world's harshest deserts which again, were not suited to kind of corn cultivation then known to mezo-americans.  what that means is that both in the andes and in the eastern part of the modern us, large-scale corn cultivation didn't get started until much later.  (the fact that the same crop, corn, was domesticated three times, also speaks volumes to the fact that it was one of very few plants available for domestication in the new world.  can you think of any new-world plant that has been successfully domesticated post 1492?  i thought not.)  at the crux of the issue is the fact that the bulk of the american landmass is oriented on a north-south axis with a serious bottleneck through central america.  this made it very difficult if not impossible for any one of the three relatively advanced cultural areas of the americas to benefit from the inventions of the others.  a great example of this is the wheel, which contrary to what you write, was indeed known at least to the maya and probably to other mezo-american groups as well.  they did not use it much for the obvious reason that they had no draft animals (of which there is, again, a paucity of candidates for domestication in the americas) and had a slave-based economy.  the andean cultures would have loved to have learned about the wheel from the maya inasmuch as they had llamas and alpacas that could have been used to pull carts.  the inca specifically, had the most extensive system of paved roads ever built by any pre-modern society.  the mezo-american cultures would have greatly benefited through having llamas and alpacas and the potato, but none of these inventions ever reached them and by the time of the spanish conquest, though the aztec capital city at tenochtitlan was larger and far cleaner than anything in europe, the spaniards had superior weapons technology and draft animals (horses) of a size that no mezo-american had seen for thousands of years.  this in contrast to the eurasian landmass where cultural information has always moved with relative freedom between the cultural centers of china, southeast asia, india, persia and the middle east, russia and eastern europe, and western europe.  a great example is writing.  by all of the best available evidence, it looks like truly unique writing systems have arisen only twice in human history.  once in the fertile crescent with the sumerians, and much later in mezo-america with the maya.  you may say something like, ""but what about the chinese?  what about the egyptians?""  in point of fact, there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that both the ancient chinese and the ancient egyptians got the idea for writing through cultural diffusion, probably directly from the sumerians in the case of the egyptians, and indirectly, from persians and members of the indus valley civilization in the case of the chinese.  in any event, what's not at all contestable is that european culture, from the greeks onward, has always benefited technologically from its contact with cultures in other parts of the eurasian landmass.  this is because eurasia is predominantly oriented on an east-west axis which means that things like crops and domesticated animals can easily move back and forth.  if you doubt the validity of such a supposition, think on this; while western europeans knew about and even traveled to the far east by at least the 1300's, it took them another five to six hundred years to penetrate the heart of the african continent.  meanwhile, once they got to the north american continent, they did very well because it turned out to have a climate that was very similar to that of europe and the mediterranean, and in which their crops and domesticated animals flourished.    they were aided immeasurably by the fact that they carried with them a variety of ""crowd"" diseases to which the natives of the americas had no natural resistance, and which in consequence killed off millions of them long before the europeans ever came into actual physical contact with them.  emerging archaeological evidence, for example --and this is buttressed by the otherwise formerly apocryphal accounts of several early spanish explorers--  seems to indicate that the mississippian culture was decimated by at least one, and probably several waves of smallpox that wiped out a good two thirds to three quarters of its population long before european settlers, over a hundred years later, began to cross the appalachians.  in places like cahokia, in modern illinois, large urban centers were completely abandoned and the complex earthen and wooden structures --cahokia was home to the largest pyramids north of tenochtitlan-- fell into ruin and disrepair.  unfortunately, the mississippian culture has always been relatively easy to overlook inasmuch as since stone is hard to come by in the mississippi drainage, they tended to build in earth and wood that was then faced over with plaster and painted in whites, blues and reds which obviously, in the humid environment of the mississippi and ohio valleys, does not hold up more than a decade or two without maintenance.  further complicating the situation is the fact that many early white settlers early figured out what to look for and quickly looted mississippian sites of what few metal objects they contained.  why did europeans carry crowd diseases to which the native americans were not resistant?  why not the other way around?  the answer is simple; it has to do with animal husbandry.  most if not all of our crowd diseases (think of sars or h5n1) arise from close contact with domesticated animals.        as it turns out, the number of domesticated animals found in eurasia is something like three or four times more than in the new world.  if you think this is because native-americans simply didn't have what it takes to domesticate as many, consider this; no animal from the americas has been domesticated since 1492, despite numerous attempts.  the american bison is a great example.  lots of people have gone to great lengths to domesticate them, but despite the best efforts of well-funded ranching interests, the beast remains undomesticated.  it can be raised on ranches, can even be herded to some small extent, but the bison cannot be quartered in barns, cannot be milked, and cannot be approached without risk of great bodily damage.  this is by far the longest comment i've ever written on reddit.  i wrote it rapidly, without pausing to organize my thoughts, and as such, i am sure there are some few minor holes or inconsistencies.  but the point remains; your argument holds no water.  i could go on and on punching holes in your arguments, but i have neither the time nor inclination.  if nothing else, hopefully what i have written here will at least make you question the validity of your assumptions.  a final note.  based on dna analysis, we know that all amhs share a common ancestor who must have lived roughly 100k years ago.  while that may seem like a long time to you and i, in evolutionary terms, especially where relatively long-lived mammals are concerned, it is but the blink of an eye.  any respectable evolutionary biologist will tell you that the chance of a non-isolated group of any species of large mammal developing any kind of genetic trait, within that time-frame, which confers a selective advantage over other groups of the same species, is vanishingly small.  again, i posit that the reason you do not see this is that you do not fully understand the terms of darwinian selection.",0,,

422329,"first off, let's make sure to define these the terms. as some have already said, thick and fat are not interchangeable.  Â· thick is more or less synonymous with curvy, or better yet, voluptuous. she definitely not skinny. she's got noticeable **curve** on the hips and/or ass and breasts, something a guy can grab on to. she has thighs and probably no thigh gap. she **doesn't necessarily** have a perfectly flat stomach, but the curves are bigger than a slightly chubby stomach. she has an hourglass or pear shape, meaning she must have some fat, but it's deposited in a feminine pattern.  Â· fat means overall fat, and especially a big stomach/belly. there may be multiple chins. there may be big breasts and hips/ass, but the overall fat obscures the curves of those parts. some men - at least, this man - might go so far as to say that a very fat woman can seem just as curve-less as a flat woman.  Â· ""curves"" generally does **not** refer to the stomach. ""curves,"" to most straight man, refers to hips, ass, breasts, and maybe thighs.  Â· fat is **not** curvy, but as fat acceptance grows, some **women** are using curvy as synonymous with fat, but most men do **not** use it that way.  Â· fat is not curvy, but that doesn't mean there aren't fat women that men find appealing. they might be more often called just ""big"" or ""bbw."" but it's possible that ""fat"" may eventually lose its negative connotations over time to the point that people stop using bbw.  now to address your question: you're not imagining things, but you're incorrect, or at least, imprecise, in your premise when you say ""15 years ago, women aspired to be skinny and that was the desired body. "" to be specific, that's more what **white** women aspired after.  to actually answer:  yes on both counts - fat acceptance is increasing among everyone, and ""thickness"" has become more popular **among white people**. i put that in bold because in latino and black communities, bigger women were already more accepted. many minority women were already proud to be curvy. what's changing is that it's become more accepted among **whites** (and asians) as well, and whites of course have more control of the media. more white women are seeking approval in being curvy, and enjoying the attention, and getting surgery to get those bodies (and blacks may complain, perhaps rightly, about appropriation). also, even before fat acceptance, it was already the case among all races that men in general liked women heavier than many women **think** men like - though there are plenty of men who like slim women, much fewer men like the skin-n-bones skinny/scrawny women.  some affects it's had:  \- fat women are getting more confident about their prospects and gaining more self-confidence, so i imagine they're getting more outgoing in the dating world, feeling more ""marketable.""  \- it's less of a stigma for a man to be with a fat woman.  \- the invention or popularization of certain terms like bbw (big beautiful woman) and pawg (phat ass white girl). notice that few or no people talk about ""phat ass black girls"" - black women were already stereotyped as having curvy bottoms, but white women for a while were stereotyped as often having no ass, so the pawg acronym is a more recent counter to that.   \- certain fashion trends and brands like apple bottom jeans, have grown.  \- non-black women are adopting trends that were already known in the black community, like twerking.  \- probably a decrease in the perceived taboo of black male/white female relationships. it seems that as white women embrace curves, they're pursuing black men a bit more, and black men are noticing them a bit more.  \- increased inclusion in the mainstream fashion industry of larger women, where they're called ""plus-sized."" the industry still has problems, but yeah, there's more visibility curvier and fatter women these days.  \- cellulite may be getting less stigma as well? i'm not sure about that, but it would make sense. even a very fit woman can get cellulite, but as women get larger, it's more likely to show up, especially on white women.  i'm making some generalizations here of course, but that's what people do. exceptions and outliers may exist here and there. and as some boundaries between terms get hazy, some may use sub-categories like ""slim thick,"" etc.  as a straight, athletic male myself, aside from noticing the recent phrase ""dad bod,"" i can't comment much on how increasing fat acceptance in men is affecting fat men's dating, though my kneejerk guess is that it matters less in that arena, as women are generally thought to be less concerned with men's looks in the first place (not totally unconcerned, just less concerned than men are with women's looks).",1,-1,1

(closures, incidentally, are a different story entirely; clever use of closures _does_ make things possible that weren't without them, or were at the very least fiendishly difficult and impractical, not just three lines of code. the best way to get started with them is to find places in your code that are starting to grow a bajillion options, especially ones related to collections, that all boil down to ways of manipulating the data or summarizing the data. instead, allow things to pass in closures. it's also really useful for flow-reversal; i have some code that generates the shells of html tables based on certain sql searches, and you pass in closures that explain how to render the cells. these closures get to do anything they want with the rendering, in the context of the calling code that ""knows"" the most about the rendered objects, and the table part of the renderer doesn't have to care. without closures you'll end up with code that is both less capable and more tightly bound.)",0,,

624639,"wow. that top hillary photo is exactly what i look like when i get thinner than 145. iâ€™m a romantic. iâ€™m a bit more elongated than her in the middle and a lot more pinched in in the waist. i literally look sad and alien like and everyone lets me know how bad i look it. i went through a phase trying to emulate my petite, naturally straight figured friends when they tried to cheer me up about my own figure. i didnâ€™t only look sad, i felt sad since it just looked visually wrong to me and felt it. i donâ€™t know if anyone gets that feeling. my body felt unhappy. i kept fighting that feeling thinking if i just kept training and controlling my eating that my frame would shrink...it never did because that doesnâ€™t make sense. your bones are indeed set up a certain way. now iâ€™m 152 and i try to not get smaller than this but no bigger than 170. i look like bottom hillary at 170. the sad thing about it was that i thought being thin i would have more flexibility and options wearing clothes. and tbh i didnâ€™t. because i still had the same exact problems i had when iâ€™d get bigger. during a bad break up i got out of control and was depressed. i rose up to 190 (also i still measured 36 band size though cup size went bigger). i legit looked fine and i got hit on even more than i ever had in my entire life. which is nuts to think about but i looked better when i was chubbier. i had that christina hendricks thing going on. clothes looked perfect. i was a size 10. my body size was in line with my head size which was my biggest difficulty to get around. if something in your body is one size likely the rest will follow and thatâ€™s normal. now iâ€™m a 6, sometimes 8 (again i also weight train, which helps a lot with this shape to be able to carry the weight needed to suit the head). after all that fasting and heavy training my body is slow to gain weight but, because of it i learned about my happy spot, which i wouldnâ€™t have unless i got to the weight i am now. i learned 20 lbs from the smallest you could go is a good reference point for the hourglasses. thatâ€™s our happy spot where we still look curvy, can eat without guilt, and still have fun shopping. in fact, when i was bigger my wardrobe and just how easy and fun it became to finally dress and appreciate my figure helped me get out of my depression. not to brag itâ€™s just my reality. i look better bigger. iâ€™m trying to go back to 160-165 and keep it there. because bigger than this and my body turns porny. and no one takes me seriously since everything just goes jello. we canâ€™t win lmao ðŸ˜‚. at that weight iâ€™m content, happy thick jiggly but not human jello blow up doll wiggly. i donâ€™t have the patience for how i get treated when my butt gets that big nor the spontaneous butt slapping from everyone. it was funny for a while not anymore. i felt like a toddler that became a grownup and people kept trying to feel its baby rolls. i like my privacy and will bite back. personality wise i donâ€™t fit my body though. i look like a big baby inside iâ€™m a rottweiler. a nice calm one until angered. trying gain my slowly but surely since now itâ€™s harder for me to gain weight. ugh.   i got this thin now because i went through military training and i loved it and it stuck. iâ€™m â€œcutâ€ (defined is the right word) but still jiggly and chubby in the extremities since thatâ€™s what my body has always been. basically i look like i got a corset on 24/7 now with slightly sleeker arms. theyâ€™re still a bit chunky but thatâ€™s meant to be there and in no way breaks up the big picture. if anything it sort of balances with the thick thighs. my weight training is mostly band work. i work in health care now (nurse) and because iâ€™m a chicken of the troubles of being long term obesity i try to keep a weight guideline. but when i got to 135 i looked terrible in everything. sure i could wear stuff for other body types because i literally shrank myself to the point you could see each and every one of my ribs and vertebrae. at that weight you could even see the tendons. the proportions looked wrong and even my coach (wife of a coworker whoâ€™s a marine) and her comrades, all in the military, told me to gain weight because i was too low for my frame size. if i were to be checked for a mission that weight rendered me ineffective since i was too weak for more than basic motions. i passed out at one boot camp and was sent home. they also said i had to gain 15 lbs, preferably 20 as i was too low in range for my individual dynamic. they said my weight was too low for my frame which runs large. i was trying to meet their borderlines and they explained to me that a human body isnâ€™t a manufactured process. yes they give you reference points for fitness but they have to look at you individually too because what another person might lack or need i might not have to worry about. i kept trying to get the smallest weight of a middle frame person (120-140 and shorter than 5â€™3 to give you an idea). ironically because of them i discovered iâ€™m large framed (wide), even though iâ€™m 5â€™4â€, measuring 36 on hips and shoulders even at size 4 weight so i still had to wear 6. my waist is 12â€ smaller than my bust and hips so it adds to the skeletal look i had when i was too thin because my body looked like it could keel over any minute like a marionette (puppet). the pressure from the weight of my upper body and my waist was huge, i was often grabbing at my sides since it felt like my waist had no support. my knees kept shaking and my already tiny wrists and ankles felt weak and pressured. shoes felt super heavy. size 6 is the smallest i can wear before i venture into alien territory for my look. and it only looks ok now because i built muscle to add support to my frame namely my waist which desperately needed it. the weight training helped me get muscles in my abs so the skin doesnâ€™t sink into the ribs which is what made skinny me even more uncomfortable since my body would sort of pull in and scrunch forward for take the weight off the ribs. i can now stand erect in a â€œseriousâ€ position without having to tilt my hips and stationing my hand there to shift my bust from my waist. which is why women with my shape often do the pose i was explained by the military of all places. the shift helps the body find a point of â€œbalanceâ€, which is also why most women with our bodies have wide and bigger feet. to accommodate the wider frames. by the way, i will never be the woman that can get abs. my belly still curves forward and it is relatively flat but still soft. my middle is even tinier, no matter how much i work it wonâ€™t get wider for that washboard effect. the military taught me to appreciate what i look like as for so long i felt indelicate and â€œold schoolâ€ because of my shape. i felt so out of fashion and tbh â€œmommy-likeâ€ that i became blind to my own blessings. i always associated skinny with youth even though iâ€™m young and have always had this body. go figure. lmao that pun was an accident. my friends literally tell me they wish they could be half as squishy even with my muscles. i still look jiggly and am jiggly. ðŸ˜‚that experience was a wake up call and made me realize that one size indeed doesnâ€™t fit all. iâ€™m not meant to be tiny and thatâ€™s ok. i just have to play its own beauty. iâ€™m sorry for the length i was trying to help a few out there because i see this all the time with patients. so many women try to fight their own biology instead of just working with it.",1,-1,-1

(bush and several others), would they be involved in shady land deals and illicit affairs in the oval office (billy clinton).  did anyone see the look in hillary clinton's eyes when she was running against obama?  she was totally possessed.  she was consumed by the lust of power...the same way i feel michelle obama is.  the one thing i can say about all four of the above candidates is this: the least corrupted is mrs. palin.  i don't know what kind of politics and games she had to play as mayor or gov., but i'm sure that under a microscope, they don't hold up to the values she professes.  barack obama, while not a muslim, has muslim sympathies.  there is no denying that the only two men his mother ever married were muslim.  he was raised during his most impressionable years (until the age of 10), by muslim men.  he went to a predominantly muslim school, and while they don't profess to be a school that teaches islam, we all know what islam is and it is the first and foremost mission in the lives of all muslims.  to say they didn't ""focus"" on islam would be the acme of gullibility.  that being said, no, he's not muslim, but he sympathizes with their ""plight"".  i don't think he's been plotting this since he was a child...he admits to doing cocaine, weed, etc.  it could be a lit, it might not be...why would a politician lie about doing drugs...usually it's the other way around.  all i can say is that we can't trust anything any of them say.  when all is said and done, john mccain and sarah palin are the biggest ""outsiders"" of washington (as a pair) and the lesser of two evils....but what does that say about our country, that we're forced to vote for the lesser of two evils?",0,,

192549,"finding other players is currently quite rare. i've only seen players in the eranin warzone and lp 98-132 nav beacon/extraction site a couple of times, and only 1-2 at a time. the station in lp 98-132 (freeport) is very popular though, as it's an easily accessible lawless system, and (as long as you don't actually hit the station) the station couldn't give less of a damn about what goes on around (or even inside) it (seriously, you can fight players inside the station without the station wrecking you for it, as long as your aim is perfect).  there's usually pirates at freeport (in the server i'm on there's even a group of 2-4 holding the station right now, shooting everything on sight).  also, if you're having trouble landing hits, try gimbal weapons and turrets. gimbals can aim at pretty much anything in your field of view, and turrets can be set to 3 modes:  - fire at nearby enemies randomly. - fire at targeted enemy only. - fire forward (like a regular forward fit weapon).  also, here's a list of all ai ships (listed lightest to heaviest), and how to approach them in a fight (good stuff to know. i'd say once you can take out an anaconda's cargo hatch without getting yourself wrecked, you're well ready for pvp encounters):  - **federal fighter, short version:** worthless ships, pretty much any weapon setup can wreck them effortlessly in seconds. - **federal fighter, long version:** lightest ships in the game. these things have laughable shields, paper thin hulls, and weapons so weak they're only a threat to other federal fighters. despite all of that, federal fighters should not be taken lightly. their pilots are put through heavy training from birth, just to prepare them for the moment you engage in combat with them. the thing is, they know how worthless their ships are, and their weak ships are actually a key aspect of their combat strategy. their weapons aren't intended to damage you, and their shields/hulls are intentionally that weak. federal fighters are the most dangerous ships in the game; first they're just firing at you, as a distraction. as they get closer, you'll still be sitting there, watching as your weapons wreck their shield and hull at an alarming rate.... and then it happens. you realize what's going on, that it's too late. an instant later, it's all over. the federal fighter crashed headfirst into you at full speed, sacrificing itself to kill you. - **hauler:** these can't even begin to form a threat to, well, anything really. they turn slowly, are fragile, and only have one c2 hardpoint (at least that fits a functional weapon though, unlike the federal fighter). shouldn't be a problem, ever. - **eagle:** glass cannons. most agile (not fastest) ship in the game, with an additional c2 hardpoint compared to the sidewinder. these can be a decent threat to anything due to their agility, but as soon as you get a few good shots on them, it's pretty much over. - **sidewinder:** standard ship, standard weapons, standard everything. surprisingly agile (second only to the eagle). if you know how to fly one, you should know how to fight one. - **viper:** proper combat ship. decently agile, fits 2 c4 and 2 c2 weapons. fastest ship in the game (500m/s boost). a big step up from the sidewinder due to the weapons/speed. don't take these on unless you're in a viper/heavier ship as well, or at least know what you're doing. - **cobra:** cargo version of the viper. fits the same weapons, and sacrifices a bit of speed/agility for a larger cargo hold and tougher armor. easier to fight than vipers, but not by too much. - **type 6:** cargo hold with thrusters. usually just tries to flee when engaged, always makes for an easy fight as you can easily keep up with anything smaller. - **type 9 heavy:** the name doesn't lie, this thing really is heavy. fat. slow. so fat and slow, even a cargo canister can outrun it (by orbiting it). these usually just run for dear life when attacked (despite a top speed so slow they might as well be going backward), but if they do fight, you're in for it. these things have some heavy weaponry. thank whatever you believe in for their turning speed though, and just stay behind them for an easy fight. - **anaconda:** biggest/toughest ship to take on. these things have insanely thick shields and armor, turrets, weapons that can 1shot any smaller ship (plasma accelerator), and they're surprisingly agile for their size. any position other than in front of them is fine (unless you want to become a pile of scrap in under 2 seconds), and none of their turrets can reach behind them (sometimes they don't have turrets on the bottom either). with these things, just scan for cargo to make sure they're carrying good stuff, and target the cargo hatch. trying to actually destroy an anaconda is something you should leave to the big ships, not necessarily because the fight itself is tough, but because their armor is so thick you can pound bullets into it for a decade, and barely chip some paint off. by the time they're actually near death, they'll just jump out as well.",0,,
788352,"my eyes had crusted over so much i had to make a concerted effort to crack them open. sunlight was shining in on my wasteland of an apartment, and birds were singing outside. i rolled over to check the time on my phone. the cracked screen read 9:13. i was supposed to clock into work over an hour ago. there was a surge of anxiety which promptly faded. my boss wouldn't fire me, not with how hard it was to find people that wanted to work. i wasn't looking forward to being dressed down either way though.  ""another beautiful day to be wasted at my soul-destroying job."" i mumbled to myself, as i rotated my body to rise from bed. my rotund, hairy belly trembled and quaked like a waterbed with each movement.  ""god, i've let myself go. i really need to start working out again."" i mumbled to myself making my way into the bathroom to work out which clothes were still clean enough to wear again. on my journey there i spilled a half-full bottle of brandy into a bag of stale cheetos without noticing that i did. as i did, i passed by the reflection in the mirror and saw just how overweight i'd gotten. i hadn't taken a good long look at myself in months and it wasn't a pretty sight. for a few moments, the weighty shackling of sleep still constricting my mind and body, i stared blankly into the mirror. as if by sheer force of will i could force the body fat to disappear.  suddenly there was a loud screech followed by an abrupt sputter. it sounded like my neighbor henry peeling his thirty-year-old-pickup out of the trailer park at full speed. but it sounded like it was coming from right beside me. i jumped back, startled fell over onto the toilet.  i got back up, startled and looked out the window to see where the commotion had come from. before i realized i was looking out the window buck nude.  ""buck nude? i was wearing pajama bottoms-""  the store bought pajama bottoms were down at my ankles. i tried to pull them back up but there was now about an extra foot of elastic, so they wouldn't stay up. i looked back in the mirror and saw that my body had slimmed considerably. don't get me wrong, any doctor worth their salt would have still given me a lengthy lecture about the importance of healthy eating and adequate exercise. but the difference was still prominent.  ""what the hell? did i really just do that? no. this has to be a dream. wake up! i've got to get to work. wake up! wake up!""  there was another bang, like a gunshot. i was back in bed, and i shot up like a mummy rising from their sarcophagus and heaving with breath.  ""was this... real life? i had to know.""  i grabbed my greasy, cracked phone. i tried to open my browser. it was still 9:13. which was the same time it was in the dream.  how to know if i'm dreaming  i clicked search. but after thirty seconds of watching the loading circle i became frustrated.  ""dammit i wish this thing would load faster!""  the phone made a snapping sound and the information appeared. i managed to find some information about lucid dreaming and reality checks. apparently theres ways to check this. like looking at your fingers, if you have more or less than ten, you might be dreaming. i had ten. another one is to see weird times on the clock. like 9:63. but 9:15 was all i got. you can also pinch your nose and try to breathe through it. if you can breathe through a pinched nose, it's a dream.  well that pretty much confirmed it.   regardless, i had to get to work. that was definitely one of the strangest dreams i ever had. i started getting out of bed, then remembered the bottle of liquor i had kicked into my snacks that i had stepped on. but it was already spilled.  i scratched my chin, covered in scraggly black facial hair, walking around them to the bathroom. when i arrived, i turned to look at myself in the mirror. i did look thinner than before. i just stared at myself for a long time. i turned my body sideways with an odd cocktail of confusion and delight. slowly it clicked. it seemed like i was getting everything i wanted. i wanted to lose weight, and that happened. i wanted to wake up, and thats what happened. i wanted my phone to load faster and thats what happened.  i looked at myself in the mirror. i concentrated on myself losing all the weight. going back to how i looked in high school, when i ran for the cross country team. i braced myself as there was a horrific screeching noise came through, like nails being drawn across a chalkboard. i powered through it as the grating noise became so intense it forced me to shiver. i stayed focused on my goal.  in around thirty seconds of agonizing i had lost about a hundred and fifty pounds. i felt so much lighter... so much healthier and full of energy. i couldn't believe it.  ""heh. heh. he ha ah hahaha!"" i laughed in sheer joy, giggling like a child. if this was possible, then what else?  i glanced down at the stinking pile of laundry on the bathroom floor and wished that it was clean. suddenly the floor turned black and white, strobing like tv static as the clothes stood up. shirts and pants and socks walked as though they were worn by invisible people. my work uniform shirt turned on the faucet to the tub as one by one my clothes jumped in and washed themselves clean. some odd music played as they washed themselves, a tune which i could not place the artist nor the source from which it emanated. one by one they got out of the now-full bathtub and shook themselves off like dogs that had just finished a swim. this somehow got them completely dry. before they piled themselves neatly folded into a laundry basket.  ""can i just do... anything?""  i imagined a big bar of gold appearing in my hand. there was a loud clang, like somebody had struck a gong as a twenty-kilo gold ingot appeared with a snap and a poof of smoke. i caught it with both hands, stumbling with the added weight. once i had it secured i studied its illustrious sheen. now, it didn't matter that i was late for work. if i sold that, that gold would give me enough money to live off of for a good while.  i thought to myself, frantically trying to imagine what to do next. i realized that at the wrong moment this power, this seemingly godlike ability i had yet to come to terms with might eventually vanish. that would be my one weakness.  ""this power. i will hold it forever! no force in the universe may take it from me. it shall never become weary from its use.""  suddenly i felt a stabbing pain. there was a great thundering roar. then more of a screech. it sounded like the jump scare of the five nights and freddys animatronics, thats the best way i could honestly describe the sound that my shift in reality. my body spasmed and convulsed. i looked at myself in the mirror. a square cross section of my torso was gone. a rainbow light emanating from within my glowing, heart. i panicked at the sight of my own lungs and beating heart, swiftly willing my body back together.  i should have taken that horrific sight as a warning for what was to come...",1,-1,1
539538,"for the vast majority of people, i'd still argue that it's true that if they're overweight, they're eating too much for their body.  either way you swing, high or low, a large reason for that size difference is eating incorrectly for your body. either too much, too little, or really wrong foods that your body can't process correctly (i know a guy who just doesn't seem to process carbs and he can eat insane amounts of food and he's rail thin). personally, i don't consider anyone to be anorexic until i see bones protruding where it's painfully clear something is wrong. it's also painfully clear someone is morbidly obese when they appear as round as they are tall.   after having lost weight myself (i was on the borderline of entering the 'overweight' bmi at my heaviest), i lost 30lbs and it really opened my eyes to just how skewed our sense of healthy weight has become. even after that 30lbs, looking at my overall body shape, i could have actually stood to lose a bit more weight. people do vary greatly in body size/weight though. i have a friend who is my height and build, but she's about 10lbs lighter than my lightest adult weight. she doesn't appear unhealthy. compared to me now, she's around 20-25lbs (depending on the day) lighter than me but i've also spent the last 2 years lifting weights with the intent to bulk up and appear much more muscular. and this is why the bmi isn't a great indicator - but we all know this.   there's another girl i know, who .5 - 1 inch taller than me. she is definitely overweight. we were playing dnd and talking about an npc height/weight and she was like ""that would be a twig!"" but unknowing to her, she described my height/weight at the time (pre working out) and i wasn't anywhere near a twig. this kind of thing is very common among many people who i've talked to. because population wise we have gotten fatter, what use to be considered chubby is now considered normal. what use to be obese (and is still medically considered obese) is now the new overweight. i personally hate how 'thicc' and curvy have been thrown in. no, you're fat. if you have a curvier body shape, you'd have that while you're thinner too.   you can carry a few pounds extra and be fine, i won't disagree with that. but for many, it's just a slow creep that many don't pay attention to.   health wise, iirc i  believe it's healthier to be a little underweight so long as you get all your nutrients in. however, should you get sick, your body has less fat to sustain you off of should you be in a dire situation, so an overweight person might have a better chance at surviving the same illness. but of course there's a point where too underweight and too overweight is a determent. and with being overweight, it causes a lot more issues with putting extra stress on basically every part of your body. you can only get so skinny before you're basically a walking skeleton, but our range of being obese is much greater.   it's a little bit of a ramble here, but ultimately, my point is that i try and push for everyone to find out what works for them and to try their hardest to exist at a healthy weight for the betterment of themselves and society. you are welcome to accept your body how it is now, but why not push for better? push to be the best you that you can be? don't give in to excuses",1,-1,

580119,"trying on stuff and going with what's comfortable when affordable women's clothing is universally designed not to fit. i'm not like everyone woman; in fact, i'm somewhat atypical, but here's my laundry list; i bet you many other women's are longer.  the only pants i can find that actually fit my hips fall off my waist. women's pants, in general, have been oppressively tight on my lower torso and upper legs, regardless of the size, my weight, everything. men's pants are somewhat better, if i can find them in a large enough size to accomodate my hips. i've actually switched to wearing athletic or boxer shorts with skirts, so i can actually, you know, move around. i'm a lot faster, and oddly enough, the more comfortable style of clothing here actually makes me look better.  shirts are even worse. i have giant shoulders for a woman--i've been wearing xl sizes since i was twelve or thirteen years old, and i always lose my favorite shirts to tearing in the underarm or shoulder (someone commented that women need to change wardrobes every season; this is because clothing, even ostensibly women's clothing, is apparently not designed for our bodies and wears down very quickly). women's blouses seem almost universally designed to choke me, limit my range of motion in my arms, etc. this has been true regardless of my weight, even back when you could see my ribs (well, i was 1x then, 2x now. big difference). and the worst part of it is? this is even ignoring my chest.  my chest is problematic becuase my ribcage seems to be unusually large. i have scarring from attempting to wear 34 or 36b bras when i was in junior high. i'm bigger now in both respective measurements, and i can never find the 38-42 i need in the price i can afford. this sizing problem of mine also makes fitting into shirts, which seem to be universally designed for either pamela anderson lookalikes or five year old girls, problematic, but honestly, i don't care. i wear mostly men's shirts. but i can't go out without a bra for both health and modesty reasons, and bras f***ing hurt. and of course, if i were to do the healthy thing and try to get the damn things lopped off, i would risk medical damage that might interfere with breastfeeding if i ever have kids, and probably being laughed out of the surgeon's. no one complains about two ds unless they're on a report card.  and then shoes. oh shoes. i have extremely narrow heels, and yet somehow, it is only men's shoes, and one particular brand of sneakers marketed toward teenagers, that fit me right. socks are problematic too, becuase women's sock sizing assumes that women don't have calves, or at least, not like mine. it's gotten better since i gained a lot of weight, actually; the fat can squish to fit in the sock, but the muscle i had during my high school days couldn't.   about the only women's clothing that doesn't give me a lot of trouble is underwear... assuming i can find a style that doesn't try to go dental on my buttcrack.   i mean, yes, some women are incredibly vain, but i don't care so much what i look like, and i don't care so much what people say. i just want to be able to not get eaten alive at job interviews for looking like a hobo, and not hurt myself trying to look civilized. but because i'm built like a freaking pokemon--short and dense--the only way i can find clothes that aren't oppressively tight order to not fall off, i have to spend hours looking through bargain racks or shell out big bucks.   and the sad part is? i'm one of the lucky ones who looks halfway decent in the clothes that make me feel like i'm dying. too bad i refuse to wear them unless nothing else is clean.",1,0,0

257958,"i'm 6'4"", i weigh 360, though my highest was 395.  so i will just pretend i'm still at my 395 when writing this.  for reference, i weighed 210 when i entered freshman year highschool and started working out then.  i weighed 255 when i graduated high school.  i weighed 265 when i entered university 3 years later.  i graduated university at 340 pounds.  in the year i am detailing, i weighed 340 going in and damn near 400 going out.  i did not gain 60 pounds over the year, i gained 60 pounds in 7 fucking months.  even though according to bmi charts i'm rocking a near 50 bmi, you probably wouldn't have been able to tell by looking at me (obviously i was overweight, but how overweight is the issue).  i was an athlete for years, and only started to gain weight once that stopped, because my body was still begging for all the calories i'd been eating even though i stopped exercising so hard.  tl;dr: i can still see my feet when i look down, without sucking in my stomach.  i ate 3 meals a day.  for breakfast, i'd have cereal.  honey nut cheerioes, 1 full bowl.  any more honestly made me feel sick.  i loaded up with about 24 oz of coffee with french vanilla creamer (probably 3 servings per 8oz cup), so each cup of coffee weighed in at about 105 calories.  about 2 hours later i'd have a snack.  this snack was not all that bad for me -- where i worked stocked healthy snacks.  but i would also have a coke or dr pepper.  for lunch, i would eat out.  since i was living alone making a software engineer's salary, i could eat out 3-5 times a week so long as i was modestly frugal elsewhere.  lunch is really where the killer calories came in.  i would usually go to moe's southwest grill, get their largest burrito size, load up on rice, black and pinto beans, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, cheese &amp; queso, and every vegetable they had.  they had to double burrito my burrito's from time to time just to close them.  i don't remember exactly what i was looking at in terms of calories, but 1800-2000 for lunch was normal.  lunch was typically my largest meal.  that number does not include the medium soda i would have -- though i rarely ever had a refill.  to put it in terms of a more common fast food place, when i went to arby's i'd get the biggest roast beef and cheddar, large fries, jalapeno poppers and some other side, and a large soda.  about 3 hours later i'd snack again.  and another coke/drpepper.  for dinner it really depended.  i would make those store packaged au gratin potatoes (2 packs), or noodles (2 packs) or rice and chilli (2 cups + 2 cans).  if i ate out (which wasn't too uncommon), i would probably go to panda express, arby's or jack in the box.  mcdonalds rarely.  i didn't like eating out for dinner since it would require me to stop playing video games after a long day of work.  i may snack after dinner.  depends.  no more soda, though.  to estimate my caloric intake, i'll give you a range.  on days that i was determined to eat healthy (this trend lastest 2 days at best), i would eat around 2900 calories.  the food itself was healthy, but the quantity was not.  on other days... shit.  i could (and still can) eat, for a single meal: large stuffed crust pizza with multiple meat toppings + black olives and jalapenos (~3250 calories), a full cheesy bread side with marinara sauce (~780 calories), and a full pan of their alfredo pasta (~580 calories).  that's 4610 calories for a single meal.  so on my heavy eating days, i'd day i could easily break 7,000 calories.  for the largest meal i've ever eaten, this will be bad... this happened recently.  i went to the stockyard restaurant, which is one of the top 10 steakhouses in america.  my meal consisted of:  1 18 oz steak  1 lobster (an entire lobster)  3/4ths of a family size macaroni and cheese with bacon  3/4ths of a family size au gratin potatoes  1/2 of my girlfriends 15 oz steak  chocolate lava cake and 2 big scoops of ice cream  1/2 of my girlfriends pecan pie slice  3/4ths of my friends coconut cake slice  massive salad with massively unhealthy dressing  some type of soup  most of the appetizers  do note that we were a table of 10.  this will give you a decent measure of just how much food i am talking about here.  all in all i was looking at around 8500 calories, teetering on 9000.  depending on the accuracy of the estimate we did (we actually spent 30 mins at the office looking up the numbers), i could have eaten nearly 10,000 calories.  i did eat light the rest of the day (like it fucking mattered.)  i've never been so stuffed in my life, nor do i intend to do that again.  this was december of last year, after the year where i went 340-&gt; 395.  i didn't gain any weight that year.  physical activity for the year of the fat slob: i would walk the 1.5 miles to/from work from time to time.  probably averaged out at once per week.  and since i mentioned i lost 35 pounds, i can tell you what i do now, in less words.  breakfast: cereal or oatmeal or a fit and active turkey breakfast sandwich (350 calories for breakfast) 2 cups of coffee with 2 servings of creamer (140 calories)  snack: celery, carrots, granola bar (190 calories), yogurt (120 calories)  lunch: chicken soup (~300 calories, chicken is boneless/skinless, with celery and carrots added)  dinner: tilapia (2 or 3 filets) or salmon and tilapia (1 each) or 2 baked chicken breasts (about 14-16 oz frozen) or 12-14 oz of steak, grilled.  paired with baked asparagus or steamed broccoli or corn or peas.  that constitutes a normal dinner.  fish 2-3 times a week, chicken 2-3 times a week, then one of the following dinners:  fried rice  stroganoff  beef stew  chicken soup  dinner out  average caloric consumption ranges fro, 2500 to 3200.  typically i will do 2500 every workday (sometimes less), then more on the weekends.  physical activity: i own a weight set, so i have 3 workouts i alternate between:  upper body (bench press, biceps, shoulder press, forearm curls, and some grip exercise)  upper body (dumbbell row, dumbbell fly, laying triceps extension, forearm curls, grip exercise)  lower body (deadlift, squats, calf raises, hamstring curls)  i do 3 days, then rest.  the upper body days are done for strength training, lower body workouts are mostly endurance (i don't feel safe doing heavy squats or deadlifts, especially in my house.)  i also walk 2 miles as often as i can.  i don't have a second snack now, and i completely cut out soda.  i've had 3 sodas this entire year (a coke, a dr pepper, and an orange fanta).  when i go out to eat i still eat like a major fatass.  one particular stress inducing day i went to an all you can eat buffet and put back 5 plates of cheap greasy chinese food.  how do i feel about being heavy?  i used to kid myself a lot.  i have a younger brother who is just fat fat.  i used to exercise, and i used that to justify my size.  even though i was/am certainly muscular, i ignored the fact that i put on 130 pounds, 95+% of which was fat.  i'd say it didn't bug me.  i could still walk the mile to work, i don't have knock knees, i could still see my feet.  i did a lot of bullshitting to justify it and make myself feel like it wasn't too bad, like if i lost 30 or 40 pounds i'd be healthy again.  now?  i feel like shit.  i started dating someone online in december 2012.  she lives with me now.  she weighed 155 when she moved in and around there in the 4 visits before she decided to move in.  by the end of the first year with me (she moved in mid-august), she already weighed 170.  while i wouldn't consider 170 bad for a 5'7"" curvy lady (who also spent about 7 years working a physically taxing job), it hit me hard how poorly my lifestyle affected people.  even though i stayed around 385-395 the entire 2013 year, eating dinner with me caused her to gain weight which upset her.  and it also made me realize something else: i weigh more than twice as much as her, and that makes me feel shitty.  like she deserves better.  you know, someone who doesn't feel like they're going to have a heart attack after 10 minutes of physical activity, someone whose weight doesn't affect their ability to keep it up.  stuff like that.  after my cholesterol medicine ran out and i went to the doctor, i got hit with another fun bit: hypertension.  the high cholesterol i passed off as a culture shock from moving to the us.  lower quality food at fast food, greasier foods, etc.  hypertension is me having a shitty diet eating shitty preserved food because i was too lazy to cook.  so i do not like being heavy and i am trying to change it.  35 down, 100 to go. (260-275 is my goal).  even though i've been dieting since january 1st (i actually am keeping a new years resolution for once.  awesome), i still feel it.  i am still struggling with it.  psychologically, obese people lose the ability to listen to their natural hunger cues.  i have to decide to stop eating.  my body won't tell me i'm full until 1-2 hours after i eat.  it's a lot of guesswork to do it.  if we go out to dinner, i have to eat a decent snack before i go, otherwise i will over order and eat too much.  i've honestly lost the ability to tell the difference between hunger and headaches, so any day i don't feel 100% is terrible.  i eat but my brain is telling me i'm starving, even though i'm not.  it's a struggle.  i feel fat, i look fat, i have man boobs, stuff like that.  i wear 46"" pants, many people could fit into one of the legs of it.  i don't think that i will ever be right again.  i will never be capable of determining when i should stop eating on anything other than me consciously deciding i've had enough.  that's just depressing.  tl;dr it sucks and i always feel hungry, even when i'm full.  losing weight sucks because i have to guess when i've had enough.",1,-1,

(i wish i was kidding.)  going out to use the bathroom was like walking into a minefield. we're talking fresh cat or dog shit or piss on the order of 1-3 per square foot. where there was carpet it was absolutely matted down, littered with crap and usually had a fog of fleas 8"" deep. when i'd walk through it it was like feeling sand blowing against my legs.  the front yard contained three, maybe three and a half partially destroyed vehicles and one giant old truck. there was also two to three fridges and a couple of washers and crap. to one side of the house was a sort of patio or concrete yard between the house and detached garage, and this was shoulder to neck deep in crap they'd found in the trash. clothes, cans for recycling, cages for their 20-30 odd doves and pigeons, garbage, wrecked appliances.  one time they came home with a fully functioning kawasaki 1000 police motorcycle, saying they found it behind a 7-11. just yoinked it in their truck. tweaker dad destroyed it in the space of days. he had peeled the labels off and was getting ready to paint it or some shit, but decided he wanted to rebuild the whole thing at 4 in the fucking morning. it never did get put back together. he lost too many damn parts.  i didn't last the rest of the month. i did adopt a very cool cat there, and learned some things not to do. btw, i should note that i wasn't also tweaking. i was just a drunk/stoned homeless kid sucking at life. this experience is why i never got into meth. no way. not after seeing *that*.  **artists are crazy. and filthy.**    i once lived in a warehouse full of musicians, artists and weirdos. it was like living in a proper squat except we paid rent and were mostly left alone by the city and cops and shit. the building should have been condemned, but neither the city, the owner nor the property management company wanted to deal with it, so they left us alone because we kept out the junkies, and kept the place from burning down and being a real, true blight.  there were about 30 of us there, and more than a few people hated each other. besides the ongoing residents there were a lot of guests and couch surfers. there were also a lot of parties we'd throw, 300-500 person ragers and 12+ hours of underground techno. (well, we often had music going 24 hours a day for days on end, but not in full party mode.)  that place was awesome but fucking gross. giant, fearless rats ruled the kitchen. once we were getting inspected and we had to cull the colony. i put down 25-30 rats with snap traps and a bucket of water in the space of 3 hours, and it's one of the hardest things i've ever had to do because i like rats. and those fuckers were big and mean.  you know how bad it is when your roommates leave dishes in the sink? well, try that with 30 crazy, drunk, punk ass crusty motherfuckers for roommates and an industrial sized sink you could take a bath in. (in fact that sink also used to be the shower for a long time before someone built one.)  you could fit like 150 dirty plates and half a ton of silverware in that thing. i'd tackle it a couple of times when it was at it's worst and it was incredible, as in beyond belief. stank ass water up to your shoulders and a layer of rotting vegan food half a foot deep in the bottom. it'd take a day to just do the dishes.  it's probably the worst kitchen on the planet. sometimes the stove would get so bad it had an inch or two of crap on it. people dumpster dived for veggies and would bring home too much, and it'd rot in the fridges, so you'd find twenty pounds of rotting spinach or potatoes somewhere occasionally. (it wasn't all bad, though. we cooked some killer food and had many awesome feasts and parties in that kitchen, but it was a wreck.)  the bathrooms were rarely clean. we only had two shared between 20-30 people. or 300 during a party. once after a party we found it covered in about 6 inches of shit and soggy toilet paper. that took a shovel and a gas mask. we had a ""grey water"" system to flush the toilets that saved both rainwater, sink water and shower water. every so often someone had to dive into the tanks and muck it out and make it not stink so goddamn much.  there's all kinds of other gross stuff. the place is/was fucking awesome, but, man, not for people with weak immune systems or stomachs.

331562,"## part 3  ### pants  * **choose the correct rise for your shape**. if you feel self-conscious about bending over in your jeans, a higher rise will probably work betterâ€”the fabric will cover your butt appropriately for how curved it is. your jeans probably aren't hitting you at the right area of your hip/waist/general midriffy zone. * **the shape and positioning of pant pockets affects how your butt looks.** go pant shopping, or check out your closet, and investigate:     * *pocket height changes how full your butt looks*. pant pockets that are lower down and fall along that curve from the widest part back to the thinnest part (lower down on your buttocks) make your butt look fuller. if they're higher up you'll look flatter.     * *the angle of the pockets can complement or contrast your form*. if the pockets are angled outwards it accommodates hips that flare out quite nicely, as the pockets mimic the shape of your form. if you have flared-out hips but perfectly right-angled pockets, there's a conflict in the lines drawn by your body and by the pocket detail. try to see when the pockets provide an overly abrupt or subtly abrupt difference in lines.     * the angles of the lines the jean pocket shape makes (e.g. if it's rectangular, or if it's an angled wide v at the bottom) also have different effects.     * *observe how the pocket is proportional to the item and your size*. if the size of the pocket is proportionate to your *derriÃ¨re*, that's visually smoother than a too-small or too-large pocket which may emphasize the difference in your butt's shape versus the pocket's shape in an unflattering way.     * *pockets add a varying amount of visual weight*. decoration (e.g. flaps) and fancy stitching will bring more visual weight to your butt and will make your butt look more visually prominent (which generally translates to looking larger). * **select the cut of your pants according to how much volume they visually create.** there are two kinds of proportions you're looking at:     * *volume proportionate to your torso attire*: it's interesting to both maintain the [same perceived volume as your torso](http://image4.oasap.com/o_img/2012/08/10/16347-91600-home/elastic-contrast-panel-slim-pants.jpg) ([via](http://www.oasap.com/trousers-leggings/16347-elastic-contrast-panel-slim-pants.html)) or greatly over-exaggerate a difference:       * for maintaining volumeâ€”if you have a slim and tailored torso in an outfit, go for similarly slim jeans.       * for differentiating volumeâ€”it can be nice to pair a more fitted torsoâ€”or a torso with [less fabric](http://cdnd.lystit.com/photos/2012/04/17/vince-taupe-wideleg-pants-product-1-3279816-870771576_large_flex.jpeg) ([via](http://www.lyst.com/clothing/vince-wide-leg-pants-taupe-1/)) with wide-legged pants that fall from hip to ankle in a straight column of fabric. alternatively, a heavy coat paired with legs in tights or skinny pants (very slim in fit!) can provide an interesting proportional contrast. [here's an interesting collection of wide-legged pants](http://clothesdontcheat.blogspot.com/2012/04/wide-leg-pants-for-president.html) styled in various ways.     * *volume proportionate to your hips and thighs*: a super-skinny cut may make your legs taper in a spindly and awkward manner if it creates an impression of wide hips &amp; thighs with disproportionately slim calves. it may widen your hip area in an unbalanced way. something that appears to fall in a relatively straight line from knee to ankle is generally safe, as long as it follows and hugs (but doesn't appear to constrict) the curve of your calf. * **when looseness looks awkward**: bootcut or flare cuts typically look awkward because they produce volume in a place we expect slimness. ankles are usually quite thin; calves are usually thinner than the thigh; to create more volume at the ankles and volume at the calves to compete with the volume of your thigh is often jarring. do this with thought and care, or not at all.  ### shoes  * **shoes have visual weight.** they anchor your outfit at the bottom, so when examining the proportions of what you're wearing, check that the amount of visual weight your shoes introduce feels coherent with the rest of your outfit.     * *slim shoes have very little visual weight*. think [ballet flats](http://www4.images.coolspotters.com/photos/179116/alexa-chung-and-lacoste-gallery.jpg) ([via](http://coolspotters.com/tv-personalities/alexa-chung/and/shoes/salvatore-ferragamo-varina-flats/media/240905#medium-240905)) and flat sandals with slim straps. keep in mind they may look disproportionately small and insubstantial if, say, you have heavy and bulky layering on your torso. make sure this is the impression you want to giveâ€”unbalanced proportions aren't necessarily *bad*, but you should handle them with care.     * *heavier shoes have much more visual weight.* think wedges, chunky sneakers, lita shoes and their many clones. * **observe how the toebox changes the shape of your foot.** [different toeboxes](http://finalfashion.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/types-of-toes-web.jpg) ([via](http://finalfashion.ca/)) can elongate, shorten, widen, or slim the shape of your foot to select just three types of toeboxes and how they affect the shape of your foot:     * *rounded toes*: can look childish or juvenile (as children's shoes generally have more rounded toeboxes). often makes your foot look shorter and wider, since the generous curve implies a rounder shape instead of a narrow one.     * *almond toes*: generally recommended since they lengthen your foot with the slight taper, but they're still gently rounded and shaped enough to look normal.     * *pointy toes*: very deliberately abandon a ""natural"" human foot shape for something more angular and pointy. the more extreme and extended the point, the more jarring it can be. this is not to imply pointed toes are bad, but they're typically a strong statement. a [carefully pointed toe lengthens the foot in an angular way](http://cdn.glamcheck.com/fashion/files/2010/11/burberry-autumn-winter-2010-accessories-collection-3.jpg) ([via](http://www.glamcheck.com/fashion/2010/11/19/burberry-autumn-winter-2010-accessories-collection/)) * **look at the thickness and height of a heel in proportion to the visual weight of the rest of the shoe**.     * thick heels with very strappy sandalsâ€”or the reverse, a thin heel with a visually dominant shoeâ€”provides a strong contrast. do with care.     * substantial heels with a substantial shoe (say a closed-toe or peep-toe heel, or a shoe with thick straps and a strong shape) feel visually balanced. a [relatively substantial shoe with a heel that tapers from wide to slim](http://images3.freepeople.com/is/image/freepeople/24560211_001_a?$browse-lt$) ([via](http://jeffreycampbell.net/)) still retains visual balance between shoe and heel.     * thin strappy shoes (or shoes that cover very little of the foot) with a slimmer heel also feel visually balanced, on the other end of the spectrum.

747852,"yeah, i don't know why people modded you down; this is a good question - these flaws are ones that manifest themselves under both high load and once your codebase becomes ""large.""  in some cases, the large-codebase problems are one that plague other languages as well, but in php happen to manifest themselves ""earlier"" (i.e. the definition of ""large"" is smaller for php).  here are a couple examples off the top of my head:  1/ you know the whole ""include_once"" idiom? (similar to #include or import in other languages)?  unfortunately in php, this isn't runtime equivalent to linking in a library in any precompiled state; instead it forces an entire evaluation of the included files.  on a small scale this is okay, but on a large application, the number of included files becomes huge due to the amount of common code and infrastructure that's inevitably necessary.  you can try to relentlessly trim it down, but your application is still going to grow, and this full-interpretation overhead makes it so that *every page load* has to pay for this overhead.  2/ misspelled variables are just treated as newly-declared variables (i.e. no compile/run-time error warning) by default.  this is a useful feature when you're probably small scripts, but in a large codebase, it causes huge problems, especially since sometimes variables are undeclared because a chain of include files is missing.  this can be avoided by having e_strict on, luckily, but it is off by default.  3/ many of the array_* functions have inconsistent semantics; for instance, many of them supposedly return arrays, but bizarrely they cannot be used within expressions as array arguments to another function.  you have to assign the result to a variable, then subsequently use that variable as an argument.  these behaviors do not cause a run-time error (it just coerces the result into some random thing and goes on its merry way), so tracking down these bugs is also hard.  4/ the run-time type-determination is not exactly correct.  this is worse than being very incorrect, because it's mostly correct, but then every so often something odd happens that results in a bizarre bug.  this is okay in smaller programs, but in large programs can be frustrating difficult to track down, since you tend to assume that the type-inference is going to work as it does in other languages.  in my favorite case, it was an unnecessary intermediate type-coercion of a non-zero value to literal 1 (""true"") when i needed the non-zero value to remain what it was for later use, but instead it kept being pushed down to the value ""1"".  5/ the oop model is slow.  well hey, it's an interpreted language - they're all slow, right?  well, the problem is that you really only ""need"" to start using oop once the program has transitioned from ""a little script"" to ""large"" (i.e. to organize and encapsulate your code), and so if the oop features are slow, the slowness *only* manifests itself during the time you use it - when your codebase is large!  (this is very frustrating, because then you have this horrible decision choosing between performance and obviously cleaner oop-based architecture)  incidentally, the additional overhead of parsing oop class definition files contributes greatly to the problem in #1.  6/ function calls are relatively expensive in the php internals - there is a lot of memcopying of argument data structures before a function can be called.  also not a problem at small scales, but if you have a tiny function that's called all over the place, it becomes a significant source of runtime overhead to do all these unnecessary memcpys.  then the obvious solution is to inline it, but as you know, inlining a very commonly-called function bloats your total code size (see #1).  7/ php also does lack unicode support, but you can get by using the mb_strings library, and php6 is slated to have good build-in unicode support.  that hasn't been a problem for us yet.  8/ string quoting semantics are also inconsistent.  the various string-escaping functions, combined with ""magic quotes"" and other features, weren't designed in a unified  manner, so you get a lot of improperly-quoted string bugs.  again, not a big problem in a small-scale, but at the large scale you end up disabling almost all of php's own string-escaping functions and writing your own string-escaping libraries.  9/ form input handling is quite loose.  there is no type-checking (fine) and pretty much anything goes, and the variables are directly imported into the global namespace.  again, this is very convenient in small scripts, but leads to a lot of unpredictable behavior once your codebase gets large.",0,,
565251,"there is a condition that makes women fat, regardless of how many calories they consume or how much they exercise.  it's called lipedema.  this is the only genetic, obesity mimicking fat condition that i know of, and the only reason i know of it is because i've been diagnosed with it.  we don't really know how or why fat on a lipedema patient's body acts like it does.  there is a big theory that the fat cells act more like a benign form of cancer and replicates rapidly.  what we do know is most women that have it have a weakened or broken lymph system, and lymph fluid leaks into the fat cells which mutates it into something else entirely.  it no longer metabolizes like a normal fat cell and even if you starved yourself, the fat cell will continue getting bigger and bigger from the lymph fluid (google anorexic lipedema to see the stuff nightmares are made of).  the only silver lining is because lipedema fat is no longer acting like normal fat, the chances are that someone who's been trying to lose weight their entire lives has very little normal fat left on their body and is very low risk for obesity related conditions like diabetes or heart disease.  there's also very little adipose tissue around the organs (again, if a lippy lady has gotten rid of all the normal fat).  unfortunately, this condition isn't cosmetic.  the fat is heavier than normal fat from the fluid in the fat cell, and because of this most lippy ladies will tell you that their legs feel very heavy.  because of the pressure the fat puts on nerves, it's incredibly painful to touch the skin of a lippy lady.  because of the pressure on veins, varicose veins and spider veins are a reality.  because of the pressure on the lymph system, most of us have secondary lymphedema on top of the lipdemema and if it goes too far without getting liposuction, the fat can completely wreck the lymph system for irreversible and very permanent lymphedema.  i won't even go into the havoc it wrecks on the skeletal system.  this is probably the only common thing between a normal obese person and a lady with lipedema.  what i can tell you though is watching your mobility being ripped away from you, without being able to do a damned thing about it is one of the worst feelings in the world.  in the petition to my insurance to pay for liposuction (which is the only medical option at this time for getting rid of this god forsaken fat), all of my doctors without even consulting with each other wrote that i had about 5 years left before i would be wheel chair bound.  i really have no words on what that feeling is like, especially for someone who's very active and rather go on a hiking holiday than lay on a beach somewhere.  i'm one of the lucky ones that caught it in time, and i have the financial resources to get liposuction (if it progresses too far, liposuction is no longer an option).  my lower body has been completely done and my surgeon has taken 17.5 liters off my body so far and i already feel so much lighter and my gait is going back to normal.  i still have probably 25 more liters to go.   so yes, they're on to something but all these fas and haes people are actually making it harder to get women diagnosed by telling them to love their fat bodies and not bother trying to lose the weight.  this is the point when we get diagnosed!! when all the normal fat is gone and our bodies look grossly out of proportion!",1,0,
207372,"&gt;those variables are *not* dependent, none of what you're saying is firmly linked!  not firmly, but loose correlation is correlation. not any one of the things i mentioned will make a huge impact on muscle development, but there's no single thing in general. the reason none of those things are firmly related to muscle development is because there are so many factors. something that relates to a set of factors is called a *dependent variable.*  &gt;hormones and bone size aren't linked.  i never said they were. i said androgens were related to muscle development.  &gt;your worst and most fallacious argument is that large frames and height are in any way correlated! tall =|= large framed!  i did not say that. i mentioned shaq as an example of someone who had a wide frame relative to an already tall height. yao ming is about half a foot taller than shaq, and weighs about the same. now look at them and tell me that if they got in a fight, shaq wouldn't open a can of shaq fu on ming's ass.  &gt;your entire argument is a mess.  yeah, it's pretty easy to make that accusation when you're arguing against a strawman. i made one offhand comment about a person who is tall, and your rebuttal seems to have a disproportionately huge focus on refuting something only tangentially relevant to my overall argument. my argument is simple: wider frames accommodate more lean mass, and lean mass is heavier than fat, meaning wide-framed people are heavier than somebody of equivalent clothing size (assuming another non-bodybuilder person bulked up to their size, not the wide-framed person cut down to the size of the small-framed person).  &gt;same clothing size large boned person has lower weight, less muscle, less fat to fit the same size. as the bones are more spread out, they have to have less muscle and fat to fit the same size. they will have a lower bmi and bodyfat %, as having the same muscle or fat would add more bulk. this is controlling for physical mass.  i don't know about you, but my clothes aren't skin-tight. i've been wearing the exact same clothes with bmis of 27 through 22 and i've never had to get new ones. my shirts and pants fit exactly the same, because i buy based on my shoulders and hips, not how heavy i am. the bony parts of my shoulders and hips are the widest points of my body; i'd have to add a lot of mass to move up to a new size. if you're describing a wide-framed person at a low weight, sure, i would agree that they might look deceptively large, but we're talking about people who are high bmi. isn't that the point? the woman is heavy and blames it on her frame size, right? from what i can find, people with [wider frames do well at higher bmis](https://healthyeater.com/ideal-body-weight-calculator) and have more lean mass at a given height. a normal framed-person who bulks up to their weight will have lower starting lean mass, so in bulking up to their weight will put on a decent amount of fat, making them bigger.  &gt;large boned person will weigh the same (obviously), be physically larger, and look leaner while having roughly the same bodyfat %  larger *at the same bodyfat %*. meaning lower bodyfat at the *same size.* i thought this was the point you were trying to make? you were trying to say that if they're the same size, the large-framed one should be lighter, right? they're larger at the same bodyfat *percentage* because if you have more lean mass, you need a linearly proportional amount of fat to achieve the same *percentage.*  &gt;large and small bones weigh nearly the same.  right, because thicker bones aren't that much bigger to begin with. adding half a cm will add to volume cubically, but to the area as a square, so the dry weight will not be much more. however...  &gt;a large femur of the same length as a smaller just has more *spongy tissue*.  ...volume *is* much higher. you know how they say muscle weighs more than fat? it mostly comes down to the water content. [muscle is like 70% water, while fat is 10%.](https://www.livestrong.com/article/550931-does-muscle-tissue-have-less-water-than-fat-tissue/) and the [spongey material is about 60% water](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8686603). less dense than dry bone, but still denser than fat.  &gt;both fat and muscle weigh more than bone on its own.  [no](http://www.scrollseek.com/training/densitiesofdifferentbodymatter.html)  &gt;and you don't understand women sizes at all.  yes. i explicitly said exactly that. i found a size calculator and put in random numbers (that i felt were in reasonable proportions) until i got a size 10.  &gt;there's no gut underneath that, where tf do you think the hips are?  with biometrics, one part being bigger normally correlates (yeah, yeah, loosely, but still) to other stuff being bigger. normally, i wouldn't try to estimate frame size based on the size of somebody's hips, but it's the best thing to go on, since she doesn't give any of the measurements you would normally use. then again, if you don't think you can use one measurement to estimate the dimensions of the rest of somebody's body, then the formulas they use to calculate frame size are pretty bunk anyways, because they basically work by measuring your wrists or elbows or something. besides, she gives pants as an example of why she can't go below a certain weight, which suggests she thinks the rest of her is in proportion.  &gt;and how big do you think hips are? 34in is thin, supermodel hips, 38 is not huge at all  it's nearly as big as a man's hips (if pants sizes are anything to go by, since pants are supposed to rest on the hip bone,) and while women have *proportionally* larger hips, the average man is about 5'9"". it's pretty big for a 5'6"" woman. if ac/dc and sir mix-a-lot are to be taken as reliable sources of information (and i see no reason they shouldn't,) the dimensions of a woman in good health are 36-24-36. however, sir mix-a-lot specifies that these dimensions are for a 5'3"" woman (which isn't far off from america's female average 5'4"",) so i gave her an extra half-inch to stay proportional, making her a full 1.5 inches wider than average, which isn't negligible. when you pointed out that 38 inches isn't that big, i went back and actually punched in the numbers, so to maintain the same aspect ratio, she actually needs to be 37 inches, which 38 inches is wider than. a difference of an inch may not seem like much, but a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that it increases the volume of her abdomen and chest cavity by just under a liter, adding 5 lbs if it's lean mass. what is the extra volume occupied by if not lean mass?  &gt;your whole argument is a mess and is confusing so many different variables and is making so many assumptions.  if my argument seems convoluted, it's because i'm trying to address the individual points of *your* scatterbrained argument. my argument is pretty simple: wider frames accommodate more lean mass. most of this is pointing out parts of *your* argument that i find dubious. and yeah, i make assumptions, but we're working with limited information. ever hear of fermi problems? when your information is limited, make assumptions. making logical delineations without filling in the blanks is *less* accurate. it's better to fill in the gaps with reasonable assumptions and reduce sig figs. what assumptions am i making that are directly for my main point? the assumptions i do make are merely to help visualize a minor point. when i calculated the extra lean mass from frame size, i made the same assumptions she did: that her weight is due to her frame size and that the rest of her body scaled with her hips. you, on the other hand, assume that the dry weight of bones are representative of how heavy a skeleton is, which isn't even something you need to assume because you can google it.  &gt;internal organs aren't scaled by bone,  that's a big assumption to take for granted. source?  &gt;and neither are hormones, muscle or fat, those are independent variables not at all controlled specifically by frame size.  did i say hormones are controlled by frame? if anything it's the other way around. what i said when i originally brought it up actually implies hormones and frame size *are independent*. i mentioned androgen levels as being a factor in muscle size, not a dependent variable of bone size. then again, i suspect that you are actually arguing against an imaginary man made of straw and replied to me by mistake.",1,0,0

being thin doesn't automatically mean you're some pillar of virtue or that you eat properly or exercise ever. being thin just means you're thin. furthermore, being fat doesn't always mean you are out of shape either. there are fat people who compete in the olympics. there are fat people who run marathons. there are fat people who eat properly and exercise all the time and they never get skinny. it's not a black-and-white issue like you apparently believe it is.  &gt;but it's usually fat and obese people demanding acceptance,  i would too if i was constantly marginalized and dissed because of my appearance. i would too if i was constantly fed the message that my body is disgusting and should remain hidden. i would too if i was told that i'm ""lucky"" to have such a decent husband because i'm fat and he's not and he's doing me a favour by dating my poor unworthy self. fat people demand acceptance for the same reason that gay people do: because it is wrong to treat them like crap, just because you don't like something about them.   &gt;but why should they get it ?  because they're human beings. because until someone does something heinous to another person, they deserve the right to be treated with courtesy. accepting others doesn't mean you love them or think everything they do is great or find them attractive. all it means is that you recognize that they are a person, just like you, and you treat them with respect rather than snubbing them, judging them, or insulting them. that's it. it isn't rocket science. it isn't even hard to do at all unless you're some kind of bigot. you aren't a bigot, are you, skippy? i'm starting to think you are.  &gt;yes, it's the difference between a person not flaunting their ""thin-ness"" at a club or each because they are not wearing ""i'm thin and beautiful"" or **""i'm thin and you should love me"", and a fat person wearing what we know they often do wear.  i see fat people every time i go out in public. i have never, not even once, seen a fat person wearing a shirt that says ""fat and proud"", or ""i'm fat and you should love me"". it isn't commonplace. one in three adults in america is obese now, according to stats, and comparatively few people wear shirts like the ones you linked to. the last one was actually pretty rad...i'm guessing that woman has had enough of taking shit from people and that shirt is her way of warning people not to say anything. they shouldn't be saying anything to her anyway.  &gt;comparatively there exist few people skinny and flaunting it demanding to be accepted.  that's because we already are. you don't have to fight for acceptance when people already accept you. thin people still sometimes do have people say rude things about their weight...i've had that happen a few times in the past. but for the most part you get compliments. nice legs. you're so thin! look at that waist. you look wonderful, you'd never know you had kids. etc. etc etc. people accept you pretty readily when you are thin, because that is the image society pushes on us, especially on women. how many fat women do you ever see who play the romantic lead in movies or tv shows? how many famous fat actresses or female singers do you see? not very many. and the ones who dare to gain weight - like kim kardashian - face all manner of horrible slander for it. look at the women in commercials, in music videos, in advertising. look at news anchors and weather women. thin is in and fat is almost entirely excluded from these realms. thin people *are already accepted*. if society was different and fat was what everyone wanted, and thin people were treated the way fat people are, you bet your sweet bippy that there'd be thin people demanding to be accepted for who they are. as they should. everyone deserves that right.  &gt;fat or skinny people on the beach are irrelevant, as an individual has no reason to succumb to the demands of either to be accepted. if choose not look at obese people in swimsuits on the beach, that's my preference and fat people everywhere have little so say about it. fat people have no right to be accepted by me any more than i can say they shouldn't like chocolate. that's what ""preference"" means.  acceptance and ""preference"" aren't the same thing. nobody is saying that you have to find them sexy if you don't. i don't often find fat men attractive...there are other demographics that i don't find myself particularly attracted to either. and that's okay. you don't have to find everyone attractive. but acceptance has *nothing* to do with a person's beauty! acceptance is simply about live and let live. it's about treating others with the same kind of courtesy and politeness that you want from others. it's about not leaning out your car window to make pig noises at the fat woman out for a jog. it's about not staring at the fat man walking down the street and saying snotty things about him to your friends. it's about *not giving a damn* that the stranger you pass on the street is fat. that's acceptance.  ps, if i changed the word ""fat"" in your paragraph to the word ""gay"", the bigotry becomes a little clearer.   karma, man. karma. if you go through life refusing to accept other people based on nothing more than the size of their ass, it's gonna come back and bite *your* ass.   &gt;if fat people want to ""hide"" then that's their problem not mine, they choose to care more about external standards and my preference instead of them choosing to value themselves more.  attitudes like yours are one of the reasons why fat people sometimes struggle with their self-esteem. they get the message that they don't deserve respect until they're thin. they get used to being made to feel ugly, unlovable, and just not good enough. it's not as easy as just choosing to care about ""external standards"" when you are bombarded with the message that who you are as a person is worthless because you have more adipose tissue than other people.  &gt;i can like people on the whole despite being fat,   how big of you. this is like saying ""you're a girl but i like you anyway"" or ""even though you're black you're alright"". stop seeing physical characteristics as something to like someone ""despite"". it's no different than racism or homophobia.  &gt;but why should i ""like"" fat people because of their fat ?  nobody is saying you have to like fat people *because* they are fat. all i'm saying is that you shouldn't look down on them or be rude to them because they're fat, even if they have on a tee shirt that says ""fat and proud"". acceptance doesn't mean you like someone. it means you accept them and you let go of the need to be bothered by their appearance or lifestyle or choices. this is a lesson i learned ""so as by fire"" in my personal life. i was a mondo huge bigot for *years* about all kinds of things. i judged people for all kinds of stupid things and i felt it was justified and perfectly okay, because hey, look at what they're doing! but it's *wrong*. there is *no need* to go through life burdened with disgust at the choices or bodies of other people that have less than nothing to do with you. it isn't my business. and it isn't yours.",1,-2,-1

930650,"only reason i can think of for people down voting is it's not furry art, which this is a furry subreddit, so expectations are set.  one of our guidelines is that human anatomy studies are allowed for reference purposes, so it's a grey area?  but, yeah, reasons.  anyway, environment wise this is perhaps your weakest piece.  perspective is only vaguely maintained in places, it's still sharp everywhere (sharp corners, sharp edges, and the pistol on the counter is very blocky and unrealistic.  as before, you're going to have to look into studying real environments and objects to get a handle on rounding out your drawings.  there are very few sharp edges and corners in the real world, either by design or because of the daily bump and grind.  even a cement block poured to have a hard edge will be rounded in a few months or years because of environmental wear and tear.  that's not to say make everything curvy, but wider lines, rounder corners, shadows and highlights all lend to the appearance of a blunter object.  character wise, i think /u/inadayorso has covered a lot of the points:  * her hand is very flat on the counter.  even pressed firmly, there is a curve across the back of the hand, and also an angle from the wrist joint down to the knuckles. * her braided hair looks like it goes down her back, then up onto her shoulder.  as a fan of longer hair, i know that this doesn't often happen.  she'd need like, waist length hair for that kind of thing to occur with a braid that thick.  the braid should be coming directly from her head and over her shoulder. * very high collar bone, doesn't feel very feminine * extremely form fitting jeans.  denim doesn't often conform like that, and when it does it has looser sections at *some* point (like around her knees and ankles).  form fitting doesn't necessarily make for the best of wardrobes, or the best of anatomy examples. * conversely to the jeans her blouse is not form fitting and hides the natural curve of her body, so she appears to have a stock straight torso.  fabric gathering would still hint at the curve of her back with a few folds gathered around her waist as the fabric rests on the flair of her hips. * no hips.  &gt;v * very masculine face, as mentioned.  you explained it as a kind of transgender thing, but cloning would eschew that transgender appearance entirely because she's grown female from the ground up.  that means thinner eyebrows, a smaller face, rounder and lower cheeks, and a bit less of a strong jaw line.  she can still be very masculine in other facets, like having a commonly masculine expression, or very butch stance, things that are common to a guy who spent x decades living as a guy. * the feet are a minor point, but having them turned outward from each other and yet having the left foot behind the right on the same plane, it feels like an off balance posture. * and finally, she's huge.  like, 10 heads tall huge.  that's 2 more than normal for a female.  even with a male basis which may present through cloning, she's really tall.  for someone this big to make sense she should have a much more amazonian physique, or more likely a hulking warrioress physique.  look up ""heroic proportions"" for an idea on how to make larger than life characters work.  this is where anatomy study comes in because you need to understand why certain things are better the way they are before you start goofing around with major proportions.  10 heads is, as i said, unrealistically huge for a normal human.  but head height isn't necessarily a factor for true height.  take [this guy](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2806288/thumbs/o-robert-wadlow-570.jpg?3) for instance.  he's 9 heads tall, but he's obviously humongous.  his head is larger than the guy he's standing next to.    one of the anatomy things you'll learn is the bigger something is, the more muscle it packs on to be able to move around or the more adaptations in terms of locomotion they need to get away with less muscle.  elephants are super thick for instance for all that mass to move.  giraffes though have spindly legs.  that's because elephants have conventional plantigrade feet and arms (like most plantigrade mammals) while the giraffe has unguligrade legs that are designed to be long and lock into a particular configuration (stilt like, basically).  most of their muscle is in their hips and shoulders, with little elsewhere in their limbs to move joints, because the joints don't move much at all.  and this muscle mass is apparent within the same family.  felidae for instance range from massive and muscular lions and tigers, to smaller and more lithe cheetahs, and then even smaller still lynx, each with proportionally less muscle (but proportionally different physiques, so a lynx with its shorter limbs and wide snowshoe paws appears more muscular than a cheetah at a glance).  human physique on a character that tall would require much more bulk.  rounder ribs (breathing to push oxygen to all of the body requires larger lungs and muscles), wider shoulders (muscle mass to move arms) and arms, much thicker legs (primary locomotion requires not only moving those long legs, but lifting the mass above them), and an overall wider centre of balance (thus a wider skeletal structure overall).  this accounts for major proportions, but keep in mind that anatomy likes to keep the least amount of internal volume possible, so wider hips and ribs just barely affects the waist line as an example.  arm joints wouldn't necessarily be much larger than normal, so they could be a bit spindly in comparison to the muscle around them required to function in day to day life; thinner than expected elbows and wrists would be likely.  the knees and ankles though would be shock reinforced, having had to support the weight of the body over a great period of time, so they would be thicker than expected (compared to the rest of the body), but still proportionally thin compared to the increased muscle of the thighs and calves.  feet may be spread out from having to be a stable platform for all those years, and thus be extra wide, but feet are

201699,"man. you're clearly light years ahead of my newb self. lol. thanks for all the tips. i definitely appreciate it! the burgers done that way sound phenomenal. i love a good burger, but i get frustrated at the price of good burgers here. that method sounds like it'd amp up my homemade burgers. it's just a basic electric smoker. i figured i'd tool around with it for awhile and make sure i like smoking shit myself before i commit to an expensive or fancy setup. the friends who got me the smoker have smoked some great stuff on theirs, including deer sausage and duck, so they kinda inspired me to start trying stuff out. i really want to cure some bacon and mess around with pork belly. i was in whole foods the other day, and i saw ""salmon candy"". my guess is it's salmon that's been glazed with a lot of sugar and was smoked. but it was like $30/lb. you snacking on red snapper reminded me of that. was it self caught snapper?   i juuuuuust bought a house though, and this place is a disaster, so i have to do some more work on the inside before i can start planning an outside area for me to setup my smoker and grill and the things. i have a backpatio, but it's your standard small slab that was poured in 1960 something. it's narrow and long, and the roofing is shot full of holes, so i am on pause until i can get it figured out.",0,,

750631,"it doesn't stop either. i just turned 50 and my 26 year old sister (from a second marriage) and i are a few weeks in to the task of sorting out my dad's hoard before he starts having legal hassles (the cops were just here about all the crap in front of his house). i believe he suffers from several related cluster b disorders, including narcissism one of which manifestations is body dysmorphia; he prides himself on eating just once a day, and weighs about 168 pounds at 6 feet tall and 78 years of age. i know this is within the ""normal"" range, but it definitely errs on the side of scrawny to my eyes. meanwhile i am a 5'8 1/2', somewhat busty female, weighing about 164. i wear between a 10-14 depending on manufacturer. sure, i'd love to have a flatter stomach, but i am definitely not ""fat"" or unhealthy. my cholestoral, blood pressure, etc. are all normal. i have exercised my entire life, long distance running and typically using a bike for transportation, on average 15 miles a day. i eat healthy, natural foods, do not pig out on junk/fried/fast or processed food (maybe have an ice cream or a piece of chocolate once a week), and at various points in my life have spent hours at the gym, dance classes, in addition to running and biking. despite all of this, i was only ""skinny"" at times in my life when there was something drastically wrong, e.g. i was addicted to heroin and cocaine and barely ate in my late 20s, then after i cleaned up and gained weight i literally survived on cottage cheese and rice crackers while doing heavy daily workouts in order to get down to that socially acceptable anorexic frame. as i got older, as is typical for women in general, i've found it harder to take off that ""final 15"" pounds that would make me be considered slim, but it's got nothing at all to do with me over-eating or under-exercising. at this point in my life, i've had to consider that it's either genetic from my mum's side (she has a caribbean/hispanic mixed race background) or else i have a medical condition such as hypothyroidism (which i'm trying to get checked out for soon). in other words, i'm either normal to my body type or there is a medicine i can take to speed up my sluggish metabolism. either way, it's not something diet and exercise can (healthily) alter, as my lifetime of experience has shown me: my weight just plateaus at a certain point and i gain weight very easily, at the slightest indulgence.  sorry for the long intro and now back to the present. so here i am, working my ass to the bone to clear up this junk, being super non-judgmental the entire time, never ever saying things like ""what the fuck is wrong with you that you could let your house and all our family belongings turn into such a filthy pile of shit?"" but happily doing the disgusting work, including turning an area into an outdoor cookout section so the man could eat some home-cooked grub for the first time in aeons, and what do i get as thanks? yesterday, the old man takes me aside and starts telling me about how me coming down here, (putting my whole life on hold for up to one year while working for free and spending money on cleaning supplies and boxes instead of my own needs) is this wonderful opportunity for me to get my fitness back and lose some weight. uh, wtf?????????????????????????????????????????????? he told me to my face that i have a food and eating problem, despite the fact that he has seen exactly what i eat and how often since being here, i.e. same as him: salads, fruit, yogurts, fresh fish and the occasional potato. he also told me that i need to exercise more - i am probably burning 2000 calories a day just running around this joint and dragging crap around - and just ignored me when i told him that before i came here i regularly rode my bike 10-30 miles a day and before that, when in france, rode even more than that plus running 6 to 12 miles at least 4 days a week.  it was incredibly offensive and insulting, especially since i can't remember the last time he gave me a compliment or even noticed any accomplishments of mine: i gave him a cd of a 6 week music tour that i did before leaving europe, with a whole bunch of world class international musicians, and found it lying unopened in the dirt a few days later. i am so pissed off at him for having the frikking nerve to fat-shame me when i haven't said a word about his disgusting lack of hygeine or even basic organization, and when i am not even frikkin' fat! i'm just not thin! i was on the verge of packing up my stuff and bailing on the whole project, but then i would be ditching my little sister, plus this morning the cops arrived with an ultimatum to clear the street in 15 days. so i've had to swallow my pride, but you know what i'm not going to swallow? a single mouthful of food in front of my dad, the entire rest of the time i am here. what's even weirder, this morning i think he felt as bad as a narcissist can feel when they've been horribly insensitive to someone else, plus he realized he really needs my help now more than ever, so he offered to go get coffees from the store. asked how i take mine ""just milk or cream please"" but when he gets back he hands me one that's really sweet and asks me how it tastes. ""like it has sugar in it"" i said. ""yes, three packets!"" he declared cheerfully, ""isn't that how you wanted it?"" ""no, i said, nothing but cream. no sugar."" ""oh really?"" he says. ""yes, i've never taken sugar in my coffee"" i reply. ""oh well, it won't kill you!"" he says. wtf? i can't even try to understand this. did he think that i was lying about not taking sugar in my coffee to make some kind of a point and thought he was gonna catch me out? it makes no fucking sense at all. anyway, this is probably not that helpful to anyone except all i can say is, if you're young, don't expect this shit to stop anytime soon. be strong in your own self-image and never, ever, expect validation from your narcissist parent(s).",1,1,-1

278149,"beware, unnecessarily giant critique! please don't be afraid, i write things of this length for everyone. understand that my length and language are no indication of my opinion of your quality as an artist. i just like to explain things very wordily, and i prefer not to mince those words either.  hm... you don't appear to be undersketching. i'd recommend highly that you read the sidebar guides for information on these and their purpose. if you can't be bothered (which you really should be), they're shape skeletons. extremely light, floaty maps of where the different parts of the anatomy and scenery will go. pony bodies are done with two circles, one slightly smaller than the other, that overlap; the head is a big circle larger than either of the body circles, and the legs are circles connected by sticks. these aren't supposed to look like a finished product because they aren't one; they're the rebar, not the wood and paint.  like xjuggernaughtx siad, your legs are thin. they're the correct thickness up top, but they're not widening nearly enough at the hoof. they need a serious taper so that their hoof winds up nearly twice as wide as where they connect to the body. the heads on fluttershy, rainbow dash and rarity are all much, much too small; they should be sized and proportioned like twilight, if not bigger.  one other thing that i notice is fluttershy. for a start, her body has no bottom edge, making it way, way thicker than it should be. her back legs are also strange, and i don't know if you quite understand what they should be doing. you got 'em more or less right on rarity, so i don't know what's happening with fluttershy. her thigh is way too big for one thingâ€”compare it to applejack's thigh. it's twice as big! her ""foot"" portion, the bent part laying on the ground, is also much too small and thin; it should be the same size as rarity's. her front too legs stretch out too far, and their joint is odd; on the nearest one, the bottom portion seems to be getting way smaller towards the end, which is the opposite of what it should do.   fluttershy's eyes are also too small and too high up. same goes for rainbow dash.  twilight and rarity's horns are too long and skinny; normal unicorn horns are much shorter and stouter.  rainbow's inner feathers are too long, and her legs bend in the wrong placeâ€”that leg thing isn't really your fault, though, since they bend incorrectly in the reference, too. that joint there is the elbow, and it goes the other way; the lower joint is the wrist, and *that* one bends inwards.  besides all that, i seriously love this. to be honest the picture you chose as a reference, though nice, isn't something i could recommendâ€”it's based on official hasbro vectors, not the show's art. as such, it's not especially accurate to the way the ponies are usually portrayed.  again, i hope i didn't give you the impression that this is bad, since it certainly is not. like i said, i write these things for everyoneâ€”but that doesn't mean i don't want you to take my advice to heart! i hope i could help; if you have any questions, i'd love to answer!",0,,
226510,"edit: some edits and additions in random places.  i'm self-taught, but let's see if we agree on the basic ideas (which i learned via trial and error, and a lot of reading):  **general principles**  everything i say below applies to everyone, men and women, fat-asses and skinny bastards alike. the principles are universal, all you need to do is tweak the parameters, but the overall method is the same. amazingly, the same method is best whether you want to look good, or be healthy / live long, or all of the above.  whatever you do, it must be sustainable. this is not a quick 3 weeks fix, it's a change of lifestyle. remember, what's good for your health is good for your shape, and your health is a life-long affair.  most people do not need to ""lose weight"", they need to lose *fat*. these are very different problems that have very different solutions. but most people can't stand associating the word ""fat"" with themselves. denial - it's a powerful drug.  most people would be better off if they gain a little bit of slick athletic muscle. that includes you too, women (some of you stopped reading at this point - well, good luck, but you may want to google-images [allison stokke](http://i.imgur.com/ayroq.jpg) before you leave). more muscle means faster metabolism, which means it's easier to control and get rid of fat.  exercise *and* nutrition. you need *both*, no matter what your goals are. you can't pick and choose. you need to do everything, or at least as close to it as possible.  **nutrition**  write down *everything* you eat for 1...2 weeks, every single bite, then do the math using a nutrition calculator, and see the number of calories / day, protein / day, carbs / day, fat / day. the results will totally amaze you in several different ways. (tldr: you think you know what you eat, but you don't. *nobody* does, until they write it down for a while.)  most people would do well to increase their protein intake a little bit, but be careful with total calories / day.  most people should not care about eating too much fat. normal intake is fine, just keep a watchful eye on the saturated fat and cholesterol. low-fat diets are stupid, given that most people are stuffing themselves full of carbs all the time (see below). tldr: your fat intake is fine, stop worrying about it.  reduce the carbs intake *a lot*. don't eat a low-carb or zero-carb diet, that's stupid, just make sensible choices. stop ordering fries with your burger, *forever* (yes, that's very sensible). stop drinking soda, *forever*. stop using salad dressing *forever* (or sprinkle it with a bit of olive oil and vinegar, it's tasty and healthy). stop eating popcorn at the movies, or in any other situation - that shit is evil, and so are potato chips, twinkies, etc. reduce chocolate, icecream, pastry. if you crave sweets, eat fruits. plants should provide most of your carbs intake anyway. but that pile of rice that came with your chinese takeout - you probably don't need the whole thing. tldr: you probably eat 2x...3x more carbs than you should.  ideally, your daily caloric intake should come 33% from protein, 33% from fat, 33% from carbs. but most people eat more like 20 - 10 - 70. it's hard to stick to the 33/33/33 ratio all the time, but stay close.  don't skip meals. in fact, do the opposite - instead of splitting your daily intake in 3 big meals, eat several more smaller meals (ideally 6, but 4...5 is fine), but keep the total constant.  if you are not losing fat, you probably need to reduce the carbs and/or the total calories some more. but progress is gradual, so don't hurry; you can't ""get in shape for summer in 2 weeks"", that's just idiotic. also, if you exercise you don't need to starve yourself. fat loss occurs at a tremendous rate if you exercise; a simple 400 calories drop in your daily intake will trigger very rapid fat loss, if you do everything else correctly (keep reading). people eating 1500 cal / day are idiots and deserve whatever bad things happen to them.  if you are not gaining muscle, you either don't eat enough protein, or not enough total calories (i did not start making serious progress until i started to eat 3200 cal / day - but careful to not start putting on fat instead, so watch the mirror), or your lifts are not heavy enough (you're just ""toning""). but progress here is even slower than losing fat. there's no shortcut.  supplements (for fat loss, muscle gain, etc.) are just that: supplements. meaning, your diet and exercise come first. ideally you should never use supplements if you do everything just right.  stop being obsessed with your weight. your body fat percentage is far more important. buy some cheap skinfold calipers online and learn to measure your bfp. throw that bathroom scale in the garbage.  **exercise**  starving + cardio is a shitty fat loss method. it's not that good of a ""weight loss"" method either, at least because it's not sustainable (you can't do it 3 decades without interruption) and it's not really all that healthy.  between weightlifting and cardio, the former is a more efficient fat loss method, per unit of time invested. cardio elevates your metabolism while you exercise, but after that the metabolism drops to the previous level rather quickly. weightlifting elevates your metabolism while you exercise, and then your metabolism stays pretty high for quite some time; if you don't just lift weights, but actually gain some muscle, then it stays higher forever (or until you lose the muscle) - first increase is due to the body doing muscle recovery after effort, second increase is just because muscle burns energy quickly even when idle.  lift weights 3 times a week (anyway, no less than 2 times / week), up to 60 min each (no more, but not less than 40 min), full body workouts. lift heavy, short sets (3...8 reps), strive to make progress and increase the weights week over week. ""toning"" with light weights and lots of reps is a waste of time. take 60 sec ... 150 sec breaks between sets, no more, no less. wear a wristwatch and use it. stop chatting at the gym, do your lifts and gtfo.  split body workouts allow you to do more than 3 sessions per week (which is the maximum with full-body workouts), the efficiency is slightly higher but the effort is much bigger. this is only for the select few.  for each group of muscles, you want something like 24 ... 25 reps total per session. e.g., if today you benchpress sets of 3 reps each, that means 8 sets. if today you squat sets of 8 reps each, that means 3 sets. if today you chin-up sets of 5 reps each, that means 5 sets.  sets of 3 are done with the heaviest weights. sets of 8 are done with somewhat lighter weights. sets of 4, 5 or 6 are in between. you need all of them.  how heavy is ""heavy""? just make sure it's heavy enough so that you fail the last set about once every week or two. e.g., if you're supposed to do 5 x 5 today, during the final set you can only do 4 reps before you fail. or, you do manage to do all reps, but you have to reduce the load a little for the last few sets. that means you're challenging yourself. when you're not failing the last set anymore, that means you need to increase the load.  don't lift for more than 60 min each time, your body starts making stress hormones after that and your progress is diminished. don't lift more than 3 times / week full body workouts, your muscles need to recover after lifting (you don't make progress at the gym, you make progress after the gym when you're recovering).  the big lifts (bench press, squat, chin ups, deadlift) are the best, but when doing anything that involves your back (squats and deadlifts) **learn the fucking form** before you lift! nobody appreciates having to deal with back hernia for life. if you feel you're losing the perfect form, drop the barbell right now and stop! back pain means stop! hire a trainer for a few weeks, to teach you to squat and watch over you, best money investment ever. once you learn it properly, the squat is the best exercise ever - just make sure you're making progress slowly and gradually. the squat is great for women too - just repeat this mantra ""jennifer lopez's ass"" and you'll see what i mean.  free weights (barbells, dumbbells) are much better than weight machines. use the machines only as a supplement.  every day in a weekly cycle should have different exercises, different relative loads: 8x3 (and maybe 6x4) on monday, 3x8 (and maybe 4x6) on wednesday, 5x5 on friday, or something like that. once every few months, change your weekly program entirely. boredom is the enemy of progress, and your body gets bored pretty quickly.  but cardio is not bad either; at the very least it provides your body the much-needed variety. if you only lift weights 2 times a week, then ride your bike on a good uphill road 2...3 hours on the saturday, then you're way better off than most people - if your diet is also good, then you probably look great too and get laid a lot.  games, such as soccer, or volleyball at the beach, heck even ping-pong, are not bad. just make sure you get plenty of rest in between. e.g., if this week-end you go to the beach and throw the frizbee a couple hours (best game ever imo :) ) then skip the bicycle. having a day off between any two exercise sessions (regardless whether they are lifting, cardio, or games) is a very safe rule to have. you don't want to burnout, it's not a pleasant experience. you may get away with not taking days off when you're 20, but in your 40s or later the situation is very different - build healthy habits early.  whatever you do, **start slow**. if you're a couch potato, you'll need 3...4 weeks to reach a reasonable, average level of intensity (full number of reps and sets, full duration for one session of training), then 4...6 months before you can get close to near-maximal load effort, and then 1...2 years before your body is truly ready to give 101%. that means, first couple weeks, you do one set of this, one set of that, then gtfo. don't be a hero, it's why most people fail after a couple months - they try to do too much too soon, men and women alike, both genders are pretty stupid like that. that's wrong. it's not a sprint, it's a marathon. **start slow** and gradually ramp up.  slight muscular pain doesn't mean much, just keep ploughing ahead. joint pain, or tendon pain, or back pain - that's different. slow down and re-evaluate. maybe you're burning out. maybe you need to change your routine - doing the exact same thing every day for ages is a recipe for joint injury. depressed, easily catching a cold, low energy - you're burning out. take a week off. in fact, take one week off every 4 ... 8 weeks no matter what - it's good insurance against burn-out.  at the gym, carry a small notebook and a pencil in your pocket, and write down everything. e.g.:      2010/09/20     bench press    200lb    3 3 3 3 3                    180lb    3 3 3     chin-up        +35lb    4 4 4 4 4 4     leg press      250lb    4 4 4 4 4 3     calf raise machine    150lb    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3  and so on. start a new page every day. this will show you your progress very clearly and you'll always know exactly what kind of exercise to do, what load, how many sets and reps, etc.  if you don't know what exercises to do, get arnold's ""encyclopedia of bodybuilding"" - it shows you all the important exercises, it tells you what muscles are being trained by each exercise, it's full of detailed diagrams and pictures (of arnold's and other champions).  **gender-specifics**  women are crazy. they'd go on silly diets rather than lifting weights, being afraid that they will look ""too muscular"". no, you won't. it took me years to build up a little bit of muscle, and i've 10x more testosterone in my bloodstream than you, on average (what with me being a man and whatnot). your fat gain/loss and your muscle gain/loss are mostly controlled by your **diet**, not by your exercise. the exercise provides only the *energy* for the change, while the *direction and the material* for the change (more/less fat/muscle) is given by the diet. if you lift weights but your caloric intake per day is pretty low, you can keep lifting till the cows come home and you won't put on any muscle (but you will lose fat pretty rapidly). so lift weights and watch your diet and you'll look like [jennifer garner in ""daredevil""](http://i.imgur.com/cluhu.jpg). or stick to your oprah ""diet"" and you'll look like a broomstick (and trust me, nobody wants to fuck a broomstick), or like a skinny-fat ugly woman. or, more likely, you won't make any progress and you'll stop all efforts, totally discouraged.  another typical female mistake: ""smaller is always better"". no, it's not. smaller waist is always better, yes, but that means you need to lose fat. the ass, on the other hand, most if not all men want to see and feel some curves down there. please don't disappoint, do some squats (or one-leg step-ups or whatever). and lose that puffy fat that makes your ass look like shit; build a little bit of nice round firm muscle instead (which is so hot).  men are crazy, too. they think lifting weights is enough, and diet is optional. no, it's not. keep stuffing yourself full of burritos and see if you can lose that belly. hint: it'll never work that way.  another typical male mistake: work out upper body forever, neglect lower body. that's called the ""chicken legs syndrome"" and it's ugly. don't worry, don't avoid working out the legs, nature knows what's good for you.  regardless of your gender, exercise your entire body and you'll look great: if you're a man, it will build your upper body naturally, while keeping your lower body in good shape; if you're a woman, it will build shapely attractive athletic legs and ass, and a nice hourglass figure on top of that. exact same exercises, very different outcomes depending on gender. mother nature is amazing.  **final words**  so let me re-iterate - just keep doing the exact same exercises, and if you shift your diet the results change vastly: reduce calories a little and reduce carbs a lot, you lose fat fairly rapidly (and you build no muscle, in fact you may lose some; unless you're an absolute couch-potato beginner in which case your muscles will shape up a tiny little no matter what kind of exercise you do). increase calories a little and increase protein a lot, you slowly gain some muscle (there can be no rapid gains here, unless you take steroids) and your fat percentage stays more or less constant. the direction of the change is solely dictated by diet. the exercise program described here is the most efficient one regardless of the kind of changes you want to make.  finally, make sure you get enough rest and sleep, and reduce stress in your life as much as possible. this helps with any goals you may have.  p.s.: i used to be a skinny bastard, 180 cm (6'0"") and 61 kg (135 lb), couldn't pick up a crayon. nowadays i'm 84...86 kg (185...190 lb), no visible fat (i guess 12...14 % bfp, just like you), and last year i bench-pressed 100 kg (220 lb). in the process, at some point i put on a bit of lard on my belly, which i quickly learned to control and get rid of using the methods above.",1,0,0
714391,"here's a little bit of the deal with mic pres (and with almost any recording gear, especially as you get more expensive):  * good sound quality is cheap these days. don't take my word for it, try it: take a great-sounding cd, send it out of your audio interface through the line outs, and then back in through the line inputs, and hit record. now play back the ""ripped"" tracks. (do this, seriously) does it still sound like a great cd? i bet it does. that's your basic signal chain.   * now try the same test, except this time send it out through your speakers, and record it with the most accurate and neutral mic you own. even an sm57 into a presonus interface will sound like a pretty good mono folddown in a quiet room. and if you replace the sm57 with an omni reference mic (even a fairly cheap one), you might have to seriously strain to detect the difference.  if you did the test using high-end reference monitors in an anechoic chamber you might need clinical measurements to distinguish between the two. so far so good.   so what more is there? well, there are a few things.  for starters, the reference cd you were recording is already a great source. otoh, a typical singer or acoustic guitar player, for example, might exhibit some pretty drastic swings in level when you stick a mic in front of them.   let's say you're recording digital so you set your input to capture average *peak* levels of -12db, with maybe an occasional transient or plosive that hits close to 0dbfs. so maybe the average ""average"" or ""rms"" level has the needle bouncing somewhere around, say, -18db, with occasional passages hovering closer to -24.   assuming 0dbu on the preamp meters is equal to 0.77 volts ac, your ""average"" -18db record level is about 0.095 volts. your ""low level"" -24db passages are about 0.048 volts, remembering that db is logarithmic. assuming you would like to have at least another 24db of clean resolution between the quiet passages and ""silence"" (a.k.a. the noise floor, and 24db is not asking much *at all*), that means your preamp should handle signal from a -48dbu noise floor on the low end, to a 0dbu peak on the high end. (we are here equating dbu with dbfs, just to illustrate)  so to achieve that 48db dynamic range (which is not asking much *at all*), we need a preamp that can deliver clean gain from about 0.003 volts ac, to about 0.77 volts ac or a difference of 2^8. let's think about that for a second.  if we were to equate this to household 115 volt outlets in the us, you would need an outlet that could deliver 115v on the low end, and a staggering 29,440 volts on the high end. if you tried to run that kind of voltage through household wiring your house would explode! the wire gauge for such voltage would measured in pants sizes and the wire alone would have enough random movement of electrons to be a white-noise generator when connected to normal speakers. the transformers and power supplies required for that kind of stuff would make your whole house buzz and hum. and that's just with a meager 48db signal-to-noise! if you wanted a ""high end"" 96db snr ratio, you'd need a capacity of over **753,000 volts** at this scale!  now, audio circuits obviously operate at much lower voltages, which considerably reduces the scale and materials cost, but the principles are the same: a high-quality, high-headroom, low-noise audio circuit requires very careful, precise, and high-quality design and construction. a 1% error on a logarithmic scale of 2^16 (96db noise floor) is a massive distortion on the decibel scale.   **so what does all this mean for preamps/audio circuits?**  it means that carefully-designed, carefully-built, excruciatingly precise circuits will tend to perform much better at the extremes than cheaper, factory-stamped, low-cost, looser-tolerance circuits will. a boutique manufacturer who is willing to pay 10x as much in components, testing, and construction in order to achieve 0.01% tolerances might sound little different from a manufacturer who is achieving 0.1% tolerance when you are simply comparing one line-level test signal to another, but those differences might become quite noticeable when you're combining 48 tracks of dynamic source signals and noise floors.   you should shop based on sound quality, not based on design philosophy (leave that to the people who know what they're doing), but certain kinds of very demanding source material can reveal pronounced differences between preamps that easily pass the ""re-record your favorite cd"" test:  * big, slow-moving, current-sucking sources such as di electric bass or synth bass will push a circuit's power-handling to its limits: some may sound ""strangled"" or voltage-starved, others may distort in pleasing or unpleasing ways (e.g. a fat, beefy, punchy growl versus a farty/blurty sound). others may deliver excruciatingly clean and precise transmission right up the point of overload, at which time they may turn into grating digital-sounding clipping.  * a source with lots of complex, detailed and rapid high-frequency dynamics swings, such as jangling keys, might reveal a lot about sensitivity and accuracy. some circuits might deliver crystalline, pristine accuracy, others might turn the whole thing into hashy white noise, others still might artfully overload and give a crisp, chunky but still bright ""loudness"" effect, without losing the sense of realness.  * intense dynamics changes, such as drums, might reveal circuits that handle big overloads well or poorly, in different ways. this one might turn into punchy, crunchy ""big impact"" distortion, while another might turn flabby and weak. yet another might sound just like it sounds in the room.   this is why commercial studios often pay a fortune for a mixing console with high-quality input channels plus a bunch of different outboard preamps even if, on most material, one track at a time, it's hard to hear any difference.    **so what should you do if you can't afford a bunch of kilobuck preamps?**  first off, don't sweat it. your prosumer mixer or audio interface probably has pretty decent preamps these days, which are eminently capable of making great-sounding recordings (remember that test up above, where the great-sounding cd still sounded great through your own cheap signal chain?). the difference is that you may need to adopt a slower, more finicky, and more perfectionist approach to workflow (which is a good habit to be in anyway), especially with regard to ""gain-staging"", which is the art of making sure that every knob, at every stage, is set in the precise ""sweet spot"" for maximum subjective sound quality **this does not mean peaking at zero db-- forget what your manual says**. for example:  * let's say you've got one of those preamps that turns blurty and farty with di bass guitar. i'll bet good money that if you turn down the gain until the bass is peaking at -12~-18, all that blurtiness and fartiness starts to evaporate. this might mean a slightly reduced snr, and a slightly hissier/hummier track, but hiss and hum can be dealt with downstream easier than bad sound can, and there are plenty of ways to add ""growl"" and ""fatness"" with downstream effects.   * let's say that you have one of those preamps that likes to turn fast-changing ""sizzle"" (such as jangling keys or cymbals) into white-noisy hash, and that the circuit simply can't keep up with extreme high-frequency dynamics... you might need to try unconventional mike placement, for example pointing your room/""overhead"" mics at the floor, or off-axis, and then eqing downstream to compensate. there is no reason this kind of approach won't sound great, and this is one of those  rare instances where sonic maximizers/exciters can be genuinely useful in terms of restoring high-frequency harmonics that were lost to the recording process.   * let's say your preamp doesn't like big, fast dynamics, and tends to sound papery or ""flat"" on snare/kick drum... (for starters, sample-replacement opens up a world of possibilities, but let's set that aside). you'll probably to have to work harder on stuff like mic placement, possibly using more mics to capture different parts of the sound and possibly accepting inferior sounds to start with and then relying more heavily on downstream eq, compression, distortion, reverb, etc, or ""multing"" subpar tracks downstream to craft, for example, one track for snare ""smack"" and another for snare ""boom"" and then mixing to taste.  * let's say that your preamps begin to reveal a buildup of noise/graininess/unpleasantness when you get into higher track counts... the solution is to use fewer mics/channels. instead of putting (or using) top and bottom mics on every drum, see if you can get away with one or two kit/room mics and a spot on the kick and snare. for that matter, a good mono drum sound is vastly better than a bad stereo drum sound, and i guarantee it won't hurt record sales. instead of recording six tracks of backing vocals, try recording two tracks with 3 singers on one mic each. if you're of a mind that you need 4 or 6 tracks of guitar to get a ""big"" sound, try moving the mic a bit further away from the amp, or using delays (here's a hint: half the ""bigness"" of double-tracking is the illusion of increased loudness: if two guitars sound better than one, half of that is simply because it's twice as loud--try simply turning the guitar track up 3db instead laying on more tracks).  * if your preamps have a narrow ""sweet spot"" of good sound, and if you have a hard time fitting, say, a singer with poor mic technique, or an over-exuberant guitar player between the ""too quiet"" and ""too loud"" range, then set up two mics, one further back from the other, and then mix together whichever mic happens to be closest to the ""sweet spot"" of good sound.  in short, **there is a difference** with the top-flight gear, but you don't **need** it to make great records.",0,,

134588,"it sounds like you've distracted yourself from your responsibilities for awhile, and now with your xbox broken you don't have a distraction anymore. with everything building up as much as it has, it feels overwhelming to tackle everything and you're afraid of the consequences if this stuff doesn't pan out. here's what you need to do:  reflect on yourself and your situation. take some time to come to grips with where you are. i was always 165 pounds for the longest time, and at 6'1 that's pretty skinny. i tried to eat enough to gain weight, but it seemed no matter what i did i had a crazy metabolism that just wouldn't allow it. when i was 23 or 24, my metabolism slowed down and i got up to around 170-175. that was a very healthy weight and about where i wanted to be. but then i kept going, 180 wasn't too bad, but definitely a little overweight, and at my height i got just over 190. now, that's not fat, the way that you see some 300 pound people at, but i found myself always rationalizing it.  ""180 isn't that bad, i'll probably float back down."" ""185 is a little high, but i'll just be a little more careful about what i eat and it will naturally go back down."" ""190 is higher than i would like, but it's not like i'm really fat; just a little overweight.""  it wasn't until i got a little above 190 that i realized i was well on my way to 200. i did not want to break that barrier and i had a moment of clarity that i was 15+ pounds overweight. i needed to accept that and take action. the biggest part of that was accepting my position and that i needed to act on it.  that's using the weight thing as an example, but you've also got additional baggage holding you down. you haven't committed yourself 100% in your coursework, and your house is getting dirtier and dirtier. you need to accept that this is where you are and that it's not where you want to be. make a list of all the things that you're not happy with. it sounds like you've got 3 solid ones between your weight, your school, and your house. add as much as you can to that list until you have a list of everything that isn't going right or that you don't like about your life.  once you have that list, you need to act. there's a few different ways to approach this. you'll likely have a big list, and i'm sure it's overwhelming to look at all the changes you need to make. for me, i like to start with small changes. getting in shape is going to be a long process, and you're not going to see instant results. catching up on schoolwork is likely a big task that you'll only be able to make a dent in at the start. therefore, i would start with the house.  cleaning the house is a great feeling when you're done. spend a whole day working on it. put on some tunes, amp yourself up, and just become a cleaning tornado. start by picking up all the trash that can be thrown away, and take it out. just doing that has a big visible impact. if you have dishes piled up, clean those and put them away. after that, tidy up the things that are laying out that aren't garbage. find a spot for your tv remote. put your clothes in the hamper. pile books up on the book case. put your xbox games away and in order. then vacuum. whatever carpet you've got, vacuum every inch. once that's done, clean any hard floors you have. i imagine your kitchen is a hard floor, and maybe you've got others as well. spend a chunk of time dedicated to the bathroom. clean the toilet, put all your bathroom stuff in order, clean the sink, clean the floor, clean the shower. now go back to the kitchen and look around. maybe you need to clean the inside of your microwave. maybe you need to clean the inside of your oven. maybe you need to wipe down the walls and surfaces around your stove. get some cleaner and clean it up. open your fridge, your freezer, your pantry, and take inventory of any current food. ask yourself if there's anything that you've had for over a couple weeks if you actually intend to eat it or not. anything that's been in there for longer than a week or two, throw it away, organize, and clean it out.  reading all of that looks like a lot of work, but honestly if you do everything above it will probably take you 3-4 hours max. once you're done, you'll have a strong sense of accomplishment. make sure you're doing laundry throughout your day too so at a certain point you've got all your clothes cleaned, folded, hung up, and put away. make your bed. even if you never do. after you've done everything above, look around to see if there's anything left that you possibly can clean. work until you feel like there's really nothing left to do, and then you'll feel amazing. just getting your house in order is going to feel like your life is in order. this method is called the ""snowball method"". you start small, but with things that you can see immediate effects from. when you take the trash out right at the start, you'll feel good right off the bad. you'll see instant rewards from your work, and by the end of the day, you'll feel like you've accomplished a lot and your life is getting in order. when your girlfriend comes over or if she's there while you're doing it, she's going to be impressed. you'll actually look forward to her coming to see this because you'll have something to be proud of. as you work throughout the day, you'll get tired occasionally and you'll think ""i should take a break."" don't. keep working and keep plowing ahead. some people work 8 hour days working construction or lifting heavy shit all day. you can do some light cleaning for 4+ hours straight. if you need something to drink or a snack along the way, by all means, have at it. but don't even stop to eat or drink. take a moment to stop, grab the food, put it in your mouth, then keep cleaning. but don't ever stop the momentum that you create.  now, it's called the snowball effect because while you start small, you will eventually tackle bigger and bigger things.  with your house in order, and with the amount of time all of this takes, at some point you'll need to eat a meal. since you want to get in shape, the good news is that you already did your exercise for the day! you moved around a lot to do all the cleaning that was necessary. great job! without even thinking about it, you've started to make some progress towards your second goal of losing weight, exercising, and getting in shape. now, you don't want to give that right back by ordering a pizza and piling the calories back on. instead, take 30 minutes or so to research online some healthy recipes. i literally just googled ""healthy easy recipes"" and got tons of results with lists of different easy healthy recipes to make. [this seems a good place to start](http://www.foodnetwork.com/healthy/packages/healthy-every-week/quick-and-simple.html) but don't just stop with those. keep looking for more too.  since you cleaned out your fridge, you probably don't have much to eat. and if you do have anything to eat, you'll want to make sure you're not eating pizza rolls, corn dogs, or whatever garbage might have been in your pizza. find 4-5 recipes that you think look good and that look easy enough to follow. go grocery shopping and pick up the stuff for those recipes. it may only be enough for 1-2 days of food, but we need to start off small. don't make a list of recipes for the next 7-8 days or you'll get overwhelmed. just find a couple meals that you could make, and maybe even pick up enough for two portions of each so that you can try to make it a couple times.  you may not be a very good cook, so this is a chance to learn to cook with some easy recipes. the first time you make something it will probably turn out like crap, but keep working on it. you can always tweak it and learn from your mistakes. upon returning from the grocery store, cook up one of those meals and eat it. ahhh, satisfying. you get to eat a healthy meal in a clean house, after doing a decent bit of exercise. great job! now clean up the dishes (you don't want to lose the progress you just made by cleaning the house, right!?). if you clean the dishes as you go, it's never a huge chore. it takes nothing to clean a pan, a couple plates, and some silverware. it will literally take you 2-3 minutes, and then once again everything will be clean, and you'll be full, and you'll have put in a good amount of exercise. that's a good day.  at this point, relax. you've earned it. you have to beware falling into the trap of endlessly avoiding responsibilities through xbox, computer, or tv, but it's okay to take some time to kick back after you've accomplished a lot.

749113,"first of all, i'd like to extend an appreciation to all those actively involved in this sub-reddit. few things motivate me more than paging through the hall-of-fame gallery. the accomplishments chronicled here are quite impressive.  ***  now, to my story... the first picture was taken in 2009, early in my first semester as a freshman in college. i had always been a bit overweight in middle-school, but things escalated exponentially during high school. a well paying job (relatively speaking, especially for a teenager) and a car, amounted to many a trip to the local gas station on the way home from school (for a candy bar, or three of course!) or to my favorite fast-food restaurant (wendy's... foodgasmic...) for a quick burger and fries (don't forget the large vanilla frosty). when i graduated high school in 2009 i weighed in at about 300 pounds at 6'2 (i don't have my grad pictures handy, but i believe that this [**picture**](http://imgur.com/yzk9i) was taken around the same time). while i never managed to snag a girlfriend during high school (fuck, i wouldn't have dated me back then either), i was always very outgoing and fun to be around. nonetheless, i was terribly self conscious about my appearance.  the summer after graduating from high school i moved to minnesota to attend the university of minnesota. most first year students experience the dreaded ""freshman 15,"" well i experienced the ""freshman -40."" with such a large campus and classes scattered across it, i was forced to walk 1-2 hours each day (and often longer on weekends to prowl for parties). i lost about 40 pounds without much conscious effort that first year at school.  i maintained at around 260 pounds throughout the first semester of sophomore year. however towards the end of that semester, i had the most interesting realization. i thought to myself one night, ""jordan, you have better chance of being a millionaire by the age of 35 than you do actually ever being skinny."" at this point in time i was pulling a 4.0 gpa, had snagged a well paying it internship with one of the largest privately held organizations in the us, and a girlfriend that i was quickly falling in love with. i was happy... except i was missing one thing: a healthy and fit body. these thoughts and my unsightly realization (which later turned into a personal challenge), was what lead me to begin my official weight loss journey.  ***  i began counting calories and exercising on november 8th, 2010 - i weighed in at 247.40 pounds. i quickly fell in love with [http://www.caloriecount.com](http://www.caloriecount.com) to count calories and log exercise. i also thoroughly read over the [http://www.bodybuilding.com/](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/forumdisplay.php?f=16) and their weight-loss forum.  for many months i ate at 2300 calories per day, which incrementally was reduced to where i stand now at 1700 calories per day. as long as i stayed under my calories each day, i didn't care what i ate. this was one of my biggest mistakes... had i been eating enough protein, i would have been able to preserve much more muscle during the process.   my exercise routine consisted of 30 minutes on the elliptical each day, with haphazard and irregular attempts at weight lifting. while i saw some mild noob-gains in the weight room, my inconsistency and failure to stick to a solid program led me to realize little benefit from the time put into lifting heavy. this issue, coupled with inadequate amounts of protein each day, led me to quickly realize i was on my way to becoming skinny-fat. nonetheless, i was ecstatic to finally be able to look in the mirror and begin to appreciate what i was seeing as a reflection (at least while wearing clothes, heh).  i consistently lost 2.25 pounds per week on the average until the middle of may. at this point i weighed in at 200 pounds, with a goal of reaching 175 pounds by my 21st birthday in august. however, while working in the office this summer for my it internship i was presented with an assortment of opportunities to divert from the planned caloric intake for the day (i.e. free cookies, donuts, soda, ice cream, et cetera). i supplemented this diet-failure by working out for 2 hours each day (hour of cardio + hour of weight lifting). also at this point i begin taking protein shakes for breakfast, which permitted me to hit my protein targets each day (140-200 grams). while i was only ever able to get down to 190 pounds over the course of those three months, i did begin to develop some mild muscle definition.  after my internship concluded i no longer had access to the office gym, and subsequently put a hold on my diet. i ate like a king for a good two-to-three weeks and managed to balloon back up to just over 200 pounds. entering into junior year, and finally having access to a gym again, my goal is to drop down to ~175 by january 1st, 2012. i'm also on my second week of the the stronglifts 5x5 program, and hope to progress through it's first cycle within this time frame. once i reach ~175 i will reevaluate what i wish to do next, with the likely options of dropping another 5-10 pounds or beginning a slow, clean bulk.  out of all of this, i'd like to impress upon you guys the importance of a solid strength training program and the consumption of adequate protein amounts. without these two elements, you may end up skinny but still dislike the way in which your body looks without clothes. if i had been cognizant of protein intake and put the effort into strength training the way i am now, i'd be in a much better place.  ***  **tl;dr: fat, ugly college freshman realizes he is missing but one thing in life - proceeds to get attractive and skinny by junior year**",1,-1,1

775487,"sorry to hear that your am treated you like this and op, because same for me. it doesn't matter what they want regarding our looks, so long as we're healthy, because what really does matter about what we think about ourselves is our own opinion. still, though, we can't help but be insulted by them, anyway. i honestly suspect that ams who claim that ""chubby is pretty"" want us to be overweight on purpose so *they* (the ams) would look better in comparison and thus feel better about themselves. they expect us to be their trophies, yet at the same time, we're also competition for them. it's a mixed-message, like ""do well to make me look good, but not too well, or you'll outshine me"" sort of thing.  tmi tl;dr  i'm also on the shorter side, too (like everyone else in my family), so definitely relate to the part about the slightest weight gain looking like a lot. when i was 6, i remember my am complaining about me weighing 45 pounds, which is actually how much i was *supposed* to weigh at my age and height at the time, but she thought i was ""too skinny"" and wanted me to gain some weight. she also wanted me to be tall, too, but since she knows nothing about nutrition nor how genetics works, she let me choose whatever i wanted to eat for supper and didn't care about portion control. out of all the things she didn't give me any say about, the only thing she really should have chosen was food, because, being kids, *obviously* we would choose to stuff our face with junk. i don't actually *remember* having a food addiction as a kid, but i certainly must've had *some* unhealthy relationship with food because my weight blew up from around 50 lbs to 80+ lbs when i was 7 (which is also the age where kids generally develop their own identity separate from our parents and therefore the age where our aps begin giving us a harder time, which made me suspect that i probably ate my feelings every time she stressed me out -which was pretty much all. the. darn. time).  my sister never had a weight problem, despite her claims of having been a ""fat"" teenager (*her* highest weight ever was only 124 lbs, at 163 cm/5'4""! now her weight is only around 108 or 110 but she's all lean muscle. i'm also only 5'4"" --though 1cm shorter for anyone using the metric system, which makes me mad because she's younger --but i was 2 inches shorter and a few pounds heavier than i am now when i was a teenager with my sister, then 5'3"", still being taller than me back then, which everyone had to point out and laugh at me about, so i wish that *my* highest weight ever was a measly 124 lbs. while i was never actually obese, or even *too* overweight for that matter, my highest weight ever was definitely a *lot* higher than hers), with her even becoming a health nut/fitness junkie as an adult, while i'm a food addict and yo-yo dieter who definitely struggled with my weight almost my whole life -we have the pictures to prove it, too. i remember gaining 10 to 15 lbs on average every year (had i continued that pattern, my weight would've been around the 330s right now. *five* pounds is hard enough to lose the way it is, so i can't imagine needing to lose *that* amount!), but my am never showed any concern about my health, much less my self-esteem, only that she thought letting me eat all that food would make me grow. well, i may have been one of the heaviest kids in my class, but i was still clearly one of the shortest. obviously, whatever i was doing wasn't working! but no. my am thought that satisfying one's appetite meant the same thing as getting our nutrition. yeah, i was growing, all right -sideways.   i hated the way i looked growing up (especially considering that i grew up in the 90s, when straight blond hair/big blue eyes and being tall and stick-thin was the beauty standard). i was short and fat with beady eyes and a horrible perm that only served to accentuate the roundness of my face. to put it nicely, i was a very dopey-looking kid, and always got made fun of for my appearance and weight. adults chimed in, too, especially when my sister was around; i remember one nasty old hag (a neighbor/friend of our grandma's) who came over to visit cooing over what a ""cute"" and ""pretty little girl"" my sister was but when she asked to see the other grandchild (me), the first thing that came out of her loud mouth when i walked in the room was, ""look how *fat* you are,"" in front of everybody, and called me ""the big one"" of us (okay, so age-wise, too, but i *hated* the pun), which got my stupid sister laughing. (yeah, not like that obese old woman was a supermodel herself, which i shot back, but was yelled at by the adults, who didn't stick up for me, for being ""disrespectful""). as if my self-esteem hadn't suffered enough already! even a checkup to our pediatrician was humiliating because she pointed out that my sister was nice and thin while i was short for my age and overweight, and voiced concern to our parents to watch my eating habits so that i don't develop health issues later on.   now, how was the way i looked ""attractive"" in any way? even though i wanted very badly to lose weight, instead of exercising, being humiliated only made me turn to food more and thus gain more, instead, and, since my am herself wanted to *gain* weight, there was no way she was going to replace the junk with healthier food choices or at least teach me portion control, even when it meant my health was at stake (she just yelled at me ""just don't eat it, then!"" impossible for a glutton to resist when surrounded by temptations, plus i was a child then and had no willpower, so no, there was no ""just don't eat it, then""). i complained about it to my am (begged her to sign me up for gymnastics for *years* to lose weight), but all she said was ""chubby is cute, skinny is ugly"" (although i don't recall her actually ever *calling* me ""cute""). yeah, well in the west, ""chubby"" means fat, and fat is ugly. plus, she probably liked that being fat made me look much older (""mature"") than i was even before puberty hit (which being fat caused to come at an earlier age --12 in my case, when i was *far* from ready for it), since it embarrassed her over how short i was --because she didn't want people to think i was younger --and she wanted me to look like a ""proper young woman,"" not a little girl like my sister always looked and still kind of does at almost-32. (also, i *hated* looking older as a fat kid/teenager, because that made everybody who didn't know me assume that there was this big age gap between my sister and me --we're only 18 months apart --so when we would argue as siblings do, *i* would be the one chastised about my ""childish"" behavior by people who didn't know me, telling me to ""grow up"" and act ""my age,"" which was like 11 but they probably thought was more along the lines of 18, and to stop picking on my ""little"" sister, even if *she* were the one picking on me).  my am only wanted me to look grown up because she's small and hates how her body type is; she's always thought she was ""skinny"" and so *hates* that, but she's not at all skinny, she's average for her height (158 cm/5'2 1/2""). she's just petite, and so are we. aps generally seem to have no clue how genetics works.  i'd always wanted a svelte, boyish figure just to spite her, as well as to feel more like myself (i have gender dysphoria, which made puberty a nightmare journey) and stop her comments about my ""curves."" fat was ugly in other kids, but when she made bad comments about some mildly-fat kid's fat, my body shape looked exactly like that, only nobody could tell because i wore baggy, shapeless sweats since the age of 12 in order to hide my shape. i struggled constantly with weight and yo-yo dieting all throughout my teens and 20s because of my am. now that i'm out of my 20s, i miraculously lost my ""chub,"" which was probably residual baby fat, since i haven't really been working out much after 30 yet was never able to lose in my 20s no matter how much i worked out, so now i'm getting criticized for being ""too bony."" (unlike my am, i'm fine-boned, so of course i would look thinner in comparison). yeah, well, i'm finally okay with my weight for once.",1,-2,-1
303873,"my feeling is that, since you've already brought up the idea of handing out bonuses to your team and the idea has been shot down, probably you shouldn't hand out *anything.* take them out to dinner or something, but gift baskets/visa cards/etc. should be considered off-limits. word of that will *undoubtedly* spread around the company, in a manner thus: ""beefpancake's team got a $1000 bonus and we didn't get shit....the fuck."" everyone who didn't do the same thing for their people will look like an asshole and be pissed at you for it, plus the owners will be pissed that you did something they already told you not to do.  be smart. do dinner at *the most.* if you really want to do bonuses, hold back the amount of money you *would have given* to each employee in a savings account, and then give it to them if/when they leave the company. over a few years this could amount to a few thousand bucks per employee, right? they'll appreciate that a lot, especially if they are moving or whatever.",0,,
502644,"#18 should i perform a bulk, cut, or recomp? -  what are you goals and what is your time frame? are you a teenager? who do you want to look like?   there are many questions that need to be answered to know which is right.    if you are overweight, you should cut.   if you are skinny fat and want to get ripped, you could either cut and look like a stick, body recomp and slowly transform yourself, or lean mass to get muscle before doing a straight cut.    if you a teenager...your body (unless very overweight/obese) is likely a raging furnace of potential. thus, teenagers considering leangains should eat as clean as they possibly can while lean massing at the *bare minimum*, ideally weight gain. watch even a slightly overweight body absolutely revolutionize itself in no time.  #19 should i have 2 or 3 or 19 meals a day? -  [your metabolism is not really affected by the number of times you eat in a day](http://examine.com/faq/do-i-need-to-eat-six-times-a-day-to-keep-my-metabolism-high.html).   you have a window of eating (for most people, 8 hours). get your calories in then. what matters is the overall amount of calories (based on maintenance) and macros (more carbs on workout days, more fat on non-workout, high protein all days).  #20 but you still haven't told me the exact macros! -  see important resources - this question is answered through use of ifcalc.  #21 what about meal timing within my feeding window? -  it is recommended that a majority of your calories, 60%, should be consumed post workout (post workout refers to the feeding period after your workout, not within 30 minutes). if you cannot or prefer not to train fasted, or if your schedule can't meet that recommendation, don't sweat it. you will still get results as long as you stick to your feeding window.  #22 but i'm keto -  carbs are an essential part of efficient muscle building because they supply glycogen, a primary fuel source for muscle. starchy carbs are great for building muscle. [read what lyle mcdonald says about that](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/how-we-get-fat.html). carbs *can* make you fat ... if you overfeed on carbs chronically (we are talking about 700g+ a day for many days).   if you insist on being keto, that is fine! just head over to /r/fitness and /r/keto for the best advice.   #23 can i do cardio? -  as martin says, ""strength is strength. cardio is cardio. don't mix, keep them separate, and use cardio sparingly on a diet if your primary goal is strength and muscle gain. "" moderate-high intensity cardio while also lifting heavy weights is a form of fuckarounditis (see [number 6](http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html)...number 14 is also hilarious). martin is explicitly against doing intense cardio , saying that the anabolic reaction of lifting **heavy** weights is dented by the catabolic response to extended/intense cardio.   martin also believes that for maximal fat loss, **heavy** weights + rest = success. if you want to throw in some conditioning, then do it on your off days.   if conditioning is important to you, then do it. if you are focusing on fat loss, martin recommends sticking to **heavy** weights.   at the same time, low impact steady state (liss) cardio should be ok - aka walking. do it before you break your fast for marginal fat burning benefits.  #24 can i adjust the hours of the fasting-feeding cycle in if? -  yes. see martin's post on variations [here](http://www.leangains.com/2008/06/brief-primer-on-popular-approaches-to.html).  #25 should i drink protein shakes? -  as discussed in ""maintaining low body fat,"" it is recommended that you chew your calories, not drink them.   that said, some skinnier folks or those who have trouble eating enough are welcome to drink calories if it is what you have to do to get the required calories for the day. this is meant to be something you can do long term. as always, don't sweat this small stuff.   if you find that you are overeating, start chewing more calories! also, high-fiber foods are excellent for satiety.  #26 i am really sore! -  what kind of soreness? is it immediate or develop overnight? are we talking muscle soreness or joint pain? if you are new to any movements in your training program and the soreness is delayed, you likely have [doms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delayed_onset_muscle_soreness). this goes away after your body gets used to the movement -- further, the lack thereof later on makes some idiots think that they can work out the day after a killer lift day and think it won't hinder progress. wrong.   if you have joint pain, ensure you are stretching properly post workout, using a foam roller, or ideally consult your doctor, trainer, or physical therapist.  #27 any other supplements i should take?   martin has [a post on supplements he likes](http://www.leangains.com/2010/01/supplements-you-might-actually-find_09.html)   more info on them via [examine.com](http://examine.com/):   * [fish oil](http://examine.com/supplements/fish+oil/)  * [vitamin d](http://examine.com/supplements/vitamin+d/)  * [caffeine](http://examine.com/supplements/caffeine/)  * [bcaas](http://examine.com/supplements/branched+chain+amino+acids/)  * [creatine](http://examine.com/supplements/creatine/)  * [beta-alanine](http://examine.com/supplements/beta-alanine/)  * [whey protein](http://examine.com/supplements/whey+protein/)  * [yohimbine](http://examine.com/supplements/yohimbine/)  * [l-tyrosine](http://examine.com/supplements/l-tyrosine/)  * [jack3d](http://examine.com/supplements/jack3d/)  #28 i can't seem to get rid of the stubborn fat -  see [this post on losing stubborn body fat](http://www.leangains.com/2010/06/intermittent-fasting-and-stubborn-body.html).

198341,"the pizza analogy is quite misleading. the reason a pizza flattens out is because you're applying centripetal force away from a single axis, i.e., the axis you're spinning the pizza around. because the dough's volume cannot change, it has to get thinner as it gets pulled outward.  contrast this with dust particles. the volume of the dust cloud isn't fixed, so if you spun it like pizza dough, you'd expect the cloud to stretch away from the axis, but not get thinner.  if a large number of particles start out with completely random orbits, then you're absolutely right... the total angular momentum of the system should be close to zero, and that can't change. so as the cloud coalesces, it will just form a big star with no spin.  however, let's consider a system with a small angular momentum. this doesn't mean all the particles are moving the same way--just that there are ""more"" of them moving one way than the other.  as the system evolves, some of these particles will collide. specifically, this type of collision is called an [inelastic collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inelastic_collision). basically, this is the kind of collision you'd get if you threw two blobs of dough together, as opposed to the kind you get when you throw two billiard balls together.  when one lump of dirt collides with another, they will tend to stick together and form a larger lump of dirt whose angular momentum is the sum of the two parts that collided. that's the key part, so i'm going to belabor the point a bit here:  suppose we have 10 random people. some of them are heavier, and some are lighter. now split them randomly into two groups. my question is this: how do you think the total weight of each group will compare? well, there are only 5 people in each group. there's a reasonable chance that you got more heavy people in one group than the other. so, you expect them to weigh roughly the same, but one group might average 20 pounds more than the other.  now take ten million people, and do the same thing. as it turns out, you can expect the difference in *average* weight between the two groups to be much smaller--a thousand times smaller in fact. that is, if take the total weight of the people in each group, and divide by the number of people, you can expect a difference of 0.02 pounds between those two numbers.  why is this important? because when you put a lot of random things together, they look shockingly uniform. the same thing happens with our protoplanetary system. as the dust particles lump together into bigger and bigger blobs, we expect the average angular momentum of the particles in each blob to get closer and closer to that of other blobs. this is just another way of saying that we expect the planets to be moving with almost the same motion.  i couldn't find quite the animation i was hoping for, but i think [this animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9t8g8gok0g) might help you visualize what i've just said. notice that the particles seem to be moving in many different directions at first. in this case, none are actually moving against the grain, but still there's quite a lot of variation. as the system evolves, you see the blobs start to move in lockstep. this is a direct result of the kind of averaging i mentioned above.",0,,

560410,"your not ugly.  however you have several issues.  slim build, wide bridge nose, beard scruffy,  hooded eyes,  clothing,   you have a slim build this isn't nesseccerly unattractive but isn't considered to be conventionally the most pleasing male form. regular excersize focusing on your back and shoulders like swimming, rowing or rock climbing will help to build muscle on your upper body. try eating a lot more food with a higher fat content to add some weight around your face. although you have a nice square jaw your slim build makes you look a tad boney and sunken in places. dont go mad but about 5lbs of muscle and 5lbs of fat would make a massive difference.  this would also smooth the bridge of your nose and fill out your hooded eyes wich would make your eyes look less sunken/hooded and bring the contour of your cheek bones up which would soften the bridge of your nose and would help you to lose the broader look it currently somewhat has. this is a very minor tweak that you will find improves your face and proportion a huge amount.  the beard i'm afraid is only coming in around your jaw. until it comes further up your cheeks you should stay clean shaven.   you have a heavy defined jaw which women like and men want but its further exaggerated by the beard only being on the jaw line. it's making your face look bottom heavy, scruffy and your jaw look bulky rather then defined .   clothing.  the shirt isn't a good fit for you the neck is to wide, and the fabric is to loose and thin.  if you have a slim build try heavier fabrics, waffle knits, wool knits, thicker polos.  a mistake many people with a slimmer frame make is to try and wear oversized clothes to make them look bigger however it swamps them and can make you smaller next to the to big openings in the sleeve and neck. jean wise go for a straight-slim fit stay away from skinny jean's and wide leg. a skinny will do to much to show off a slim build and make you look very skinny and a wide leg will swamp you.  go for darker colour denims as lighter colours will draw attention to your limbs. avoid very light or bright colours  as you have a paler skin tone with red undertones.  bright reds, greens, and yellows will wash you out.  try for warm secondary colours or dark shades.  a deep red, dark blue, dark green, greys, blues, plum/wine colour, browns and warmer oatmeal colours instead of white will look best and stop and stark contrasts against your skin tone.   if you want to go really metro and get detailed and polished then read below.   your hair looks best shorter in the last pictures product and wax would look good avoid hairspray, harsh shiney gels or crispy product. the shorter sides are nice but you can afford up to an inch in length on top.   you can also go for an eyebrow tint and shape. angular masculin features are considered the most conventionally attractive at the moment so going for an slight eyebrow tint will make them look thicker and a shape will give them a more angular look that will define the angles of your face.  if you go for the tint and wax ensure you go to a salon or beauty therapist who works on men often or has a large male client list. you dont want to end up with a skinny over ached feminine brow. however definition, thickening and a shape can work wonders to draw attention the eyes wich will make almost anyone look more attractive. you have light hair so avoid black, ask for a dark blonde or very light brown to bring them out without making them stand out.",1,0,-1
474082,"agreed on warning signs.  and i was one of those ""troubled smart kids"" in my youth.  for all i can be certain, i was but a few bullying-instances from snapping.  the better angels of my conscience won a long-fought battle that lasted years, culminating in an anxiety-filled breakdown a few years back.  i scarcely recognize some of the thought-patterns that i still remember as being from the same person.  i didn't express any of this -- wasn't a goth, didn't keep a journal, didn't act out.  i was just an outcast, kept it all to myself, and i might've been locked away if i was ever truly open about the dissociative rage i had for the world.  kids that permanently dwell on the negative aren't just ""in a phase"" -- it's a defensive response to an unkind world, and it reeks of adjustment disorder.  your daughter is grossly in need of someone to listen to her inner-most thoughts.  it probably isn't going to be you, so i'd suggest finding a therapist she's comfortable talking to.  avoid medication like it's aids; more than likely it's not actually necessary and it obfuscates true mental clarity and replaces it with premature enlightenment (""i'm all better now!"" but not really).  it will take a lot of time to get to the bottom of it all, but you owe your daughter the effort.  you're lying to yourself and doing the world a disservice to attribute morbid, detailed fantasies as simply an expression of teenage angst.",0,,

223299,"you know, speaking as a fatty, fat people aren't fat out of ignorance, they're not fat because they don't know that fast food is bad for them, they're not fat because they don't know how to cook, and they're not fat because those tricksy corn growers just keep smuggling hfcs into everything.  **fat people are fat because they have decided that being fat and eating delicious, terrible food is more attractive to them than eating healthily and losing weight**.  that's it.  it's really that simple.  oh, there are other excuses, like ""i'm just an *emotional eater*, and i'm stressed out all the time!"", or maybe ""it's just too hard to lose weight when you're already fat, woe, woe is me.""  but when it comes right down to it, being fat - or being thin, for that matter - is a **choice**.  it's a choice that all of us, fat or thin, make dozens of times every day.  do i take the elevator, or the stairs?  do i want some oatmeal and fruit for breakfast, or am i going to stop at mcdonald's for a sausage and egg mcfuckwich?  when i get home tonight, am i going to go to the gym, or sit down at the computer and play video games?  when i'm out grocery shopping, am i going to buy frozen pizzas and taquitos, or fresh asparagus and chicken?  those individual choices we make tilt the scale - literally and figuratively - in the direction of us being fat or thin.  the more choices we make in one direction, the easier it is to keep making that type of choice.  so yeah, maybe if you've been loading up on taquitos and playing video games for the past twenty years, like i have, choosing to take six flights of stairs instead of the elevator just stops becoming a viable option - the choice is taken away from you.  but even then, there are still positive choices that you *can* make.  fat people know they're fat.  fat people know why they're fat.  basic thermodynamics are not any sort of great mystery.  fat people also know that other people will judge them because of their weight.  they know how shaming it is to have to shop at the fat girl (or big and tall) stores, they know how much they hate looking in the mirror when they try on clothes, they may even tell themselves ""god, i hate being fat, i wish i could do something about the disgusting sack of meat that is my body.""  but all the shame and self-loathing and external negative reinforcement in the world won't matter, until they start making the **choice** to take care of themselves.  and for many of them, that choice is never made.  they keep rationalizing and justifying and deciding, every day, that they would rather eat cheesecake *now* than be 10 pounds lighter next month.  and you know what?  i understand that choice.  it's a choice i made myself, for years.  i was a skinny, active kid who ate like a horse during childhood, then as soon as puberty hit, i started packing on the pounds.  the added weight made it harder for me to be active, so i started choosing sedentary activities, then i slouched comfortably into the trap of ""well, i'm *already* fat, i might as well eat my cake and have more, too.""  i found a boyfriend who loved me in spite of my weight, i had a lifestyle that permitted me to be as fat and slothful as i wanted.  i ate delicious food, and lots of it, and i loved doing it.  i could easily have spent the rest of my life like that: fat, largely self-content, somewhat prone to embarrassment and shame when i had to buy new clothes, but happy to be enjoying the short-term pleasures of fatty, sugary foods.  my parents telling me that they were worried about my weight didn't make me change my choices.  even my boyfriend's gentle nudging didn't do it.  i wasn't educated about wise food choices by a benevolent friend, no angel descended on a shaft of light and spoke unto me, saying ""tabo, lose thee some weight, sister, or you're gonna get the diabeetus.""  i just made a **choice**, about six weeks ago, to stop being a disgusting, self-indulgent fatty fat-fat.  i decided that my long-term health and happiness meant more to me than the transitory pleasures of cheese fries and pecan pie.  i decided that i would rather be able to bike and hike and swim and be active again a year from now than spend that year eating frozen custard and pasta and chocolate cake.  don't get me wrong, i love those things... but at the end of the day, i would trade them for physical fitness in a heartbeat.  it took me more than fifteen years to gain this weight, starting from puberty.  i know it's not going to disappear overnight.  i know that i will spend the next two or three years of my life depriving myself of foods that i love, and that even when i reach my target weight, i will never be able to enjoy them the way that i did.  but this is a choice i am making, for myself, and i'm determined to keep making it for the rest of my life.  i've lost more than 20 pounds so far, and while there have been weeks when i've stalled or even added a pound or two, i'm not letting that discourage me or dissuade me from my choice.  so please: don't tell me that obesity can be cured through education.  don't try to argue that fat people just don't know enough about healthy food.  we're not idiots, we *know* that a small leaf lettuce salad with olive oil and a bit of vinegar is a better snack for us than a mars bar.  we're *choosing* the mars bar, because that's what we want to do.",1,-2,0

205899,"you need to call your ahj and ask this. the us covers was too many different climate zones, homes built in montana are built very differently from homes built in texas.  states further north will have basements dug into the ground where possible, becsuse water and sewer services need to be that much lower to get below the frost line in winter. most homes further south don't have basements, most are either slab on grade, or done with a crawl space that is a few feet tall with the home built on top of that.  homes further north will have insulation and a vapor barrier installed on the exterior walls. the vapor barrier is needed because when cool air from outside hits the warm air from inside, you get condensation. that isn't a problem when it is warmer outside than it is inside, and only by a matter of 10-20Â°f. water doesn't condesnt when it's 70Â° inside your house and 90Â° outside. it does condense when it is 20Â° outside and 70Â° inside. if you go further south, vapor barriers are not common. paper backed r12 insulation, drywall, and done.  if you're further south, plumbing snd hvac get installed in exterior walls and attic spaces. that is something that would never get done in a state further north where it freezes regularly during the winter.  so you can't just ask ""do i need to do gasketed boxes in exterior walls?"" and get a straight answer.",0,,

""more like you've witched him into straying!"" father paidrig retorted.  ""the lord knows, there's something unnatural about you.""  no one in the village knew for certain how old granny bedrock was.  she also had a curiously stocky build and a heavy brow-ridge on an otherwise remarkably rounded face, leading to speculation that she was part troll.  ""if you believed your own gospel, you'd know you've nothing to fear from witchcraft!"" granny bedrock snapped back, stamping her cane again.  ""is it not written, 'to as many as received him, to them he gave the **power** to be called the sons of god'?  and again it says, 'rejoice not that the demons are subject to you, but rather that your names are written in heaven'--as if the former should be regarded as a trivial thing.  where the word has come, the evil one's power has been bound!""  ""three-score and ten, or by reason of strength, four-score--how is it that you were old when my grandfather was young?"" father paidrig demanded.  ""wrote moses who lived to be an hundred and twenty!"" granny bedrock returned.  ""is it not the lord in whose hand is the breath of every living thing, to prolong or shorten our years as he sees fit?  nine hundred years those who lived before the deluge might see--""  ""how can you stand here arguing theology while my child is missing?"" mistress harrow demanded of the village's priest and witch-ward.  ""i know what fearful thing lives in the black forest,"" granny bedrock answered calmly.  ""untamed because the dread of man lies too heavy on it to seek the warmth of our fires as the wolf and the lesser wildcat once did, but bearing no malice.  your son did not return in tears at sunset, so it is likely that he will return in the morning, with the blood that makes a hero in his veins.""  ""you'd best hope he returns,"" father paidrig said darkly, and the argument resumed.  &amp;#x200b;  \----------------------------  &amp;#x200b;  the boy pounded down the game trail, not caring that a path that wide and that low was likely to have been made by a feral hog rather than some naturally wild creature.  wolf or wild boar, will reasoned, would only tear his flesh and not his heart.  darkness came early in the wild woods, the sunlight that leaked between the mountains baffled by the forest canopy.  will tripped and fell in the fading light.  when he picked himself up, he went on at a much less headlong pace.  as the light continued to fade, will stumbled more and more often.  at last he fetched up against a massive oak tree, and decided it was as good a place as any to rest.  for a time it seemed as though the boy had judged correctly, but when a sliver of moonlight found its way to the earth in front of him, he heard a creaking groan as of a thick tree in a heavy wind.  then he felt the earth beneath him stir as the tree he was leaning against began to uproot itself.  will scrambled away from the tree and spun to face it.  he knew he had no hope of successful flight in the darkness; he could only pray and face the unknown threat.  ""i've naught to fear from death, and i'm not so desperate as to make a pact with the devil,"" he warned.  ""no devil i,"" the tree-spirit answered.  ""tis only adam's curse i suffer from.  and though i feed on fear, i don't seek to cause it.  what comes in the ordinary course of nature is sufficient for my needs.  ""it's fear i feed on; despair is useless to me.  how does a child come to think death better than life?""  will hesitated, but something in the tree-spirit's voice sounded sympathetic to him.  all his pent-up frustration came spilling out.  ""my brother blames me for the things he breaks, and my father believes him without even hearing my side.  my cousins use me to practice their fist-work, and my mother assumes i provoked them.  the merchant's boys steal my slate and break my chalk, and father paidrig calls me a liar when i ask for redress.  the one adult willing to listen to me, everyone else calls a witch!""  ""not witch, but witch-ward,"" the tree-spirit said.  ""until the coming of a better ward.  paidrig would do well to consider that without her labor, there would have been no one left in this land for his grandfather to preach the gospel to.""  his branches wilted slightly as he continued, ""injustice is a hard thing to bear.  did it never tempt you to think that if you were going to be blamed anyway, you might as well have the fun of the doing?""  will shook his head.  ""god sees all, even if men do not.  i trust that the god of truth will not allow slander to stand forever.""  ""and is this what keeps you from defending yourself against those who would rob you?"" the tree-spirit asked.  ""no,"" will answered.  ""i'm too small and too weak to fight back effectively.  and not likely to get any stronger if the boys keep stealing my lunch and my parents sending me to bed without supper.""  ""ah, i am being a poor host,"" the tree-spirit said.  ""i have fruit if you are hungry.  it is not precisely natural, but there is no harm in it.""  will's stomach answered for him, and he said, ""god bless you if you speak truly and curse you if you lie.""  ""wisely spoken,"" the tree-spirit said with a rustling laugh.  then he dipped a branch toward will so that the boy could take some of the fruit.  will took one of the fruits and bit into it.  he found it thin-skinned and juicy, but with an oddly meaty flavor.  ""is there a limit?"" he asked just before he finished the last bite.  ""eat until you are filled,"" the tree-spirit assured him.  will obeyed, and felt a new strength flooding into both his body and his will.  he finished eating just in time to hear the snuffling of a pig nearby.  with life once more seeming worth the living, he felt a surge of fear at the sound.  ""if you wish,"" the tree-spirit said, ""you can seek shelter in my branches until morning.  but there is strength gained in facing ones fears.  do you know the secret to killing a boar alone?""  ""ground your spear against something solid, and keep it steady so that he impales himself when he charges,"" will answered.  ""but it takes a much larger and heavier spear than most, with a crossbar to keep the boar from climbing the shaft to avenge himself.  there's only one in the village, that i know of--and it does me no good here.""  ""that i can provide,"" the tree-spirit said.  ""though a spear that can only be used once, since i can only make my wood so hard.  what will you?""  ""if i don't fight the boar,"" will said, ""i'll have to fight the bullies, and i'm likely to be blamed for it still.  no one can fault me for slaying a beast that threatens anyone who crosses its path, however.""  there was a sharp crack and a massive branch dropped next to will.  he took it up and found it to be more than twice as long as he was tall and perfectly straight.  about halfway down its length it forked with a pair of stout but short side branches that curved slightly toward the pointed end of the main branch.  ""brace it against my trunk,"" the tree-spirit said.  ""here, i'll make a socket for you.""  will readied his spear, and the tree-spirit told him, ""you'll need the point a bit lower than that.  there now.  courage is all!""",0,,

630968,"this is my updated analysis of this epic throwdown scenario.  **15th**: **ash lake and the great hollow** have some potential, but it lacks firepower outside of the hydra, large mushrooms and clams.  basically, it's got the same issue as the painted world.  not mobile enough, too easy to kill. might get some enemies with curse, little mushrooms are negligible.  a few straggling giant mushrooms could cause this army to last longer, but they wouldnâ€™t be competitors.  it's lack of npc's really prevents it from having that specialized, elite unit that can push it over the hump to move up a slot.  **14th**: **the painted world**'s victories would prove costly, with most of its military comprised of lightweight, high damage dealing fighters.  the phalanx, though durable, is it extremely immobile.  it would probably become less effective when the lighter soldiers were downed after the first stages of the fight.  jeremiah, priscilla and the tower knight wouldnâ€™t be able to withstand an assault by almost any of the other armies.  **13th**: **northern undead asylum** has great strength, but when put up against all of the remaining armies, it becomes clear that 25 zombies don't stand up to other infantries.  the demons can put a dent in the other armies, but ultimately they don't stack up well to the numbers game.   oscar and the black knights could take this unit farther, but iâ€™m not sure if they have enough to get past darkroot forest or havel, andre, solaire, and a buttload of baldur knights.  **12th**:   **blighttown and the depths** will be able to last this long thanks to its enormous numbers.  that said, once it's damage dealers like quelaag, quelana and the gaping dragon are taken down, then it has little chance to beat more well-rounded armies.  ultimately, you'll be left with a few mosquitos buzzing about that most people don't even notice.  the barbarians are susceptible to backstabs, speed, and ranged attacks, all of which are plentiful in the more balanced armies.  itâ€™s possible this force could take down gwynâ€™s army, or greatly reduce its numbers, should the poison and toxic effects come into play.  these guys have a chance to play spoiler to one of the better armies.  **11th**:  **darkroot** has some glaring weaknesses.  it's basic infantry, the ents, can easily succumb to fire.  the defenders are strong, but they all rely solely on one healer to keep them alive in battle.  the giant cats and sif are the only other truely formidable battlefield units, as they are fast and powerful, but would likely be brought down over time.  it's possible sif and the hydra could push them up to 10th if the forest hunters work together as an elite, tight knit unit.   **10th**: **undead burg and parish** would fall after losing most of their infantry at this point in the battle.  as the weaker armies are defeated, the hollow's lines will have thinned drastically.  the stronger units with the backing of the channeler could take this group farther, but i expect this group to come down to andre, havel and the wyrvn vs. the world in the end.  havel would probably go after seath, due to their rivalry.  if he can take him down early, this group could move up to fifth place.  unfortunately, the sheer physical weakness of their standard infantry makes me think that these guys could get knocked out even earlier.   **9th**: **oolacile township** has a shot at going farther in this fight, but i donâ€™t see its basic infantry holding up against something like anor londo, who has divine and lightning weaponry.  manus, with incredible power, offers a chance for these guys to move up a few slots, but i donâ€™t know if heâ€™d be able to take down the bed of chaos.    **8th**:  **sen's fortress** is next.  i like the man-serpant's chances, but with lesser numbers, the entire force will be far too reliant on tarkus and the iron golem at this stage of the melee.  the giants are slow and would be fodder for any armyâ€™s elite units, ricard doesnâ€™t have much going for him, and all around this army is to defensively focused to really push its boundaries.  it could hold out longer, but it would eventually cave in to any larger armyâ€™s siege.  honestly, the kiln would probably be able to sweep the floor with this entire force without much trouble.  theyâ€™re just too slow.  **7th**:  **new londo** could fall earlier or later, but it depends on how effective the four kings are.  the darkwraiths and ingward are strong, but the sludges and ghosts would be too slow to keep up in battle.  this inability to keep up would expose the darkwraiths, who will likely run ahead in order to pushing the boundary of their territory.  spread thin, both of these segments of the military would be divided and conquered, leaving only the four kings to fight.  that said, they could still put up an excellent fight on their own.  i believe most of the armies ahead of new londo on the list would have units capable of one-shotting the ghosts and banshees, while the wisps will probably be long gone by the time the war is down to this point.  the drakes and darkwraiths will certainly keep them in the fight, but i think they wouldn't be able to withstand the cursing abilities of seath, lost izalith's brute force, or the catacombs regenerative skeletons.  **6th**:  at this point it's a crap shoot. **duke's archive and crystal cave** seems a possible next option. much like sen's fortress, the duke's chances widdle out as it's hollows and pisacas get taken down by other army's power units.  seath has a chance to put the hurt on any army, which is exactly why havel would have taken him down early on to cripple the army's chances against the numerically superior burg/parrish.  golems and crystal knight, combined with channelerâ€™s buffs, should have no trouble copying the same fighting force that gwynâ€™s unit utilizes.  the only problem there would be the low overall defense and health of the channelers and archers, who, once defeated, would leave this army exposed at range.  **5th**:  **catacombs and tomb of the giants** will have to deal with two of its largest weaknesses.  the divinity of anor londo's knights, and the fire from demon ruins and lost izalith.  after an epic clash, nito would lose to caeseless discharge.  with his downfall, the skeleton army could be easily dispatched.  itâ€™s main issue is that all of its units fight in a similar way:  charge into battle and rely heavily one offensive powers.  it has little variance in speed or defense, with every unit weak to divine weaponry.  nevertheless, the power of the dogs and wheel skeletons could cut through the demon ruins group, bumping them up a couple of slots.  it also faces a heavy opposition in the form of the royal wood.  while it would be effective at taking down the scarecrows, artorias, gough, cieran and kalameet all present a serious challenge to this otherwise one dimensional fighting force.  **4th**:  **demon ruins and lost izalith** would take fourth.  the demons would prove to be a formidable army, but with 20 silver knights, 8 giants and gwyndolin, the struggle for dominance would be intense.  the bed of chaos proves to be a tricky foe, but with coordination, the agile painting guardians could take it down quickly.  the rest of the fight comes down to whether or not the taurus and capra demons can stand up to anor londo's giants while being barraged by dragonslayer arrows.  also, the dragon legs would destroy themselves before doing any effective damage to another army.  they have a massive, powerful army, but i want to give the benefit of the doubt to gwynâ€™s elite force of demon slaying knights in the kiln.  **3rd**: **the kiln** was the first one out in my last prediction, but upon further contemplation i think it would actually be one of the most successful.  i think it was george washington that said heâ€™d prefer a small, elite fighting force over a large disorganized one, and thatâ€™s exactly what this is.  if gwyn and the knights can stay together, they could easily take down anything in the game through pure brute force.  although this would require being concentrated, they are a highly mobile, offensive unit with enough defense to withstand a good bit of damage.  the only weakness i see for them would be fighting the occult forces of the catacombs and tomb of the giants, which might set them back a couple of slots.   as i said earlier, the problem with this military force is that once it loses two or three of its soldiers, itâ€™s power is greatly reduced.  blighttown and the depths might whittle its numbers down to ineffective numbers.  **2nd**: **the royal wood** stands an excellent shot at being the best army.  i think weâ€™re discounting a few extra characters in their military, including gough, cieran, elizabeth, and sanctuary guardian.  kalameet and the sanctuary guardians alone are deadly tanks that will be able to cut through practically every other force.  his big weakness will be handling the silver archers from anor londo who specialize in dragonslaying.  ornstein and smough versus artorias and gough would be such a great battle, but i think smough would wipe the floor with gough.  cieran, chester and the stone knights make a strong, balanced fighting force, and the scarecrow infantry provide enough speed to prevent other armies ranged units from taking down the stone knights too early.  **1st**:  i still have to give the greatest advantage to **anor londo**.  divine weaponry, lightning damage, a teleporting, magical deity with a crossbow, wrath of god dropping giants, and ornstein and smough make anor londo an incredibly well balanced military.  the darkmoon knightess, baldur knight and berenike knight also provide a healthy backbone for the military as jack-of-all-trade units.  they could be left to defend regions, or move ahead and go on the offensive.  despite not having the numbers of the other armies, anor londo has enough balance to create a strong tank force backed by ranged attacks like lightning bolts, dragonslayer arrows, and gwyndolin's sorcery.  although this scenario could end differently, anor londo would be my take for the ultimate winner in a battle royale such as this one.",0,,

it was odd, but for some reason he didn't care to ponder it. he simply continued his robotic motions, drifting into the unseen, leaden arms guiding him to nowhere. the water went on endlessly, a never-ending flow, and soon enough the muddy shore he'd left behind faded into the thick, concealing mist. he continued on. stroke. stroke. stroke. the endless cycle repeated upon itself. his arms began to tire and his movements became more and more sluggish until he could bear the burden no longer and released the oars in exhaustion. the kayak stopped completely and with the ceaseless, robotic splashing ended, it became deathly silent. no sound was heard, not even his own breathing. all around was water, water and fog, nothing moving, nothing making a sound, not a trace of life. the man's heart began to beat faster. louder. his breathing became heavier. the silence drilled into his ears and black thoughts entered his head. what was lurking about? where was he going? where had he come from? who was he? why was he here why? how? where?  questions tore around his brain at breakneck speeds as sanity's death knell called and he began to dwindle into madness. why? why would this quiet not end? why? why?! why?!  the insanity was slapped from his head as a pop sounded from below. then another. then several. as his eyes were drawn down to the source of the noise, something slithered past his kayak. he caught only a glimpse of it, a flash of green skin. then something slimy and rough brushed against his legs. he had to stop himself from recoiling in terror. something was in the water with him. something big. he sat motionless. the water was completely still, but the dreadful feeling that he was being watched lingered. it was waiting for him to move. one errant twitch would be the end of him. shaking hands reached into a pocket in his shirt to retrieve the small torch he'd found earlier, hoping for maybe a meager source of light. the mist hadn't lifted, and blacked out most of the moonlight. he fumbled around in the darkness, taking care not to move around too much. the beam of light cut through the dark in a flash, and his sight was returned. the water was still black as the pools of hades, but it improved his sight range a little. as he scanned the area around him, his light reflected off something. something shiny. he moved the torch back over it. it was large, larger than his body, larger than his boat, larger than the shack he'd been chased from. it was a massive green disc that reflected the light with an unnatural shine, with a black dot about the size of a horse at the center. the realization hit him hard.  what he was looking at was an eye.  and its owner was directly below him.  it was gargantuan, hundreds of feet long, maybe thousands, and it was resting right under his feet. his eyes widened. his jaw dropped. then the flashlight followed suit. he heard his own death knell silence as it hit the water with a loud plop. the enormous cloudy eye focused on him, staring blindly for a moment. and then he was off. the kayak was left abandoned as he swam with all his might in a hopeless effort to escape. a huge wave erupted from the water like a meteor just hit, and the black tides consumed him. lead weights dragged him downward, covering him in the deep black water, thrusting him forward at a great speed. the world began to spin, up was down, down was up, the sky was green and grassy and the ground an expanse of blue. his limbs flailed about as he was sent hurtling into somewhere, the tides had him now. water filled his lungs, went up his nose, choking him from the inside out.  as the sea wrapped its bony fingers around his throat, he caught a few glimpses of green, gray, massive shapes propelling toward him, and the sound of a great beast moving for the first time in thousands of years. the leviathan opened its gaping maw and began to suck in all the water around it. its vacuum suction drew him in. he watched death grow closer, the huge mouth of a hungry best, and finally found some peace. there were worse ways to die, after all. what's so bad about a little water and a big black hole? nice and quick, nothing to worry about. his vision began to dim. his lungs slowed evermore until they stopped completely. the jaws of death closed around him, and the endless choir of night chirped on.",0,,

676590,"1. **how did you become overweight?** i was delightfully skinny until third grade. i transferred schools to an advanced program ((which you usually do much earlier)). my stress immediately went up, even for that young, as did the amount of homework. i stopped going outside and running around for fun, instead staying inside and talking to friends. slowly, over the next couple years, my activity levels went from very active to mostly sedentary. my family also didn't eat well. sure, we had fresh food (my family is very well-off). but lean nutrition was a joke. i had free access to ice cream, cake, soda, sugary juice, whatever i wanted. meals were mostly based around red meat, usually 4 nights a week, and we went out to dinner (almost always chinese or mexican) at least once a week. in terms of truly *healthy* meals, i'd say we ate healthy once, maybe twice a week. by the time i was in sixth grade, i was overweight. i went over the obese line by eighth.   2. **did it seem to happen suddenly, or did it take years?** see above. i noticed feeling out of breath in third grade: we went to a doctor, they tested me briefly for asthma (test = making me run briefly in a circle in the office), and sent me on my way. i definitely started noticing it by fourth grade, but it didn't really hit me until fifth. i had to wear a bra by fifth grade. i started sucking in my stomach in fifth grade as well. i fully decided i was doomed to be a fat kid by seventh.  3. **did you at any point try to reverse the process?** several times. i know i had hit around 180 in eighth grade, so i immediately stopped eating ice cream ((i could easily eat half a carton in one sitting at that point)). i know i got down to around 150 just through that alone. but at that point, i was so overweight and so out of shape that exercise was brutal, so i couldn't bring it down any further. that's the lowest i've weighed since then. in high school i didn't explicitly diet, but i did rationalize to myself, ""ok, you can't eat that much, it's *really* bad for you"". a couple friends helped me exercise occasionally, and i took a gym class at least once a year. so that helped maintain it. however, as i've mentioned before, i haven't been able to get my weight below 150 since eighth grade. no amount of effort has shaved those pounds off. late last year i peaked at 185 (right before i started losing weight: see #4).  4. **are you trying to lose weight? if not, why? and if so, are you succeeding? why or why not?** incrementally. i've been watching what i eat since december, restricting sweets, getting off the soda, and watching meal portions. i've been getting 45~60 minutes of active exercise 3~5 days a week, and work in at least keeping moving (as opposed to being sedentary) the rest of the week. i'm down 20 pounds. i know i could lose more if i really pushed myself hard. but there's a lot going on in my life (family relationships, personal relationships, work, school, general stress, etc.) that makes just fighting the overwhelming habit of stuffing my face -- a stress habit i developed over years -- a daily willpower struggle, let alone working out. currently i'm actually pretty fit (in terms of fitness) for my weight range. even in high school, given the willpower, i could lap most of the other girls, stretch further than the skinny girls, and swim fast enough to merit innumerable invitations to join the swim team. that being said, i know my weight holds me back from being more fit than i am. so tl;dr, i'm succeeding, but i know i could do better.  5. **are you unhappy with your weight, or are you content that your lifestyle is worth the price of admission?** yes. in some ways, i like my weight. i have curves. i have an hourglass figure and breasts that other women (friends and strangers alike) openly comment on envying. but i also hate my weight. i hate feeling heavy. i hate the way i look. i hate how, when i pinch my stomach, i can make shapes out of the flab. i hate having to shop the tiny xl section in the junior's department, *praying* for something that actually fits. i bought a pair of shorts today that, even in the purportedly correct size, make my legs look horrible ((i'm going to have to return them)). i hate the looks people give me when i go through the checkout with something even remotely unhealthy. i hate knowing that people assume i'm lazy, that i go home and stuff my face like a pig with sugar and corn syrup. i hate feeling worthless. i hate knowing that people hate me for how i look. i hate knowing that i will be judged every day by people who don't even know me, in ways that they would *never* judge me if i were thin. i hate having to explain myself for my weight, as if my body is something to be justified. so yes, i'm unhappy with my weight. but it's not that i'm unhappy with the number on the scale: i'm unhappy with the stigma that comes with it. yes, i'd still probably be losing weight ((health reasons: maternal line has a long history of obesty+type2 diabetes, both lines have histories of heart diseases, so i *have* to keep away from the obesity side)), but i wouldn't feel so shitty about myself and my appearance every single day.  6. **do you think there's anything wrong with you at all?** wrong with me? i have a lot of problems. honestly, most of them *aren't* directly related to my weight, so i won't discuss them here. however, i will say that my weight has been linked to my stress levels. as i mentioned before, i developed stress eating from a very early age. it's practically an instinct at this point, an urge i have to force myself to fight. so the more shit that goes on in my life, the more likely i am to gorge. so yes, that's something that's wrong with me. in terms of my weight? no. i don't think it's ""wrong"" to be overweight. i don't think we should kill all the overweight people just because they're overweight. i think people should be allowed to do with their bodies as they like, provided it doesn't hurt anyone else. yes yes, whine to me about ""well *i* don't want my taxes paying for fat people to keep gorging themselves"". if that's the *biggest* problem in your life, then i'd say your life is pretty sound. but if it's their choice, and they're informed about the consequences, who are we to dictate that there's something ""wrong"" with them?",1,–1,

831037,"at the risk of totally nerding out let me speak as someone who does computer forensics professionally.   forensics equipment, and software, is always pretty silly expensive. part of it is that the vendors often send their product out for 3rd party verification so that any evidence discovered using their can be court admissible. part of it is that we're dealing with a fairly niche field that has  low sale volume. part of it is that in order to collect evidence there is an insane number of adapters and connectors involved. if we only look at hard drives there are at least 6 different connectors currently in use, at least a dozen if we go back 10 years. then you have things like flash drives, cd/dvds, tape backups, etc. often, in order to be court admissible, one requires special equipment to be used so we can't just plug a flash drive directly into a computer. so in the case of a flash drive expect to pay about $300 for a device like this [tableau t35u](http://www.siliconforensics.com/p-229-tableau-t35u-forensic-bridge-kit-tk35u.aspx).  the mobile device forensics equipment is even more specialized. the gear i've worked with comes with:  * a faraday bag (think a portable wifi/cellular dead zone) * the collection device that you plug the phone into * a 2'x2'x3' case of various adapters and attachments (this one worked with around a hundred models of phones and tablets) * the software that allowed you to perform the analysis  the faraday bag is required because, in order to demonstrate sanctity of the work, the phone **cannot** be allowed to connect to any cellular towers, wifi hotspots, bluetooth devices, etc. similarly, the collection device is specially designed to prevent the examiner from making any changes to the phone or tablet. either event would contaminate the evidence and possibly result in it being thrown out.  at the end of the day, particularly with the mobile device equipment, we're talking about a hefty bit of physical gear included in the purchase and a big beefy piece of software. based on forensics pricing the 17k price tag seems not entirely unreasonable. compare that to the cost of outsourcing where $200/hr is considered quite reasonable and the simplest cases can require a minimum of 4 person hours. i generally assume 20 person hours for a typical case; that estimate includes gathering the evidence, setting up the collection, doing the analysis, and writing the report.  tl;dr; i can't speak to whether or not the police do enough investigations involving mobile devices to warrant the cost. i also don't know what they bought, but the price isn't necessarily unreasonable.",0,,
708028,"you might feel weak because anorexia causes low blood pressure and also while anorexic you physically have a hard time building muscle. if you dont eat enough meat and protein your excercise will do you no good but burn your energy. had to learn it the hard way.   the 1st step for you to do is set up a meal plan. personally i had this issue where i cant tell how much food an adult female needs to consume per day or what nutrients i was missing.   now i dont always eat enough food since hunger is what tells me how much to eat and i have no appetite normally so i cant trust my stomach to tell me when to eat or how much to eat.   you know what made me eat even though i wasnt hungry at all? my will to figure skate.  due to my anorexia i couldnt perform well at class, the little girls twice younger than me performed super well, but i would get tired and dizzy and nauseous. and i would vomit food and feel like my bones were like paper and i couldnt move my jaw to speak or walk on anything but my knees and hands. i found out what was causing me all these problems.   i knew that if i was weak i couldnt do figure skating, and not having any strenght to the point where i couldnt speak or walk was torture for me. i had never felt worse than when i was weak.  feeling weak wasnt physical pain for me it was just mentally and emotionally painful for me to speak, to exercise, to ride my bike to the store even. its the kind of pain where you cant control your own body, where you dont have the strenght to stand up and keep your head up.   i hated that. it made me so physically vulnerable and then i wondered when i start to live alone who will carry me to my bed when i cant walk? who will give me water when i wouldnt be able to stand up to reach the sink? who would cook food for me when i would be too weak to get off my bed? that scared the living hell out of me. luckily i still live with my parents so they help me out when i cant.   but living this way isnt really living. when you cant move or speak sometimes. this doesnt happen often to me maybe only once per season but each time this happens i start to wish i was dead or that i would never neglect my meals and food intake ever again because thats how bad it was.   to beat this what you will have to do is make a rule. that you wont leave the table until you have eaten x amount of food. i hate force feeding myself when im not hungry. trust me i eat pills for my add condition and all of them have a severly common side effect of apetite loss. if i stop eating i will loose weight and energy and the only thing that would keep me alive would be my stimulant pill until eventually my body would shut off and run out of fuel if i wouldnt start eating again.   now as an anorexic since birth (yes i was literally born very tiny and underweight) being anorexic was always part of my life 100% of the time. i still dont know how it feels to be healthy because i still am not and never was. but i am trying to.  i did some blood tests in order to start with my meds and my doctor told me what was wrong with my blood. i had a vitamin d deficiency, low blood pressure, that i wasnt eating enough protein, karbohydrates. like fruit, yogurt or bread. when she said that this was my only problem i was like â€œwow i thought it was way worseâ€ so i started on a vitamin d supplement, making sure i eat some yogurt every morning (always have yogurt in the fridge so you can grab some everyday to make sure you are getting the nutrients).  now eating is hard for me due to me being an extremely picky eater. i am very sensitive to the smell and texture of the foods and wouldnt eat anything that my sense of smell didnt approve of (like fish and mushrooms for example). i havent eaten fish since i started school and luckily somehow i am not missing any nutrients that are in fishes and is essential for everyone).   if you have a fear of gaining weight, you can start with eating chicken since it doesnt contain any fat. but you really should eat more fat foods eventually.   to me there are some days where i love my body and some days where i dont. i am anorexic too 172.5cm and 47kg. i dont think my body is ugly but when i see how beautiful the bodys of healthy people look i become a bit jealous. beautiful healthy people dont have their hip bones sticking out, they dont have branch thin arms, they have bigger boobs and butt which is exactly what i want. and if i want these things it means that i will have to consume enough fat to make me less lean.   always remember this: loosing weight is 1000% times easier for us, anorexics and gaining weight is 1000% times harder for us. just like overweight people struggle to loose weight and gain weight easily so do we anorexics who struggle to gain weight and loose weight easily. its the roles reversed.  our eating disorder keeps us away from being able to live fulfilling lives filled with energy. we are tired, we are weak. could you be happy with always being tired and weak? no one wants to be like that.   our enemy is ourselves and our ed. our ed doesnt let us live fulfilling lives and we ourselves want to live fulfilling lives. in order to live a fulfilling life you must beat the disorder that is stopping you from living in full potential.   maybe it would help you to look at your ed as an enemy that makes you tired and weak. then you might feel more motivate to counter act the ed by starting to eat more healthy.   your ed is your enemy, it tells you that your body is disgusting when it isnâ€™t. i want to you to look at healthy and fit people and their beautiful bodies and think â€œthis is how i want my body to look like, this is what i think is a beautiful body is and my ed canâ€™t convince me otherwise since it doesnâ€™t wish me good.â€ and you wouldnâ€™t listen to someones opinions of you who wouldnâ€™t want the best for you.   thanks for coming to my ted talk.   keep in mind, its very easy to relapse on an ed, never happened to me since i always had an ed but it might happen as a possibility and for that you need to be prepared. i suggest you weight yourself every single day and make meal plans with exact measurements of how much meat, protein and other nutrients you are supposed to eat today.  weight yourself in the morning before food and make a note. stick with your balanced meal plan and eat as much as it says in your meal plan even if you dont want to or arent hungry. after the meal i want you to reward yourself with anything of your choice (thats healthy) but only if you have finished your plate. you could reward yourself with a cupcake or a relaxing bubble bath for example, literally anything. but it has to be something that you really enjoy doing, and you will only reward yourself if you have eaten enough.   as you keep track of your weight, when you weight yourself before bedtime if you eat correctly you wont see any loss in weight and you will see the numbers going up little by little every day. and everyday you will be closer to your goal which will ultimately be that you now regularly stick to a healthy diet, and have reached the ultimate goal of a healthy weight. seeing the numbers go up everyday will trigger the brains reward system everyday, so will the bath and cupcakes that you will reward yourself after eating a good meal. this will keep you motivated to keep pushing for your goal, and the reward system in your brain will release more chemicals like serotonin and dopamine which makes us feel happiness and fulfillment. it will be like a drug to eat healthy, to get closer to the perfect body. the closer you get to your goal the more you will be trying harder, the more it will be hard to stop when the reward is so good.   the challenging part will be is too keep eating healthy after you have reached your goal, some people tend to feel like â€œi have reached my goal, so now i dont have to worry about meals anymoreâ€ but that will cause a relapse. so you will have to find other ways to reward yourself for keep your weight healthy and stable.   i speak of this as if thats how i cured my e, but i havenâ€™t yet. it is no doubt hard for any person with an ed to change their mindset, to turn their will to be skinny into something healthy that wont make them starve themselves. remember you can be skinny and healthy, to be skinny you dont have to weight any less than 60kg , to be skinny what you must do is turn your fat into muscle, if you are afraid of becoming fat, well let me tell you this it isnâ€™t how much you eat that decides how fat you will be it is what you eat and how much you eat that tells if you are fat or not. if you eat lots of junk food, that has so much fat and 0 nutriets then you will be the kind of fat thats ugly and unhealthy. if you eat balanced meals, meat, veggies, eggs, bread, fruit you will always be healthy. if you keep eating these foods and exercise you wont have to worry about gaining weight from the fat in the meat because your body will automatically use that fat as fuel and energy reserve, the healthy fat will spread evenly around your body and if you wont like how the fat will look then its no problem! you can turn fat into muscle if you exercise!   so eat balanced meals and keep exercising so you wont have to fear gaining the ugly and unhealthy type of fat. but if you will decide to exercise make sure you eat more energy rich foods (no fats) to compensate for the energy loss when you burn your fat.   i hope this helps. i hope this helps me too. i am not ed free yet but im definetely climbing up there slowly to my goal.",1,,–2
721684,"alright. so on my 19th birthday i went to visit my cousin in college. this was during the days of four loco before it was banned (though it's out again with less deadly chemicals). our pregame, on top of cheap beer, was two four locos which we played beer pong with. and i am fairly certain i had my two, and like half of my brothers. no one was stopping me, because it was my birthday and all. from there we go to a party in another apartment, and continue to get sloshed.   fast forward to the next morning, i wake up on a couch with half the cushions pushed off, using my hands as a pillow. i lift up my head and look down, and see my knuckles are completely covered in blood. my first thought is, ""oh shit...did i get into a fight?!"" i am a non-violent drunk on most nights, so this kind of scared me. my second thought was to run to the bathroom to check my face in the mirror. my face seemed perfectly fine, the only thing that hurt were my hands and the hangover. i ask my cousin what happened and he has no clue, he blacked out as well.   it took a month before i finally heard the full story. my cousin and i, for some reason, started punching beer cans on a table. the dude who owned the place politely asked my brother to remove my cousin and i from the apartment. apparently i did not go willingly, and my brother (who is a big dude) had to carry me out in a headlock. he then dragged us both back to my cousins apartment and threw me on the couch...there is a picture from that night of my cousin passed out face first in the middle of his hallway.   all in all, it was a successful birthday.",0,,

938940,"there are some options here, but it'll take a bit of work.  first problem, from an old crossdresser's page, ""if you're a girl with no hips and no belly, you're a girl with no hips. if you have a belly, you're a male.""  now, if you're average, it's pretty easy to make things work. if you're overweight, and we're talking about body fat percentage, really, it takes more work, but you'll release estrogen from the cells as you reduce, so there's a good compensation. and if you're skinny or underweight, you can easily add some weight -in the right spots.- ;-)  so, first, check your body. how tall, how heavy, how much fat? women store their fat in different places, so we have a problem right off. best option would be hormones, but that's beyond this discussion. let's put some numbers around this, though. your target body fat would be about 20% of your weight is far, if and only if you can achieve that female shape. if you're shaped like an inverted triangle, standard male shape, it's hard to change that, but you'll need to look towards putting mass on the bottom to compensate, while also reducing any belly. then you'll want to consider how to maintain. might change eating and exercise, that's also beyond this wall of text.   first thing, you can't spot reduce, except when you can! this is done by tweaking workouts to selectively increase fat removal from certain spots. it can be done for belly, triceps, not sure if the legs, too. (hoping!) see: https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/tip-spot-reduction-that-works/  the idea for the belly would be, some ab exercises, then do some aerobics like running on the treadmill, then ab exercises, then back to treadmill, abs, treadmill, abs. this will put more blood flow in the muscles under the far, to you'll slightly increase the fat removed from those cells, and over time - likely several years, depending on body fat percentage - you'll see greater difference than if you just worked regular fat loss.   so, with that approach outlined, consider food. for our purposes, i've heard and seen great results from intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet. if you need to lose a lot of weight, it would be a good approach. painful part is, you need to get used to measuring your meals. for example, i'm 35% body fat, android (masculine) shape. to make a gynoid (feminine) shape, tiny waist is essential, and you want to widen the hips. widen the hips by exercise, decrease the belly through exercise as above, and tune the diet. i'm working on a protein sparing modified fast. (i don't recommend jumping to this, mind. we've already done keto, vegan, calorie counting, weight watchers...  long story short, you must alter the body chemistry at our size, me at 220#, her at 270# and 55% body fat. we're in bad shape, and this is for me only, and for 3 weeks only, if i make it.)  so, you'll want to look up a calculator and see your caloric needs, first. i'd suggest milton st. geoff calculator, i think it was. you'll need to know your body fat percentage, though. and then you'll want two days of exercise planned, an a and a b, lower body, and abs with stomach vacuums, and do some yoga to ensure some strength without mass in the upper body. you'll also gain flexibility, a good feminine attribute. you can see where this is going, right?   you've calculated a small calorie deficit. you're cleaning the diet: lower carbs, no sugar, selected fats, tailored to what you need. carbs that do come would be mostly from leafy greens, especially do bitter greens like kale and parsley, and then it's just time and consistency. took me two years the first time, when i didn't know as much, but i was much younger. now, stressful work life, limited exercise opportunities, and family obligations, plus i need to stay in man mode...  not so good. but i'm trying again ..  by the way, you can also get the body to cannibalize muscle, if you are harsh enough with both exercise and diet. this means, more activity, and especially include long distance cardio like jogging, which can eat lean body mass (reduce weight, sure, but wrong tissue type gets consumed, for most of us.) with the added cardio, the body won't want to keep the fast-twitch muscle fibers, that's all high energy tissue. it will keep more fat, though, because the fat is low energy tissue. i imagine some blend of hiit for the whole body, e.g. a burpees session, with the abs and jogging on the alternate days, though you'll want to include butt exercises after the burpees, because the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus needs to be pumped up, while the rest of the body should be long and lean. but that should get you there over a few years. once you're at maintenance, you can cheat a bit without major issues. e.g., have a glass of wine now and then, that's fine. but not a caramel mocha starbucks every morning, no monster energy drinks, no daily candy, no daily cake, no daily pasta, etc. (note you can add exercise for some of this, but you can't out-exercise a bad diet. it will win eventually.)  hope this helps. it's simple to say, hard to do, and it can vary from age and dietary needs. also, it's premised on avoiding building muscle size, but women can make larger muscles, too, so feel free to adjust to what you want to achieve. almost forgot: do photos and measurements for your body, it will tell you more than the scale, even with the body fat percentage calculated by a scale or meter.

616383,"as they moved into the bedroom, celina felt a hard smack on her ass, and squeaked to herself, as her large booty wobbled. immediately the warmth moved down there, and she knew that her butt was growing. she couldnâ€™t believe it â€“ her butt too! but that was already so large â€“ what would it look like bigger? she didnâ€™t get to find out, as curtis threw her onto the bed, her fat tits wobbling as she lay on her back. they ballooned up into the air, and she found herself looking a large canyon of cleavage bulging up as she looked, swelling larger and larger.  â€œi want you to grow out of those jeans.â€ curtis grunted, flipping her onto her back, and smacking her fat ass again.  â€œbut theyâ€™re already so tight!â€ celina moaned, loving being ordered around, and adoring the sensation of denim stretching as curtisâ€™ hand made contact with her ass, and her enormous cheeks wobbled as he hit them. her butt was really big now, curving out from her slender form as if a pump had been shoved up her ass. it was bulbous and humongous, and every slap inched it larger. she could feel the tightness of her jeans as her ass expanded into them, and wondered if sheâ€™d even be able to take them off now. they were digging into her waist, as her big butt wobbled into the air, swelling larger and larger.  â€œiâ€™m gonna make you grow.â€ curtis growled, as he pressed his rock hard cock against celinaâ€™s butt and made her swell into it. she could feel her ass expanding, huge cheeks enveloping curtisâ€™ cock as her butt expanded. all the while, she could feel his hands running over her arms and body, her top getting smaller and smaller as her breasts grew bigger and bigger. they were nearly as wide as she was, and getting larger. and then she started to grow taller.  â€œno, not taller!â€ she cried, as her body began to stretch. her thighs lengthened and thickened, straining her jeans even tighter as she grew and grew. seams began to burst open as she expanded, and she knew she was going to rip out of them soon. she couldnâ€™t believe this was happening. it felt so good.  all the while, her body was lengthening. her bare feet were growing as the tops of them pressed into the bed, and she could feel her body stretching, her arms elongating, her torso moving forwards, even as her breasts expanded. oh god, in all the time she was thinking about her gigantic ass, she hadnâ€™t paid attention to her breasts â€“ they felt huge now! she could feel them looming down from her slender, growing torso, and they felt like huge bags of meat, massive udders that wobbled heavily and slowly beneath her.  then her jeans ripped open.  â€œfuck yeahâ€, curtis grunted, as he smacked her fat, wobbling butt one last time and her pants tore apart. celinaâ€™s massive, expanded rear bulged up into the air, and her underwear was practically invisible, swallowed by the gigantic cheeks that seemed to gobble them up. curtis grabbed her butt with both hands, and she felt power pulsing into it. he leaned down, and with his teeth tore off the remnants of her underwear and smacked her fucking huge ass one last time. she cried with pain and joy as her ass expanded again, and felt curtisâ€™ bare skin against her, and knew the growth wasnâ€™t done yet.  now the growth began in earnest, as curtis undressed and slid his generous cock into celinaâ€™s dripping, waiting cunt. she could now feel his power emanating around her whole body, and she begged her master to fuck her. for he was her master now, in this joyous scene of domination and growth. he was her master, and she was his slave. his growing slave.  â€œfuck me, master!â€ she cried, and curtis began to move his large dick inside her tight, wet cunt. immediately she began expanding again, more forcefully this time. curtis could feel her huge ass growing into his crotch as he pumped her bigger, still spanking her ass and making it expand, pushing into him and making him more turned on than ever.  then he leaned down and reached under celina to see how her boobs were doing, and nearly blew his load there and then. her tits had slowly groaned larger and larger over the past few minutes, and were now positively gigantic. they hung down from her expanding figure like overripe watermelons, and were curving out of the bottom of her top as if it was a pathetic sports bra, bulging out of it in all directions.  with every pump of his impressive cock, curtis sent her huge tits jiggling and slapping underneath her, even as they bulged larger. soon they were so big they were entirely pressed together underneath her, and there was barely any room for movement. instead they grew larger, spreading outwards, past celinaâ€™s shaking arms, which were barely holding her huge, heavy form upright as she crouched on all fours on the creaking bed.  luckily, celina was growing taller and larger as her tits expanded, meaning that every time her boobs swelled down to the point where they were brushing against the bed, her arms and legs would grow a little longer, and her tits would have a little more room to expand. soon, her huge, fleshy balloons were brushing against the surface of the bed permanently, though â€“ they were just too big. now her fat, erect nipples were being sent into a frenzy by draping themselves across the fabric, and her cannonball-sized tits were pushing into the sides of her arms as they grew bigger.  curtis was in paradise as celina grew bigger. her ass was so huge she was almost pushing him out of her cunt, so he focused on making her taller and more busty. her tits were now completely stuffed, and had pulled her shirt up to her chin, as there simply wasnâ€™t room for it. it rested up there like a childâ€™s bib as her breasts approached the size of small beach balls.  at this point, curtis reached around with one hand and started to massage the side of one of them. it was so gigantic and full that he knew he wasnâ€™t going to last much longer, so flipped celina onto her front, slid his cock back in, and prepared for the final push.  by now, celina was nearly 7 ft, and was pouring off the bed in every way. her butt was the largest curtis had ever seen, and her legs were almost on the floor, even as she lay back on the bed. curtis was fucking celina in her beautiful, tight cunt, and pushing her humongous tit together as he fucked. when bulged up into one another, they looked insane, even larger than the beach balls theyâ€™d become, and curtis felt his cock pulse one last time. he was going to come, to lose his virginity, and it was going to be explosive.  at the same time, celina looked down at her titanic boobs, which were all but obscuring curtis as they fucked on the bed, and knew her master had done incredible things to her. she felt like the biggest person in the world, and felt such power that she knew she was going to come, and that her orgasm would be sensational. her immense body was filling up with arousal, and even though it was growing, there was no more room for her passion â€“ it was going to explode out in an orgy of ejaculation.  and as she felt curtis come inside her, firing bolt after bolt of hot, thick jizz, celina felt her long hair, which now only reached a little way down her tall, powerful back, and felt her massive ass, which bulged into the bed like two huge balloons, and felt her truly gigantic tits, which were like over-inflated beach balls and blocked everything from view, and started to come.  it was like a tidal wave, a tsunami of passion, starting slowly from a distance, then building and building before crashing over her, causing her immense body to scream and shake and wobble and grow as curtis came inside her and she expanded out of control in every direction.  it was thought-obliterating and utterly all-consuming, and celina could scarcely believe when it was over. it was the first time in her life that sheâ€™d felt truly satisfied, she realised. but what utter, utter satisfaction.  she looked down at curtis, who seemed somehow small and puny next to her gigantic form, and smiled a toothy grin. he wasnâ€™t a short man, but she was over 7ft now, and had breasts the size of large beach balls; everyone was going to look small compared to her. she tried to get to her feet, but was too huge and too spent. it was going to take a while to get used to being this big.  curtis lay on the bed, looking up at the ceiling, barely able to muster the strength to smile. that had been incredible, he thought to himself.  he looked over at celina, the biggest woman on the planet, in almost every way, and his mouth reflexively twitched and perked up at the corners. how could he not smile.  celina grinned back. incredible. she thought to herself. absolutely incredible.  and she reached out, not caring about the consequences, about the tingling, about the potential further growth and took curtisâ€™ hand.  she gave it a squeeze.",1,2,

331847,"i used to be fairly skinny in high school (and prior) and entering college - i was a size 6 (but still thought i needed to always ""lose 5 lbs"") but could pretty much get away with eating anything i wanted. then enter an abusive boyfriend of 6 years who basically called me fat, and my response was ""i'll show you fat"" and proceeded to put on a ton of weight. the heaviest i hit with him was 185 (i'm 5'10"") but he made me feel like some sort of endangered manatee. when i dumped his sorry ass, i lost 20 lbs pretty quick.  i then got into a really nasty car accident that fucked up my spine and knees. i got extremely depressed and moved back home. shortly thereafter i got torticullis and put on more weight due to inactivity. i dated another shitty boyfriend who liked me fat, so i wouldn't leave him for another guy.  i broke up with him in 2009, and dropped back down to around 165 lbs. i felt great. i finally started being able to move around without my back and knees hurting, so i got out with friends and did stuff. then i got laid off. unemployment had me living between three homes, eating whatever food i could get.. which was usually shitty fast food. $5 caesar's pizzas sound great when your unemployment cheques are piddly, and eating healthy is impossible due to your lack of refrigerator and cooking space. i ate horribly, and managed to put on **60+ lbs** in one year. this shot me up to 230+.  this year, i was diagnosed with severe major depression. i've been suffering from it for a while, but never knew that it was what i was dealing with. i've had an eating disorder since my early teens, which was binge-eating. i had no idea it was even a disorder. i just thought i was stupid. i would order an entire papa john's cheesestick order, watch tv and eat until i was ready to throw up because i was mad at *myself* for weighing so much. i would just shove more and more food into me, telling myself that ""fatty better eat since i'm fat anyway"" (pretty much verbatim) and would go to sleep sick and sad.   because i've yo-yo'd with my weight in the past 6 years so dramatically, i can tell you: being the fat girl **sucks**. i've never been hard on girls who are bigger, mostly because i've known too many of them growing up. clothes don't fit right, which leads to crying spells in dressing rooms. you don't feel pretty, you don't feel attractive. you know guys won't hit on you, and if they do it's because they figure you're an easy lay with low self-esteem. i used to hang in bars all the time, and people say the most hateful things to you when you're overweight. once i turned down a guy who i just was not interested in, and he basically called me a 'fat fuck' and said no one was really attracted to me.   you wind up either becoming hardened to your weight, or making a joke of it. i did the latter. i make jokes about being fat and overweight all the time, sort of to deflect the fact that being this large hurts me physically and mentally. i weigh myself religiously, and dream about being able to frolick on the beach in a bikini. i refuse to wear clothing that's remotely revealing, because i view it as unfair to other people to view my gigantic gelatinous mass.  places like reddit are hard to deal with sometimes. it's a bunch of internet assholes passing judgement on a regular basis. girls could have not even extra padding and guys are already saying ""too fat"" or whatever. so those who actually are overweight just feel that insult even more, despite it not being directed towards them.  however, in retrospect, i haven't ever sat on my ass and just accepted my weight. i've been working out since january, and went on medication in april. since april, i've lost over 30 lbs, and i'm continuing to lose. that's half the weight i put on last year. it sucks, it's slow, but i've changed eating habits and my lifestyle so i can do something about the weight. i want to help people who are overweight to realize they can do something about it.  but i'm reminded every day of my weight, when i pass a reflection, a mirror, another girl who's thinner or heavier than me. my boyfriend loves me for who i am, but i'm always mentally crying because i'm sure he's checking out the much thinner chicks around - no fault of his. and i want to be that for him, but i'm not right now. and that really sucks ass.  so to the people who are hurtful and hateful to those who are overweight: **fuck you**.   you're adding to the problem.",1,–2,

477301,"this, but i'm going to add in some comments:  1 - paint - good paint helps. you *can* absolutely get good results with cheap $1/oz acrylic paints from the craft store, but you'll find that certain colors (reds and yellow in particular) are *very* translucent and don't cover well, especially when thinned. (and you should thin your paint!) better quality paints help - the citadel foundation paint series is fantastic for basecoating, then you can rock the cheap stuff if you want. i do, except for inks and metallics.  1.5 - brushes are important. get decent quality brushes, but don't get the super expensive ones. the raised areas of the mini are hell on brushes, so until you get the hang of things and you know what you like in a brush, don't splurge. (yet.) paint with the biggest brush you can - don't start with those 3-bristle #0000 things, you'll never finish the model. i basecoat, and normally shade and highlight the models with a #3 brush. you want brushes that hold their point. there's some new synthetic brushes that are pre-shaped by cutting the lengths of the bristles that kinda have to hold their point. these brushes tend to have white bristles and are a little stiffer. i really like them, and they're not as expensive. super high quality windsor &amp; newton sable brushes are awesome, but expensive.  2 - start with a solid primer coat. metal or plastic, they both need a good primer to base things on. black is more merciful - you will miss a lot of spots on the model, especially deep crevices, and black doesn't stick out like a sore thumb when you miss those spots. white does - but it's a lot harder to get a brightly painted mini on a black undercoat. krylon sandable primer (comes in white, rust, grey, and if you're lucky, black) works well. you don't need to spend $10 or $15 for hobby primer. they're a little nicer, true. but they're not $8-$12 nicer than the krylon. keep the nozzle about 12"" from the models you're priming, and spray across the model from many angles. get 100% coverage, but not thick and drippy. pro tip: the first bits of spray have bigger droplets of paint, since it has to clear the stem of the can. start your spray away from the model, bring the stream across the model, and stop once you're back pointed away from it. short, even bursts is best.  3 - basecoat - give a good, neat, crisp basecoat to start. there's plenty of techniques to make a sloppy basecoat look good (and i'm a super sloppy painter) but starting with a clean basecoat is a great skill to have. thin your paint (acrylic, testors enamel is great for one-color minis, but you *can't* layer, blend or anything with that paint.) with water until it's about the consistency of milk. you may need a couple of thin coats to get good coverage of yellow and red, for some reason the pigments of those colors is always weak.  4 - shade - from your basecoat, you can paint a darker shade in the recesses and shadow areas. be neat and precise.  5 - highlight - from the shade step, highlight the high points of the model. imagine a single point of light shining onto your model, and the higher/raised areas get a lighter shade from their basecoat. example: you're painting a face. the light's from overhead, so the forehead, bridge of the nose, cheekbones, and bottom lip get a highlight.  some links:  http://coolminiornot.com - great tips and inspiration  http://www.youtube.com/user/agproductionsinc - nice channel of videos, some good tips, even though they're trying to sell their dvds  most importantly, experiment, and have fun! i particularly enjoy blending colors on the model. when the paint's still wet, you can actually pull the paint around with a clean, moist brush. it works better if you put a couple of drops of flow extender on your pallette when you're mixing colors or thinning down from the pot.",0,,

939668,"why would you want to lose muscle and be all weak?  lifting will not make the muscles smaller - there is no way to ""compact"" muscle - but if you lose fat your body shape overall will become smaller and you will appear slimmer and more ""toned"".  you cannot bulk up excessively because you don't have testosterone, and you should definitely try lifting if you want to lose fat.  it is an effective way to burn calories and reshape your body.  i have a more muscular frame than a lot of women, but i got over having big calves and putting on muscle (relatively) easily.  there's absolutely nothing you can do about it, fat or thin, so you may as well embrace that it makes it easy for you to be strong and athletic (and by the way, burns more calories at rest so you can eat more than skinny-fat people.)  at some point, we just have to accept that our bodies are the way they are.  we can't diet to get taller, or narrower hip bones, or a different hair colour.  my rock-solid calves don't fit into tall, narrow boots, but i've learned to disregard bad fashion designs that don't take into account people with normal bodies.  for shirts, sleeveless tops, stretchy material, loose-fitting (at the shoulder) shirts and tailoring helps (buy a larger size, have the waist taken in.)  you *can* find flattering options, you just have to think about what suits your body type (and don't make the mistake of thinking if something isn't cut right for you, that it's your body's fault.  it's just a shirt that's not cut right for you, the same way that a dress designed for someone with curves will not flatter someone who has an a-cup and no hips. styles vary.)  wearing heels will make a bigger difference for you than someone with smaller calves.  also, i get the impression you think that muscle is not attractive.  but... a lot of people think fit-looking, muscular women are really attractive.  i don't know if you date men or women so i'll provide some variety in examples:  - /r/fitness... women lifting weights, having muscle definition, and generally looking fit are highly appreciated there.  - go over to actuallesbians and you'll have to beat women away.  here is a thread i started on this very topic http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/i5se7/are_athletic_physiques_hot/  - i don't recall anyone saying ""oh hope solo's calves are too big""",1,0,0

331674,"honey child, none of those examples are muscle guys. just call them bears/otters, it's not hard or difficult. you're only making things more difficult by flipping terms, calling every tom, dick, and hank down the street a muscle guy, when they make up a very, small microscopic fraction of guys in this community, and full stop, no bullshit answer, no they want nothing to do with you, interpersonal wise, 99 percent of the time.  for starters. the first guy,  https://pbs.twimg.com/media/fs_mfloacaajvvi.jpg  i would consider a stocky chub on a good day, and a powerlifter that let himself go over the years etc. maybe a nice wrestling chubby boy in his younger years. etc. that's fine, he's still a big cuddly bear. he probably just got done doing some exercises, and stretches, and sets earlier that day, because he's looking rather plump and swole there, but yeah lol. but that man is clearly a chub/bear, and nowhere near a muscle guy. his body needs to be more sculpted, and formed. so he's a stocky chub imo.  second example,  https://i.pinimg.com/originals/df/9f/af/df9fafa44c9af7b3068d3465a0fc2925.jpg  is an average bear guy at the beach. that's clearly a big stocky xbox/playstation bear, at the beach. looks like he's headed to get something to eat, and the hot dog stand, or snack bar, or concession stand, to treat himself, and that's fine. lol. he's a nice otter/curvy man, and nothing about him is a muscle guy. i'm not saying he doesn't possibly, and probably workout, and go to the gym, we all do in some capacity, lol. but that man is not a muscle guy, not even in the slightest.  listen here, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying either of those guys are ""fat"", (they are kinda more chunky/fluffy/i guess if you want to be down to the bone, and be scientifically technical, they would be considered ""fat"", probably based on bmi, but meh. they look fine to me.) but they are no where near any realm or category of being ""muscle guys with stomachs.""   sweetheart, these are muscle guys, ""with a stomach/untoned abs/neglected ab muscles, because they came back from a weekend barbecue lol"" etc.   https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ue4gzv2pwa8/xdogxpdwf2i/aaaaaaad7pk/oi0hibyy_i8w6o-cf3dc6dsrtbsutw2xwclcbgas/s1600/aaron%2bshock%2bmiami.png  https://cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/kwanten-mbeach/shirtless-ryan-kwanten-shows-off-his-killer-body-for-malibu-beach-dip-20.jpg  i know it sounds hard to tell the difference, but it ain't, and it's quite simple. you can tell if it's a true muscle guy, that is probably cheating at the moment, and letting himself go, because he's on vacation, or not keeping up with his routines, so he has some flab around his abs, but yeah. not even close to the examples you gave. you can tell by his overall aesthetic, whether he's strictly into muscle building. not every big stocky guy is muscle. some guys are born with larger figures and shapes. so yeah etc.  so you need to get body image terms correct, and understand your type/attraction. that's step and wave and stage one.  next, secondly, lol. i'm not gonna sit here and say the common trope, ""there will be someone that will be attracted to you."" as i feel, i don't know that. number one, i'm not a psychic or god honey. so i don't want to say concrete answers, or responses to stuff like that. number two, because i think it goes deeper than that.  but i will say that, most truly muscle guys, i've noticed are unbelievably vain, and most gay/bi men like that, want a partner who's also looking scent surrounded/the same as him. there are exceptions to the rule. i did see this one gay couple online, one partner was this really jacked/really fit/bodybuilder guy. perfect pecs, arms, abs etc. partner was a petite, jeffree star, flamboyant, sissy type but yeah etc. so it can happen, but generally, they want a guy that looks the same.  so i feel perhaps first of all, understand body types number one. not every big stocky guy with his shirt off at the beach, that you're attracted to is muscle; that's like calling a banana, an orange etc. no, that's not how science works. lol.; and just because he doesn't have a rotund, bloated belly sticking out, and he's not my 600 pound life morbidly obese, that he is a muscle guy. because neither of those examples you gave op, are a muscle guy, not even close.   so basically, if you're attracted to bears/otters, (those examples you gave were them etc.), that's fine. seek out guys like that. baby, i'm attracted to guys who look like that myself, and i'm feminine/slender, so it's okay. if you're attracted to ""muscle guys"", i wish you the best of luck, because unless you plan to conform yourself, and be jacked like them, chances are looking pretty dim, and they are also more vapid with attraction to their partner. so yeah. but if you want a more average guy, then that's a different story, and you may have a fighting and great, and a fantastic chance to work something out, and make something happen. so yeah.  thank you. :)",1,0,

568301,"ok so headcannones i have for each tribe, feel free to add your own, spoilers ahead!  skywings:   -appearance- the tallest tribe but the most skin and bones. they have all sorts of flappy parts, like big wings, a tail thing that looks cool, and those extra hip fins, sorta like toothless has. tail is 37% of body length. have long, wide, pointed snouts, and snout spikes. can have big, fancy, antlerish horns. red-orange-yellow pallet, with small amounts of pink-dark purple. black and white colors too. their back spikes are small, dull, and fade out near the shoulder. firescales dragons will always have *really* bright colors, but they eyes can be any color (green, blue, red, white/black). and fireless dragons still have fire organs, but they are just not working. they always have faded scales and eyes.  -kingdom- has always been the biggest but the most empty, the huge castle being a old structure and the center of the kingdom. was mostly known as a good, kind tribe before the reign of queen psychopath (scarlet). if a hybrid could pass a skywing it could stay, if not it got the animis-and-firescales treatment. the whole baby-murdering started when a animis dragon went ""crazy"" (was pushed to the limit by a evil and power hungry queen) snapped and pulled an albatross about 4,000 years ago.   -biology?- every twin egg hatches firescales twins, and they happen once every 10,000 eggs. skywings live to about 200, and lose scale color at about 150. they radiate heat like sandwings, but less. they have massive ""fire organs"" located on ether side, right under the wings. heat is felt more from there. there is a magical element to fire.   -history- has had the most wars, mostly with sandwings and mudwings over territory.   -other- scarlet has definitely become a cryptid, and a ghost story.      sandwings:  -appearance- stouter but still swooshy enough to get pushed over my a sandstorm. have lots of big flaps of skin with blood vessels running though (i know, charming), i'll get into more in biology. tails are 30% of body length, and the stinger is rather small. scales are thin but many, and some sandwings have scales that make a ""click clack"" sound when rustled. have sandy yellow scales with lots of light and dark patterns. some have shades of green, red, or even pink thrown in. sandwings are kinda a melting pots, with lots of variation between the oasis, and the scorpion den is just a mess,with alot have blood from other tribes. they have flater but sharp snouts, and snout spikes. they have short, dull, horns. tongues are short and thick, have spikes like a cat, and are forked. their frills can almost feel like fur, and can be a tall as the dragon's head hight.  -kingdom- it's really spread out between the oasises, with lots of dragons staying around their own, developing lots of different cultures. almost all of them share some love for music, though. the scorpion den is full of hybrid, 95% have hybrid blood at least 3 generations back, mostly mud and skywings, with a few night and rainwings too. jerboa 1 was a hybrid from the scorpion den, before the queen found her. the scorpion den was named after the mad queen scorpion. it used to be the center of the tribe. piercings are quite common, and are used to show rank, family, or dept in some places. almost any sandwings with sense carries many bags with water, food, and supplies with them anywhere, the dessert is big. everyone is the scorpion den has a southern accent.  -biology- ok, so elephants have big ears partly because when the wing blows threw the thin skin, it cools of the blood underneath. same logic with sandwings. sandwings have all the bits and bobs for survival in the dessert, and the heat coming from them is from some sort of heat organs that help make the fire they breath.  -history- have had the most different queens from different bloodlines. the land between the desert and the ice kingdom is full of gems and treasure. this is known because scorpion made jerboa 1 make something for her to see through the ground, to find ores and such. jerboa 1 was the only time the kingdom of sand has ever had magic.  -other- the cactus that heals stings was bred and places around the desert close to the start of the kingdom.     mudwings:   -appearance- whenever i draw to draw a mud, they turn into chonkers, but they do have a stocky body, good for wading in mud without being swept away. the scales on their back are wide, thick, but not ridged, so they can move with the rest of the body. they have really big paws with 6 talons on each. they have thick, short tails that have tadpole-like fin at the end. short, square, snouts and jaws. nostrils on top of snout, and huge, thick, horns that curve like a ram's. they have short, flat tongues that aren't forked, they have flat teeth in the back for grinding plants. they come in colors of red-to-orange-to-brown-to-green. some have white, light, and pink patterns.  -kingdom- similar to to sky and sandwings, the mudwing kingdom is big, but empty. the sib-group thing was established when the mudwing kingdom was first formed, and the line of queens has been mostly unchanged since the first queens were chosen. mudwings have had many kings, but has never had a ruler with a partner. there is a massive library in the mudwing castle, with scrolls on mudwing history going back ages. the most popular dish in the mud kingdom is soup just toss it in a pot and drink up, yum yum. queen moorhen has been in power for 80 years, and became queen at age 15, her mother passed away peacefully in her sleep. queen moorhen is the biggest and oldest queen. she is incredibly kind and wise, if very shrouded in mystery (ha). she has earned her subject's loyalty (cough cough darky cough)  -biology- mudwings are amphibian-like and can slow down all of their organs and thats how they hold their breath for an hour, distant villages by the sea have mudwings with more fins and webbed talons. they have fire organs too, just alot weaker and than sand, sky, and nightwings. that's why they neat more heat to make fire.  -history- i don't have much here, uhhh that one time the mudwing kingdom ran out heirs?   -other- mudwings use alot if salt when cooking  nightwings:  -appearance- there are two types of nightwing body shapes, the thin, whippy one that is mostly seen in darky's time, and the chonky, thick bois that are in the dragon guide and live today. all nightwings have a tail fin with silver scales on both sides. and more silver scales down their front and back legs. they have long, straight pointed horns and back spikes. they have thick, hardy scales but a soft underbelly. they have massive, bat-like ears and some have scrunched-up snouts like bats too. they can be any dark shade of color, from common blue-purple-green to reds and browns and pinks. albino nightwings exist but are normally cast out. they do have the funky black eyes and white pupils, but lack an eye color. i just don't draw that most of the time because i don't want to.  -kingdom- in the old night kingdom, it was always a small but smart and skilled population. the schools were a new concept in darky's time, but lost alot of knowledge in the switch to the death volcano. old nightwings payed taxes, and made an income in a standardized currency. they had big brains. teeth of darkstalker are still active. on the volcano, it was a beautiful mountain fill with miles of rich, untapped forest and gems in the ground. it first erupted around 500 years after they moved in, and each further eruption decimated the land, forcing them into the hunched, powerless, dying tribe that they were before the rainforest. in the rainforest, most are quite happy, and in 50ish years, the tribes will merge into a new one. a school will open for rain and nightwings, with those classes for dragonets with powers. there are many animi lines, because that's how descendants work. every single nightwing animis has had their own power abused by the current corrupt queen. and each had lived a short, miserable life and died sad and alone. on a happy note, whiteout lived a long, happy, and peaceful life with her beloved thoughtful, they died before the island was turned into a wasteland.  -biology- nightwings have a silvery-white fire, because of the moon magic in their fire organs. that last sentence makes sense, i promise. they are more awake at night, and being a ""morning dragon"" is frowned upon.  -history- the nightwings got powers from a powerful night wing animis who put a spell on the moons themselves, shortly before going insane and killing off the remaining animis bloodline in the tribe. more queens have been evil, corrupt, or just stupid than have not, that game also had alot of inbreeding, hasberg-style. most of the history scrolls ere lost to time or burned. the talon peninsula will forever be abandoned.   -other- nightwing have moved around alot in history, and got alot of treasure by being crafty and smart.",0,,
531694,"this comes back to the bmi stuff. someone can be a steroid user and be obese in the bmi because of their muscles.  some sports require people to be light and to perform better, does that mean they are anorexic or underweight and unfit?   there are many variations to this and equally, people with denser bones or a larger frame could be heavier or wear larger clothes and so on.   for people who are slim but with curves, i have yet to see them mention their weight, mainly height. i am curious but i doubt they would be ""light"" as you would imagine, weight is weight even if it was optimum distribution.   the whole idea is quite odd in my opinion and if someone who has curves decides to wear clothing that hides their figure, they would probably wear the same size as someone who has curves but distributed to their whole body instead.   e.g. a 110lbs 5ft person could have a belly and have a bottom heavy form with stocky legs or they can have a s figure and ""petite"" but both would wear the same size if they were to hide.   the same as a muscle bound 5ft6 guy wearing a m vs a twig-skinny 6ft 3 guy wearing an m or a chubby, bottom heavy guy at 5ft6 who would only fit an xl. the three most likely would be close in weight 180lbs however their compositions are vastly different and only the one who does not have muscles would be overweight.   that becomes the whole somatotypes argument as well. similarly how some people can eat a lot and fail to have a belly/belly rolls whereas some can do that. or they gain weight in their legs, not their belly and vice versa.  all are genetics.",1,0,0

"" *hic* why did that guy kick me out? that lich story really did *hic* happen""! mister goody-two-shoes turned to look forward, sighed deeply, and sarcastically remarked ""i'm sure that jumping on the table, kicking steins at the tavern owner, and asking his daughter if she wanted to touch your *sigh* 'wand of lordly might' had nothing to do with your ejection. we need to stop mucking about. we can't be sure that the vase was his phylactery"". the pointy eared bard begin to mimic the paladin in a high pitched tone, not unlike how a 12 year old boy is want to do, but this was quickly stopped by the musclebound hobbit by a quick twist of the arm. the half elf proceeded to fall to the ground moaning and whining. the exasperated paladin pulled him along the road, during which time the satchel fell off of his shoulder. herbert decided to wait until they walked out of sight to snatch the man-purse. i mean, if he really wanted his satchel, he'd keep better care of it. besides, it's basically redistribution of wealth from the strong to the weak. he opened the satchel and was immediately captivated. he found about 60 gold pieces, but more importantly an ornate black gauntlet a purple glowing eminating from the cracks between the metal plates. herbert heard the gauntlet call to him in a voice that for some reason felt intensely familiar. he finally put it on to his right hand, and he felt it.   he suddenly understood the secrets of arcane magic, and the words he saw on signs around him suddenly began to make sense. he could read! he felt the magic nearly bursting from inside him. herbert, in mad frenzy, ran to the local scribe,""the flaccid quill"", almost on autopilot. he ran into the shop and smelt ink and parchment. he plopped his bag of coins onto the counter, staring blankly at the gnome attendant, who was not expecting a customer this late into the graveyard shift. he took a spell book from the nearest shelf without saying a word and began to write incantations in a language he had never seen before in his life. whenever he looked upon this script he saw visions of madness and hundreds upon hundreds of eyes and tentacled men holding minds in their hands. he wanted to test these new powers he felt and he knew just where he could. he went down to the city square, stopping at ""the rusty hatchet"" along the way to buy some ""gently used"" leather armor. in the square he tore an old sign off of the wanted board- a sign for bounty for a bandit gang at 10 gold pieces per bandit killed. he left town, leaving towards the bandits' forest lair.  ""bastard!"" the other children yelled. ""freak!"" ""son of a whore!""  herbert was always a string bean, but at the age of 9 his head was so large it made him look more like a lollipop than anything. the other boys would try to beat him up, but his older brother cedric would stop them. although herbert was always smarter in some ways, cedric understood people in a way he never did. cedric was the one who taught him to follow drunk adventurers late at night for easy pickings. mom didn't like him staying out late. his mom always told him he was lucky because he had such a big family. and that people like the ones in his family always had to look out for each other to survive.  he had so many aunts. and his uncle. but his uncle was mean him. he always said that having him around would lose him business. herbert didn't like to be home at night anyways. he didn't like listening to mom and his aunties work. it always sounded like those strangers were trying to hurt them. the guards were usually a pain to him and his brother, and the were avoidable, except for when the prince's birthday came. they would always have a parade throughout town, being carried down the street in their chariots. they would always send royal cleaners in first to make sure the streets were ""decent"" enough for them, and the guards would be on high alert for any tomfoolery. cedric was trying get a dragonborn he found wandering down the street to help him grab a fictional lost wallet from a small drainage ditch. the dragonborn had gold shimmering scales and a gait that only a paladin can walk in without feeling a fool. paladins were always easy to fool, seeing the world as black and white, stop criminals, help the poor in need. well these poor were in need of an easy mark so that they could afford breakfast. cedric began to dig around through the prone paladins pockets. he threw herb a gold talisman of an ankh that was encrusted with a few small gems and, more importantly, a platinum piece!  that's when herbert saw the guard. cedric had always tried to teach herbert that special cant, but he could never quite get the hang of it. this is one of a number of reasons ended up blaming himself for the events that were about to transpire. the guard called out ""stop ya lil feives! we got the prince's  birfday comin' up and we can't have you lot scarin' away all the guests!"" and ran towards them. cedric took a small rock from the ground near him and threw it at the guard. the stone hit the guard right in the eye, startling him and throwing him back. herbert looked upon this scene with complete surprise, not once moving from his spot, even after the disoriented guard let off a crossbow bolt that punctured cedric right between the eyes, instantly killing him. herbert ran from the scene to his mother. cedric was his role model. he followed him everywhere. and now he was gone. why don the rich have so much, and he and hsi have nothing, not even a brother anymore? it wasn't fair.  through the bushes he saw the bandits carrying caravaners, bound and gagged, being carried. there were  7 bandits he counted and 3 captives, two women, a dwarf and a human, and a half-orc man.  herbert studied the bandits' patterns, and sneaked down to their lair door. an hour later, he walked out of the lair, blood on his purple glowing hands. the captives are not sure of what they saw. floating objects, bandits being strangled to death by skeletal hands with a purple glowing aura and being fried crispy by lightning, a cloaked figure disappearing and reappearing  from shadows and taking the form of fallen bandits, a  royal purple blur passing over the brigands and leaving them dead on the ground that took the bandits' clan necklace after each kill. they ran back to town, before more bandits came back.   it was early morning by the time herbert had buried all of the bandits. they may have done awful things, but they were still just people who were done on their luck and had to do something that they normally wouldn't, and deserved  a proper burial. he went down to the guards' station to pick up his bounty. he had to make it home anyways to mend his wounds. the captain of the guard was more than surprised by the skinny, weak looking, teenager who walked in and plopped several symbols of the bandits upon the counter. it was moments like these that he wished that the king hadn't instituted a no-questions-asked policy for bounties, just so he could hear this story. herbert knew that he could finally use his new-found powers to buy his mother's freedom, but that she wouldn't want him to go adventuring. she had a fire in her eyes before, and this fire was put out when cedric died. herbert knew that she couldn't stand to lose another son, so he would tell one of her coworkers. he walked into ""the tiny succubus"". when he entered, the smell of cheap perfume and sweat me his nostirls, and comforted him in a strange way.",0,,

""there are less ps2's than 360's and xboxes, so the x-box family must be losing. has he ever thought maybe it's because you can get a ps2 for 150 fucking dollars! the wii will be a success because it's pretty muck a smaller gamecube with motion tech (look like it kicks total ass). did he look at the ps3?! you can get a wii60 for the price of a ps3. with the wii you can buy a 360 too because it doesnt cost you any organs. but the ps3!? now that is screwed.

570861,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,

587708,"part one:  the first shot is cool, but the actor shouldn't have tried to sell it so much. it looks a bit like he's jackin it until you pull all the way back. same thing when you next show him. i'm still not sure what he's supposed to be conveying. actors overselling can be a big tool for disengaging the audience. also in that same second shot of the guy, where the care pulls up there's a lot of intense flaring, and you lose a lot of contrast from the light coming in at steep angles, invest in a lens hood.    in the first dialogue scene the vox levels are way too low. do you have any external recording equipment? sounds at least like you might, but a boom pole with a good windmuff would have really helped. and speaking of that dialogue scene, while they're talking she is speaking screen right to screen left, and so is he. it looks strange to the audience even if they don't know about the action axis. just remember to shoot so that the characters that are looking at each other look like they're looking at each other. like if you shot from over her left shoulder it would have been fine.    your opening credits, while not a big deal in comparison to the project as a whole, look pretty bad. first you have all of your text left justified. which would have been okay if the text was all the way on the left. better if you switched from left justified to right justified and put it on the left and right accordingly. also it looks like your text was rendered out smaller and then expanded, leaving jagged pixelated edges. better to have created text in a larger pt, then to have later extended. it would have been better still to see smaller font all together. that giant text mid screen is, sorry, pretty ugly. a slimmer font, in a smaller point, in alternating places would have been much easier on the eyes, much more dynamic, and much less jarring. like the size you have later on while he's in the car. although that red, ew. find a place to put white font.     and when finally the title comes up, it's just down in the corner. if anything that should be the one thing that is against a black background. and that shot dragged on to long showing the ceiling of your car for an extended period of time. which would have been okay if you continued that upward motion with a reveal shot for the next scene from another almost-completely black to the scene.     also something is monologued in the next scene, i think, but those levels are so off.      in that next dialogue scene you notice the flaw of shotgun mics attached to the camera. the audio, very apparently, cuts from shot to shot because you're capturing audio in an entirely opposite direction. a boom pole would have been nice here. so would an ambient mic.      also cursing is disengaging. especially when the characters seem to be outwardly timid, and when there's really not much else going on. like if one of those characters snapped their key off in their car door i could see either cursing, but two f-bombs in 6 and a half minutes when all else is ambient music and cool shots and talking is abrasive. three by 6:45. also in this scene you keep whirlwinding the camera. you don't need to keep switching it around. just throw up an establishing shot. then a shot with both characters, and then go to over-the-shoulder shots unless one of them stands up or something, then pull back out to the two-shot. four by 7:30, unless i missed one. also, and here's just an overall excellent tip. don't switch right to the person talking nearly as often as you do. let it either linger on the person who just finished while the next person says a few words before you switch to the new speaker mid sentence. or switch to the listener before the speaker is done speaking and then you can leave it on them while they start to speak, and while they're reacting to what was just said. and then you can play around with that and do things like not even showing the second person at all if you think the lines from guy one and the reaction from guy one is more important than line from guy one line from guy two so on.     and then you switch to overusing shit. twice in like ten seconds. ""you know you don't mean that shit."" can be a much weaker line than ""you know you don't mean that."" and i'm not like against curse words or anything, this isn't just a personal preference to be quickly ignored. go all out with curse words when it makes the story better. but in these first few exchanges it really doesn't. ""man you choked."" ""fuck you."" would have been more powerful if fuck wasn't said 50 times before that line. or just remove it. ""man you choked."" ""i didn't choke.""     in that flashback the shot of just virgil, who isn't in action but who is reacting, is really good. nice work. although the next bit that girl doesn't look as scared as she should be.     the was no sound effect from the husband throat slitting. no knife sound. no muffled scream. no thud to the ground. no quiet joke. also slitting someones throat produces a lot of blood. (not that i know anything about that loololololol) but keep that in mind.    also the actress didn't look too distressed that her husband was just killed. the following scene where he walked away was too long. here's a thought: make the part where he's about to kill the pregnant girl really loud, she's screaming and fighting, the guys yelling at the other guy to do it, he doesn't want to, the shots flicker faster as the commotion rises. and then boom he does it. and right there change scenes to the two in the car. loud commotion to silence.     later when they're talking there's a huge audio sync problem. ""shit i never took you to be the family type."" is heard way before it's seen.     the next part where virgil kills james the music is okay to have, but not that music, it's kinda cheesy. i expected him to say ""oh hi, mark!"" and the grainy effect is cheesy too. i would stick to using canted angles to explain that something is wrong. a ramped reveal is weaker than a hinted at one that finally snaps. also when virgil pulls james into the ally someone is clearly walking around on the sidewalk. i would have re-shot that one part.      the very next cut is weak. after james is killed virgil kneels over him, and then it cuts. but there's no change in type of shot, and not much change in direction of shot. to make it smoother go from fully body shot to shoulder and up shot and then dolly out. or to make it even smoother, continue the first shot into the next scene. i know on set it's easy to say, okay let's film this part, now this part, now this part. but sometimes two parts fit naturally together and it would be better to just keep the camera rolling.     also, now it's night time when we're back to the beginning? i get that time would have passed while telling that story, but not from sun way up, to sun on the horizon, to sun completely gone. you showed the whole story and the flashback within the story in like 14 minutes. the same story we're supposed to believe took several hours?     the next scene when virgil is with his fiancee, he says ""it's where i killed a man."" and you hold on her for a reaction. but there isn't one. no dialogue there is okay. great even. but no reaction at all is not.  and then when he finally lets it out ""how many other people know about this?"" would definitely not be the first thing she'd say. and the next thing she says, ""what would you do if i died?"" maybe ""what if i wasn't here?"" or maybe she doesn't need to ask it at all. maybe he just goes ahead and says ""without you..."" and her next line ""that's how i know there's some good in you."" that doesn't make sense within the context of the story at all.      that's how she knows? his falling apart without her is how she already knows there's good in him? so before she knew he killed someone she already knew there was only some good in him. and even if you worded it differently. ""well at least i now know there's still some good in you."" is such a blow off line. like. what kind of bitch, after just hearing that a guys biggest regret, and most impossible to confess secret, is that he defended his mother from nightly beatings says ""oh well at least there's some good in you."" no.     that exchange very much sounds like a positive one if you don't at all pay attention to anything being said. and this is it, this is where he lays it out. it shouldn't be ""oh well i guess you're still okay."" it should be ""oh my god i had no idea, so that's why you always shy away. come here."" embrace embrace embrace. not stand awkwardly oppositioned until revealing that ""ahh i guess you're still somewhat okay."" and then a little sniffle and a hug. that's the big moment, don't miss it. writing is a very important step. this sequence is shot well, actually, from what i remember. but that whole exchange could have been improve with only minor reworking. have other people read the script, read it outloud to yourself. if it sounds cliche, or doesn't make sense, or in this case, both, change it.",0,,

806327,"i've been very, very fat my whole life. currently 36 yrs, female, 5'4"" and 470-ish lbs. my father was thin, my mother was, and still is, rather fat, but not huge.  mother was very loving and an incredible cook. she showed love by making huge delicious meals and dishing out way too much for me. i think she did that because it's how she was raised as well.  father was an abusive, controlling ass. at least to me. he seemed to genuinely love mom, but he acted like i was an inconvenience at best, and a burden at worst. he would beat me (and i do mean beat, not spank, i know the difference) on a weekly basis for the smallest/dumbest things (taking too long in bathroom, getting a c on report card, dropping my fork at dinner, etc.).  we had a rule in his house: at dinner, you clean your plate. no exceptions, no excuses. whatever you're given, you'd better eat. this isn't that unusual, but combined with mom's habit of overfeeding me, it meant i'd be stuffed to the gills at every meal. and that led me to putting on an awful lot of weight from a very young age.  of course, my stomach eventually adjusted to the large portions i was getting, so i'd be able to eat it all without complaining. then mom would increase my helpings, thinking i wasn't getting enough.  my father hated me for being fat. he'd berate me almost constantly, tell me how ugly i was, etc. strangely, he never said any of that about mom, or did anything to stop her from feeding me so much. the thought did cross my mind that he wanted me to be fat so he'd have more ammunition against me. looking back, i'm almost 100% sure that was true. anyway. as a way to cope, i turned to food. i associated food with comfort and love because of mom, so it felt like a natural way to escape. as you can imagine, this did nothing to solve my weight problem.  i was over 400 pounds at age 14. by 18, i was nearly 600 (i dont remember what exactly i was at my heaviest, but it was in the low 590s. enough that my doctor rounded it up and used 600 as a shortcut in her conversation with me afterwards).  now, i do believe it's possible to be fat and healthy, even if you're morbidly obese. if you eat good foods and get exercise, you can be in good shape even if you're overweight. but, let me tell you something about being almost 600 pounds. it hurts. a lot. i. was. so. fucking. heavy. all that extra weight on me was murder on my joints. my feet would hurt within a few seconds of standing up. my ankles and knees ached when standing or walking. my back ached 24/7, 365. i was almost always just a little out of breath, because my lungs couldn't provide for my huge body. i walked with a very slow, careful waddle, with my arms swaying awkwardly to keep myself balanced, because i knew if i moved the wrong way i would throw out my back, or trip and fall (i couldn't see where i was stepping because my belly was so big). i fell a few times and couldn't get back up. at my heaviest, it took 4 people to help me up off the floor. remember, this is an 18 year old girl we're talking about. i'd have to scuttle through doors sideways because of how wide i was, and even then, it was a squeeze. even getting into and out of bed was becoming a serious production.  now, you're probably asking why i let myself get so big. surely i could see what was happening, how debilitating my weight was. well, yes and no. i was fully aware that i was extremely overweight, and clearly unhealthy, but it's also something that happens over time. the fat doesn't just pile on all at once and make you go holy shit i gotta do something. it's a gradual process, fools you into thinking everything is normal. my back didn't just start hurting like hell one day. it started as mild discomfort, slowly morphing into a constant twinge, then a gnawing ache, then chronic pain. i didn't just lose my breath suddenly and never get it back. first i'd get winded going up stairs, then walking quickly, then walking at all, and finally, even when sitting i'd be taking deep breaths to keep up with my body's demands. i was the proverbial frog, being slowly boiled alive.  a lot of fat people get a sudden wake up call. that one thing that happens and makes you go, ""holy fuck, if i dont lose weight i'm going to die next year."" that didn't happen for me. what was my turning point? i moved out. that was it. i moved out of my parents house, got a job (office receptionist) and an apartment, and just lived on my own from that point. without my father's constant abuse and harassment, i all but stopped stress eating, and away from my mother's cooking, my portions decreased. i was still a very big eater (i do still love to eat, honestly), but nothing like i was at home. i made a few friends and would go to the gym with them, and the weight began to come off. eventually i stopped going to buffets and mcrestaraunts, and began eating healthier like them. i hated how hard it was to move and do things, so i started lifting weights too.  it's been about 18 years since i left home. i'm still very fat. i know this. i only lost about 125 pounds. that might seem like a lot, and it is, but it was only 1/5 of my highest weight. i'm not really making a focused effort to slim down. i'm just trying to be healthy, and it's happening on its own. i know i'll never be thin. i'm okay with that. i can do so much more now. i still waddle, but it doesn't hurt to move. i still get winded on stairs, but i'm not constantly struggling to catch my breath. my back still hurts on occasion, but i dont constantly feel like i'm being crushed by my own weight. and yes, i do still eat more than i really should, but i'm not going to bed feeling like my stomach is about to pop.   i'm still losing weight, though very slowly. if i can get to a bit over 400, or maybe even less, i think i'll be alright. my body knows what it wants to do. i try to make good choices in food, and in amounts that feel comfortable for me, but yes, i do love pie, and i'm going to have some every saturday. it's my special treat for myself. when my body gets to a weight its comfortable with, i'll probably stop losing. and when that happens, i'm sure i'll still be a great big fat woman.  but at least i'm not 600 fucking pounds anymore.",1,–2,

751057,"&gt;first off, this wasn't a sexist attack, it was a hillary attack. you can attack hillary, her life and upbringing, her views and actions, without being a sexist.  you can, wright didn't. he did not talk about any specifics of clinton (clinton, or senator clinton, she is an adult and deserves the respect of an adult. your inability to give respect to a woman is telling.) and he did not give specifics about obama, he talked in broad terms about how obama bore the suffering of his race.   &gt;second off, she has led an insanely more privileged life than obama.   insanely more privileged? how so and please provide actual evidence. not that she is white and so was better off. i don't know of any great poverty in his early life, both of his parent were in college, his mother was married for most of his childhood. what was the ""insanely"" larger privilege?  &gt;which, she, of course, has. rich all her life.  really? she was born rich? or she got money after attending yale sort of like how obama got money after attending harvard?  &gt;wife of one of most popular and successful presidents in the past few decades.  that is not privilege: she was half of a very successful political team because of her abilities. she was known as a sharp politician from their days in arkansas. to talk of that as privilege is for you to, yet again, demean her as a woman for being a woman.   &gt;i am not saying she wasn't challenged, but let's face it, her political career (just like her life) has been handed to her on a silver platter.  that is utter bullshit. she was a successful lawyer on her own, she was recognized from both sides as a brilliant political thinker, and she was investigated for her entire time in the white house. you seem only able to build up obama by kicking clinton down. how sad.  &gt;obama has been called muslim, which isn't an insult persay, but it is a blatant lie. many american's still believe it. go listen to hannity talk about obama, or oreilly.  listen to them or matthews or others talk about clinton. none of those people put obama down for being black, but the issue of whether someone could even talk to a woman was legitimate. they discuss how it is ok to call her a bitch, they say how listening to her is like hearing your wife say ""take out the garbage"". her gender was a ""legitimate"" issue to her detriment. otoh biden's campaign ended when he called obama ""clean"". that was somehow so racist that biden was no longer considered legitimate.  &gt;do not marginalize racism and pretend that sexism is a bigger problem.  i was not, i was trying to say both are important. but you and wright only have room for one oppressed group and that is black men.  &gt;black men were victims of violent racist murders in the sixties and seventies. how many white women were murdered for being white women in the seventies?  you really want to play that? until 1975 it was legal in sd for a man to rape his wife. and we can look at domestic violence stats. and how women are sentenced to longer terms for killing their abuser than men are for killing their wives. you really don't have much ground for claiming that things are just perfect for women in america.  &gt;what about holding a job -- any job?  or getting a fraction of what a man makes.   &gt;it's not that i agree with the suppression of women.  it is just that you don't think it is a problem. it even helped them, it put them on a pedestal.  &gt;how easily ignore the difficult struggle that black people face in america.  i don't, i tried to say that both struggles were important. but you can't and won't hear that.    &gt;it's racist to completely ignore a black man's struggle and marginalize it in the face of a women's struggle.   true, but i was not ignoring the struggle for racial equality, i was saying that the struggle for women's equality deserved a place in wright's, and your, thinking. you and wright are the ones demanding that we only consider one oppressed group in the world.  &gt;and under a president obama, as a nation, we will finally unhold that oh-so-important issue. we will finally restart our critical journal towards equality.  and in your view this journey depends on ignoring the plight of more than half the population.",0,,

947229,"-how often on a daily basis do you notice that you're obese? any emotion come with it?  it's not so bad anymore. i started out at 440 - yikes! especially as a female. i was pretty miserable too. no self esteem, no joy in life. all i felt like was a disgusting lard bag. and eating releases dopamine which made me feel better but then there would be more weight gain... yeah, it was a vicious vicious cycle. nothing about it was good.   now i feel fantastic, and while still obese, i can honestly say i don't feel it. i can shop, though still in the plus size, in almost any clothing store now. i date a lot, i go out. seat belts fit and i don't have to worry if my ass will be able to squeeze into a chair. my main reminders are other people. and people can be so mean. really, wheaton's law. live it.   -have you tried to lose weight? how did it go? is it like quitting smoking where you feel urges to over-consume, or does it just feel like you're starving to death so you go back to eating as much?  of course. i'd say 99.9% of really overweight people are always trying to lose weight. very few just say fuck it and allow themselves to rot. i'd tried and failed dozens upon dozens of times. even looked into the stomach staple. truth is now i'm having the most success i've ever had. down 140 and still going strong. the main difficulty isn't the hunger (though there is a disorder for that) so much as when you start to diet and you're really, really obese, there is no happiness in your life. you feel like shit, all the time, and you've removed your main pain killer. the trick is to hang in there until the weight really starts coming off.   -is pooping any harder when you're obese?  no, though like another person said, keeping clean is more difficult. also, if the handicapped stall is in use or, god forbid, non existent, well, you're in trouble.   -when you shower, do you actually lift layers of yourself to scrub in between?  yeah, unfortunately. in one particular area i do. but if you want some perspective, women with large breasts have to lift them to wash underneath, too.   -when you go out to bars or whatnot to look for women/men, do you intentionally look for other fat people? do you actually find other obese people attractive?  hah. boy, can i give an opinion here. do i like fat men? no.  biologically, i'm looking for a mate. so i want to mate with the best so my genes carry on. obese people do not present health. either physical or mental. something is not right here, and my sex drive tells me to stay away same as it does you.  on the weird flip side, i don't like really skinny men either. i find the skin/bones look to be pretty disgusting. i'm not sure if this is actual biology or my disgust of the white trash stereotype of fat girl and skinny little white trash guy.  i've also noticed the quality of men that come on to me when i'm out on the town improves with every 20 pounds i lose. not factoring in their weight at all.   -if you were ever average weight, what did you think of obese people then? now?  mostly pity and disgust. and guilt for feeling that way, because you know how they feel. pity mostly. the desperation that accompanies carrying all that weight around... though now that i've lost so much weight and am still working hard, i almost feel annoyed with them. like 'come on, you know you have a problem. fix it.' which is so wrong of me. i've struggled myself, and because i'm doing it now doesn't make me better than them. more guilt.   i can't say how i'll be at goal. my doctor wants me at 190, my trainer thinks 170, and i want 150. i'm 5'10, mind you - not a small woman, but my skeletal structure is not thicker than a normal woman. so... we'll see. i'll stop when i'm done, and i hope that i keep some sense of understanding.   -do you think people judge you on a daily basis for your weight? like people on the street, bus drivers, store owners, etc.  god yes. are you kidding? if you've never been fat, then you don't know. just like you can understand how the world views black people, but you'll never know the racial prejudice for yourself if you're a corn fed white girl from the suburbs.   but, to be fair, people judge you for your looks too. even if it's in a less noticing sort of way.   -are you concerned about the health risks associated with obesity? if so, what's keeping you obese?  i enjoyed the benefit of being young and relatively healthy, even at my heaviest. it's only matter of time before i stop being obese (i'm eagerly anticipating the day i get to change my okcupid status from 'full-figured' to 'curvy' or 'a little bit extra')  -what's your monthly grocery bill? or daily caloric intake?  i pull between 30$ - 40$ a week. my daily caloric intake is 1200, with occasional drops to 500 calories for the occasional boost. (i am under a doctor's care. i do not recommend you try this on your own) but to answer the question i think you're really asking, when i first started i could burn up to 2800 calories sitting down. at my heaviest. see, being heavy you build up all this muscle... well, i won't get into it. to gain weight (and i was) i had to be eating well over 3000 calories. probably close to 4000. and i don't even remember my food bill....   -what sort of stuff do i not even think about because i'm average weight that you have to deal with because of your obesity? how do you handle it?  i worry about the permanent damage to my body when i get older. seat belts. bathrooms. toilets. chairs. benches. fitting into boxed seats at movies and concerts. walking, even short distances. as a woman: yeast infections, chafing. my jeans used to wear out along my inner thighs. bra size was a nightmare. back pain... ick. it's all just ick. be nice to fat people, kids, even if they act like assholes. trust me, they're having a bad day.    you handle it by... i guess i don't understand the question. you deal by dealing. is there another option? i used to stay inside a lot. order delivery. venture out as little as possible. for a time i worked from home. but really, you deal by living. or eventually getting pissed off at your life and deciding to change it.",1,-1,

521104,"on a crack-of-dawn flight from new york city to seattle recently, i had my first ever, um, altercation with a seat mate. i'd almost missed the planeâ€”i was that person staggering on board just before the doors closedâ€”and i'm sure he thought he was going to have the row all to himself. i flashed him an apologetic smile (i know that aeronautical heartbreak too well!) and pointed to the middle seat. ""hey, sorry, i'm over there."" he looked at my body, sort of glared blankly at my hips, but didn't respond or make eye contact with me. then, as i went to put my bag in the overhead bin, i heard him mutter something sour.  ""[something something] say excuse me.""  my adrenaline went bonkers. was someone being a dick to me? in person? at 7 am? in an enclosed space? for no reason? when i have a hangover? and we're about to be stuck next to each other for the next five hours? i'm used to men treating me like garbage virtually, or from fast-moving cars, but this close-quarters irl shit-talking was a jarring novelty.  me: ""what?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no, you said something. what did you say?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no. what did you say? tell me.""  other passengers: [silent screams]  him: ""i said that if you want someone to move, it helps to say 'excuse me' and then get out of the way. you told me to move and then you just [gestures at my body in the aisle].""  me [head melting]: ""i'm putting my bag in the overhead bin. you know, because that's how planes work?""  him [dripping with disdain]: ""yeah, okay.""  i sat down. they closed the doors. i said, ""looks like there's no one in the middle seat, so you won't actually have to sit next to me. since i apparently bother you so much.""  him: ""sounds great to me.""  as soon as he fell asleep (with his mouth open like a nerd), i passive-aggressively jarred his foot with my backpack and then said, ""oh, excuse me,"" because i am an adult. we ignored each other for the rest of the flight.  it felt foreign to be confronted so vocally and so publicly (and for such an arbitrary reason), but it also felt familiar. people say the same kind of thing to me with their eyes on nearly every flightâ€”this guy just chose to say it with his mouth.  this is the subtext of my life: ""you're bigger than i'd like you to be."" ""i dread being near you."" ""your body itself is a breach of etiquette."" ""you are clearly a fucking moron who thinks that cheesecake is a vegetable."" ""i know that you will fart on me.""  nobody wants to sit next to a fat person on a plane. don't think we don't know.  i have, in my life, been a considerably thinner person and had a fat person sit next to me on a plane. i have also, more recently, been the fat person that makes other travelers' faces fall. anecdotally, i can verify that being the fat person is almost indescribably worse.  this year, for the first time ever, i got on a plane and discovered that i didn't fit in the seat. i've always been fat, but i was the fat person that still mostly fit. i mean, i couldn't fit into clothes (more tunics patterned like a parisian suitcase, please), and i had to be careful with butt safety (i'll take the chair side, not the banquette, thanks), but i was still the kind of fat person who could move through the straight-size world without causing too many ripples. until this fall.  it's been an incredibly busy year for me professionallyâ€”i've probably flown 20 times in the past eight monthsâ€”and one day i sat down and it just didn't work. i was on a flight home from texas, i think, and the flight out there had been fine. suddenly, on the return flight, i had to cram myself in. i mean, i know i ate that brisket, but i was only gone for two days! i'm no butt scientist (at least, not certified...anymore), but how fast could a person's butt possibly grow!?  if you've never tried cramming your hips into a jagged metal box that's an inch or two narrower than your flesh (under the watchful eye of resentful tourists), then sitting motionless in there for five hours while you fold your arms and shoulders up like an origami orchid in order to be as unobtrusive as possible, run don't walk. it's like squeezing your bones in a vise. the pain makes your teeth ache. it fucking hurts.  but even worse than any physical pain is the anxiety of walking up the aisle and not knowing what plane you're on. am i going to fit this time? will i have to ask for a seatbelt extender? is this a 17-incher or an 18-incher? did i get on early enough that i can get myself crammed in before someone comes and sits next to me? is the person next to me going to hate me? does everyone on this plane hate me? i paid money for this?  people's butts might be getting bigger, sure, but it's a certainty that seats are getting smaller. i fit in every other chair. (some people don't. that's fine too. those are good bodies too. those people deserve respect and accommodations too, without caveats.)  i'm sure some fat people are fat by their own hand, without any underlying medical conditions, but a lot of other fat people are fat because they're sick or disabled. and unless you're checking every human being's bloodwork before they pull up kayak.com, you do not know which fat people are which. which means, inevitably, if you think fat people are ""the problem"" (and not, say, airlines hoping to squeeze out an extra $200 million a year in revenue, or consumers who want cheap airline tickets without sacrificing amenities), you are penalizing a significant number of human beings emotionally and financially for a disease or disability that already complicates their lives. to me, ethically, that's fucked up.  a few weeks ago, i went to seattle's museum of flight for my nephew's 6th birthday party. they have the body of an old airliner from the '60s in there, and you can go hang out in it and pretend you're a mad man or whatever and honk the buns of invisible flight attendants. whatever you're into. and you know what? those seats are fucking huge. it's like sitting in a normal human chair, but in the sky. the difference was incredible. (it was definitely the most interesting exhibit in the museum, and that place also has, like, the first plane. which, to be fair, didn't have seats at all. so...upgrade? i guess?)  soon after that museum visit, i came across this post: ""it is now physically impossible for an adult to fit on a plane."" the wall street journal reported that seats are getting smaller and smaller, even on long international flightsâ€”some squeezing below an already scrunchy 17 inches. in case you don't know how small small is, that is crazy small. that's not just too small for fat people, it's inhumanely small for ""normal""-size people too. another headline: ""airlines squeezing in even more seating.""      southwest, the largest domestic carrier, is installing seats with less cushion and thinner materials â€”  a svelte model known in the business as slim-line. it is also reducing the maximum recline to 2 inches from 3.   my boyfriend is 6'5"". his shoulders are so wide that he physically must use both armrests (and then some), and his legs are so long that the person in front of him absolutely cannot recline their seat. he doesn't fucking fit. he fits worse than i do. even though fat people are always blamed for ruining everything on planes, i realized the other day thatâ€”thanks to insecurity and my proficiency at origami-armsâ€”i've literally never used a plane armrest. even when i'm in the middle seat. i hear it's nice, though!  none of this is news. the should-fat-people-be-allowed-on-planes debate has been raging for years, and i have no interest in pointlessly rehashing it all over again. some people will always disagree. that's fine.  but i just want to say this: before the day i didn't fit, this conversation was largely an abstraction for me. my stance was the same as it is now (if people pay for a service, it's the seller's obligation to accommodate those people and provide the service they paid for), but i didn't understand what that panicky, uncertain walk down the aisle actually felt like. how inhumane it is. how much it makes you question your worth as a human being. i've done it a dozen or so times now, and i've also had a fat person sit next to me and squish me a little bit for six hours. there is no comparison.  i'm telling you this right now not to get sympathy or pity, or even to change your opinion about how airplanes should accommodate larger passengers. i'm just telling you, human to human, that life is complicated and fat people are trying to live. same as you. regardless of your stance on the ""obesity epidemic,"" these things are objectively true: airplane seats are too small. they're too small for everyone except for small people. it's bad. passengers are going fucking nuts. and, sorry, it's not my responsibility to fix it.  that guy next to me didn't call me fat to my face. i don't even know if that's what was bothering him, although i know the way he looked at my body (my body, not my face, not once, not ever). i can't be sure why that guy was mad at me, but i know why people are mad at me on planes. i know that he disliked me instantly, he invented a reason to be a dick to me, and then he executed it. at 7 am. in a flying fart-can. when i had a hangover. and, much more importantly, i see other people staring those same daggers at other fat people's bodies every day, in the sky and on the ground. it's just a shitty way to go through life, for everyone.  you don't have to change your mind about fat people. but you could just be fucking kind. you could give it a shot. it's the holidays, and we're all in this fart-can together.",1,–1,

653945,"**why did you go for a bike instead of a trike this year? it looks like bikes would be less stable with the shell boxing you in.**  you are correct to some degree.  we had kick-out doors that could be opened and closed with ease.  rhit had a deployable training wheel on one side that they rolled off of a bunch.  olin had a really cool training wheel that used the motion of the rear wheel to lower.  it failed before they could use it during competition, though.  they ended up sticking a leg out of the fairing when they stopped.  toronto's failed as well, so they cut a hole in their fairing.  this hurts them a lot, especially since they want to keep using the vehicle.  however, the other option was to fall over every time they wanted to stop.  not a great option.  missouri had the coolest landing gear, although not the best.  it was on a little electric motor that swept a pair of wheels down just in front of the rear wheel.  i never saw it fail and it looked seriously very cool going up and down.  it looked like something that would end up on it if they ever made a real vehicle.  we went for the ""dead simple"" method and just kicked them out.  we had a string to pull them shut, but we didn't even use the doors for the endurance competition since we didn't want to have a failure.  if it was a higher-speed course we would have left them on, but it was hilly and technical rather than really fast.  having said all of that:  we wanted to do something different than ucf's trike last year.  as i think i mentioned before, there were two ucf teams this year, but one decided on the day before competition not to come.  really disappointing, as we wanted to compete with their trike.  we wanted to show up with something cool to set us apart from them, as well.  in terms of stability, our frame was *perfectly* balanced.  the first time i sat on it stationary i was able to put my feet on the pedals and hold my arms out for something like 6-8 seconds without even leaning before falling.  even at 3-5mph speeds, you had full balance of the vehicle.  besides the frame design, our steering boom gave us a ton of tiller ([look here if you don't know what that is](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html).  this meant we had to turn a lot at low speeds to keep balance, but at high speed had an amazing time keeping it straight and steady.  they said we were the slowest team to do the low-speed safety test of 100ft at 3-5 mph, and we were still the best balanced of the teams on bikes.  once you get used to our kind of odd steering where you sweep left and right opposite the direction you want to turn, this thing is beautiful to ride.  it's very natural since you're doing most of your steering from leaning.  you can get a pretty far lean on this thing - i tried to scrape those side mounts more than once before we cut them down.  basically, what i'm trying to say is:  yes, two wheels is harder, but you can offset that with a good design, which we did.  **why did you go for 7005 aluminum instead of something lighter like kevlar/nomex/aramid honeycomb core with a carbon fiber layer (or even saran wrap) on the outside?**  catrike donated materials for the frame, so that was the big factor.  other than that, cost, complexity, and safety (risk of failure) were the big motivating factors not to make a complex frame.  i'd be willing to explore this with a bigger budget if i ever did it again, though.  we have a ton of honeycomb left that we'll probably leave for next year, but i might try to break off a piece for science.  ps, the frame is pretty light.  basically everything that's powdercoated white is 12 lb.  **what was the final weight of the wind breaker?**  i believe it was 76.4 or 76.5 lb.  it was well above our design weight, but the rideable frame was 21-22 lbs.  the fairing was just plain heavy.  it was strong and thick, but maybe too much.  **why did you opt for a recumbant vs. a prone bike?  it seems like by facing forward you could put more weight into your pedals and maybe have more control.**  the control part may be true, but you produce more power from a ""sitting"" position.  msoe [built one this way](http://people.msoe.edu/~eckersoa/cadence/index.htm) a few years ago but the issues we saw with it were power, comfort, and mostly balance.  such an unnatural feeling - ours is a 45Âº seat angle, which is high for a recumbent but actually produces an amazingly natural feel.  it's a fantastic balance between an upright and recumbent bike.    if you have questions about rider power (or really anything about bicycles or riders) you should check out ""bicycling science"" by david gordon wilson. phenomenal resource that helped us plan out gearing optimized to rider leg power.  **how do you keep cool enough? i'd be pouring sweat after 2 hours in that thing and would be overheating so much i wouldn't be going too fast.**  the high on saturday was something like 40Âºf, and sunday it got into the 60s.  both competitions were in the morning, and most riders were cold rather than warm.  we rode without our hatch and doors for the endurance, and were perfectly comfortable.  i can't say much about teams with enclosed vehicles, though.  all i can predict is that they were loud inside, as those things always are.  also, riders could do from 3 to 11 laps.  we got through five of our six riders, with lap times as low as 4-5 minutes each.  i think i was in the vehicle the longest (like 40-45 minutes) but i also came into the pit twice - once because we had to adjust our steering and boom and once because we got black flagged for safety (a part vibrated loose and its mount looked unsafe to them).  **why no disc or aero wheels?**  aero wheels: cost.  wheel covers: simplicity, since they're extremely difficult to make work on wheels with cantilever brakes (which we had on the rear).  we were going to make a rear wheel fairing but didn't have the time.  another week and we would have made one from carbon and kevlar.  **what was your favorite thing you learned?**  i made a bike frame!  i want to make another one for personal use.  it's really neat that i worked on it with very little input on the actual dimensions from my teammates, since i know start to finish how every adjustment affected every other measurement, and got to see something go from my mind to paper to cad to a physical thing.  engineering is awesome.  i do want to build my own custom-fit to me, though.  it was pretty simple once you figured out what to do.  the hardest part was making a welding jig to hold it all in place.  really neat science to that.  it's easy if you have 8020 aluminum parts to set it up, but we used wood since we couldn't afford the few hundred or thousand bucks that would have cost.  **what would you change if you could do it all over again?**  i spent a bunch of time thinking about this on sunday during the 17 hour drive back.  if i could do it again, here's what i'd do.  if i did another two-wheeled design (which i probably would), i would make a thinner fairing with fewer layers.  the monocoque designs where the frame and fairing are basically inbuilt (see rhit, toronto, missouri) are very cool, but i don't think that needs to happen to be successful. i would definitely not make a composite rollcage.  we made ours so thick and heavy because if it failed we were out of the competition, even if it failed during testing.  we didn't want to be screwed.  i'd make an aluminum rollbar in the future as part of the frame.  if i was making a personal bike, i wouldn't make a rollbar, and if i did it would be much thinner than that and probably removable so it could be replaced.    maybe a bit lower seating position, if only to get better chain routing than the craziness that we had.  i would keep the rear drive wheel to use that 700.  that thing functioned beautifully.  **if i built a trike?**  lower, lightweight, still a 700 in the back, and wheel fairings.  i think you could make one of these that worked very well in the competition if you made some changes to last year's ucf trike.  here are my thoughts on how we could have taken theirs and dominated the competition:  - change their 24"" rear wheel to something larger  - use thinner tires all around  - minimize the size of the fairing, make it more aerodynamic - there was plenty of room and pretty poor visibility.  it could definitely have been made more aerodynamic by bringing the section near the rider's knees down.  - wheel fairings that turn with the wheel.  basically what i'm saying is [make a plane with no wings](http://i.imgur.com/skrmb) for the fairing.  - minimize the fairing all around.  last year's was made to have plenty of room.  ours was made to the largest rider for each dimension (height, width, etc).  toronto's bike is literally built to the exact dimensions of their largest rider and nothing more.  here are [one](http://i.imgur.com/liyk6), [two](http://i.imgur.com/8nnxv), [three](http://i.imgur.com/vhynf) cad images from toronto that shows what i mean.  i wouldn't go *that* extreme, but something would be a step in the right direction.",0,,

""what would look right on the edge of healthy? i'm not sure...150 sounds about right."" how about 200lbs. i honestly have no idea what's normal. i had a love of *very* overweight friends growing up (getting close to 300 pounds after graduation at their biggest) and they all mocked me for being ""skin and bones"" while also hating their own bodies. thus, i always figured 150 was slightly larger than ""normal"" because every girl i met who looked normal--that is, larger than me, but not as large as my friends--always, *always* said ""i'm 140 lbs."" it's just a number that stuck with me. i realize some women have never been under 150 lbs and still look amazing and love their bodies, but i don't think they'd *like me* because i look so much smaller and weaker than them.  my whole life people have said i look anorexic (or ""too, chubby for my frame"" depending on the person) so it's not like i have a healthy, normal view of women. i just want to date someone petite like me so i don't feel like such a freak. i haven't ever hit 5' 0"" tall, and i broke 100 lbs earlier this year for the first time ever, and i'm actually 115 now. i've never gained more than 5 lbs. a year in my whole life, i don't think. if bbw literally is ""big beautiful woma(e)n"" and ""real women have curves,"" then i'm a freak and i just want to date other freaks, you know?",1,0,
551327,"to an incredibly beautiful 39 year old  chinese american teacher from san francisco. i was 15 at the time.  i met her at a conference. a group of male teachers and conferees, including my father, were hitting on her in a pretty rude way,  so i 'rescued' her by jumping into the conversation. they couldn't do that in front of a kid. later, we left for a walk. somehow we struck up a friendship, i wound up in her hotel room, sitting on a small couch with her right next to me in  her bright red silk chinese dress. she was slender and tiny, even smaller than me even though i was less than 5 feet tall at the time.  so shapely and the dress revealed just enough of her bust and shoulders to drive me insane. we were turned toward each other, and looking at her made me feel like i would burst into flames. so as background, 15 year olds wore crazy clothes at the time - i did - anyway, tight, tight pants and a silk shirt. i started getting really excited and my dinkle started going down my pants leg - i couldn't help it, and she obviously noticed. i kept having to adjust myself, as it went longer and longer down my thigh. i excused myself for a minute to go to the bathroom to adjust - orienting it up so at least i would be able to stand up when she booted me from her room. but that meant there was more freedom for it to grow. from an early age, it was very long and very, very thick - more later on that.  it was really obvious that i had a raging hard-on when i came back to the couch. i could feel the head pushing up past the waistband of my pants, and i could see her peeking at it, disbelieving but very interested. i noticed she'd taken her long hair down, removed her shoes, unbuttoned a few buttons at the top of her dress, exposing more cleavage, and curled her legs up under her to face me on the couch. she'd poured herself some wine. i thought she'd had a bra on a moment earlier, but i saw none now as her nipples stood out under her dress. she motioned me to sit, aligning me so we faced each other. the elephant dick in the room: since age 10 or so when i'd taken my first shower in front of other boys at school, i'd gotten warped ideas about sex from my friends - mostly, i think, due to the fact that i was the boy in my school with the really large dick. news had spread like wildfire, and my life was never the same. i was very self-conscious about it, because i got teased or asked about it all the time. people acted strangely around me. my only exposure to sexual topics was through the lens of big dickdom, and i'm sorry to say, being molested twice by men, soccer coaches, who'd become obsessed when they learned about my unit (but i don't think of that as having much to do with my virginity). so there we are talking about school and teaching and books and the city we were in, when suddenly she broaches the topic of my penis. it must have been impossible to ignore as the head literally poked out up beyond the waistband of my pants, then between the buttons on the lower part of my disco-style silk shirt, then out into the open and straight up toward the ceiling. she just stopped talking mid-sentence and stared right at it. knowing she was looking right at my cock made it spasm again and again, getting thicker and longer.. a little liquid started coming out of the uncut tip - the liquid was pre-cum - my head expanding and pushing out past the fleshy folds of my foreskin. total silence as her big eyes cycled from my cock, looked right into mine, then back to my penis, again and again. i knew she was looking, she knew i knew, i even think she like that i knew, but i was too shy to do or say a thing. i had mostly not known when girls liked me, and even when i knew they were after the big dong they'd heard about through the grapevine, i lacked the confidence to make a move. even when i'd let girls play with it, they'd always made the first move. i didn't know what to do, and neither did she, it seemed. but she eventually figured it out. after what seemed like minutes, she said, ""wow, you seem to have a problem there, a big problem."" it seemed that she liked it -- she was smiling -- but still i thought she might mean she was insulted. i said i was sorry, and confessed that i was really attracted to her, i couldn't help it getting big in front of her. i started to cover it up with my shirt so i could go, but she quickly grabbed my hands to stop me, almost panicky. she said it was okay, natural, and to leave it as it was. she even straightened my shirt a bit, pulling it down around my cock so even more poked through, and then kept on staring, her face moving closer, with intense interest. i'd turned a little when she grabbed my hands and now it was pointed straight at her face, not far away at all. as she leaned forward, i caught glimpses of her braless breasts, hair flowing down the nape of her neck, her slender, muscled back. my cock twitched, throbbed, and swelled even more, the head poking all the way out of the foreskin, moving toward her face just inches away. she looked up, startled. i apologized again, but she interrupted and said she was flattered, that it felt good to know she could make me get so big and so hard, since she was so much older than me. she was getting very flushed, and i could see her nipples really hard, something i'd never seen before. she didn't look old to me; she looked so amazing. it grew even bigger and redder. she sat staring at it for a bit, then said she liked looking at it, it was a very natural thing and i should be proud, not embarrassed. eventually, we restarted the conversation, my thing between us, and she asked me if i'd ever had sex. i said no, and she continued to ask questions. how far had i gone with girls? did i have a girlfriend? did i get that way often? she continued to look at it as she shared that she'd only been with chinese men. her husband, she said, was very tall but quite small down there and sex was not at all interesting to her. then she moved the conversation to the size topic. she asked me if i knew it was big. yes, i said.  really big? yes, i said, that's what people say around the neighborhood and at school. no, she said, i mean, really, really big. we probably talked about it for half an hour or so, and it was clear to me that she was getting turned on at the size, talking about it openly, and that i was just a teenage boy. she asked if i'd ever had wine, and she poured us both some. now she was completely flushed and obviously excited. i coud see her hands trace her breasts absent-mindedly, or go in between her legs, touching a little, as she talked about how special it was, that i had a gift. how i would make some girl very lucky. how if only she weren't married, a teacher, and too old for a child. it was painful to me, because i knew then that nothing would happen with her, i'd made her horny, but that was all because of her strict upbringing. so close to sex with the most beautiful woman i'd ever seen. she asked me if i'd showed it to other people, and i said yes some of the girls in my school and neighborhood, that several girls had played with it, enough to make it shoot with their hands, even a blowjob from a high school girl when i was 12, but no sex. and of course the boys at school knew all about it and were always putting me up to trying to seduce girls or even teachers, though it'd never happened. i felt frozen there on the couch, unable to make the first move, and knowing she would never do it. she touched my arm. it was electric, more wetness came flowing out of the end - maybe more than a little.  seeing this, she bit her lip, sighed, and asked me to show her more, so i did. once i'd lowered my pants and she could see the whole thing, i could see she was really surprised, even shaken up. just a string of ""wows"" and ""i've never seen anything like that"" ""it can't be real"" and disbelief, but still no contact. she asked me to pull on it, taking great delight when i pulled the foreskin up over the head and back down. she even put her hands on my forearms as i pulled on it, moving my hands up and down, pointing it directly to her face, but she wouldn't touch it. just incredible tension and heat between us. she reached her hands for it a few times, but pulled her hands back, saying no to herself, i can't, he is just a boy. so we were there, and i wondered if i would just be frozen there until she asked me to leave. i knew i would be unable even to zip up all the way - i'd have to left my pants unbuttoned, mostly unzipped, my dong held in and my pants up only by the belt, half my cock poking up past my pants, visible under the thin silk of my disco shirt. thinking i'd have to walk all the way through a crowded conference back to my room... anyone who looked at me would see, a familiar and embarrassing sensation for me. i tried always to avoid erections in public, as i was really quite short and skinny at the time, under 5 feet tall, and it was a ridiculous sight - a small boy who looked about 11 or 12, freckle-faced and innocent, and this completely ridiculous, fake-looking, dildo-sized boner sticking up under his shirt. so i started to pull my pants up, but it was too big, too hard, and i said i didn't think i could zip it up all the way. hearing that it might go away, she finally got the courage, and she said ""don't."" she asked if she could touch it, just to see what it felt like, but i had to understand, definitely no sex. i said yes. she repeated it several times - no sex. then she reached out to the head, squeezing it, almost milking it, getting some of the pre-cum on her fingertips, her long nails polished in red. she spread pre-cum around on the head and then dabbed more to her fingertips, holding it up to examine it in the lamp light. then she did maybe the sexist thing ever - she reached down and dabbed some more pre-cum, rubbed it together in her fingers, then lifted it to her nose and smelled it deeply, and seeming not even to notice, touched it to her face, then between her breasts. it glistened in the soft light, painting her features. then very deliberately so i could see, she delicately dabbed more pre-cum -- my cock was leaking now, down the head and shaft -- and from her fingers, put it between her legs, reaching inside her panties to put it between her pussy lips, then inside. she did this several times, pulling up from the bottom of the shaft, the foreskin over the head, then back down, milking it, gathering the clear liquid on her fingers, and reaching inside her panties to put it inside her. i could see the outline of those lips through her sheer red panties. open wide, the clit standing up, the lips wet with a mixture of pre-cum, her juice, sweat, and desire. then she stroked my dick a little, then more forcefully. it got even bigger, and she let out little sighs and moans, excited but conflicted. she seemed to be in agony, her wants on one side, her strict morals on the other. she repeated ""no sex"" and ""stop"" to herself often, louder over time, but she didn't stop. she reached to rub her clit furiously every minute or so, quietly whispering that she was going to come. she must have kept it in her hands, fondling it and looking at it from different angles, for another 20 or 30 minutes. first one hand, then two, then she kneeled on the floor in front of me, her face even closer to it. she examined my testicles, commenting ""so big"" as well.  ""you must have so much saved up,"" she said. then she put her face to my balls and inhaled deeply through her nose, telling me it smelled so sexy. she said it smells like raging teenage hormones. she looked up at me and said one more time, ""no sex!,"" trying to convince herself, almost shouting, her hands still wrapped around my cock. but she stayed there, stroking it with two hands. she seemed fascinated by the size, the way the foreskin moved up over the head, the veins, tracing her nails over every little detail, the sensation excruciating for me.. eventually, she seemed to rationalize, some things are not sex and would be okay.  she leaned forward, opening her mouth, her tongue reaching out to tickle the head, then the tip of her tongue going in the peehole as she pulled the foreskin up, then down. every time she pulled my foreskin up, she would try to insert the tip of her tiny tongue into my peehole, as if searching for more pre-cum. when pulling it down, she would open her mouth and try to take in the whole head -- it seemed impossible -- or move back a couple inches to look at the foreskin. my balls felt like they would explode, and as she gave me a little head, just kissing and tasting it and swirling her tongue into my peehole, only for a few seconds i felt my cock and balls respond by pumping a mini shot of semen into her mouth. not a full orgasm, but not the clear leaking pre-cum she'd had. she seemed thunderstruck.  she raised up a little and stuck out her tongue with white liquid on it. with her middle finger, she dabbed the semen from her tongue and looked at it in the lamplight. she licked her finger, swirled the cum in her mouth as if to taste it, and swallowed. i could see her realize how far we'd gone as she tasted then swallowed my semen. the cum seemed to set her off. suddenly, she lost all control, stood up, grabbed me, and pulled me back toward her bed in raw desperation. she pulled up her dress and yanked her panties forcefully to one side, reached with bith hands to grab me by the cock, and jammed it inside her as far as she could manage, her hands reaching around to my ass to pull me in. it was a revelation, my virginity lost. of course i couldn't fit all the way, but that didn't matter to me because i'd never felt  anything so good, and the fact that it was far too big for her only turned her on even more. it was a great experience, very gentle and loving in its own way, but also incredibly fierce. she showed me all sorts of positions, always trying to see how much she could fit, telling me to fuck her hard, hit her cervix, and so on. how different she was from the demure teacher i'd first met. she said she couldn't stop cumming, yelling ""big cock!"" again and again. finally she told me to shoot inside her, and she slowed it down maddeningly, torturing me slowly as she squeezed the cum out of me with her tight pussy muscles. kegel and ben wa, she would later explain. later that night, after we'd done it a couple more times, she also taught me that caring for one's partner  matters more than raw sex. it makes raw sex better. she taught me to be focused not on my experience, but on the woman's. so until that experience, the only thing i thought that mattered about sex was that i had a really large dick. at the same time, she confessed that she'd never realized she had a fetish for size. can one be a sex addict if one's never had full-on sex, or engaged in the thing that makes one an addict?  for me, i'd only had oral and handling by girls as sexual experiences, and the mind-binding torture of having been molested by men. for her, she'd always thought of herself as not particularly sexual, even though people saw her that way. she'd never realized her fetish. to me, yes, one can be an addict even as a virgin, if you count fapping or everything but going all the way.  over the years, i went out to see her in san francisco a few times. we spent a few secret vacations together. the sex and the love were always amazing. she visited me on the east coast a few times, and we carried on for about 15 more years. she remained happily married, with kids. i had many relationships - too many, and only calmed down after i married. she's probably the reason i had asian fever for so many years, nearly wrecking my life to get a flavor of that sweetness i'd experienced that first time. later, in desperation i did a few asian chick-big dick porn videos. not a way to make a living. not exactly a mistake because it led to better things, but not the high point of my life. i'm glad i got out of that business and that i'm no longer defined by the size of my dinkle. it's been 34 years.  it's not just that she was beautiful on the outside - she was a beautiful person all around. i don't think she exploited me in any way - she was just vulnerable and totally possessed by one thing, penis size, the same way i was owned by asian women.  she's 73 now. i haven't talked to her in some years, but i wish her well. she wasn't just my first, she was the right one. it took me many years to learn all the lessons she taught me, but now that i know, i'll never forget.",0,,

tragic flaw became obvious with their methods.  *a mail-lord will do anything to deliver his parcel!* veelopen chuckled to himself, placing a crimson claw onto scorched grass as he stepped from the thirteenth magic postal office via gate spell.  â€œyour quarry should be in that camp.â€ a voice meekly spoke from the rippling cyan tear in space. veelopen turned to the source â€“ a man wearing blue robes.  fierce, the demonologist in charge of human-to-demon interactions at this office. his face looked comparable to the bone white of a splinter fiend, and his protruding cheekbones made the resemblance that much more uncanny. he ran a hand through his scraggly black hair, and a few pieces fell out. bags underneath his near-soulless eyes finished off his facial appearance in a sad sort of way.  he stabbed a finger again at the hill in the distance, a primitive palisade surrounding a large column of smoke atop it. â€œthat way, veel.â€  veelopen nodded, patting the mail bag at his bony hip. â€œi'll be off then!â€ he declared, bringing a claw to his forehead, as if shielding his eyes from the sun. the humans called it a 'salute', fierce said it conveyed respect.  fierce weakly waved, and the portal shut with a clap, leaving only wisps of blue smoke behind. veelopen inhaled the crisp summer air as he walked, each step tickling his clawed feet with emerald blades of grass. up ahead, two green humanoids with flattened heads, nasty tusks, and floppy ears snorted at him. both had spears, and primitive hide armor. they stepped in between him and the wooden gate.  â€œgreetings gentlemen!â€ veelopen started, and the two guards exchanged looks. â€œi have mail for a... mr oxi?â€ he said, reading the envelope from the bag.  â€œno oxi in camp.â€ the bigger one grunted, and the other nodded with an ugly grin.  veelopen traced a nail along the recipient's name. â€œfirst name malik?â€  the larger one sneered, and shook its head. the smaller one looked at his superior, confused.  â€œno maliks at all?â€ veelopen asked.  â€œwe have prisoner named malik.â€ the small guard blurted, earning a kick in the stomach from the larger guard.  â€œah, i see.â€ veelopen nodded. â€œdon't worry, i won't disturb your ceremonies, i'm only here to deliver this envelope.â€ he spread the corners of his mouth wide, displaying his teeth. fierce called this a smile, it supposedly a display of friendliness. the smaller guard trembled in fear.  â€œleave.â€ the more competent guard puffed out his muscles, definitely trying to look intimidating, despite not even being tall enough to come up to veelopen's elbow.  â€œi'm sorry sirs, i simply can't do that.â€ veelopen placed the envelope in his bag. â€œi have a parcel to deliver.â€ he countered with intimidation of his own, a single whip of his tail, shattering a small rock with the blow.  the muscular guard turned to the other, barking out an order. â€œget more orcs.â€ his underling nodded, and dashed through the door. a second later, the sound of wood sliding on the other side rang out. veelopen's opponent brandished his spear at the ready. â€œlast chance red monster.â€  â€œi'm sorry it came to this then.â€ veelopen flexed his claws. like any demon, mail-lords possessed natural fighting instincts. however, during their work, they had discovered several flaws with their talents. for one, any metal armor was very hard to pierce with regular claws, and arrows were surprisingly effective against their hide.  to remedy this, all mail-lords were taught basic magic combat spells, such as enchantments for their claws, or a fly spell. as demons, their sources of mana were near endless, and they had a frightening aptitude for learning magic. they were devastating combatants, and the guild was happy to have them on their side. veelopen smiled as his foe charged.  lightning fast, he went through the motions for a simple firebolt spell. the orc's eyes went wide as a flaming sphere formed in veelopen's claws, and then streaked outward, slicing clean through his previously hide protected chest. his foe fell as a roar erupted from the other side of the gate.  *sounds like reinforcements have arrived!* veelopen started the gestures for his next spell. *looks like my work is cut out for me.* he leaped backward as the gate shot open, a formidable horde of orcs equipped with hide armor and a variety of weapons. veelopen dodged a javelin, and activated a defensive spell â€“ magi-shield. a warm cyan glow washed over his scarlet hide, deflecting a javelin and a dozen arrows.  â€œkill red monster!â€ an enormous orc decreed from the rear of the mob. his swarm charged, belting out both battle crys and javelins. veelopen frantically formed his next spell as magi-shield's effects started weakening, a javelin making it through his shielding and embedding itself loosely in his shoulder.  â€œmy apologies in advance!â€ he shouted, finishing the spell and producing a similar amber orb. he hurled it into the center of the mass. surprised, a few orcs stepped away from it, but it was too late. the orb exploded outward, sending a wave of orange flames outward, obliterating orcs like a fiery eraser.  veelopen stumbled forward, almost toppling over. fireball was a very powerful spell, and one that *technically* he wasn't supposed to know. excluding other spells, most skilled mages could cast it at most twice per day. he could cast it up to eleven times, hence why demons weren't supposed to be taught it. fierce had been kind enough to teach it to him, provided he kept it under wraps. unfortunately, the amount of mana it absorbed in an instant was very jarring, and unskilled casters usually lost consciousness. either way, another fireball so soon would be a bad idea.  the majority of the orcs dead, the largest was now much more easily visible. each stomp of its armored boot left a firm impression in the ground. its snot-colored gut protruded outward â€“ likely stuffed with some poor farmer's livestock â€“ as the metal plate shielding its belly buckled with each movement. atop its flat head, a massive helmet rested, thankfully obscuring its hideous face. in its grimy hands, it held a massive greatsword. blatantly magical runes ran along the ebony blade, each serrated edge glowing white with magic.  â€œfight me demon!â€ it belched, piercing the air toward veelopen with a fat finger. â€œgorag will eat you!â€  *eat?* â€œsorry, did you mean, *defeat*?â€  gorag slapped a meaty hand to his bulging gut. â€œeat!â€  *eeugh.* veelopen cringed. â€œvery well, gorag! i will fight you, on the condition that if i win, your orcs let me deliver my parcel unharmed!â€  gorag grunted affirmatively, then roared a battle cry, charging veelopen with horrific speed, each thundering step leaving a crater in its wake. *woah! he's fast!* veelopen rapidly weaved a firebolt spell. he hurled it, but the fat orc cartwheeled to the side, easily dodging the flaming streak.  â€œgorag eat good tonight\~!â€ gorag cackled, reaching sword range. veelopen darted to the side as the massive blade chopped the air where he had been a split second ago. his foe unleashed a flurry of barely predictable slashes in rapid succession, forcing veelopen to concentrate on not getting killed.

(and that's not just a little bulge from sitting down. she's sucking it in and it's still folding over and resting on her legs.)  that's great if people want to feel comfortable in their own skin, even if they do have a little extra of it... but that doesn't obligate me to find them attractive, fat and all. and it certainly doesn't make me some shallow jerk or something if i don't find them attractive that way.  i once made a point to a rather heavy girl once as we were sitting at a bar. she was giving me a hard time about whether or not i found her attractive, and when i said that i didn't really because of her weight, she was furious and started calling me names and saying how much i was missing out etc, how shallow i was. so to illustrate my point, i pointed at a guy who was sitting at the bar who was built the same way she was and said ""do you find him attractive?"" and she said ""no."" and i responded then why should i be obligated to find you attractive, and why am i some horrible person if i don't? (she conceded the point, but wasn't happy about it)  frankly i'm sick of all the backlash from fat girls today (generally much worse than the girl in the picture this discussion is about) toward men who don't find them attractive. there are plenty of men that do, and those of us who don't are not obligated to, nor are we shallow woman hating men with unrealistic expectations of women. we simply find skinnier girls attractive, and there are plenty of them out there. they're not abnormal for being thin either, as this fervent effort to promote fat girls as ""normal"" seems to imply. they're normal too. not anorexic, or bulimic, etc just because they're thin. some girls are born thin or petite in the same way that some girls are born heavier etc.  beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and people should be able to feel beautiful... but that doesn't make people who look different than them horrible people or abnormal.  (of course for me i qualify that with ""within reason"", as i find morbidly obese people to be revolting, but some people love it... so...)  don't reverse the hate just because you feel angry at not being in the popular club that has been dominated by the skinny girls. trends come and go, and a century or two ago ""voluptuous"" women were all the rage. it's simply a reflection of cultural attitudes and changes with the passage of time.  normal is a wide range of shapes and colors. there is someone out there for everyone, it's just a matter of finding them.  (a few closing notes: ""as average body mass increases in western nations, people view an increasingly larger amount of body fat as ""normal"" or ""acceptable"".[26] people are especially likely to take cues on acceptable body size from their social circle, gaining weight concurrently with those around them.[27]"" from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/female_body_shape this is something that has bothered me as during my lifetime i have seen this perception of ""normal"" in the younger generations shift toward increasingly heavy girls. that's fine for them if they find it attractive, but i never have and it only becomes more striking to me as the girls continue to get heavier and more and more people start talking about how attractive they find these heavier girls.)",1,–2,

530874,"> does anyone have a good langform report on how boeing shit the bed so throughly. i remember how abrupt the narrative shifted after the 737max fiasco grounded their fleet and all of a sudden there where reports everywhere about their issues.   a few things:  - in the early 2000s boeing moved their headquarters to chicago. a city they have no connection to. it meant that management were no longer in close proximity to engineers and the production lines. in 2022 they decided it was time to get things right and move headquarters again, but to a location that meant management would be close to the people that mattered most; washington dc with the politicians and defense department.   - 787 initial development. during the 787's development, it was an ""all things to all people"" kind of situation. boeing promised everything: more range, lower fuel consumption than anything else, cheaper production costs than anything else, better economics than anything else. and they were going to build more of them faster than anyone else. one by one these all were hollowed out. carbon fibre is actually substantially more expensive than aluminium (and the related engineering), so boeing had to cut production costs. various fuselage parts were outsourced to italy (vought), wings to japan (fuji heavy industries iirc), slats/flaps to australia etc. boeing then also sold off their division that made fuselage sections in kansas (it became spirit aerosystems). all of this saved/raised money, but all of it meant that boeing had far less control and oversight of these subcontractor's operations.   - 787 certification. as it got closer to unveiling the first 787 it became more and more clear that boeing was largely clueless about manufacturing with carbon fibre. when the 787 was unveiled to the public, it had to be rushed inorder to be shown to the public on 07/8/07. the aircraft unveiled to the public on that day was literally held together with fastners from home depot down the road in everett. it was going to be a month between unveiling and first flight, but boeing had to announce delay after delay after delay due to production issues and being unsure about the strength (and longevity) of the center wing box. eventually it had it's first flight in 2009.  - 787 production. because the program had so many delays with certification (and subsequent fixes), 'production' aircraft being assembled were not at the same standard as what the faa had certified. consequently, there were many aircraft rolling off the production line, not being compliant with the type certificate and needing to be reworked. this was an enormous issue. many of the 787 'terrible teens', 787 numbers 13 through 19 were assembled in 2007 but didn't have their first flight or get delivered until 2017 or 2018. initial production aircraft were vastly overweight; 4 tonnes for early build aircraft. boeing didn't get weight to below what was promised until 787 number 190. because there was so much catch up, it's estimated that no 787s were cashflow positive until a similar point. boeing managed to 'hide' this via program accounting. scummy but legal. https://theaircurrent.com/tac-explains/program-accounting/  - 737 program. at this point the 787 had been taking up so many engineering resources that boeing was blindsided by airbus launching the re-engined airbus a320neo in 2011. boeing claimed that this new airplane was just 'catching up' to their 'market leading' 737-800 and that they didn't need to repond to it. at the paris airshow 2011, the market spoke; airlines collectively ordered something like 2000 a320neos in the space of a few days. i remember it at the time - things were fucking crazy. every hour and a half or so there would be a new press conference hosted by airbus; 70 a320neos ordered here. 50 ordered by another customer. a lessor wants 40. loyal 737 customer orders 60. it was fucking insane. **the tide had gone out and boeing was swimming naked**. some time passes and more 737 customers defect to airbus. wall street is not happy boeing is forced to react.   - boeing launches a warmed over re-engine program of the 737, called the 737max. this clusterfuck is well documented, so i'll not talk further about it here. boeing had thought previously that they would launch a clean sheet design as the 737 replacement, but this would cost a lot of money for development. more money to develop it means less free cashflow. wall street would not be happy. airbus' re engining of the a320neo meanwhile was a relatively cheap and simple program, so boeing figured that they would do the same.   - boeing also launches a longer version of the 787, the 787-10. it has most of the capacity of the 777-9x but much lower costs and is more optimized for shorter flights, cannibalizes many of the 777-9xs potential sales. thankfully this doesn't matter too much because the 777-9x sold quite well initially.   - with boeing having promised so much with the 787 in terms of low production costs, the fact that they'd also sold a huge portion of their orderbook at very low prices was becoming a problem. boeing's solution was to announce a new 787 production line in charleston, south carolina. this was largely a unionbusting move; south carolina is not a union friendly state. the plan was to assemble 787s in south carolina, pay the workers there peanuts and reap in the profits. it was a shitshow. turns out that hiring people who have no aerospace background, giving them absolutely minimal training then paying them peanuts means that your quality control turns to shit. which it did, predictably. lots and lots more issues with aircraft needing rework due to the production line moving faster than what the new south carolina employees could handle. the thing with quality control though is that it only matters if you care about quality control. many boeing executives looked the other way. although south carolina was a mess, it had lowered costs a lot, so boeing executives were happy and their bonuses were fat. there's plenty of articles you can look up about charleston 787 production line quality control issues. aljazeera did a documentary about it - supposedly because the egotistical head of qatar airways got angry about how shoddy the quality control was (this is a guy who refused delivery of his airlines a380s for months because the carpets wern't perfect). air india takes the first charleston built 787 in 2012.   - because boeing had outsourced so much production of 787 parts, there were huge issues with quality control and oversight. boeing could barely do quality control of their own operations, quality control of their suppliers seemed to be nonexitant at this point.   - it's 2013. in january a japan airlines 787-8 at boston has a fire in it's electronics bay. a week later a ana airlines 787-8 has a battery fire in flight, causing an emergency landing. the 787 gets grounded. a few months later boeing comes up with a solution (basically a big, thermally resistant battery cover). the 787 is ungrounded.    - airbus' a350 is selling very well and sales of boeing's 777-300er are starting to dry up and the program is starting to reach it's end of life. the 777-300er was actually quite fortunate in that, like the airbus a330, it was able to gain more sales due to delays with the 787 and a350. the 777-300er was god's gift to airline economics and boeing was making a shittonne of money from it and from the boeing 777 freighter. boeing decides the future of the 777 program in november 2013; they launch the 777x. a longer version, with even bigger engines and a massive carbon fibre folding wing. they optimise the aircraft for the middle east airlines. super long payload/range chart.  - partnering for success. with production of the 787 being a bit of a shitshow, boeing decided that their suppliers were making too much money and that they need a bigger slice of the pie. so they squeeze and squeeze and legally blackmail and squeeze the suppliers by forcing new contracts on them if they want to remain part of the 787 program. suppliers must lower costs, get paid later and find more efficiencies. several suppliers leave. partnering for success does nothing to address quality control issues, infact making many of them worse with suppliers now having much tighter margins and less money for oversight. https://leehamnews.com/2014/02/16/boeings-partnership-for-success-strains-supplier-relationship/  - it's 2017. the 737max has had it's first flight. the certification program is going on surprisingly well and, for once is actually on time. 787 issues seem to be sorting themselves out and boeing looks to try and muscle it's way to higher marketshare. it is decided that the 787 production rate will be hiked by 40% to 14 aircraft built per month. this will lower unit costs and let them sell at lower prices. this turns out to be much less of a shitshow than you might think, but mainly because the bulk of the extra aircraft get built at seattle/everett by the experienced employees. somewhere around this time boeing engages in more unionbusting shenanigans in seattle. some experienced employees have to make the choice between retirement, lower salary or being relocated to charleston. many take retirement. there's little in life that boeing management likes more than buying out experienced engineers from their contracts and replacing them with someone cheaper (or not replacing them at all). they did the same over covid, but on a much larger scale.   - it's october 2018. a brand new lionair 737-8max crashes into the java sea.     > it does seem a bit surprising that that they actually seem weaker than airbus now.  not really. let wall street run any firm and they will eventually run it all the way into the ground.",0,,
259815,"plagiarized from   http://www.spiked-online.com/articles/0000000cad43.htm  if americans had to be described with one word, there's a good chance it would be 'fat'. americans, we are constantly told, are the fattest people on the planet. obesity is rife. compared with other nations the americans are not just big, but super-size.  yet this obsession with obese americans is about more than body fat. certainly there is a debate to be had about the extent to which obesity is a problem in america - a discussion best left to medical experts. but a close examination of the popular genre on obesity reveals it is about more than consumption in the most literal sense of eating food. obesity has become a metaphor for 'over-consumption' more generally. affluence is blamed not just for bloated bodies, but for a society which is seen as more generally too big for its own good.  it is especially important to examine this criticism of american affluence in the aftermath of hurricane katrina. an assumption underlying much of the discussion is that, at the very least, wealth did america no good in its battle with nature. an editorial in last weekend's uk guardian caught the tone: 'america is the richest and most powerful country on earth. but its citizens, begging for food, water and help, are suffering agonies more familiar from sudan and niger. the worst of the third world has come to the big easy.' the implication is that america's wealth is somehow pointless.  a column in the washington post went even further, by advocating what it described as a confucian approach to the question. it argued that americans 'blithely set sail on churning seas and fly into stormy skies. we build homes on unstable hillsides, and communities in woodlands ripe for fire. we rely on technology and the government's largess to protect us from our missteps, and usually, that is enough. but sometimes nature outwits the best human efforts to contain it. last week's hurricane was a horrifying case in point. the resulting flooding offered brutal evidence that the efforts we have made over the years to contain nature - with channels and levees and other great feats of engineering - can contribute to greater catastrophes.' from this perspective, the pursuit of economic development is worse than useless: it may be well-intentioned but it only makes matters worse for humanity.  to understand how a disaster such as hurricane katrina can become an occasion for attacking american affluence, it is worth examining the fat metaphor in more detail. take super size me, the documentary in which morgan spurlock lives on nothing but mcdonald's food for a month. within the first minute the american flag is shown fluttering in the wind. the voiceover then says: 'everything's bigger in america. we've got the biggest cars, the biggest houses, the biggest companies, the biggest food - and finally - the biggest people.'  spurlock makes his assumptions even clearer in his follow-up book, don't eat this book. the first chapter discusses how america has become 'the biggest consuming culture on the planet' (1). he talks of how 'the epidemic of overconsumption that's plaguing the nation begins with the things we put in our mouths' (2).  other popular works on obesity make similar points. eric schlosser, author of fast food nation, says at the start: 'this is a book about fast food, the values it embodies, and the world it has made. fast food has proven to be a revolutionary force in american life; i am interested in it both as a commodity and as a metaphor.' (3) just how the big mac or chicken mcnugget can embody values, let alone make the world, is not made clear. schlosser frequently argues that such food has little nutritional value but he seems happy to endow it with incredible powers to influence society.  greg critser, a liberal and a democrat, and author of fat land, talks about food consumption in almost religious terms. like schlosser and spurlock he makes it clear that he is not talking about food alone. in chapter two of fat land he argues: 'bigness: the concept seemed to fuel the marketing of just about everything, from cars (suvs) to homes (mini-manses) to clothes (super-baggy) and then back again to food.' (4) in the same chapter he makes it clear that a key objection to mcdonald's is that it campaigned to override 'cultural mores against gluttony' (5). implicitly at least critser is arguing that the deadly sin of gluttony should be somehow rehabilitated.  making a connection between obesity and consumption is not limited to books about fat americans. it is a staple of many environmentalist texts. for example, jeremy rifkin makes a similar connection: 'the us gdp continues to expand along with our waistlines, but our quality of life continues to diminish.' (6) clive hamilton, an australian critic of economic growth, talks of overweight people 'revealing in such a confronting way our dirty secret of overconsumption' (7).  michael moore only refers to the obesity issue in passing - in stupid white men he argues: 'if you and i would eat less and drink less, we'd live a little longer.' (8) perhaps this is a sensitive issue for him, seeing as he is no lightweight. but he does criticise america for being number one in relation to several areas of consumption, including beef, energy, oil, natural gas and calories (9).  such arguments seem to have won considerable resonance both inside and outside america. according to the latest pew global attitudes survey, a comprehensive opinion poll of public attitudes in america and 16 other countries, the usa is routinely seen as greedy by western publics. for example, 67 per cent of the dutch, 64 per cent of britons and 62 per cent of canadians see americans as greedy. perhaps most striking of all, 70 per cent of americans see their fellow compatriots as greedy (10).  despite the huge volume of discussion on american obesity the key arguments put forward by the critics can be reduced to a few simple ingredients. each of these is open to question, although it is unfortunately rare for them to be critically scrutinised:  over-consumption is not just about food. food is being portrayed as simply the most conspicuous example of a society that consumes too many resources.  consumption is widely seen as a problem. at the very least it is regarded as incapable of making americans, or any other people, happy. at worst it is portrayed as having a down side or even being akin to a disease. so in their best-selling why do people hate america?, ziauddin sardar and merryl wyn davies argue that 'the ""virus"" of american culture and lifestyle replicates so readily because it is founded on the premise of abundance, the lure of affluence' (11). similarly, an american documentary and follow-up best-seller on affluence was called affluenza (12).  the sin of gluttony, it is widely argued, needs to be rehabilitated. usually the argument is put in secular rather than religious terms but the content is the same. what is being suggested is that a morality of limits needs to be popularised. people should apparently be encouraged to limit their consumption - whether the limits are voluntary or imposed by law. often controls on advertising are also favoured as it is seen as somehow propagating the culture of consumption.  let us examine each of these arguments in turn. then we can consider why the attack on consumption has come to the fore in recent years.  the end of hunger  the first argument has some truth to it, in that there is a close relationship between food consumption and the use of resources more generally. so criticising the pervasiveness of cheap food in rich societies can also be a way of attacking affluence. in other words, the wide availability of food can become a metaphor for large-scale consumption more broadly.  but critics of cheap food forget that its attainment is a considerable historical achievement. most of human history involved a constant struggle to find enough food. the battle against hunger was the norm. this is still true in much of the developing world, where the world bank estimates that 815million people ate too little to meet their daily energy needs in 2002 (13). so to have achieved a situation where, at least in the developed world, food scarcity is virtually eliminated is a tremendous achievement. as well as being good in itself, it also allows people to spend more time on other things rather than struggling to meet their most basic needs.  of course this does not mean that obesity cannot have negative consequences. but it should be recognised as a problem associated with success. food today is more plentiful and of better quality than ever before. no doubt quality can improve still further in the future and other factors, such as insufficient exercise, can be tackled. however, these are relatively small challenges compared with the historic battle to rid the world of the scourge of hunger.",1,–1,

[diva cup](http://divacup.com/) is probably the most popular / common brand, but i prefer [meluna](http://www.meluna.ca/) because they offer the great variety of sizes and grip styles.  edit: just realized in linking to the meluna site that the fda has changed regulations regarding menstrual cups and they can't ship to the us until they get approved. their fb page says that won't happen until next july at the earliest. laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame.",0,,

951492,"some warnings, some examples, and then some d/s weight loss suggestions:   please make sure she doesn't have a history of any disordered eating in her past before bringing this up. please also watch her for developing an eating disorder through this journey. it's s slippery slope for some people from wanting to loose weight to please a partner to not being able to stop restricting. watch the behavior--not the weight. being malnourished or having an eating disorder doesn't always mean looking like skin and bones.  also make sure that your goals for her are achievable for her.   as an example: i'm a very stocky build. i will never be anything smaller than a size 6 pants because that's literally how large my hip bones are. i will also never be smaller than 36inches around my chest because that's how big my rib cage is. i will literally never fit a dress size 4 because my bone structure is too large. when i work out i don't get thin really, i get toned even bulky muscles but i don't loose that many inches and i certainly don't look the traditional skinny.  i also have to be very careful with dieting because i was formerly a really fucked up anorexic/bulimic combo. which started from trying to please my parents by being as thin as my step sister who has a very lithe/slight build.   i also had a slightly dominant partner who used to tell me on a daily basis to loose 40lbs. he said it to me every day. he seemed fixated. which made me feel pretty defeatist about our relationship because there really wasn't a practical way for me to do that for him. we broke off our engagement eventually in large part due to this. i felt like since i wasn't physically his type and he made it clear it was important to him. i felt like i could never really please him. anyway, he ended up dating some tiny asian girl. pretty sure he's happier that way.   my switch husband took a different approach: he found me sexy and then his tastes changed. he used to be into very thin girls. his biggest turn on ons were bones that showed through skin. for some reason he had a thing for curvy, stocky me though probably because we were such good friends and felt open enough to talk about kink. that turned into a relationship. he found that he started looking less at skinny boney women and more at thicker girls, even when i wasn't around. i don't know how it happened or if it's repeatable, but it should be something you consider.   all that said if you're both still on board:   in a d/s context there are lots of fun ways to do this. have her check in with her food and portions via text or whatever for each meal when you aren't together. order for her or give her specific options to choose from if you are together. you could also make her her lunches if you're more of a daddy/care taking dom.   set small goals and have rewards for meeting them or finishments for not meeting them. i don't suggest actual punishments because that can really fuck with a persons view of food and body image. just make sure the rewards are more motivating then the funishments.   you can also make your play times together quite...aerobic. chase scenes, repetitive motions, static holding objects are all things we see in bdsm scenes all the time. why not put them all together in one? make a sexy work out. have fun with it. use orgasm torture or teasing as part of the work out. one idea off the top of my head that i would enjoy is to have her do squats onto a vibrator that you're holding at the correct height.",1,1,0
211165,"just read my comment over and i'll admit, it meanders, but this is what advice i can offer from my own adventures in big-guy sartorialism.  as a fellow big dude, let me say that you want to stick to a neutral color palate.  camel, grey, and blue are really where you want to be focusing your energy. you can add color through accent pieces.  i'd actually avoid h&amp;m or target for a little while, until you get down to a waist of around a 42 or lower.  h&amp;m doesn't stock above a true 38, which really just pisses me off.    what ever you decide to get for your first major purchase, you'll need to get it tailored. we big dudes think that we need everything looser than skinny dudes, when actually a true fit is even more important - baggy clothes will just make you look bigger than you are. to that end, never buy anything that says ""relaxed"", ""loose"" or ""baggy."" if you want to look slim, go for slimmer cuts. don't misunderstand - skinny cuts are a definite no go, but do get ""straight"" or ""regular"" cuts.   a well tailored, dark and darted suit can really improve your shape and give you a bit more of that masculine triangle.  ask for darting on the jacket, and get the pants tapered, and properly hemmed.  while for most guys, pleats are a huge no no, it can work for bigger guys.  i prefer a flat front, and i think you will, too. it looks cleaner. i like to minimize break, and i prefer a cuff, since it breaks up the leg.  since you're tall, a cuff might work for you, too.  big guys need to do what we can to avoid looking sloppy.  to that end, no sneakers at the office! i see a lot of other large guys in sneakers, or those black sneakers that no one thinks are dress shoes. come on, man. your shoe size probably won't change that much, so you can invest in good kicks now, and the rules for shoes are the same whether you're big or small - avoid anything with a heel if you can.  to start, since your office is casual, i'd suggest brown leather wing tips or some monk straps.  i know you said your job is business casual, but don't be afraid to rock a suit. a shirt and a tie without a jacket is bush league, son.  you're better than that. and, light-weight fabrics.  i know wearing heavier fabric can feel safer, like it's covering more up and drapes better, but a shirt that fits well and is made of a light fabric, like linen, will be much more comfortable than a dark heavy fabric, like certain cottons.     try shopping in a well curated vintage menswear shop.  i once saw a size 56 oxxford houndstooth cashmere jacket for $150 at keezers, which is a great shop in cambridge, ma. only time in my life i wished i wore a bigger suit size.  jos. a bank has some decent starter options for a bigger guy, but there aren't as many options.  don't go to mens wearhouse.  also, i say buy what you can now, and just keep getting it tailored down.  if you dress well while losing weight, you'll look and feel better, which will help you stay motivated.  so, that post got away from me there, but i hope you found some of it helpful.",1,1,0

803138,"firstly i think it depends on your definition of 'fat'. i always sigh inwardly when i see that word because it seems to include anyone slightly chubby to morbidly obese and there's a big difference inbetween. i would imagine a bit of a belly wouldn't be a deal breaker for most women, but then i can't speak for most women so who knows.  secondly, i always thought it strange that women are the main ones under pressure to be slim, because i usually think females can carry off extra weight better than men due to their inherent softness/higher fat to muscle ratio, though i guess that depends on body shape/weight distribution to a degree. i'm a straight woman, but i always thought overweight girls generally looked more attractive than overweight guys. yet there are a lot of men, even overweight themselves, who are still really critical of a girl's body and are after a slimmer girlfriend. (i'm not implying you're necessarily one of these people; this is just something i've generally observed.) i have a friend who told me his sister's boyfriend is overweight yet always makes snide remarks about fat girls and snarked at his (tall, slim) girlfriend for putting on weight during pregnancy. what the hell? maybe it's a covering-up-insecurity thing, but it really grinds my gears.   speaking for myself, i would say it depends on how you carry the weight, how healthy you are, and the rest of your appearance. i've never been particularly interested in people's bodies (visually i mean; what they do with them is an entirely different matter!); i'm a face (and hands) girl. looking into someone's eyes, seeing them smile, ruffling their hair, and again i like good dextrous hands. i can't say i would be particularly physically attracted to someone obese, but it really depends on the rest of the package. i suppose flab isn't really attractive, but the weight itself wouldn't bother me so much - i think it could be seen as positive in some ways, as some women like being 'enveloped' by their man, for him to physically 'overpower' her and i guess being cuddly is a plus. having said that, my long-term boyf is skinny and it seems the majority of people i've fancied tend to be skinny too - but that wasn't what attracted me to them (i don't usually go on appearance only, more some sort of magnetism), it just seems to go with the territory. (most of them smoke/d too, which is a turn-off for me in itself, just to prove my point.)   i'm speaking as a girl who's lost about 70lbs, if that makes any difference. my boyfriend found me attractive when i was larger &amp; we first got together, but personally i feel much better about myself now. i've never really done the 'dating' thing either and always used to think no one would want me, but i knew/know of lots of girls my size or bigger who never seemed to have problems with boyfriends, so i guess confidence/knowing un-superficial people is a part of it.",1,–1,

200402,"what you need to understand is that the two candidates are really not that different on a total political spectrum, with fascism on end right and communism on the end left. when you examine the political spectrum like this almost all candidates and politicians in america fall into the moderate category. in this microcosm of moderates you have mccain on the right , hillary in middle and slight left and obama a bit further left than hillary. if you examine this scale with only presidential candidates, which becomes the norm in political discussion, mccain is on the far right, hillary is in the middle and obama is arguably the most left and liberal of the political spectrum.   in the most basic of answers that means that those in the democrats party who are more inclined to the center and right will vote for hillary and if hillary is gone that means they will lean towards mccain.   of course i am sure the real answer your looking for is based on race and age of the candidates and your right, its probably the biggest unmentioned factor in the this election. forget all the issues, for many this will become a issue of racial thoughts and should a black man be president?   there is also the issue of religion. fox news calling obama a ""muslim"" basically made mccain and hillary more christian than obama and his radical ideas of hope and change. and  those conservatives christian groups know what power they have when they pick a candidate: they won it for bush in 00 and 04,as long as he was on side of christianity thats all that mattered.   that bridge you mentioned is alot shorter than you think for a middle american mom who has never even seen a black person in real life. though i can explain the rational reasons for this, it will be mostly irrational reasons that will make this leap.   as for me, i would vote for mccain over hillary. why? her videogame legislation that will likely to happen if she ever was elected and if she stop getting lobbying money from the industry and bunch of other reasons. but ive always been long time supporter of mccain, especially when he was once could compared to teddy roosevelt, perhaps the greatest president. alas 00 he made the mistake of being too moderate and he did not get support of christian who went for bush instead. so mccain became a true conservative to get nomination this time around. as for obama hes kennedy reborn, with the vision of  camelot in the glint of his eye and every one of his supporter. i feel if i vote for either candidate, i win, so whoever is the better man in the coming months i will vote for.",0,,

""jim, let's have a look at how the bracket turned out, shall we?"" the screen hanging high in the air above the ring in the center of the stadium all change from the announcer to the commentator.  ""alright, folks, here we have [the bracket](http://challonge.com/312twng0) and it looks like it's going to be a tough one indeed. the first round matches are looking incredibly though, with matches like spider vs. tortoise, human vs gorilla, and, of course, honey badger vs. poison frog.

""will jim's nemesis, the webslinging, eight-legged beast be victorious tonight? give it up for the spiiidddeeeeer!""  next comes the enormous, armored tortoise, each of its slow steps shaking the very ground. it lets out a bellowing roar that booms across the stadium.  ""the tortoise sounds like he is ready for a fight! give it up for this immovable object!"" for a moment the entire arena goes silent, anticipating the spectacle that is about to break loose. a bald man in a stripped black and white shirt in the middle of the arena glances nervously at the spider, wiping sweat of his forehead before he lets out a loud, sharp whistle. the animals are released from their bindings and the silence is once again drowned in an eruption of cheers.  the spider immediately went on the attack, its eight legs thundering across the ground, closing the distance between the two fighters quickly. the giant tortoise takes a few slow and awkward steps, trying to keep the spider in sight. the hairy beast pokes and prod at the thick armor of the tortoise with its long legs, pulling them back in a flash to avoid thick jaws snapping around wildly, trying to catch a leg in its iron grip.  ""i don't know how well this is going to work out for the spider, there is no way his legs are going to penetrate that thick armor."" the spider seems to realise this as well and decides to change up its strategy, the tortoise still struggling to keep up. the spider begins to deftly pull a thick rope of web from its behind with its hind legs, its other legs keeping it well out of harms way.  ""that looks web looks incredibly thick, you all know how strong a tiny spiders web is, just imagine how strong a spider of this size can make it's web!"" now the spider is starting to circle the tortoise, narrowly avoiding the jaws snapping shut behind it, while enveloping the tortoise in a thick web. the spider takes a step back and simply watches, perhaps thinking it had already won as it sees the tortoise struggle with the sticky strands of white goo.  suddenly, with a fierce growl, the tortoise breaks free, and it is not happy. it finally begins to work up some speed, shaking of the last piece of web and charges at the spider, growling and snapping. the spider is still much too quick though and makes it's way around the tortoise, mounting it from behind. long hairy legs hammer and squeeze the thick shell from behind, the tortoise roaring wildly, trying to shake the pest of its back. *crack*. jaws finally find their target, closing in an iron grip around a leg that ventured too close. with a mighty swing of it's neck, the tortoise hurls the spider by its leg, sending it flying through the air and snapping the leg clean off.  the spider's broken body barely has time to hit the ground before its opponent is on him, snapping angrily. the spider tries to skitter away, but it limps awkwardly, stumbling as it tries to take a step on its missing leg. soon hairy limbs are flying through the air, spattering the ground with gooey remains.  ""tortoise wins!""  ~  **round of 16, squirrel vs grizzly bear**  ""can the agility of the squirrel beat the raw strenght of the grizzly bear? we're about to find out!"" huge muscles bulge on the bears thick neck as it lets out a bellowing roar. across the stadium is the squirrel skittering around it's cage, waving its tail.  a whistle splits the tension in the air and the beasts are released. the bear charges, bareing its teeth.  ""oh no, what is the squirrel doing? does he not realise what's about to happen?"" the squirrel is sniffing the ground and waving its tail about without a care in the world, as if it was just out in the forest, like any other day. the bear smells blood and lowers his head, charging even faster, no more than a few strides away now.  with a mighty leap the squirrel suddenly springs in to motion, swinging itself over the bear and dragging its sharp claws along the bears back while doing so. a rippling ""ooooh!"" spreads through the crowd when they realise it was a trick. the squirrel turns into a blur as it circles the bear, dodging and ducking the heavy, sweeping paws, meanwhile dealing scratches and bites to the bears back and sides.  ""the bear seems to be struggeling, could it be that the squirrel can win this? that would be a huge upset, sure to make a lot of money change hands!"" the bear retreats, panting heavily and bleeding from a few wounds, but by no means defeated.  the squirrel goes on the attack again, clawing viciously at any weak spot it can find. a sudden lash from the bear catches the squirrel square in the chest, knocking the air out of it as it hits the ground. the bear charges, but the squirrel is back on its feet quickly, whipping its tail in the bears face and spinning around behind him. he bites deep into the bears back and the bear lets out a great roar of pain, but in the same instance it sees its chance and chomps down on the bushy tail, waving infront of its face. the tail is ripped clean off and the squirrel retreats, blood dripping heavily from its tail end.  the squirrel tries to keep up the attacks, but without its tail he is caught off balance, no longer moving with the same grace. a claw gashes the squirrel across the face and in the next instant the bear is all digging its maw deep into the throat of the squirrel.  ""grizzly bear wins!""  ~  **round of 16, llama vs platypus**  ""next up, llama vs platypus. can the sea-dweller compete out of its element? can the llama do anything at all, or is it as useless as it seems?"" the llama is idly chewing some grass, staring around with a blank expression, while the platypus moves around its cage with surprising speed and vigor for something of its size.  the whistle blows and the battle begins. the llama simply stays where it was, chewing away at some more grass, no doubt wondering what everyone is cheering at. the platypus approaches cautiously, but the llama pays him no mind.  ""look at him, he doesn't know what to do! the llama won't fight and the platypus has no idea what to do!"" the platypus circles around the llama, watching it closely. it tries poking the llama with its paddle like hand, but the llama simply ignores him, chewing away happily. the platypus gets more and more bold, finally snatching away the grass from the llamas teeth.  this seems to, finally, have gotten the llamas attenting. it turns it head slowly and stares the platypus into the windows of its soul and with a deep gurgling it spits out a massive glob of drool, hitting the platypus in its face.   furiously hissing, the platypus wadleds up to the llama, who is looking at it with a bored expression, stabs the llama furiously with its beak-like mouth. the llama topples over in surprise, squealing with pain, his opponent takes the opportunity to stick his spur deep into the llamas side, sending waves of poison coursing through the veins of the llama.  ""platypus wins!""  ~  **round of 16, lion vs vietnamese centipede**  ""can the classic, the crowd favorite, the lion, stand up versus the seemingly endless legs and scales of the vietnamese centipede?"" slimy, black scales glint in the sun as the centipede slithers across its cage, its many legs working together, like the cogs of some great machine. on the other end is a fierce lion, roaring proudly, showing its razor-sharp teeth.  a whistle, a roar and a hiss, and the fight begins. this looks nothing like the last couple of fights, this time both contestants are charging each other with murder in their eyes. they clash together and roll, the legs of the centipede wriggly desperately for a foothold while the clawed antennae on its head clash with the sharp teeth of the lion. they roll around and around, clawing and stabbing, blocking and evading until they finally break free from each other with a final roll.  the tumbling and turning leaves the centipede fumbling, disoriented by the spins. the lion seizes the opportunity and pounces, trying to sink its fangs into the centipedes head. the centipede manages to slither forwards just in time, making the fangs catch it in the side, tearing a deep gash. the insect presses on, ignoring the pain and slithers between the legs of the majestic beast towering on top of it, wrapping it tight with its long body, clutch with its legs.  the lion flails its limbs wildly, trying to find something to bite into, but it can hardly move from the immense pressure pressing in from all sides. with a final thrust the centipede sinks its clawed antennae into the lions side, pumping venom into its victim. the lion lets out a final, weak roar and falls to the ground, lifeless.  ""centipede wins!""  ~  **round of 16, poison dart frog vs honey badger**  ""all the way from the rain forests of south america, we have a golden poison dart frog! a regular golden poison dart frog is said to have enough venom in them to kill ten grown men, and they are no more than two inches long! lets see if the honey badger can withstand that!""  the frogs colorful hide gleams in the sun, coated in a thick layer of poison. at the other end is the honey badger, pacing back and forth in its cage, looking for something to eat. the whistle sounds and the cages are lowered. instantly the honey badger looks eyes with its prey and goes on the offensive.  the frog waits patiently for the attack to come, before leaping out of the way at the last second, giving the honey badger a cheeky kick in the side as it bounces away. the frog leaps away again, leading the snarling badger on a chase through the arena, narrowly dodging the badger's attacks, but not making any efforts at dealing damage itself.   finally, the badger is too tired to chase and has to take a moment to breath. the frog tries to get close, but the badger is back on its feet again, snarling and taking up the chase again. eventually, they reach the end of the stadium and the frog seems to be trapped with no where to run. with a quick leap it moves out of the way of the badgers lunge and rubs itself up against the back of the beast, coating it with poison.  ""oh no! the badger is positively drowning in poison, this can't be good!"" the badger shrugs, shaking most of the poison of, and lunges again, his fangs sinking deep into the surprised frogs soft belly.  ""but what's this! the honey badger simply doesn't give a shit, shrugging off the poison as if it was nothing!""  ""honey badger wins!""  ~  **round of 16, gorilla vs human**  ""now... what you've all been waiting for. can humans compete in a bracket like this? are we predator or are we prey? let's find out!"" in one cage is a huge hulk of a man, lean with bulging muscles, stretching his legs and taking deep breaths while staring across at his opponent. the gorillas arms are like tree trunks, thick and heavy, flexing dangerously.  the whistle blows and the cages are lowered. the gorilla belows badly, swinging his fists like hammers while charging the giant of a man. the man had no doubt prepared for this for a long time and he wasn't going to let a charging gorilla, trying to smash him into a bloody pulp, scare him. he looks around, calmly analysing his surroundings, looking for something to use as a weapon. he sees something and an idea seems to form in his mind.  the man takes of running to the end of the stadium, the roaring gorilla charging after him, flailing his arms. the man dodges in between the goal posts and the crowd holds their breath in anticipation as two huge, hairy arms sweep through the air where the man's head had been a second earlier and with a loud *crash*, the gorilla's arms split the goal post in half, sending pieces of scrap metal flying through the air.  the man runs off, picking up the largest piece of the splintered pole and holds it up like a sword, facing the gorilla. angrier than ever, the gorilla charges, but the mans new weapon is proving to be a problem for him. he is using the added range of the pole to poke and prod and the gorilla from a safe distance, sending it into a maddening frenzy.  the gorilla lunges desperately forwards, riddled with cuts and bruises, and the human easily dodges the attack of his tired opponent, stabbing him deep in the side with the piece of metal. the hairy beast is stumbling around, unable to stand straight, but his huge fists are still flailing dangerously. stab, stab, stab. the gorilla stumbles down on one knee, bleeding from dozens of cuts, too tired to fight. with a final thrust, the man pierces the gorilla clean through with his weapon.  ""man wins!""  ~  **round of 16, ant vs black mamba**  ""round of 16 is nearing its end. up next is ant vs black mamba. will the famous strenght of the ant be enough, or will the snake slither away with the victory?"" a huge redish, brown fire ant is on one end, probing its surroundings with the over-grown antennae on its head. on the other side of the arena is the long, whitesnake, slithering in its cage, its tongue darting in and out, taking in the smell of its opponent.  the whistle blows and the fight begins. the snake rises up, watching the ant move closer, its tongue darting in and out with a low hissing. the ant circles cautiously, trying to find an opening to attack while the snake still waits, tongue darting in and out. with a sudden lunge the ant attacks, but the snake seems to move at an impossible speed, almost too fast for the eye to see it dodges out of the way.   the ant lunges aggresively again, but the snake is much too quick, moving out of the way and biting into the side of the huge ant. the effect is immediate, the ant looks drowsy from the poison, but continues the attack.  perhaps it was the flailing unpredicability of the ants attack that caused the snake to misscalculate, because some how the ant managed to catch the snake in its fangs on the third attempt, holding it firm in its jaws. hissing viciously the snake tries to break free, wriggling its entire body, trying to avoid the approaching stinger. the venom causes the ant to drunkenly miss thrust after thrust while the snake wriggles and hisses. finally, the ant slumps to the ground, the poison doing its job, killing the beast.  ""black mamba wins!""  ~  **round of 16, rhinoceros beetle vs komodo dragon**  ""alright, it's time for the final contestants to prove their strenght in the arena, give it up for the rhinoceros beetle and the komodo dragon!"" in one cage is a huge insect covered in heavy black scales, its long, deadly horn gleaming in the sun. at the other end is the lizard, armor-like scales reflecting the sun, like a mirror, tongue darting in and out like a snakes.  once again, the whistle breaks the tension and the cages are lowered. both start out on the offensive, the beetle charges, clicking dangerously, while the lizard hisses. they smash together with a *crash*, armor clashing with scales. the lizard narrowly manages to avoid a quick defeat by turning away from the horn at the last second, but he still struggles. the beetle seems to be much stronger, so the lizard has no choice but to break away from the fight.  the beetle unfolds a pair of wings from underneath its thick armor and takes to a clumsy flight, charging down through the air at the lizard who has to throw himself to the ground to avoid being pierced by the horn. the second time the beetle passes, the komodo dragon is prepared, dodging ahead of time and managing to snatch hold of a leg in passing. the lizard bites down hard, forcing the beetle to awkwardly crash land into the grass.  the lizard takes a great leap, trying to crush the beetle underneath him, but it rolls off its back just in time, causing the lizard to fall on the horn, sinking through its belly and piercing out the other side.

""grizzly bear wins!""  ~  **quarterfinals, platypus vs vietnamese centipede**  ""last round the platypus barely broke a sweat, easily defeating the llama. will it be as easy this time, versus the vietnamese centipede, who managed to squeeze the lion into submission, before injecting it with venom? one thing is for sure, this is a fight you don't want to miss!"" two low, sleek bodies oppose each other. one shiny with scales, the other with wet fur. one with paddle-like, webbed feet, the other with more creeping and crawling feet than one creature should have, some might say.  the whistle blows and the fight begins. the platypus waddled forth, while the centipede skitters across the ground, legs and scaly body making a sickening crunching as it moves. the platypus swings its beak aggresively, trying to broadside the creeping creature opposite. the blows are avoided and the claw like antennae of the centipede swing dangerously close by.  with a sort of whimper, the platypus decides its time to plunge into the deep end. it lunges forwards, grappling the centipede, rolling around on the ground while swinging its beak angrily. the centipede is an expert wrestler though, and soon gains control of the situation, wrapping its slithering body around its prey, rendering the platypus almost unable to move.  venomous stingers glint dangerously in the sun, prepared to strike. just when they are about to strike a kick from the platypus send the venomous spur on its hind legs deep into the soft underside of the centipede. it loosens its grip, writhing in pain on the ground and the platypus puts it out of its misery with a series of jabs to the head with its beak.  ""platypus wins!""  ~  **quarter finals, honey badger vs human**  ""we saw the human beat a gorilla by cleverly procuring a weapon. can he do it again? the honey badger has already proven it is both utterly without fear and simply does not give a shit about anything. one one can win."" the black and white badger hisses out through the cage at the cheering crowd, pacing impatiently back and forth. in the other cage is the human, stretching and loosening his muscles with a confident smile on his face.  the whistle sounds and the cages lower. the man's smile instantly drops when he looks behind himself and sees the debris from the shattered goal post has been cleaned up, leaving him without a weapon. paws pound across the grass as the badger gallops towards the man. he backs away, looking around desperately, trying to come up with a plan. he runs back to the goal post and tries to tear off a chunk of metal, but it won't give. seconds later the snarling beast is on him, knocking him to the ground.  they touble around, jaws snapping dangerously close to the mans neck, arms locked with arms. finally, the man manages to throw his attacker off with a kick and roll away. he tries to run, to by himself time, but he barely makes it two steps before a set of fangs sink deep into his heel, throwing him screaming to the ground. the badger leaps after, but the mans good leg catches it in the stomach, mid air, sending it flying.  limping, he gets back on his feet and stumbles over to the goalpost. with a powerful jerk he manages to rip off a good chunk of the goals net, and just in time. a second later the badger is charging him again. the man swings around just in time to see it, jumps aside clumsily, landing on his wounded foot with a scream of pain, but still managing to catch his opponent in the net, throwing himself ontop of the badger with all his weight.  kicking and squealing, the badger struggles to break free, but the man sits firmly on top of it, pinning all limbs, one knee on the badgers neck, slowly choking it out. with a few spluttering last breaths, the badger dies.  ""man wins!""  ~  **quarterfinals, black mamba vs rhinoceros beetle**  ""it's time for the final quarterfinals fight, the deadly snake facing off against the ferocious beetle. can the venomous fang pierce the thick shell of the beetle? is the beetle fast enough to catch the snake?"" the pale snake waits patiently in its cage, while the beetle rears on its hind legs, making the shadow of its long horn stretch all the way across the arena, casting the snake into darkness.  once again, the whistle blows. scaly legs stampede across the ground, closing the gap quickly. with a mighty swing of its head, the beetle tries to crush the snake with its horn, but when the horn hits the ground the snake is long gone, slithering away, biting into the beetles side, unable to pierce the armor.  there's a steady rhytm to the fight. first comes a *boom*, as the ground shakes when the gigantic beetle tries to crush the snake, then comes a *hiss* as the snake slithers away, and finally a *crunch* as it bites into the thick armor, unable to pierce it. the snake crawls in and out, trying to find a weakness, but without success.  eventually, the beetle seems to catch on to the rhytm, the pattern of the fight. when the snake slithers to the side again, the huge beetle topples over, crushing the snake's head with a sickening *crunch*.  ""rhinoceros beetle wins!""  ~  **semifinals, grizzly bear vs platypus**  ""ladies and gentlemen, we are nearing the end of this spectacular tournament. four fighters and three battles remain before we have our champion. we have seen the bear best the squirrel and the tortoise, showing no mercy towards his victims. its opponent will be the platypus, having already beaten the llama and the vietnamese centipede with its deadly venom. who will win this round? let's find out!"" the bear growls hungrily, licking its lips while staring at its prey. on the other side is the platypus, waddling around the cage, mentally preparing for the impending battle.  the whistle sounds and so it begins. the platypus shows no fear, trying to attack the snarling grizzly, but his beak is not long or sharp enough to pose a threat to the huge bear. it swipes with razor sharp claws at the platypus, who is forced to keep its distance. without thick scales to protect it or sharp claws to attack with, the platypus seems to struggle to seize control of the fight.  the bear manages to keep its opponent at a comfortable distance with his long paws, sweeping dangerously close to the probing beak, trying to find an opening. the bear presses closer and closer and the platypus has no choice but the back away. when they reach the end of the arena the platypus is trapped. with no choice left but to fight, it plunges in, under the bears sweeping paws and gets up close.  for a moment they are locking in struggle, limbs wrestling limbs, but the bears superior strenght allows it to take control of the situation. meanwhile, the platypus is trying desperately to pierce the bear with its venomous spur, but the bear narrowly avoids it. with a great chomp, the bears jaws close on its enemies shoulder, ripping away a large strand of glistening red flesh. the jaws sink again, furiously working the meat, tearing it apart with a hunger.  ""grizzly bear wins!""  ~  **semifinals, human vs rhinoceros beetle**  ""only two fights remain, who will go up against the mighty grizzly bear in the finals? will it be the human, able to beat the gorilla and the honey badger by adapting to his surroundings? or will it be the rhinoceros beetle, piercing the komodo dragon on its horn and then, literally, crushing the black mamba under its armored body?"" despite his giant size and his lean muscles, the human looks small and weak compared to the armored tank of an animal opposite him.  the whistle rings and the cage is lowered, letting the fighters into the arena. immediately, the beetle comes charging with its horn lowered. the man jumps aside lands a punch on the armored side of the beetle, but it seems to hurt his hand more than the beetle. they dance for a minute, the man dodging and ducking, trying to avoid the razor sharp horn, while pounding on the heavy armor whenever he gets the chance.  the man is getting worn out, his breath coming quick and shallow, but the beetle doesn't seem to have broken a sweat. drastic situations call for drastic solutions, so when the beetle passes with its horn lowered again, the man swings onto the beetles back, clinging on for dear life. the beetle rears wildly, shaking and spinning, trying to reach the man with its horn.  suddenly, the beetles wings unfold and it takes to the air, swinging wildly back and forth, until the man finally loses his grip, falling to the ground with a *crunch* as bones break. the beetle swoops down to the ground, piercing his long horn through the man's chest and lifts him high into the air in triumph for all the world to see.  ""rhinoceros beetle wins!""  ~  **grand finals, bear vs rhinoceros beetle**  ""we started out with sixteen of the fiercest fighters in all the world, now we are down to two. are you ready for the greatest fight you have ever seen? it's the one, the only, the grizzly bear! slayer of squirrels, crusher of tortoises, torti? and, of course, the only one to beat the platypus in tonights fights."" excited murmurs spread through the crowd like wildfire.   on the otherside we have the ferocious, the armored, the feared, the rhinoceros beetle. with its near impenetrable defense and its deadly horn it has swashed its way through dragons, snakes and men. the only challange left is the bear. can the bear crush the defenses of the beetle? will the horn put an end to the bear? let's see as we get ready to crown the supreme fighter of the universe!"" the night is closing in now, but two large spotlights light up the ground.  in one cage is the bear, feared by all by now, having proven how ruthless and dangerous it is. its sleek black fur reflects the light from the spotlight, revealing the shapes of strong, hard muscles as the bear moves around the cage. opposite is the plated dread. the beetle with the horn, seemingly unstoppable throughout the tournament. everything is silent as the grave, only the snarling breath of the bear and the click-clack of the beetles shells can be heard.  and then the whistle, the final whistle, rings and the spell is broken. cheers and yeers break out, drowning out all other noise as the combatants charge each other. paw meets horn, turning it away forcefully as the stumble past each other. they charge again, crashing into each other without dealing fatal damage.  the beetle swings his horn violently, trying to catch the bear off guard, but the bear is prepared. it dodges and swipes, cutting a scratch into the armor. not enough to pierce it, but its a start. the bear keeps scratching and clawing, avoiding the horn as best it can while pressing the attack. stumbling backwards, the beetle swings its horn, trying to force the bear to a safer distance where it can use the horn to its advantage.  the bear stick close, mauling with a burning hatred, scratching the armor of the beetle further and further. desperately the beetle stumbles backwards, eventually hitting a large metal pole. the huge spotlights topple over, crashing to the ground, sending glass flying across the stadium, plunging half the arena into darkness.  the crash gives the beetle some time to recover and now it's his turn to press the attack. swinging its horn like a huge sword, it approaches aggresively, pressing the bear further and further back until they reach the opposite side of the stadium. when a heavy swing misses, the bear grabs hold of the beetle's horn, tugging it hard, causing the beetle to stumble and yet again crash into the pole of a spotlight.  the last spotlight crashes to the ground, but a few of the lights survive the fall, casting an eerie light on the fighters from below as the battle rages on. hugely magnified shadows sweep across the stands, the bear and the beetle, locked in a deadly dance, every on looker following the sweep of the horn and the mauling paws of the bear.  back and forth they press each other, both dealing and receiving blows, when suddenly the bear lets out a yelp of pain. a huge shard of glass from the spotlights had sunk deep into the soft underside of the bears foot. it stumbled backwards, defending desperately, but the beetled smelled victory. blow after blow from the huge horn swept down, until the bear could no longer defend itself. with a final *crunch*, the mighty weapon pierces the bears hide, putting an early end to its life.

185375,"seen flying from chryse planitia across syrtis major all the way to the coasts of isidis planitia, the cottonfly is quite a marvel to spot overhead. gÃ­gantasparaskÃ­nia represents a prominent group of scavenging butterflies on mars an id the largest animal to fly to date, 25 mi post establishment.    cottonflies primarily fill the niche as the vultures of mars. it is very difficult for large animals to pry apart the exoskeletons of dead arthropods to feed on, however the cottonfly has two advantages when it comes to out scavenging. with a body length of three meters for its nine meter wingspan, the cottonfly is by far the largest thing to fly in the martian skies to date. the cottonfly, along with its close relatives, use its large size to sore far and high to find carrion. this makes it impossible for terrestrial carnivores like arachnids to keep pace. their large size also make them more intimidating to go up against. beneath itâ€™s bowling ball sized head, its black and segmented proboscis can uncoil itself into a wrinkly two meter long opposable tube seven centimeters in diameter. the proboscis enters though weak spots in carrion exoskeleton such as through joints or the anus to suck up organs and decayed flesh lick a straw. with a short blade at the end of its proboscis, it cuts through tough tissue to help it navigate and dice up the body from the inside.   as massive as their wings are, relative to smaller insects, only thirty percent represents part of their exoskeleton. the skeletal part of the wing, localized at the front end, serves to support long hollow scales that act as analogue feathers. this allows the wings to be lighter to help the organism off the ground.   it is not uncommon for flying animals on mars to use countershading to better hide from predators, especially in the air, but the cottonfly does the exact opposite. it has soft snow white scales on its top side while it has black scales on its underside. one reason for this is that there are no strong enough pressures to camouflage, considering that counter shading is not very useful when the animal is too big to hide in the open air. this alone doesnâ€™t explain the pattern, but even though it canâ€™t hide this coloration does have a purpose.    like modern butterfly scales, these pseudo-feathers posses microscopic shapes that refract light in particular ways. in the cottonflieâ€™s case on its top side, it possesses cones arranged to form inverted three sided ninety degree angles which are capable of reflecting light back in the opposite direction. itâ€™s the same logic that makes safety reflectors so bright. this is extremely useful for blinding predators trying to attack from above. avian predators like the meter long wasps will often attempt to grab their prey and disembowel them through the joints to force their prey to fall and possibly get injured on impact with the ground. the cottonfly is able to defend against these assaults by using these white scales to induce snow blindness, making it extremely difficult for predators to focus in on a particular part of the body to attack. it then becomes a battle between the wasps trying to cast their shadow over their prey and the cottonfly avoiding it. even if a predator manages to land on it, it will then need to comb through the thick fluff and scales to reach into the joints.   attacking the cottonfly from below doesnâ€™t yield any better results either. in fact, itâ€™s even more dangerous to attack from below. in order to launch up into the air, cottonflies fold their wings back before using two pairs of their hind legs to push off the ground. while these legs help to make them airborne, they can also be used as a line of defense. if a predator flies underneath, it is at risk of being violently kicked and breaking a wing. with its legs being the exact same shade of black as the underside of their wings, it can be hard for anyone to see the legs in its shadow.    life cycle   cottonflies begin their lives hatching out from a clutch of about thirty eggs berried in the warm composting soils in the rainforests of chryse planitia. from the very start as twenty-four centimeter long caterpillars, they each hatch with six exoskeletal arms that collectively work as talons which they use to firmly grasp and climb with. they quickly move across the forest floor by flexing their abdomen to jump forwards.   as soon as they hatch, they will immediately begin foraging for food. they will need to grow fifty times their size on top of storing enough food for when they enter into their first chrysalis stage. this is why only their legs and head posses an exoskeleton when they hatch, to allow the rest of the body to freely grow unrestricted. due to their lack of an exoskeleton, their muscles across their body are supported by flexing against the skin in order to move quickly, like a stress toy. if this was in earthâ€™s heavy gravity, this would have been a highly inefficient use of energy to move around. in their first caterpillar stage, they will mainly feed on both plants and occasionally carrion.   after a few months, they will form a chrysalis and spend a week developing their second caterpillar form. unlike earth butterflies, many large unrelated butterfly species on mars go through two or more caterpillar stages that require their own chrysalis. these extra metamorphic stages occur as a result of a mutation that repeats the process. since these mutations helped allow the animals to grow bigger and forage for more food, it has resulted in their adult sizes growing even bigger. most flying predators in the past were not as big as they are no, which gave butterflies an advantage when it came to using their size for intimidation. wasps also grow very large and some even go through multiple larval stages, but since most wasps are predators they need stronger armor that consequently weighs them down. since it is is difficult for large sizes to be achieved for arthropods, this trait has resulted in butterflies to become some of the biggest animals on mars.    when the caterpillar remerges, it is naw seventy-six centimeters and posses a more active body plan of its previous stage along with its adult head partially formed. while it still feeds with mandibles, it naw possesses more developed compound eyes that help it to avoid predators and seek prey. it is much more of an aggressive hunter at this stage and will often hunt down small arthropods as well as its own kind to store up fat for its final transformation.    for their next chrysalis, they will either dig their own burrow, steal an already existing one from their siblings or other animals, or even take an abandoned one from an adult butterfly. they will line their den walls with secretions to reinforce it from outside intruders burrowing in. these spaces can be up to two hundred and forty gallons in volume as to give them a safe place to grow to develop into their final adult form as butterflies.   it is difficult for other arthropods to reach the size of the cottonfly because to do so involves being exposed to risks that butterflies donâ€™t encounter. most arthropods haft to shed their skin several times throughout their lifetime in order to grow. during these moments, they haft to spend hours to shed, harden their new armor, and rest after being completely exhausted from the event. this leaves them highly vulnerable and makes them completely incapable of eating or running for a few days. this is why most arthropods donâ€™t grow heavier then eleven pounds on mars, which is equivalent to about thirty pounds on earth. it is too risky to spend the energy to undergo these transformations only to get a heavy suit of armor that slows you down in return. however, because butterflies develop within a chrysalis, they bypass this whole process at once and are able to safely grow into the largest animal that can fly on mars.    even this is optimal for growing large sizes, it has its own drawbacks. while undergoing a massive physiological change, they are unable to do anything if their burrow is invaded. even if nothing is able to penetrate the thick walls of their underground chrysalis, they canâ€™t defend against something that is already inside its chamber with it.   the hobgoblin is an apex species of spider that can grow up to two meters in length. relevant to the cottonfly, their juvinile stage only needs to be 12 centimeters long to be a problem. hobgoblins will often sneak into the burrows of unsuspecting caterpillars, optimally the kind belonging to cottonflies, and hide as the caterpillar seals up the chambers to begin metamorphosing. during this time, the hobgoblin will feed off the juices of the vulnerable caterpillar as an easy source of food and safely shed multiple times without the threat of predators. it will keep the caterpillar alive for months to keep it fresh before finally killing it when itâ€™s time to re-emerge.   but if all goes well, the caterpillar it will come out as a fully grown adult. after emerging, itâ€™s body will still be damp and soft, so it will crawl up a tree wait for its skin and wings harden. the cottonfly also emerges with soft and puffy brawn felt over its scales, clay red or blue coloration to camouflage to its environment. when itâ€™s wings finally harden, it will lose the camo coat over time as it flies, revealing its pure white scales to the world.",0,,

295237,"okay, without reading any comments below, i'm just gonna go right into this, off the top of my head from what i know, without out looking st references or doing any fact-checking. this is all my own knowledge.  **something from nothing (the big bang)**  this nothing was actually not nothing at all, but supposedly what is called the singularity. it was a super dense ball of matter like a black hole, only much much much denser. as it sucked in matter it only became more dense, and it's gravity compressed it down to the smallest most dense thing that could be imagined, and then even more so. at some point, a threshhold was crossed and it became unstable and exploded, spewing out all the matter faster then the speed of light. within fractions of a fraction of a fraction of a second, the radical amount of mass was so great that normal laws of physics didn't quite have a handle on things yet.  after things calmed down and the matter released from this 'big bang' were light years apart did the really interesting stuff begin.  **creation of heavy elements**  at this point most everything was either hydrogen or oxygen, the 2 lightest elements. where large groups of them would gather by forces of gravity stars would ignite once the pressure became hot enough. after a melinia, these stars would smash elements together and create heavier elements, then die, explode, go super nova and fling out even more heavy stuff. this would go on all over the place and eventually clouds of this heavier stuff would gather over time, and by all means, 'time' in these examples represents hundreds of billions of trillions of years. remember to us a year is how long it takes a penny to spin around a vortex once. imagine how long it takes for stellar formations to come together, live, and die, just to make a little bit more 'heavy stuff' which would eventually gather by forces of gravity, the weakest force we know of, and ignite a star with it's own orbiting bits of rocks that we would recognize as a solar system proper. but i digress, let's continue.  **earth**  after countless stars have lived and died. after countless other solar systems have been formed and destroyed, clusters of stars called galaxy float around, and most of the exploded matter has found a place somewhere in the universe... sol, our sun ignites in a swirl of gathered matter and gases. heavy stuff forms into solid bits of rock as it swirls around the newly born star, and anything that doesn't bunch up into orbiting masses escapes into the nothingness of space. (until it gets sucked up by a random thing it may pass upon)  now, earth is a molten rock as the heaviest of elements settles down to the middle of the mass of molten stone like a glass of various liquids in a cup settle and separate.  an asteroid hits us, large chunks fly into the sky, possibly tilts our spin, and most of the matter is lost into space. (what actually hit us could also have been debris from what ever happened to the planet that we now see as nothing more then an asteroid belt. we can only speculate.) earth cools, mostly, with it's hot inner core of molten metal. it's hit many more times by crystallized h2o asteroids. how much water we have that came from being hit, or how much we had right from the start, i don't know. i'm not sure if it's a question that has ever really been looked into. around fissures in the ocean floors water and carbon create chemical reactions. eventually carbon compounds form into protein strains. at some point this carbon protein sparks into single cell self-replicating strains. life.  **evolution**  it's at this point things happen fairly rapidly. once life begins it's rather hard to stop. rather simple blobs of individual cells mindlessly copy themselves. cells sometimes make mistakes and get copied slightly different. sometimes this mistake can turn out to be a good thing, and this mistake eventually becomes the dominant cell that's being copied. and, eventually there become enough different types of cells that each do their own thing and thrive in different ways. this happens a million bazillion gazillion more times and ta-da! we have humans.  tl:dr,  notice that something from nothing had nothing to do with anything other then an explosion. evolution by far is as much removed from the big bang is as anything.  **final thoughts and something to think about**  there are other ideas besides the big bang to explain why everything is. the big bang only is the most fitting puzzle and makes the most sense. there is a background noise and radiation level that matches what is to believed to be left over from the explosion of the singularity. the most convincing i think is how mostly everything is observed to be moving away from each other. exactly what you'd expect from an explosion.  furthermore, it's thought that there could even have been more 'big bangs' in the past, before this most recent one... (some think that after exploding, gravity will pull everything back together again and start a new singularity and it'll all happen all over again) or even elsewhere in the universe. there is actually some new research being done where scientists are looking as far out as we possibly can and they think they can see another universe at the edge of ours. this could be the extremes of another singularity that had gone off long long ago, possibly even at about the same time or close to it as when ours exploded.  anyways.... i hope this helps put things a bit more into perspective of how 'stuff came to exist'.  i hope you find the time to read it all and my own time was not wasted.  of course reddit is gonna pick though this now and point out everywhere i was wrong, but i am only a dumb atheist with only a basic grasp on book smarts.... and yet, i was able to pull this out of my head without looking at any source or wiki or anything.  i hope i have not wasted my time.  my best to you.  &lt;3",0,,
149364,"wow  1.  why do these people always claim normal-size people are ""naturally thin"" (picture 5) this frustrates me so much.  her two friends are ""naturally thin"". the cute outdoors-y guy she was crushing on was ""naturally thin"". fat logic is deluding yourself that 'thin' people are thin because they are ""naturally"" thin and it doesn't matter what they do or eat, they will always be thin. it's such bs.  2. picture 6. fat logic is deluding yourself that your weight is the *only* reason why a hot a/b/c list celeb will never ~~meet~~ date you. wow.  also, fat logic is telling yourself your friend is suggesting giving up baking and *photographing food* because they are an evil shitlord who wants you to conform to society's warped beauty standards in order to be ""worthy"" of attention from ~~hot, thin~~ ""nice"" men. rather than because they are genuinely concerned with your weight, diet, and unhealthy obsession with food. (*seriously, who photographs food as a **hobby**?*)   3. fat logic is believing that a whole family being obese is ""genetics"" rather than behavioural...  nature over nurture. do these people genuinely not understand that unhealthy eating habits are *learned*, or do they just not accept it? if mom &amp; dad overeat, they are more likely to overfeed their kids. if mom and dad like eating pizza and kebabs and burgers and chinese take out, they are more likely to feed that to their kids. same with chips, soda, cake, candy etc. how do they not get that?  (picture 10)  4. fat logic is thinking you can change a guy's mind when he says he doesn't want to date you. fat logic is insisting you go to the gym lots so are obviously fit despite being fat. and that you eat healthily and even when you starved yourself you didn't lose any weight. fat logic is blaming the guy for being size-ist and when all else fails, racist, because he's not attracted to you and  tries to let you down gently. fat logic is also believing that being 5ft 2"" and 13 stone 5lbs makes you ""small fat"". talk about denial.  5. fat logic is complaining there are 'no larger girls' in music videos, and ignoring all the curvy girls with large butts and boobs that actually *are* in music videos (baby got back anyone?!) fat logic is complaining about not seeing fat girls in music videos whilst simultaneously complaining that fat women are fetish-ed (so to see them in videos would be 'objectifying'), whilst complaining that guys don't fancy fat women, whilst insisting (via internet posts and memes) that 'guys like curves, only dogs go for ~~thin women~~ bones.  *rolls eyes* seriously, girls, make your minds up. which is it?!   6. fat logic is blaming *everything* on your weight and believing ""thin"" girls are never insecure (or shouldn't be). seriously, do these people think that a normal sized person never worries they are just a 'stopgap'/someone to sleep with til someone better comes along? do they not think that a normal sized woman also worries about meeting someone in person for the first time in case they are disappointed with what they see?  i'm 5ft 6 and 139lbs-ish. so i'm 'slim'. my weight though is on my thighs and ass. my boobs however are tiny. i *always* worry that new partners will reject me 'cos my boobs are too small. or because my stomach isn't toned, or because my thighs are quite large (seriously, i can't wear skinny jeans because they don't go over my thighs unless i buy a size or 2 bigger, which then are baggy round my waist). fat logic is believing thin women never have any insecurities and aren't allowed to ever feel fat or unhappy with their body.  7. picture 17. fat logic is believing the only reason your friend set you up with a specific guy is because he's fat. not because she genuinely does/did think he was cute (or thought he was into you. or thought that you might be the person to look past his size and give him a chance, since you know how it feels to be overlooked due to your size). fat logic is thinking everyone thinks a fat guy with thin girl is normal, but fat girl with a thin guy is gross or wrong or weird.... uh, nope, most people [who raise eyebrows at a thin guy being with a fat girl]  also think similarly about a thin girl with a fat guy.  8. picture 19. i believe it's ""punching above [their] weight"". not ""pushing"". also, huh?  hello, hypocrisy a fat woman is allowed to fancy a ""fit"", ""hot"", ""buff"" guy, but a fat guy should not lust after thin(ner) women. also, fat guys shouldn't fancy fat women, because fat(ter) women want to date thin(ner) hot guys, dammit! .oh and again, there's this delusion that  society only raises eyebrows or passes judgement if the woman is fat and the guy is thin. in reality it goes both ways, but not in their minds.  9. picture 20 (i think? losing count now), says that when she was fat, but not as fat, she got attention, now she gets none. she says that as a person of colour it's even harder. this is hard for me to understand, as i have seen lots of black guys say they like women with big(ger) butts, and curves etc. also, as a whit person, i personally think black (african/african american) women carry weight better than white women. their skin also looks better. and i'm not sure where she gets the opinion that it's more 'accepted' to be fat and white. it makes me wonder just how large she is. also this *""i'm starting to believe my love life is curse because i cannot attract a man..""*... she says she was fat, but not as fat. so why does nshe not see losing the weight gain as a solution?!  10. another one who thinks a) everyone in their close family and friends commenting on their weight is because they are all shitlords. not that they are all genuinely worried about her. b) her paranoia that everyone is always watching her and judging her is society fat-shaming, not her conscience pricking her because she knows she's making unhealthy choices. c) that thin people buy a gallon of ice-cream. or that thin people who do buy a gallon of ice cream do not care or notice strangers ~~watching~~ judging them, because they are thin (when in reality it's because that gallon of ice-cream is not for them to binge-eat in one sitting, but will last their family of 4 for several weeks.) d) that thin people do not have any body hang ups, never feel guilty for eating candy bars or pizza etc, never worry about not being attractive, and never have ""fat days"" where their clothes don't fit or they have unwanted bulges etc.",1,–2,0
152115,"the boy limped into a cave larger than most towns.  his clothes were thin and had so many rips and tears that any who saw them would wonder how they stayed on his nearly skeletal frame.  his skin was covered with a thick layer of dirt and mud, so that one could not tell what color it was.  the only places that were not filthy were those areas that were the dozens of wounds he bore, and the blood that oozed from those wounds.  his shoeless feet had a rock lodged in the bottom, and he could not properly put the foot down.  his eyes were dull and lacked any of the energy of youth others his age possessed.  his hair was stringy and matted with dirt and small pebbles.  he looked like he wanted nothing more than to lay down and not get up again.    and that was why he had come to that particular cave.  he entered the cave with steps that were slowed by his many wounds.  and then, when the light from the sun was weakest, he waited.  he heard her before he saw her.  a heavy scraping, like a house being dragged along stone.  an almost metallic clicking, like the heaviest of weapons being slammed down.  and then she was there.  the blackheart dragon.  the beast filled the cavern with her size.  scales darker than the cave covered her massive body, broken only by her blazing yellow eyes and iron grey claws.    the boy closed his eyes, waiting for the inevitable.  for there were only two kinds of people who came to see the blackheart dragon.  those who were either brave or foolish enough to think they could slay one of the most powerful dragons in the world, or those like him.  those who wanted the swift and painless death the dragon was known to provide.  ""now then, what do we have here?""   the voice was deep, rumbling, and powerful.  the kind of voice that could bring kings to their knees with a single word.   the boy opened his eyes to see the dragon looking at him.  for some reason, she had not killed him immediately like she did most who entered her home.  ""a human boy, is it.  i take it you are not one who seeks my head.""  the boy could not speak.  rather, he was unable to.  not because of fear.  he had lost the capacity for fear already.  no, he was unable to respond simply because his mouth and throat were too dry to allow words to leave them.  he hung his head in shame.  ""no words, eh?  well think what you wish me to hear.""  the boy nodded and thought, ""are you going to kill me now?""  the dragon moved her great head down closer.  an eye larger than his body focused on him.  ""no, i don't think i will.  you have an interesting scent about you.  it would be a waste to end you so quickly.  tell me why you seek death at my claws.  what i do will depend on your answer.""  the force of her voice so close sent the already weak boy sprawling.  the dragon let out a low growl.  the boy hoped that his weakness had angered her enough to unleash her flames on him, but no such thing happened.  instead, she closed her eyes and a bright purple glow surrounded her body.  then she began to shrink.  her body changed, becoming smaller, softer.  within seconds, the blackheart dragon no longer wore her awe inspiring true form.  instead, she took the form of a human woman.  tall and slender, clad in a fine dress the color of her scales, there was an odd beauty to her.  a dangerous, fierce beauty, that could make men long for her even as their deepest selves cried to avoid her.  her hair and lips all held the color of well polished obsidian, and her finger nails were long and sharp as knives.  the only thing that could mark her as a dragon was her eyes.  they had remained unchanged by her magic.  ""there, this should make it easier to converse."" she said, in a much more tolerable voice.  the boy struggled to sit up.  the dragon stood, waiting for him.  he had not known she could be patient.  all the stories about her said she did not suffer long waits.  ""now then, i ask again, why have you come to me?  why do you wish your own death?""  the boy tried to speak for a moment before he remembered.  his words came from his mind, not his mouth.  ""i am hated.  in the town i come from, everyone hates me.  i bring the worst luck to everyone around me.  my parents were killed by robbers, who were then immediately captured by the guards.  my aunt and uncle cared for me after that, but they lost everything when their shop stopped getting shipments because of monsters and bandits.  and it's not just the people who care for me.  whenever i walk down the street, things break or are lost.  people get hurt, or even die.  and it is me.  everyone can tell.  whenever i'm gone, everything seems to be fine, or at least normal.  but when i am there, nothing goes right for anyone nearby.    ""when people figured that out, i was thrown out on the streets.  people either beat me, insult me, or just do everything to stay away from me.  eventually, i was driven out.  my luck is just as bad as everyone else's though, so i was never able to get anything to eat, or find a place to stay or anything.  the only thing i could think to do was come here and end my life in the one way that nothing could ruin or stop.""  ""i see."" the dragon said.  she crossed her arms and tapped her fingers.  her nails hit her dress and let out a small metallic clink.  her lips curled up into a smile.  ""i wonder...""  she knelt in front of the boy and touched his forehead with a single finger.  that finger was wrapped in purple light.  her eyes went wide and her smile became almost sinister.  ""ah, now this is interesting.  no wonder you have such an interesting scent.  did you know you are curse?  a powerful one at that.  it is the curse of demon's luck.  a powerful curse that makes it seem as if demons are around and working against you.  of course they aren't.  demons would rather just kill and eat you than make your life miserable.  and it looks like this curse was placed directly on your soul when you were born.""  ""so..."" the boy thought.  ""oh yes, everything that happened to you was because of this curse.  the question you should ask is why you were cursed.  the curse if demon's luck is not something a common witch or mage could perform.  it is powerful, and powerful magic is difficult to control.  why, it would take someone of my level to even think of using this particular curse for no real reason.  and i can assure you, no dragon would lower themselves to using something like this.  no, boy, this was done with careful deliberation and planning.""  ""so then why?""  ""i cannot say.  at least, not right now.  i can feel something in you though.  something the curse has covered so completely that it is difficult for even me to see.  but even i cannot tell exactly what it is.  well, at least not until the curse is broken.""  the boy felt something he had never before felt.  a warmth deep in his being.  it was small, less than the warmth of a single candle, but it was there.  it was hope.  for the first time in his life, the boy felt hope.  ""you...can remove it?""  ""yes.  all curses, no matter how powerful, can be broken.  it will not be easy though.  the very nature of the curse will protect it.  my spells will be more likely to fail, and anything that can happen to disrupt it will happen.  but it will lose.  it is still a curse of luck, and eventually, even the worst luck will end.  eventually, nothing will be able to go wrong, and that is the day the curse will fail.""  the boy's eyes grew wide.  dare he long for that day?  for the day when he could go out an be among people again?  ""however..."" the dragon continued.  ""as i said, this will not be easy.  not will it be safe.  i must be careful not to damage your soul, and there is a slight chance i could be hurt myself by the poor luck the curse brings.  i lead a substantial risk in doing this for you.  and i am not in the habit of doing someone a favor without recompense.""  ""i...will do anything you ask."" the boy thought as strongly as he could.  ""if it's something i am capable of doing, i'll do it.""  ""so be it."". the dragon's hands glowed purple and she placed one on his chest, and the other on hers.  ""i,deniria, who is called the blackheart dragon by man, offers my service.  i shall care and protect your life and do all in my power to remove the curse of demon's luck.""  the boy felt the words come to him.  he knew, deep in his being, what he had to say.  ""i, jek, who has no other name, swear that i shall obey your orders to the fullest extent of my abilities for the rest my my days.""  he felt something around his heart.  a feeling that was cool and both comforting and deeply terrifying.  ""the contract is made."" the blackheart dragon, deniria, said.    her hand came out again and enveloped his small body in warm purple light.  his felt his wounds heal quickly, even the one in his foot.  the dirt clinging to him fell off, leaving nothing but clean skin behind.  even his clothes were repaired to perfect condition.  they were still poor quality rags, but at least they were now recognizable as clothing.  he even felt a new surge of energy surging through him.  he stood firm and without pain for the first time in months.  ""now then, come jek.  we have much work to do."" she said and turned to go deeper into the cave.  ""yes...mistress."" jek said and hurried to follow.",1,,0

271970,"""this is of no consequence. the duplicator is the uploader, not the downloader. now that is fact.""  so a duplicate copy is made because of the downloader's actions, and yet the downloader is not a duplicator.  makes perfect sense!  ok, so perhaps it's both parties guilty.  should your logic apply also to child porn distribution?  ""the average person who benefits from it is, literally, a buy-low-sell-high record exec, not the artist. artists get at most 10% of their work. sounds to me like copyright is rewarding the middleman more than it rewards the real object of its purpose.""  of course there are middlemen, but it's all in terms of scale.  you can retain 100% of copyright earnings by doing all marketing, promotion, distribution, bookkeeping, taxes, etc. myself, as well as creating the art itself.  this probably limits you to selling only in a small regional market and many less copies, and all the pains of singlehandedly running your creative enterprise.  or you could make the investment in those things up front and shoulder all of the risk of the investment.  copyright gives the artist something negotiable to seek out middlemen to get the art sold.  without copyright, you don't have that bargaining power, plain and simple.  as to whether or not a particular record deal is a good or bad one, you just have to weigh alternative scenarios and determine which is best for you.  there's good and bad with all of it.    the american idol contract is notoriously restrictive and all-encompassing, but on the other hand, it is unrivaled in terms of the scale of public exposure you get.  is it worth it? not for me, but i can't answer that for everybody.  point being, say on my own i could sell 1000 copies of my own album and retain 100% of the profit.  if i could sell 100,000 and retain 10%, i make 10 times more.  absent from a lot of the praise radiohead got from putting out in rainbows for free was the fact that they benefited from the massive amount of exposure they got from the ""old"" way of doing things and all of the fans they  had already built.   ""the artist does have that right insofar as we all agree he has it. it's not a natural right. and it's there for the taking when we revoke it through copyright reform. anyway, i guess we should replace artist with record exec in your text -- it's not the artist you're defending, but the middleman anyway. did you know that artists must sign over their copyrights to even get signed by big music?""  no, i think it's a perfectly natural right for someone to be guaranteed compensation for their labor.  i also happen to believe people have a natural right to free speech and freedom of religion.  the first amendment, minimum wage and other labor laws, and copyrights ensure these rights.  the specific ways that rights are protected are established by the law - the law itself does not give people these rights.  so, for another economic example, to address the ""middlemen"" argument, the book industry is a good place to look.  since books aren't as easily replaced by digital files, book distribution, more so than music, is very much under economies of scale.    like my example above, i could make an initial investment and shoulder all risk and self publish copies of my book and distribute them.  the cost per copy is much lower with a bigger publisher, and with the added benefit that i could also sell more copies.  it's mostly the same argument as above.  but now, the terms of copyright are even more important for the author.  if it's a short copyright term, the author must find a publisher quickly, which can be a lengthy process.  added to this disadvantage is the fact that the publishers now have less of an incentive to publish it, since they also have a very limited time to exclusive rights to it.  chances are it will become a free commodity and no economic benefit will result - except maybe if the book is good, the big publisher can pick it up once it's public domain and sell physical copies for some benefit.  the author probably won't benefit unless he writes a riveting guilty-pleasure type instant bestseller.  ""sorry, pal, you are going to find a lot of people with this mindset. chill out and focus on something else while the revolution happens.""  correction: i will find lots of people on certain pockets of the internet with this mindset.  i'm skeptical that it actually translates into society at large.  people download because they can, and they save money from it by getting free entertainment.  a few get up in arms about copyright and 'sticking it to the man', and that mindset pretty much exists in these pockets of the internet.  kind of like the ron paul ""revolution"".  i should make note that the riaa probably overstates the impact of downloading for similar reasons.  ""and 150 year exclusive exploitation of all derived rights is an excess that should change. if they can't turn a profit in the first ten years, why should they be allowed to control what they couldn't milk? let the commons exploit it, and society will be better off.""  see my above argument about books.  without a substantial amount of resources behind you, turning a profit with very limited copyright terms leaves artists with a very limited ability to actually benefit from their work.    you have to ignore the actual economic incentives from all sides of it to make your conclusions, and your charge of the 'excesses' are largely from pointing to only to the biggest moneymakers in the game, rather than all players.  sure you can rail against record execs all you want, but a lot of music is heard because record labels, large and small, can get music heard by a wider audience.  when there's money to be made from copyright, that happens, and the commons eventually benefits more.  your statement about society's benefit is contingent upon the ideal balance.    for example, if copyright was not life+some number of years, it's reasonable to say that many posthumously published works would never see the light of day.  society should consider that a balance beyond life might net the commons more in the end.  and also as a caveat, artists and record labels do not have the same interests, and thus my defense of the industry types are pretty much limited to the fact that in the end artists can be better off because of it.  the degree to which copyright protects the artist and the industry is between the artist and their label/publisher/distributor, not copyright holders and society.  ""this is, again, the ""argument from 'it ought to be like i say'"", which you have used at least five times.  you have the wrong idea of copyright. it is not ""a right to compensation"" but ""an incentive to production"". no one has a right to compensation, anywhere. when people pay you for your work, it is because of a contractual relationship, not because you have a right to compensation. in other words, the ""right to compensation"" derives from your contract, not the other way around. same with copyright.  with a more limited copyright system (10-year limits, private uses exemptions), a large amount of production will still occur, and copyright will still work. you should stop advocating for the current regime, and start looking at the real-world honest alternatives and complements that have been devised in the last decades.""  since this discussion is largely theoretical ""it ought to be"" is half the discussion here.  you argue just as much that copyright ""ought to be"" 10 years.  you're arguing semantics in my mind.  i make an assumption that we live in a capitalist society, thus i think people have a right to compensation for their labor given the society we live in.  yes, this is codified by law, as is most law around the economy.  ""right to compensation"" = ""incentive to production"".  that's the basic idea of capitalism.  people work and they get paid for it.  and yes, that's codified by contract.  granted, i call the ""right to compensation"" a right because of the economic system we have.  if we had some other system, we could discuss otherwise, but as i see it, everybody else gets paid for their work, and artists should not be expected to do it all for free as if they are some class of people that deserves to be poor and share the fruits of their labor with everyone.  i am not ""advocating for the current regime"" or a stagnant entertainment industry that doesn't respond to the situation, nor am i advocating a punitive approach to downloading.  i welcome alternatives, but at the end of the day, i believe artists are much more entitled to their copyrights than the entertainment-hungry internet is entitled to free shit whenever they want it at the artist's expense.",0,,

339697,"**tldr: if there's anything my last ex did for me, he certainly assisted me regarding my body image issues.**  ---  i'd refer to myself as chubby.   i work out, i run, i try to eat a balanced diet and take care of myself. i'm not fat, and i'm not skinny, but i don't have perfect arms, my stomach isn't toned and flat, and my ass is a little squishier than i'd like. that means a lot of the time i *feel* fat.   i think it's hard not to, when you're 'average,' given what 'attractive' is depicted as a lot of the time. as a teen, even knowing deep down that the *perfect* women on tv or in magazines have personal trainers, super-controlled diets, and a lot of airbrushing, and sometimes surgical augmentation, it was somewhat crushing to be around girls that *did* have something like *that* kind of body, who weren't in sports or anything, and were just apparently magically, naturally, beautiful.   i'd always hated how i looked, or at least as long as i'd thought about my looks meaning anything.   my mom used to comment when i was a child how beautiful i was, and strangers would warn her that someone was going to try and steal me. as i matured, though i grew to be taller than her, and fairly strong, she would poke and prod my belly and sides, tsk as she asked me to try on pants she knew were two-sizes-too-small, or take me to get a dress for an upcoming even, choose one that was lovely but didn't fit, and just say with a sigh, ""maybe when you lose some weight.""   everyone on her side of the family, the women especially, lean towards very thin. my father's side of the family ranges from robust to rotund, so i suppose i landed in the middle. however, the middle can feel very much like ""fatty lardass"" when you're constantly compared against athletes, models, and actresses and slim, sculpted cousins who did everything from run track, to dance ballet, to model.   my dad would make (and still does make) comments about every woman he saw while driving, or watching tv, derisively critiquing their bodies, hair, makeup, clothing. i would listen, unsure, and wonder about my own body and appearance.   ""i thought she was *beautiful,*"" i've thought to myself more than once. ""but she's *fat*? that's *ugly*? what does that make me?"" i avoided makeup like the plague through most of my k-12 schooling - i thought if i wore any, i'd have no idea what i was doing and end up looking like a clown, or in my dad's eyes, a whore.  then there was, you know, [the whole issue with my stepfather](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/x4ovc/what_everyone_does_after_a_stepparent_leaves_the/c5ja5cb). he told me i was beautiful all the time, but comments and lessons from him tended to stick with me in a, shall we say, skewed kind of way. what i ended up believing, due greatly to him, was that though i might not be attractive, i had a demeanor and sexuality that was enough to make up for it.  by the end of high school, i had the very strong impression that beauty = sexuality = desirability = worth. for someone with no self esteem, little sense of self-worth, a completely messed up body-image, and a massive need for feeling *loved*, feeling *worth* something, as well as raging hormones and sudden access to exploration, this was a dangerous mind set to have. i ended up in a series of situations with a series of guys, and through good fortune and great friends, i managed to navigate safely through all of it.   those that told me i was beautiful, or that my body was fine, tended to be people i didn't feel like i could trust or believe for that opinion. after all, they had something to gain: access to my body, my trust, etc. their words, then, meant nothing to me, and were always cynically cast aside. i did not look like what i perceived to be beautiful - so how could *i* be?  one day, frustrated with this fact - having come to realize just how poorly i viewed my own body - my ex (then boyfriend) sat me down and pulled out an art history book. he opened it to a page he'd marked, and showed me a picture of an italian reclining venus.   ""there,"" he said, pointing to it, a very serious look on his face. ""what do you think?"" he was being very earnest, and i had no idea where this was going: he had just picked me up to go hang out with some friends, and this was the first thing he'd sprung on me when i'd gotten into the car.   ""think about what?""  ""the woman in the painting, what do you think of her?""   i looked at the picture for a moment, thinking, looking at the curves of her breasts, stomach, thighs, and said without hesitation, ""she's beautiful.""  ""she's gorgeous, isn't she?""   ""yes.""  he slid his thumb over her face. ""now tell me, who's body does that look like?""   it was like a bolt of lightning through the top of my skull, a key turning in a lock, a door thrown open. the memory of him standing behind me in a full length mirror while we both undressed, how embarrassed i felt for him to see me in such a well-lit room, and the realization that i had had no reason to be.   ""it looks like me,"" i said, quietly, unbelieving.   ""you *are* beautiful,"" he said. ""don't ever doubt that.""

""buut, but i was told by scholarly men that you didn't exist and that i was the only authority i had to answer to!"" is a terrible thing to say on judgment day just before you're thrown into the lake of fire. god commands us to ""apply our hearts to find the reason of things"".  the earliest surviving use of the term ""catholic church"" is in a letter that saint ignatius wrote to the smyrnians (people from smyrna? no idea.) in the year 107. after all, it's the protestants that split away from the catholic church, not the other way around.  the history of the catholic church is a fascinating one, however, they are not, by a long shot, ""the church"" of the bible. ""christians"" (the church) were first called by that name in antioch, long before the ""catholics"".  &gt;in any case, there are pedophile ministers and pedophile leaders of every faith. that's not the point. the point is that a person's actions do not invalidate the ideas that they hold. a person can decry marital infidelity as immoral even while committing it, that doesn't mean that infidelity is moral, only that the person in question is a hypocrite.  true. i'm curious though, how do you personally determine what is and is not moral?  &gt;just to clarify, that means i'm saying that pedophile priests are not representative of the christian faith.  consider yourself clarified.  &gt;an old theory being revived due to new evidence is not dogmatism. rather the opposite, again. if science were dogmatic, we would be ignoring this data now that we've accepted an ""empty vacuum"" view, though as i said we would never have done so in the first place.  being forced back to the truth because there is no way to make sense of the godless dogma corner they've backed themselves into isn't exactly the way science is supposed to work. i agree that science can only deal with what is measured/observed/tested/testable, although that's not science today (ie - creation of the universe from nothing is supernatural, but that is the big bang), that's what it's supposed to be. however, since science cannot deal with the supernatural, doesn't mean there is not a supernatural.  &gt;the davies quotation makes no sense. how does the big bang theory and the expanding universe theory clash with atheism? is he saying that red-shift in all directions means we're at the center? that would be embarrassingly naive, if so.  i find it amusing that you give as an answer to a solution you don't understand that the editor of nature is more naive about science than yourself. at any rate, red shifts can only be explained by relativity if they are considered to be, what is postulated they are now, doppler effect shifts of light. although, the reason they're considered that now is only because the only alternative is that the math behind relativity theory doesn't explain reality and what we can observe.  &gt;that's bunk. show me how to calculate 160.4ghz peak energy density and a left-biased standard distribution using only the bible. can't be done. how about something simple like the speed of light? not a chance. how about something really simple like pi. nope, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is three in the bible.  this statement betrays your naivety about the bible and what it actually teaches. to be educated on why the bible is correct in all things it speaks of, including pi see my comment from a few weeks ago here..... http://reddit.com/info/1y1g5/comments/c1y4ue as i mentioned earlier, god commands us to ""apply our hearts to find the reason of things"". the bible points us in the right direction for our search. if you don't use the bible you'll end up wasting half a millenia on a bunch of math that cannot even explain the simplest observations about the universe around us, like we've done.  &gt;so? he's either an ass or he's right.  lol true.  &gt;that is exactly the opposite of dogmatism. why are you presenting things that i should be presenting to contradict your points?  i never said every scientist is dogmatic on every point. my point is that on a whole certain very destructive dogmas exist, simply because of the belief that there cannot be a god. there are many good scientists and bad scientists, i use quotes from both. :-)  &gt;fred hoyle's most important paper, originating the steady-state model, was itself something of a new paradigm and has since been superseded by another new paradigm. that makes his statement seem downright silly. my guess is that he had just had something rejected and was feeling cranky that day.  certainly a possibility, however, he had many other theories besides the steady-state model and most all of them were against the grain. i'm sure he was rejected many times during his life because of this anti-dogmatism (against the big-bang). i'm not saying he's a creationists or geocentrist or anything of the sort. i'm just saying he's was one of the more free thinkers. at least to me it seems.  &gt;that's just not true. the science of 200 years ago looks much more than twice as silly than that of 100 years ago. same for 100 and 50.  i believe that is the point that dr. bouw is trying to get across, he's just using longer time spans.  &gt;that's like saying that when einstein proposed relativity, everything that had been done based on newtonian physics stopped working. if we discover an ""theory of everything"" that unites relativistic effects with quantum effects, it will be very, very similar to what we already have, differing only at scales a billion times smaller and larger than we can see. using it to work out how high the apple goes when you toss it will give you the same answer as newtonian physics to 10 decimal places.  i don't believe bouw was saying that all new discoveries cancel out all old ones completely.   &gt;how do we know that it will be similar? because einsteinian physics correctly predicts the uncounted millions of measurements against which it has been tested. it has to be pretty close, because the gps system is designed based on it, for example. any new theory that replaces it also has to explain all those old observations.  if it (relativity) cannot explain even one, which there are plenty more than one (not to mention the whole of quantum mechanics), observation, then it is incorrect.  for more info on gps and einsteinian relativity here is a good page... go to page 31 in this pdf and start on ""is the speed of light constant?"".... http://www.geocentricity.com/ba1/099.pdf that article is talking about this one... http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/gps-relativity.asp i post this link because the url has changed since the geocentricity.com article, part seven (7) in the metaresearch.org article is one of the main parts.",0,,

264772,"this is adapted from some advice i gave to a friend about moving out on her own for the first time:  at least two weeks before you move, create a packing list of necessities. it will change based on your needs and personality, but my basic list of necessities goes something like this:  bathroom:  * bathroom tissue * shower curtain * wastebasket * bath mat * 3 towels * 3 washcloths * shampoo * conditioner * soap * soap dish * body wash * face wash * loofah * toilet plunger * mop/swiffer * shower cleaner * floor cleaner * mirror cleaner * bleach * sponges * hairbrush * tooth brush * tooth brush holder * tooth paste * cotton balls * neosporin * hydrogen peroxide * feminine products   if you do laundry every week and shower every other day (better for your hair) or reuse towels one time each, 3 towels is plenty- same thing with 3 washcloths, just reuse, cut down on wasting water and time spent doing laundry.   do not forget to buy a plunger. 2 am is a bad time to be asking someone at walmart where the plungers are. it is really embarrassing.    get toilet paper in the biggest package possible unless the smaller packages are seriously discounted- it is usually a savings of 33% or more, and you will use it, barring an unexpected colostomy.   i like organic cleaning products. costco has an orange scented one that is like scrubbing bubbles and very affordable.    don't get a swiffer too big to fit the head behind the toilet. eww manual scrubbing back there eww.    you might want a hanging caddy of some sort for your toiletries if you have a bunch of them, especially if you're not big on cleaning the shower every couple of days. that lets them dry and keeps mold away from the corners where you would normally set them on the side of your tub.   get the kind of soap dish that has a top part with slits in it and a bottom dish to catch the water. it keeps your soap from getting groady. and, when the soap is down to unusable slivers, keep those in a plastic bag and throw the bag in your closet or dresser when it has a fair amount of soap in it- soap shards work like mothballs.   living room   * something to sit on * tv trays * reading lamp * something to put the lamp on * curtains * vacuum cleaner * carpet stain remover * white vinegar (to clean walls)   you can sit on sturdy boxes or milk crates until you have more spending money and time to shop around if you don't already have a couple chairs or a couch to take with you.    same thing with something to put your reading lamp on.   freecycle and craigslist have lots of free/cheap furniture, but sanitize it before using. leave it in sunlight for a few hours, spray with lysol, and use a steam cleaner with upholstery attachment to thoroughly clean it. then voila- like-new couch!    if you invest in one brand-new appliance for the move, make it the vacuum cleaner. get one with a hepa filter. if you can get one from a family member or at a yard sale that works, great, but this is probably the most important cleaning appliance to keep in working order, and one of the most difficult to replace parts for if it's an older model. it will keep things looking nice and allergens out of your breathing air- so if you gotta buy one new, make it a decent one.    if you have room for a table, great; but tv trays are fine for eating on and studying/writing/reading if the living room is small, and you can fold them up and put them away when you're done.    add your own entertainment choices-- tv, bookshelf, video games, computer, whatever.    bedroom:    * bed * 2 changes of sheets * 2 changes of pillowcases * pillows * alarm clock * bedside lamp * something to put the clock and lamp on * dresser * clothes * clothes hamper * clothes hangers * wastebasket * kleenex * curtains * desk * computer    you might want one of those shoe organizers that hang on the closet door, too.   get an alarm clock that plugs in and has battery backup. the power going out = no alarm thing sucks.   keep stressful things out of the bedroom if you have sleep problems- i like my computer in my bedroom, but if you get insomnia, put it in the living room. bedroom is for sleep.    kitchen   * microwave * measuring cups * can opener * spatula * pots and pans * silverware * plates * bowls * cups * dish towels * dish soap * lysol wipes/spray * paper towels * sponges * scrubby brush * toaster * knives * knife sharpener * cutting board * sandwich baggies * cupboard liner * baking soda * vinegar + peroxide * refrigerator magnets * cookie sheet * baking pan * tea kettle * trash can * cartons/tupperware   get the book ""101 things to do with ramen."" it is very handy.   use baking soda for most kitchen cleaning- walls, fridge, etc.   if you spend money on one new thing, make it a small set of nice knives. few things suck more than cooking with dull knives.   use the magnets to stick to-do lists, coupons, bills, etc., to the fridge where if you want to eat you can't just not see them.   thrift stores often have microwaves and toasters- same with freecycle and craigslist.   save yogurt cartons (from the larger size of yogurt not single-serve ones) to take lunches to work in.   don't get a lot of dishes. get a few that you like using, but not so many that you leave dish washing until the sink is piled to the ceiling.   keep your stove burners clean. wipe them after every use.   miscellaneous   * pens + pencils * stamps + envelopes * scissors * paper * spare lightbulbs * tylenol * tape * phone * matches * candles * emergency phone numbers * filing cabinet * calendar * feather duster/swiffer duster * laundry soap    before you move:    make sure utilities have been activated and placed in your name.   file a change of address form.   subscribe to the sunday paper- you'll need the coupons.   check pricing on renter's insurance. seriously consider it. you do not want to be the person in the newspaper headline that says ""apartment fire, tenant loses everything.""    change your address with health insurance, car insurance, etc.- anything you can get a fraud charge for not notifying of a change of address.   arrange for trash service (if that's your responsibility).   call the local police department and ask about the safety of the area-- what crimes are most common, what should you watch out for?   get internet service connected.   consider putting in all energy-efficient long lasting fluorescent lightbulbs. the savings isn't huge in the short term, but they are so long lasting that you will save on energy costs and on replacing bulbs.   pennske lets you rent a moving truck at 18- if you need a truck, look into it, and get a friend to teach you how to drive a hefty vehicle.   packing:   get three boxes. label one trash, one charity, and one pack. put everything you own into one of the three, and dispose of trash and donate charity. pack everything else.   ask neighbors to save newspapers for you for a couple of days to wrap breakables in.   get boxes from grocery/convenience/liquor stores.   load the things you'll need first last, so you unload them first.    get a couple people to help you move heavy things, and promise food and booze in return.   you don't have to move everything at once if your parents don't mind you using your old room for storage temporarily- move necessities first.",0,,

to summon this wrestler?â€ psylocke looked quizzically at the man standing in front of her, expecting him to do something or at least say something. â€œwho are you?â€ she asked, deciding to take the first move.  â€œthe nameâ€™s sheamus,â€ the man replied, â€œand iâ€™m here to do what you need, luv.â€  â€œdo what i need? so youâ€™re under my control?â€  â€œaye. just let me know what needs doing.â€  â€œwellâ€¦ what can you do? do you have any powers besides being large and muscular?â€  â€œaye, just take a look at these!â€ sheamus held his arms up to his sides, and in each hand materialised a battle axe.  â€œimpressive. show me what you can do with them.â€  â€œas yer wish, luv.â€ sheamus showed off his proficiency with the axes in both hands, finishing off by throwing one expertly at one of the ring posts. the axe embedded deep into it. sheamus then focus and summoned the axe as it flew back into his hand.  â€œbriliant! alucard, why donâ€™t you try next? just clear your mind on imagine that youâ€™re trying to tap on the same vampiric powers that used to reside in you,â€ psylocke suggested.   â€œyesâ€¦ i shall feel much better with powers again. being human once more is uncomfortably mortal for me.â€ alucard closed his eyes and focused his mind. he tried to tap on the same feeling that he felt when he transformed his body or summoned his familiars. he felt something stir in him, then crackle like lightning as the power surged in him.  â€œoh yeaaah!â€ with a crackle of lightning and puff of smoke, another figure appeared before them. this one was just as beefy and large, but his [skin was a far darker shade of orange, and he was dressed in an outrageous orange tasselled jacket with a matching cowboy hat, and a large cheesy sunglasses that covered much of his face.]( http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/images/photos/002/318/574/macho-man-randy-savage-1_original.jpg?1369071720). even though he was just standing there, he was huffing like he was in a rage, and his veins appeared to be popping from every part of his body.  â€œsoâ€¦ this is my power then?â€ alucard analysed the man that just appeared, â€œcertainly a different feel to yours psylocke. what is your name then?â€  â€œthe nameâ€™s macho maaaaan randy savage, brotha!â€ the man replied in an extremely strained voice.  â€œrandy savage then, i suppose,â€ alucard shook his name at the absurdity of it, â€œshow us your powers then.â€  â€œalright brotha, better hold on tight. cos when the macho man snaps into a slim jim-,â€ randy savage whipped out a stick of beef jerky from his jacket and snapped it with his mouth. it made a loud *snap* sound as randy disappeared and appeared at the far corner of the ring. â€œ-the macho man can teleport where ever he likes. oh yeah!â€  â€œthatâ€™s very useful,â€ alucard noted, â€œbut any powers that are a bit more on the offense.â€  â€œyou want offence? macho manâ€™s got what you need brotha!â€ randy savage once again snapped his slim jim, and a small electrical explosion went off in front of him. â€œthatâ€™s the explosive taste of beef and spices! oh yeah!â€  â€œwell, heâ€™s a tad unorthodox, but he looks like he can be effective,â€ alucard admitted reluctantly.   â€œitâ€™s your turn now soundwave,â€ light gestured to the cybertronian, â€œjudging by the looks of it youâ€™ll be summoning another fighter.â€  soundwave nodded and closed his eyes. unlike the other two he didnâ€™t have any inherent powers in him, although that didnâ€™t stop him from feeling weaker than he did before. also unlike the other two humans before him, he had a more systematic and data-organised internal system, so it was just a matter of him doing an internal diagnostic to see what had changed. when he found it he felt the power coursing through him, though it wasnâ€™t wild or furious like the others. he felt a deep, calming pulsing from within, and the power rose to the surface as strongly yet gently as the rising tide. a shining pulse of light shined before him as a third figure rose from the ground. this one was [much taller and larger, and had more of a dark brown skin, with very distinct features and piercing dark eyes.]( http://cdn.sescoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/the-great-khali.jpg)  â€œmy god heâ€™s almost as big as soundwave!â€ psylocke exclaimed.  â€œexcuse me, our friend here is not much of a talker,â€ light addressed the new addition, â€œcould you introduce yourself?â€  â€œmy nem yis de great khali,â€ he answered simply.  â€œermâ€¦ sorry?â€  â€œthe great khali,â€ he reiterated.  â€œoh the great khaliâ€¦ well show us what you can do then.â€  khali nodded once and then placed his palms together before him. he closed his eyes and focused, creating a bubble of energy around him and soundwave.  â€œyoucan test dee forsfild i yev med, yit is wery strong.â€  the others stared at him for a moment before psylocke chimed, â€œi think he said something about a force field. letâ€™s give it a test shall we? sheamus, give it a good whack.â€  â€œrighto!â€ sheamus charged forward, axes raised in the air, as he slashed down at the bubble of energy. the axes bounced off, with the force field holding strong. he jumped up and gave a flying kick at the force field, and only succeeded in propelling himself backwards onto the floor.   â€œvery strong indeed, khali. thank you.â€   â€œwokay no problem.â€  â€œwell it looks like heâ€™s not much more of a talker than you soundwave,â€ psylocke said to the robot.  â€œi guess that leaves you light,â€ alucard pointed out, â€œsince you can no longer contact ryuk, surely you must be compensated with something.â€  â€œyes, i was thinking just that,â€ agreed light. he closed his eyes and focused. he imagined the same way he would lose himself in thought when he formulated his elaborate schemes with his death note. a feeling of power grew within him, though it felt colder than the others. a chill ran down his spine as a man emerged in front of him. rather than the other 3 muscular men, this man was [short, tubby, and a sickly pale colour. in fact his eyes had dark circles that made him look rather gothic]( http://static.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/paul-bearer-2129685.jpg).  â€œthis isâ€¦ underwhelming,â€ said light, â€œi donâ€™t suppose youâ€™re much of a fighter are you?â€  â€œyou are right, i am not a fighter,â€ the man responded in a breathy high-pitched voice, â€œi am a manager, just like you are. the name is paul bearer.â€  â€œa manager? well i didnâ€™t think i needed a co-manager, but if you have the experience in fighting i could use your advice. any powers from you as well?â€  â€œwell i thought youâ€™d never ask,â€ replied paul, as we pulled out a golden urn that was somehow kept in his coat pocket. he shook the urn around, as the ashes swirled inside, and around them skeletons emerged from the ground. â€œthese are my minions of the underworld, ready to strike at your command.â€  â€œi also have something that would help you all,â€ paul added, taking out a folder from his coat as well, â€œthis is a dossier of the team that you will face. i was instructed to pass it to you, my manager, upon being summoned.â€  â€œthanks, this will be incredibly useful,â€ light thanked him. he continued, â€œwe should spend the time we have left training to fight with these new summoned fighters. iâ€™ll look over the dossier with paul to see if thereâ€™s anything that can help us.â€  â€œgood plan. i may be able to help with the training. as a vampire i was able to summon and control familiars to attack and do my bidding. this really should be no difference. we can learn how to control and give commands mentally to get the edge over our opponents.â€  the team began training with their stands, with just 30 minutes to the match and no time to lose.",0,,

582450,"when you're lighter you can throw higher volume with better form over time, whereas having more muscle on your body makes you feel the burnout faster. it's not just about speed, it's about how correct your form can maintain while also being fast. big bodies tend to get worse in their technique when they get more tired because more of their muscle mass is more exhausted at a faster rate, so their whole technique risks getting sloppier and slower at the same time.  it's not that ""being skinny is better"", it's that being skinny will change what you can get your body to do. weight classes exist in combat sports for a reason, because someone with even five pounds of muscle mass over another person gives them an advantage, all else being equal.  more than sheer muscle mass, taller frames with larger reach confers a pretty massive advantage. being able to lean on an opponent with a taller frame and make them carry your weight is a big deal, being able to hit someone at a distance they can't hit you is a big deal.  on paper, the same weight with a smaller frame should mean you have more muscle mass, so grappling and fighting inside gives the shorter person a strength and leverage advantage in terms of takedowns.  knowing where your body performs the best and leveraging those strengths properly against an opponent's weaknesses is some fight iq you shouldn't neglect, but it's rarely going to boil down to ""this body type is simply better than another body type.""  the other thing to consider with bulk and power, is that if you can knock someone out by hitting them in the jaw, then you can knock just about anyone out by landing clean. yeah, there's muscle around the neck you can train to theoretically cushion a shot, but if someone catches you with a shot you don't see coming, then past a certain power threshold it doesn't really matter how much you weighed in at that morning.  the size advantage isn't about being able to tank shots you couldn't take at lower weights, not unless you're talking about the effects of water loss from weight cutting on your brain. it's that a heavyweight throwing a hook is going to change the value proposition of what kind of damage you're willing to risk taking when you decide to give out damage. size and bulk changes the landscape of a fight in favor of the bulkier person who hits harder.   your shots on their arms won't feel the same as their shots on your arms. your body shots won't land with the same weight as their body shots. you're not going to be cutting them off into a corner and shoving them around the same way they're going to shove you around. getting shoved around by a taller, heavier frame will make you work harder than they're working to maintain the same positions in a fight vs. a smaller person shoving you.   bigger guys can straight up ""power through"" with garbage technique on the ground in certain positions if they're simply heavier by enough of a margin. that's part of learning proper technique, so you apply the correct leverage and require yourself to use less muscle to compensate for bad technique. well, if your opponent is simply stronger / bulkier by enough of a margin, then they can get away with stuff a lighter opponent wouldn't within scrambles. that's what a coach is telling you when they say you're ""forcing"" or ""muscling"" a position. newer grapplers who are bigger bodied can make themselves worse overall until they run into a similarly bulky person who has better technique and checks them by equalizing that power.  rarely is sheer knockout power with more muscle mass the scariest part of fighting a heavier person, it's all the different advantages working together that makes you not want to deal with a person who has more bone mass, more muscle mass, taller frames, longer limbs, heavier leverage in the clinch, harder kicks coming from ranges you're not capable of, less weight to absorb the impact from your guard, less active resistance your arms can put up when hand fighting, less resistance you can put up to stop someone from penetrating takedowns, more weight you have to push off of you in ground scrambles, more weight you have with your body to create counter leverage and bring somebody down with you, etc.",1,0,0

381891,"well, today was interesting. i got to see a different side to these... *telakai*... as they so like to call themselves. crap. timestamp:  **july 1, 2376. 0428 standard time. day cycle 44.**  there, that formality is over with. venn took me downtown today. hell of a place. it was actually very clean. being the capitol of the homeworld, it was no surprise, but still... venn took me to some sort of eatery, where we sat at a long table, and were served some sort of fish-type meat. it was well cooked, and spiced with some imported human fare, so i was not going to complain. i look around the table and feel as if i am almost back on earth. they look so much like us, albeit with larger eyes, smaller noses, backward knees, an extra pair of slender arms, and much, much thicker and darker hair on their heads. ok, so they don't look *that* much like us, but at least they're mammalian. and the girls... oh god. they are incredible. yeah, the reddish skin is kind of strange, but when you're here for so long... all of them have these almost musical voices, and pointed ears. i feel as if i'm among elves at dinner.  venn dragged me off to see some of the night life. we went to a night club, but their style of dancing was impossible for me, being that i have only two arms. i rather poorly demonstrated some human dances, but the crowd was pleased. we left after about only an hour, though. for the *telakai*, night clubs are a part of a niche culture. the bigger, and far more dangerous, part of night life on *shenn'an* is fencing. fencing for them is like boxing for us. it's timeless, it's primally violent, and it shows who's the biggest badass in the crowd. knowing this, i had practiced two-handed sword fighting during the five-month voyage here, and had brought my own scottish-type claymore, forged with a titanium alloy blade. i also came with lightweight titanium mail, a metal cup, and a full-head helmet that was entirely modern. however, i learned very quickly that my equipment still put me at a disadvantage. they had two major fighting styles: two small, fast swords to be held in two hands each, or one **big fucking greatsword** to be held with all four.  venn, being a man of two blades, went to the *ma'nal* class, but i decided to take my chances with the *ma'dro* class, the big guys. now, i'm no twig. i'm 6'3"" and am 205 lbs of mostly muscle. but these sons of bitches were **huge**. the first match i was in, i was downed within four strikes. the second fight, six. but after those two, i learned. i could feel the women in the crowd judging me, ridiculing me. i watched the fights, learned the moves, the counters, and eventually, it was time for me to go in one last time. i either had to win this one or be done for the night. i'm on this planet for another ten months, so there was no way i'd be known as that scrawny human with no skills. i go in and start with a low slide, and catch my opponent off-guard. i almost down him, but he keeps one of his knees off the ground and gets back at me. they call a draw after two minutes, and then we go to a second round. his backers are getting nervous, they know i have the upper hand now.  to explain, *telakai* are ambush predators by nature, and are not nearly as prone to endurance as we humans are. we tie again, and in round three, he's so worn out that i down him with one pommel strike to the chest. i'm given about twenty minutes to stretch and ready up as others did their fights. i could hear a few start to place bets on me for once. when my next fight came, i moved with a little more precision, and when i got inside his reach, i swept his legs and struck him full-on  in the side of the helmet. downed in less than twenty-five seconds, and by a human. i almost felt bad for him. but my last opponent was strange. they had extremely thick armor, and i couldn't tell who he was at all.  but he wasn't so gigantic as the others, and his sword was shorter. i had to fight a walking tank.  only after four rounds did he start slowing down. what did it was a strike to the backs of both knees. i spun my blade in a wide arc over my head to break his grip on the sword as it came over him backwards, and i shoulder checked him, putting him on both knees. i came around, and with the tip of my blade, flipped his helmet off. *her* helmet. she was one of the waitresses from the restaurant. and admittedly, she was one of the most beautiful *telakai* i've seen on this whole damn trip. i sheathed my claymore over my back, and took my own helmet off with my left hand as i offered her my right. she gracefully took it, and i expected her to down me hand-to-hand at any second. but she didn't. instead, she raised my one hand with two of hers. ""i am saeva, who are you?"" she quietly asked. i told her my name was thane, and she immediately shouted: ""*tena ma'dro vatar akuone ratam: thane!!*""  so that's about it for the night. saeva came back to my place and had a few drinks with me and venn, and now she's still here. saeva's still in my bed, and let's just say that she wasn't comfortable with the idea of keeping her clothes on.",0,,

273334,"**lunar biosphere**        the first life forms to live on the moon were specially engineered tardigrades. other microscopic organisms, cyanobacteria, fungi, and other algae were introduced as the oceans began to fill. as the iron rusted out of the seas and oxygen filled the skies, nitrogen from the burning of ammonia and the action of the fungi on the algae and cyanobacteria completed the formation of the lunar atmosphere. terrestrial plants like lichens, mosses and other nonvasculars were set down which quickly took to the virgin environment, covering the landscape with ease. land arthropods were then introduced alongside weeds which did not require deep root systems, while soils were created artificially via dynamite and industrial-scale composting of waste, which allowed shrubs and trees to be planted, which quickly began to accelerate the creation of viable growing soils.        as the chemistry of the seas balanced out, animals were introduced like corals, jellies, and sponges. fishes, gastropods and cephalopods followed. these grew to enormous sizes in the early oceans, and many remain so. several new species have formed during the last few centuries, including the great red medusa, which is one of yohaulticetlia's emblematic national animals. the lunar oceans are famous for giant cephalopods and cnidarians of all kinds due to a combination of gravitational effects and the abundance of nutrients in the shallow seas. but perhaps the most striking changes happened when land animals were introduced.        moths and butterflies, as well as dragonflies and other insects, developed huge wingspans of up to two feet and body sizes impossible under earth's gravity. larger, heavier animals grew taller and lankier, though many lighter, smaller animals also developed a more spherical appearance as their flesh began to grow outwards more than downwards. the lunar goat, for example, has a rounded appearance due to radial fat deposition, and can be seen bouncing across hillsides and valleys building up great speed as they roll. this unique form of travel is common among medium-sized fauna, while yaks and bovines are capable of loping like deer across plains. giraffes tower into tall trees, their huge necks supported by thin legs. sea creatures like fish, cetaceans and pinnipeds can leap tens or even hundreds of feet into the sky from the sea. eagles and other birds of prey are like small airplanes at their largest, and are able to catch animals as large as a young horse.        goats are used as an example of the former ""sphericizing type"" as opposed to the latter ""gracilizing type"" because they lie at the threshold of weight and distribution to have undergone the process. they have bulky bodies that are low to the ground, and short limbs, while humans are more slender and gracile, with an upright stance stilted off the ground. human limbs immediately grew longer and taller on the moon, while goats diverged into two lineages; one with short limbs and a great deal of fat and another with longer limbs and less fat which adopted a deer-like lifestyle. many lunar humans were also less affected than others by the gravitational difference, and some populations have average heights only slightly greater than earth.        many animals which could not fly on earth, or which could only fly short distances, could soar on the moon. the flying fish and other similar species can travel many miles across the open ocean in their glides. the lunar chicken, for example, can be seen in large chaotic flocks undulating above forests eating flying insects in the canopy like sparrows, while they are raised in great numbers by farmers flying in small piloted balloons to herd them. the sparrows, robins, finches, and other smaller birds find it so easy to fly that over the centuries they have transitioned into a role as pollinators for the massive flowering plants, able to hover like hummingbirds. their insectivorous habit caused them to follow their prey into the blooms they lived in, finding the nectar inside the massive flower.        plants also grow to greater sizes and heights in this environment. trees regularly climb to thrice the height of their earth counterparts, while other growth patterns impossible on earth can be seen. humans must deal with the existence of these creatures and many people carry weapons with them at all times to ward off giant insect attacks, especially in the tropics, though animals are generally well controlled in most regions. other animals are more endearing, like the graceful, long-necked moon cat that runs through tree branches like a lemur. in yohaulticetlia, they can be seen in large numbers all over the mountains, especially in the deciduous forests of the langmuir and karrer coasts, and are a treasured national symbol.        human populations who settled on the moon also experienced changes. in the early days of colonization, travel off-world was more expensive and many poor people could not afford to return to earth very often, or at all. many also chose never to return, and started families on the moon without care for the affairs of their terran ancestors. over the generations, growth patterns responded to the lower gravity and the average height increased dramatically, and today is nearly three meters. limbs are longer and bones are lighter, while circulatory and gastrointestinal function is subtly altered, with shorter tracts that build more white muscle tissue to aid in peristalsis. hair is also long and big due to the low gravity and many people keep it well over five feet, often pruning it into intricate styles. the effect on embryonic development has been towards a more diffuse growth of tissues under less gravitational strain. lunar architecture is also unique, having taller and more slender features that can be built of lighter materials.        most lunar people can travel to earth under very special conditions, and require extensive pre-travel physical therapy to get into condition to handle the increased load. blood thinners and special heart medications are used to aid the circulatory system, whose growth is adapted to lunar gravity, while the limbs require metal bracing and the neck needs support. but even the tallest, thinnest moon folk are capable of doing so given the right preparations. even so, most cannot live permanently on earth and have a much shortened lifespan there.        the last major difference between earth and luna is the diurnal cycle. earth is an independent planet in direct orbit around its parent yellow-dwarf star, and it is far enough away that it continues to experience a rapid 24-hour cycle of rotation which causes the light of sol to fade for about 12 hours and return. luna, on the other hand, is the moon of the planet earth. it is located relatively close to its primary, and because of this its rotation has slowed over the last millions of years to a stop, landing at equilibrium with its revolution about the planet. this ""tidal lock"" results in a diurnal cycle on luna as well, except that this cycle is far longer than that of earth, taking the 27 terran days and 7 hours of the lunar orbit to complete as the light of sol moves across the sky with the changing orientation of the moon in relation to it.        this means that, on luna, the light of sol remains in the sky for around 14 days, slowly receding from a two-day noon over the course of the last 6 into an approximately 3 day twilight, and then entering into an about 14-day night of an inverse character. while very different, it does result in sufficient energy transfer to fuel atmospheric convection. plants and animals of the early lunar anthropean required gradual acclimation to the conditions, but most were eventually able to be released unto the creation of successful, blossoming ecosystems.        the conditions of the lunar diurnal cycle are comparable to conditions in some places on earth, like the polar regions, where sol remains in the sky for much of the entire year while night reigns for the remainder. in these environments, numerous plants and animals as well as human societies exist which thrive in these regions which to others are marginal at best. and indeed, on luna there are numerous saxifrages, dwarf willow and birch, yellow poppy, black pines, mosses, and other polar plants which thrive in long diurnal cycles, which have been able to adapt remarkably well to lunar growing conditions even in warmer regions due to their ability to conserve energy through the night. while it took many generations of trees to achieve this balance, the growth patterns responded to the light levels with astonishing speed and elegance, resulting in an interesting menagerie of polar and tropical species co-existing.",0,,

282277,"a friend of mine called himself a ""chubby chaser"" and my brother married a morbidly obese woman.  i think it depends on your definition of ""chubby"" or ""fat"" or ""heavy"".  i myself prefer girls who are average in build, and to me this means some curves but still a feminine shape that is not a fruit. my brother had a favorite porn star before he met his wife, and in my opinion she fit this description. a round face, cute eyes, soft body, large chest, and strong arms are all sexy.  however, i think these all are true inside the ""overweight"" category of the bmi, and some people and cultures consider people like this to be, ""slim"". i dont. i think that's absurd. a little softness in the belly is chubby, and not a bad thing in my eyes. but if you try to search for ""chubby"" on a porn site you mostly find videos of fat girls.  ""fat"" is also a loose term but yo me a girl who is over her ideal weight but still healthy and in shape is ""curvy"" ""average"" or ""chubby"". buy the fat community has stolen these words to describe themselves to downplay their obesity.  in the bmi once you have exceeded ""a few extra pounds"" and it begins to affect your health you are no longer any of these positive words, you are obese (ie. fat.) morbid obesity is very very fat. neither are attractive or fun to tussle with in bed.  the athletic ability, access, and feminine features fade more and more with each added pound. this is only bad in every way for you and your partner.  there is an upside though and this is the 2nd part of your answer. women are still women, and sex is still sex, no matter how unattractive a person becomes, they are still sexier than a man.  so if the guy himself is overweight or obese, then it's an advantage to go for a partner in your own category, so that they cannot judge you. breasts are better bigger for most men. and a heavier girl has less options, and so might work harder on the relationship, be less entitled, nicer, funnier, and kinder.  thats why there is nothing more detestable than a mean, nasty attitude obese boss-b woman.  so in short they are not lying. you're still beautiful to them, and you may have more to offer as a person than a skinny person. but a thinner, more feminine and more energetic version of you is always better, they're just too nice to tell you the truth.  men like curves, not bones, and not beach balls.",1,–2,0

945008,"i'd argue quite the opposite, in fact- a lot of the development you see during the war has to do with changes in doctrine and employment of tanks, with the base technology remaining much the same, while development in the post-war period is where you see real advancements in the technology (though doctrine was still evolving as well).  before the war and in its early stages, tank designs split into two categories- slower, heavier 'infantry' tanks that were designed to support the infantry at the front lines, and faster, lighter 'cruiser' or 'cavalry' tanks that were intended to exploit a break in the lines and then operate in the enemy's strategic depth, fouling supply lines and communication. neither were intended to combat enemy tanks- that role was reserved for tank destroyers, which were armed with long-range, larger-caliber guns, but less suited for mobile combat- most german designs had no turret, mounting the gun in a casemate, while american destroyers generally had open turrets, neither of which is something you want in an offensive role. one of the most interesting outcomes of this split-level doctrine is that, in the early stages of the war, the germans fielded a tank (the panzer i) that actually had no cannon at all, only dual machine guns, and weighed less than 6 tonnes (less than 2 hummers, for comparison). these designs would not last very long.  when war broke out, the capabilities of the new generation of armored vehicles surprised both sides. as the saying goes, generals perfect the art of fighting the last war just in time for the next one, and so the swift, decisive war of maneuver that occurred came as a shock to commanders expecting wwi redux, and forced a reassessment of tank design and employment. the need that became increasingly clear was for a sort of combination tank- one that was heavily armored like an infantry tank, could strike quickly and decisively like a cruiser tank, and had armament like a tank destroyer in order to engage enemy tanks. this concept led to the most widely produced and successful tanks of the war- the m4 sherman, panzer iv, and t-34. these were remarkably similar designs, weighing in the range of 25-30 tonnes, and armed with a ~75mm rifled main gun with 2 or 3 supporting machine guns, and they dominate what we think of when wwii tank combat. there were, of course, still light tanks, tank destroyers, and heavy tanks (which i'll get to next), but these medium tanks were central to intrawar tank employment.  right now, you may be thinking, ""but what about the tiger?"" as you mentioned, tanks tended to get bigger and heavier as the war went on, and the tiger i and ii represent the pinnacle of this, being the largest and heaviest tanks employed in any significant numbers. they were rightly feared, and did massive amounts of damage when effectively employed, but they had a number of drawbacks. because of their size (about 70 tonnes), simply moving them around was difficult. they had worse performance than lighter tanks in poor ground conditions, tending to damage dirt roads and not do well in mud. they couldn't use many bridges (especially temporary or jury-rigged ones) that lighter tanks were able to handle. they tended to break down quite a bit, and their size played more of a role in this then you'd think- for one, that weight was essentially at the upper limit of what the suspension system employed could handle. because of all these issues, the tiger line of tanks represent a high-water mark in tank design, at least in terms of size. the closest modern tank to it in size is the m1 abrams, at 60 tonnes, and even that is quite a bit more mass than many other designs.  now, what happened after the war is where things get interesting. the only real technological breakthrough during the war (though it was a big one) were heat rounds, which use a shaped charge to penetrate armor. all tanks used solid steel armor, fired from rifled guns using stadiametric sights, etc., etc. during the cold war, however, you see a massive boom in development. composite armor (using ceramics, elastic materials, etc., in addition to steel) vastly improved armor performance for a given weight. other armor improvements include explosive reactive armor and wire cages to cause heat rounds to detonate early.guns mostly switched over to smoothbore, the better to fire new, more advanced heat-type rounds, and also for kinetic energy penetrators (also known as sabot rounds). sighting technology and corresponding countermeasures made massive leaps- infrared sighting, computer-adjusted sighting, wind and barrel wear adjustments, laser rangefinding, and then infrared camouflage, laser detection systems and countermeasures. wire-guided missiles and other new types of armament came into play, as did the necessary technology to defeat them, including hard-kill computer-controlled systems. all of this combined puts modern battle tanks light-years ahead of any wwii design- a m4 firing a 1940s tank round would hardly chip the paint on an abrams or t-90, and it wouldn't get the chance to try, because it would have been destroyed before it even knew the enemy was there.  sources: ""the rommel papers"", by b.h. liddell hart (available online: https://archive.org/details/rommelpapers000270mbp); ""tank action. from the

667584,"**the tyrant:**  ""skreeeeooonnnkkkk!!!!"" i roared as the other little animals attempted to flee in terror. i postured and made more loud noises, i knew drowning my victims in fear was the best way to cause them to make mistakes, and their mistakes were my ticket to some high quality meals.  ""there is no escape, you shall all be eaten by me!!! skreeeooonnnkkk!!!!!"" i roared once again. my giant hind legs pushed forth my huge body, as my tail swung to the motion of my movements in order to provide balance to my body that's been honed for maximum speed and strength.  my huge jaws opened wide as i closed in on one of my smaller victims. a half-second later, my prey's upper body was already inside my mouth, bones being crushed by my razor sharp teeth, flesh being torn, separated from their skeletal frame.  ""hmm, meaty, juicy, tasty."" i thought to myself. i continued to feast on the lower half of my delicious target, and as expected, a healthy diet provided it some very good tastes.  not from afar was another roar. ""grrooooooooonnnnggggg!!!!""   attracted by the vibration caused by this creature's loud booming sound, i traced the source with my head. from afar, behind the lush forest, i saw my competition.  he was big, much larger than my frame. i had to look up just to meet his eyes. i was definitely outmatched in terms of power, but nobody can match my tenacity! i've fought bigger ones before. they became my food.  i quickly rushed forward, lowering my upper body to gain the momentum of speed and velocity towards my giant prey. sensing my approach, the titan that i faced moved one of his legs forward, smashing it against my chest.   my body was thrown against the trees. i couldn't control myself. the force that hit me was just too intense, an explosive kinetic power that exploded, shockwaves reverberated inside my body. i had trouble getting up. some of my bones seem to have been fractured.  i looked up and met the gaze of my attacker, but he didn't seem to see me as a threat. he just looked elsewhere and continued on before lowering his neck in order to eat some of the leaves from a tree.  ""nobody ignores me!!! i am the tyrant!!! skreeeeoooonnkkk!!!!"" i roared!  i rushed once again, but this time with a different plan in my pea sized mind. my mouth was salivating for a taste of my worthy prey's fresh meat!  my target sensed my approach. he turned towards me and something swung from the sides. it was bigger than the trees. it was his tail. my head got clobbered and i was knocked down. i lost feeling in my legs, and i could only move my puny arms for a little bit, but the most useless of my limbs couldn't help me at all.  i've already lost twice. if that huge beast was a carnivore like me, i would've been finished. maybe fate smiled upon me, for he was the only creature capable of defeating me in combat, yet his kind wasn't my natural competitor.  my body, unwilling to move, was forced into rest for a few hours as my dominator continued on his way, eating fruits and leaves as he passed by some tall trees, the only things that witnessed my defeat.   **cornered advantage:**  the smaller animals whom i used to chase have somehow gathered enough courage to get closer to me. they knew that i was weakened, and maybe they were plotting their revenge.  one of the smaller creatures suddenly exposed his claw. soon, more of his kind arrived, also brandishing their claws, ready to attack me. they rushed forward and started clawing at me. they bit my legs, my arms, the sides of my body. they scarred me, caused me to bleed. it was painful. for the first time in my life, i learned what it's like being the prey.  rage filled inside my head.   ""i can never allow myself to be eaten by such small weaklings!!! i still have to kill that giant leaf eater!!! skreeeeoooonnnkkkkk!!!!!"" i roared once again!!!  the animals stopped, revisited by the terror that only i could bring to them. i curled my body to the side and the little weaklings fell off. i moved my body so as to push them into a rocky area. there were six of them. six against one, very well. i know that one of them won't be enough to satisfy my stomach's hunger.  i crushed them against the rocks. their bones snapped, their necks cracked. they couldn't do a thing, even during my weakest state. that's the power of weight and gravitational forces. a heavy object will always crush a lighter one even with the slightest motion from the heavy object. this is a very simple observation that i have about the world, i don't know who else knew about this, but i'm definitely the only one capable of using it in battle.  with their bones broken, my six courageous attackers were left motionless. i ripped their flesh off their bones one by one. each bite, each chewed flesh, they were all so tasty! their meat was very lean, for they were very mobile creatures. unfortunately for them, they abandoned their mobility the moment they decided to claw on me, and that's how they got trapped.  a day or two passed, i'm not sure anymore. i set out once again to challenge the only creature who defeated me twice. as i traveled the jungles, the forests, through the rivers and mountains, i finally spotted him. he was still his careless self, and he definitely had the right to be relaxed, for no other animal can really be a threat to him. his hide was thick, his neck was high above. there was no way any other normal creature would be able to cause him harm. he was the king of the land, the largest one in existence, able to view everything below him with a gaze.  i tracked him for a couple of days. i knew that he's someone i cannot kill with brute force alone. i needed to use what i've learned about the world.    **mind over matter:**  he's big, heavy, his skin was like armor that's near impossible to penetrate even by my peerless teeth. had i chosen to confront him directly, the results would have been the same. he'd just kick or bump me away or use his tail to smash me against some rocks.   still, even though he might seem invincible, he has one weak point: his head.  i needed to figure out a way to reach his head. the neck attached closest to his head was thinner than the neck's base. his head was also small enough and it didn't seem like it had the same thick hide as his body.   i followed him around some more until we arrived at a mountainous area. he went down a trail where more of those leaves and fruits he loved so much were abundant. i looked up high and found that there were some loose boulders... loose enough to be pushed and roll down... maybe hit him and break his legs or body and knock him down.  i hurriedly went up and started pushing at the boulders. despite my muscularly massive frame, i still couldn't budge them. my prey was just right below me, happily eating from the trees.  pushing the boulders were going to take too long. i needed another way to make them crash into him, and i needed to do it fast because there might not be another chance!  as i looked around the area, i noticed that the soil supporting the boulders were soft. i could claw them with my strong legs and cause the boulders to roll faster! i started clawing with all of my might. dirt piled to another side of the area, and finally the boulders were free! i gave them one final push, and they were liberated from their stationary positions!  a rain of smaller rocks first rained down upon my conqueror, causing him to look up. he saw bigger stones coming down. he tried to get away knowing the dangers of being hit by something large from above. his giant body, weighed down by his thick hide, couldn't get away fast enough. first, his legs were broken by the force coming from a sharp boulder. his knees broke and the bones punctured through his flesh. he cried. he fell down. a few more boulders hit multiple areas of his body. his ribs were broken, and all of his legs have been badly damaged. his massive tail was crushed and buried under a pile of boulders.  ""grrrooooooooooonggggg"" he roared in pain!  i slowly made my way down the mountain. i felt a different kind of pride take over me. it's not the same as fighting someone in close combat. for the first time i was the weaker one. for the first time i felt powerless. and for the first time, i conquered someone whose traits were overall better than mine.  i approached my foe, my head held up high, my teeth exposed. he looked me straight in the eye. were those tears? why was he crying? i guess this was our main difference. at the brink of death, my only reaction is to fight as hard as i can to survive. his reaction was to cry and accept his fate.   i crushed his neck using the most powerful bite i've ever given and ended his misery. i took my time to feast on his body. he was really a marvelous creature. every part of his body was muscle, it wasn't just his hide that served as his armor.    **tyrant once more:**  as i ate my fallen rival, i did not feel anger. though i started this hunt with revenge in mind, i suddenly ended it with respect and appreciation. respect for animals, may they be small or big. respect for the weak and the strong. appreciation about simply being alive. we all strive to live full lives and have children, and we are not always the ones to survive at the end.  this realization has made me not underestimate any animal at all, for who knows, one small creature whose mind is capable of using his environment to suit all of his needs might someday be able to conquer this world, and no matter his size or strength, he will be called the king of the world.  **the end**",0,,
609387,"**relevant excerpt from source:**  &gt;thin people can be fat on the inside internal fat around organs can increase diabetes and heart risks ... of the women scanned by bell and his colleagues, as many as 45 percent of those with normal bmi scores (20 to 25) actually had excessive levels of internal fat. among men, the percentage was nearly 60 percent.  **more related information:**  &gt;there is clear evidence in most countries with available data that mortality and case- fatality rates from chd and stroke have decreased substantially over the last 5â€“10 years  http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/eurheartj/press_releases/freepdf/prpaper.pdf  &gt;the key is being ""metabolically fit"", meaning no high blood pressure, cholesterol or raised blood sugar, and exercising, according to experts.  &gt;looking at data from over 43,000 us people they found that being **overweight per se did not pose a big health risk.**  &gt;this subset of metabolically healthy obese people who did not suffer from conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol or high blood pressure, were generally fitter and exercised more than the other obese people.  &gt;and their **risk of developing or dying from cardiovascular disease or cancer was identical to people of ideal weight** and was half that of ""metabolically less fit"" obese people.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19474239  &gt;**the obesity paradox refers to the epidemiological evidence that obesity compared with normal weight is associated with counter-intuitive improved health in a variety of disease conditions**. ... conclusion in this large and unselected group of patients with acss, the relation between bmi and mortality was u-shaped, with the nadir among overweight or obese patients and underweight and normal-weight patients having the highest risk. these data strengthen the concept of the obesity paradox substantially.  http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/27/eurheartj.ehs217.abstract  &gt;according to the data, **people who maintain their weight through diet rather than exercise are likely to have major deposits of internal fat**, even if they are otherwise slim. â€œthe whole concept of being fat needs to be redefined,â€ said bell, whose research is funded by britainâ€™s medical research council.  &gt;**experts have long known that fat, active people can be healthier than their skinny, inactive counterparts. â€œnormal-weight persons who are sedentary and unfit are at much higher risk for mortality than obese persons who are active and fit,â€** said dr. steven blair, an obesity expert at the university of south carolina.  &gt;for example, despite their ripples of fat, super-sized sumo wrestlers probably have a better metabolic profile than some of their slim, sedentary spectators, bell said. thatâ€™s because the wrestlersâ€™ **fat is primarily stored under the skin, not streaking throughout their vital organs and muscles.**  &gt;because many factors contribute to heart disease, teichholz says itâ€™s difficult to determine the precise danger of internal fat â€” though it certainly doesnâ€™t help.  &gt;â€œobesity is a risk factor, but itâ€™s lower down on the totem pole of risk factors,â€ he said, explaining that **whether or not people smoke, their family histories and blood pressure and cholesterol rates are more important determinants than both external and internal fat.**  &gt;when it comes to being fit, experts say there is no short-cut. **â€œif you just want to look thin, then maybe dieting is enough,â€ bell said. â€œbut if you want to actually be healthy, then exercise has to be an important component of your lifestyle.â€**  http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18594089/ns/health-fitness/t/thin-people-can-be-fat-inside/  &gt;**men and women who were fit, as judged by a treadmill test, but were overweight or obese had a lower mortality risk than those of normal weight but low fitness levels**, the study in the journal of the american medical association showed.  &gt;exercise specialist steven blair of the university of south carolina and colleagues tracked about 2,600 people age 60 and older, examining how physical fitness and body fat affected their death rates over 12 years. those in the lowest fifth in terms of fitness had a death rate four times higher than participants ranked in the top fifth.  http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/05/being_fat_and_fit_is_better_than_being_thin_and_sedentary_study_says/  &gt;the research, from the university of leicester and published in the journal diabetologia, combined the results of 18 studies and nearly 800,000 people. it found that **prolonged sitting doubled the risk of diabetes and heart disease, and that the risk wasn't eliminated for those people who took regular exercise.**  &gt;this study confirms findings from other research. an australian paper in the archives of internal medicine of more than 200,000 people aged 45 or over found that **those who sat for 11 or more hours a day had a 40% increase in risk of dying over the next three years, compared with those who sat for only four** hours a day. the study took into account how healthy they were, as well as their levels of physical activity and weight.  http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/21/is-sitting-bad-for-you",1,0,0

601470,"&gt;(i made an error in the title: it should be ""cmv: ""healthy fat"" does not exist because, by the nature of obesity, ***an*** overweight person is always at a greater health risk than his/her normal-weight counterparts."")  not all overweight people are classified as obese.  &gt;an overweight person is *always* at a great risk for developing health issues,  that's not how risks work.  risk is a probability.   it doesn't mean all overweight people will always roll the dice and end up with health issues.  it means that when overweight people roll the dice they're more likely to end up with health issues than the general population.  therefore ""always"" doesn't work.   &gt; if it weren't a health risk, then the word ""obese"" would not exist.   the word obese exists to classify people who have more body fat than those in the overweight category.    the health risk is then calculated to see if those in the obese category are any different than those in the overweight,  normal weight,  and underweight categories.     &gt; people claim that one cannot tell that an overweight person is unhealthy, which simply is untrue. if the individual is at a greater risk of developing a grocery list of diseases and disorders, then, by definition, that person is not healthy (relative to a person of a normal weight).  health is complex assessment of a person's wellness or disease, physical and mental, at a particular time.   health is not a black and white issue; it's a broad spectrum.   and it must be measured relative to the maximums possible for that *individual*.  a person isn't ""unhealthy"" because they might have an illness in 10 years.   they might get hit by a truck tomorrow and be killed.   we can only be sure of current status.    &gt;i have been severely obese for 18 years of my life. even at 250 pounds, i thought i was healthy and that anyone who said otherwise, even my doctor, was being rude because he or she just hated fat people. but i've come to realize that it isn't about looks; it's about health.   be aware that research has shown doctors have a bias against fat people and fat people tend to get lower quality of care because of that perception.   one issue i have with doctors is that they're not reading the fatty studies with a critical eye.    here are some glaring problems with the ""fat = sickness and death"" idea.  - any statistical study you do is not a controlled laboratory experiment.  you're surveying subsets of populations to see if variable b is more likely to appear when variable a is present.   when they tend to show up together,  this is called a correlation.   it does not mean a causes b.  it could be b causes a.  it could be another variable,  c, causes both.  it could be coincidence.      so if you read a study that shows heart disease seems to be linked to fattiness, it's entirely possible it's not caused by the fat at all.  it might be another variable (activity, nutrition) is what actually causes the increase in body weight and the heart disease.     - pretty much every study about fatness uses bmi to test who is or isn't overweight or obese.    trouble is bmi is not a reliable enough measure of fatness to use, to the point where it's questionable if we can believe any correlations.   for example,  it puts [this woman at 232 pounds]( http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/2013/01/14/but-what-about-really-fat-people/) in the same category as people who weigh over 1,000 pounds.   bmi was never meant to be a fatty test anyway!  it's [bullshit]( http://youtu.be/glxxog98urc).  it's origins date back to the 19th century where it was used as a statistical formula to be applied to whole populations of people.  it doesn't work right for individuals.   it's known to be inaccurate for those who are unusually tall or short.  it does not differentiate between muscle at fat;  according to bmi half the nfl athletes are overweight/obese?!  it's not accurate for some racial groups.  it doesn't distinguish between narrow frame vs stocky frame.     - when evaluating studies we must ask ask who paid for the study, who performed it, and who benefits if a particular conclusion is drawn.   weight loss is a multi billion dollar industry.   nobody makes any money if a study says you're ok as you are or that bmi isn't a reliable predictor of health.   so you have questionable studies which can't show cause and effect, the accuracy of which all depends on the bmi formula.    &gt;i did not have heart disease, diabetes, or any other disease that i knew of, but i was incredibly unhealthy. just getting dressed in the morning became increasingly difficult. being overweight is * never* healthy.  if getting dressed in the morning was difficult that's a function of poor muscle tone or a health condition (not always fat).   a very sedentary person could complain that simple tasks are too much work because they're that out of shape.    a thin person with a health condition, for example anemia,  could struggle to get dressed.  did your doctor rule these things out before blaming everything on fat?  if i go by the government weight charts,  my entire life i weighed too much for my height.  it didn't matter how active i was or what my actual body fat % was.  all doctors saw when when they look at me is a fatty.  when i was in my teen years i went to the doctor because tasks i should be able to do were becoming more difficult.   he diagnosed me as fat and told me to ""eat less, exercise more"".  i felt worse so i went back.   he said i'm still fat, increase the exercise more.    i wasn't getting any better and i couldn't believe fat would make someone so sick.  he begrudgingly ordered bloodwork.  turned out i was very ill with mononucleosis.   and the advice about more exercise was delaying my recovery!  overall i've been pretty healthy my whole life.  but this year i was feeling really wiped out.  i got the same speech: ""i know you don't want to hear this but your bmi is high and being that heavy will make a person tired etc etc"".  she says ""eat less, exercise more"".   i do and i still don't feel great.  i go back and she makes me feel like i was wasting her time.   she orders blood work to shut me up.   turns out i was deficient in iron (anemia) and deficient in vitamin d!        doctors who take one look at a fat person and use the diagnosis for the visit of ""obesity"" may be committing negligence.   they could be causing harm by assuming everything wrong with a big person is body fat.   just as your doctor quite possible did to you.   there is a different idea that is contrary to the ""omgfatisdeath"" mentality.   it's called [health at every size]( http://www.haescommunity.org).   health is a multidimensional thing,  and not merely a number on a scale.   heas promotes evidence based health interventions for people of any size.  and haes practioners pledge to treat you as a whole person and look at the bigger picture,  never writing someone off simply for looking fat.",1,1,0
115806,"for all intents and purposes, there are 2 routes towards training programs:  1) lift for performance (sports, fitness, general athletic ability)  the people who are in group 1 will naturally gravitate towards a specific body type solely because of their training style. it is no coincidence that powerlifters are huge and stocky, that soccer players are lean and wiry, or that football defensive backs are lean but moderately muscular. they adopt the body type that is most necessary for their function.  if you fall into group 1, your training program obviously depends greatly on what your athletic goals are. a powerlifter will have a different training program than a marathon runner, who will have a different program than a soccer player, than a football defensive back, etc etc.  2) lift for physique  the people in group 2 often consist of body builders and bros. (i have a bit of an issue for lifting strictly for form over function, but i'll put that aside for now). like group 1, these people also often have specific requirements as in what they think looks ""best"". bodybuilders desire huge, extremely toned muscles. abercrombie model-wannabes want to have the ripped 6 pack, broad shoulders, and defined chest, but an overall much smaller look than the bodybuilder. you've got your bros who just want to have massive pecs and biceps, and maybe a 6 pack if they can pull it off, and then often you also have college girls who just want to be thin.  --  of course, there is still quite a bit of crossover between the groups. the people in group 1 will still look very good, but they may not be willing to go the extra 10% required to really optimize their looks. this also varies greatly depending on which sport you play and how that fits into your ideal body type i.e. a soccer player will not even come close to looking like a body builder.  similarly, people who lift for physique still gain some athletic prowess. generally lifting for physique does not translate all that great into athletic ability, but it is certainly better than not lifting at all.  --  as far as answering your questions, here are the general guidelines:  very low reps (1-3): best for power (lifting heavy loads very quickly)  low reps (3-5): strength (ability to move largest weight possible  moderate reps (8-12): hypertrophy (muscle size) high reps (20+): endurance (ability to resist muscle fatigue)  more details [here]( http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/principles_of_strength_training)  being lean is strictly a function of overall body fat %. body builders appear to have muscles popping out everywhere because they drop their body fat down to 2-3% for competition (which is basically unsustainable for daily life). as far as lean being more â€˜naturalâ€™? there is probably arguments to be had that our primitive ancestors did not get fat because they were constantly foraging/hunting for food, and thus stayed pretty lean. the concept of human beauty changes across time, culture, and personal preference so in that regard it is highly variable.  speed really has more to do with ability to rapidly contract muscles. this is mostly a training effect, though i suppose leaner guys would tend to be somewhat faster just because they donâ€™t have to move as much mass around. counterpoint: look up muhammad aliâ€™s videos on youtube of his puncing workouts. that guy was huge and crazy fast.  iâ€™m not sure about upkeep, but you will always have atrophy if you stop a training program. there is no such thing as getting jacked after a few months and then holding that form by doing basically nothing.   --  iâ€™m not convinced that any particular physique looks awkward on anyone, except for the physiques that look awkward on everyone (incredibly lanky, incredibly fat). i know plenty of jacked short guys, so i wouldnâ€™t worry about that. also keep in mind that you arenâ€™t going to wake up one morning after starting a lifting program and go â€œomg iâ€™m too bigâ€. unless your ideal body type is fat and weak, it will require significant effort to achieve your ideal body type and progress will be slow.  also, a lot of the people i mentioned earlier are true specialists. it is also easy to be well rounded, whereby you gain good strength and endurance gains while getting relatively lean. if you donâ€™t know what your goals are right now, this would be a good start since it gives you a strong platform to branch off into whatever specialist area you decide down the road. it also gives you broad exposure to many different forms of exercise, so you can decide which ones you like best. once you figure out what your long term training goals are, you simply adjust your training routine by doing more of the stuff that makes sense for you, and less of the stuff that doesnâ€™t.  oh, and donâ€™t forget your diet.",0,,
436216,"i'll take this one because it's the majority of my research at the moment.  assuredly bulking if-style is far better than traditional mad eating.  the reason is because of the effect if has on one's resistance and sensitivity to insulin spikes.  in other words, by restricting your eating window and target-feeding (post-workout window prioritization), you optimize your body's ability to use all sorts of macros and nutrients for recovery and muscle-building rather than body-fat storage.  this is complemented of course by 16-22 hours a day of fat-burning when you are fasting.  this is the reason you can do the impossible and burn fat, get heavier, and build muscle at the same time.  by optimizing insulin sensitivity, you can literally do things even steroids cannot.  you heard me... steroids are worse than if.  you talk to your body and coerce it to do as you wish with food.  insulin is the body's most anabolic hormone, and worshiping and catering to it is literally the best thing you can do for building muscle, burning fat, and getting jacked.  the reason that rippetoe-style gomad/mad eating works is because people underfeed themselves.  when they begin training, the body becomes a lean machine and realizes that it must utilize insulin spikes and metabolism in order to adjust to the new lifestyle of resistance training.  eating enough builds testosterone, anabolic hormones, and muscle tissue.  by shifting into a higher gear, the body reflects the huge eating with what are known as newb gains - because the body is not used to having a reason to put on muscle or practically use insulin for resistance training.  this is why you should eat tons when you first start lifting... that's the advantage there.  this is the reason that rippetoe's boys can pack on 30lbs of muscle (and usually a lot of fat too) in twelve weeks.  not a typo.  the body is so deprived of utilitarian insulin sensitivity and so famished (ever seen how skinny they are in the before pictures?) that it has no choice but to grow huge.  throw in some compound lifts that require continuous muscle repair and recovery like squats and deadlifts... and it's easy to see why ""2lbs a month max"" is complete nonsense.  the myth of ""2lbs a month"" comes from an inadequate understanding of the body's hormonal functions and the utility of insulin.  if you don't know how to use and manipulate insulin, then yes... 2lbs a month is realistic... because your body won't know any better.    this, combined with cortisol, is why most people struggle to break below 15% body fat in fitness.  it's also why super-heavy powerlifters are usually pretty stocky characters.  sure, they need the high bf% for quicker recovery... but their insulin sensitivity is far lower because of how often they stuff their face to maintain ridiculously taxing and painful weights.  i respect powerlifters a great deal... being 250+lbs is such a challenge and test.  having gotten stuck at 280 myself way back when... i sympathize with their plight.    if does the same sort of thing over again as newb gains.  your body goes ""damn whydoievenbother... you're crushing it with this insulin sensitivity.  we're going to build some sick muscle together!"" and does some damage every time you hit the gym.  you can further optimize this by controlling your portions into larger and less frequent spikes (ie fewer meals a day), using aids (mcts, cinnamon, fiber, high fats, leptin, etc), and by controlling your consumption of carbohydrates.  ever wonder how on earth you can build muscle on caloric deficits?  it's because you re-teach your body how to think about food.  this is why you also don't get hungry.  the world is addicted to insulin spikes... it is literally like a drug.  people think fasting is hard because they have an addiction they don't realize.  this is why most people need snacks throughout the day and can't drink their coffees black.  and it's easy to see how people balloon and get so fat given our lifestyles and lack of activity.  spiking insulin 10 times a day while working in a cubicle?  yep, you're going to be fat.  and if you aren't... you're going to be deprived and hungry all day.  you can deceptively starve on double the calories when you don't know insulin/if the way we do.  (this is the rationale and logic behind velocity, psmf, and severe restriction lg/if)  no activity means no justification for spiking insulin, but we do it anyway with processed foods, high glycemic sweets, and pop/cola/soda.  you literally disrespect the body.  these foods historically were designed for post-cardio and post-workout.  fruits of your labour as it were.  science in fitness has tried to adapt.  this is why gatorade has sugar.  this is why gainers have tons of sugar.  this is why people try and justify desserts after cardio.  glycogen and insulin spikes 101.  when you only eat starchy/sugary/dirty carbohydrates in the post-workout training day window, your body realizes that carbohydrates absolutely must be used for recovery, glycogen, and power-building.  and when you're so ridiculously sensitive, you can eat anything you want and your body will know it has to be used for recovery.  it doesn't matter what they are or how clean/""healthy"" they are either.  thus, it adapts to living on low-carb when you aren't training and realizes what it means when you work out and subsequently eat carbohydrates.    most of the health benefits of lean gains and if can be attributed directly to the manipulation of insulin sensitivity (good) and reducing insulin resistance (bad).  longevity, immune system, joint inflammation, everything... it's all in some way connected to hormonal regulation and manipulation.  i'm convinced through my own studying that this will prove to have long-term health benefits we cannot even fathom related directly to efficiently processing both adipose tissue for energy and metabolizing nutrients for proper absorption.    think of insulin resistance like caffeine tolerance.  the more you stuff your face, the more your body assumes (correctly historically) that a famine is coming and it must prepare itself by storing body fat.  thus, by resisting insulin with super-frequent spikes... people get addicted to food.  spike spike spike spike... ever wonder how people can drink gallons of soda per day?  they're addicted and dulled to the sensitivity a can of coke can have.  they literally build a tolerance for insulin.  same reason why you can eat 5000 calories of cookies or granola bars whereas 500 calories of plain broccoli or chicken is so hard.  same reason why protein bars and shakes and formulas every two hours makes you feel famished and have an insatiable appetite.  further, obese people are just really damn good at spiking insulin while chillaxing on the couch.  with no training or muscle repair to do, the body says ""too bad, bud... time to get fat!"".    the body is a very intelligent machine.  it understands a lot better than we do how to cope with unreliable food storage, how to ensure survival, and how to handle anything mother earth can throw at us.  this includes scenarios where there would be no food for months on end.  with water, vitamins, and careful observation, the body can survive these scenarios with no problem at all.  there was one french study where a guy went more than a year without actual food because of just how obese he was.  wish i could find it.  the whole of the fitness world essentially lacks understanding of this principle so crucial and mind-blowing to if and lg lifestyles.  and for good reason.  people will never get the results they want with six meals a day, insulin spike ""100 calorie"" snacks, and sugar out of their ears.  professionals know this... but they prefer making money to making results.  the reason people think we use steroids and cheat is because we manipulate hormones in ways that even the olympic teams and soviets weren't able to do.  you can get ridiculously huge, shredded, or both in ridiculously short amounts of time when you manipulate insulin.  and you can do it eating whatever you want... no questions asked.",0,,

644986,"i'd like to think that they're more than simply sympathetic noises.  i've mentioned multiple times that i do realise that it's a complicated issue that involves many factors, however at it's core, in essence, it's straightforward.  i disagree with your point about bootstrapping your way to weight loss, i think that you can.  i think it's interesting to look at why people don't, but i'm in danger of simply covering old ground if i mention why.  life gets in the way, right?  life is complex.    &amp;#x200b;  i have a friend who loves cycling, like, it's one of his biggest passions.  sadly he's considerably over weight to the point that it has a detrimental affect on his quality of life because he cannot do rides that my other friend and i can.  we all like cycling up hills, they are what makes a ride fun, but weight is an absolutely massive disadvantage when it comes to cycling up hills (it makes a negligible difference if you cycle on the flat where air resistance is the larger force you're working to overcome).  now, i have spoken to him about intermittent fasting but due to his job, he has significant concerns about how he's going to react to fasting in the early stages.  he works in ""er"" and every day his ability to perform his job correctly can be the difference between life, death and being sued for clinical negligence.  i can bang on all i like about periods of extreme lucidity and interesting clarity of thought when approaching 16 hours of a fast, when sitting in a relatively comfortable desk job, because i am taking no risks.  whilst i know that fasting doesn't negatively impact my ability to do my previous job and sometimes it actually helped, i cannot seriously recommend it in good conscience to someone who relies on performance so critically.   this is just one example but it speaks as to the difficulty for people in different positions to enact lifestyle changes:  people have mouths to feed, mortgages to pay and sometimes, lives to save.  &amp;#x200b;  my sister was very sceptical about fasting to lose weight because of how angry she gets when hungry.  she felt it was unfair on her children to induce a short temper because of wanting to try a particular weight loss method.  instead she did 5-2 fast where she seriously reduced calories on 2 days a week, when the children were at school.  she's found some success with it and now balances exercise, strength building, portion control, healthy eating and, i think, a degree of intermittent fasting to keep her weight where she likes it.  she was never obese, in fairness.     another interesting side to all of this is gut microbiome.  this takes quite some time to change, as i (very rudimentarily) understand it.  you might need to actually spend weeks or months sticking rigidly to a new diet, or fasting routine, before your gut microbiome changes to take the best advantage of your new lifestyle.  i don't know enough to comment on this really but perhaps it could cause delayed positive results for diets/lifestyle changes?  i have read that intermittent fasting alters your gut microbiome.  it also improves insulin sensitivity which has additional long term benefits, helping stave off type 2 diabetes etc.  &amp;#x200b;  \&gt; but you canâ€™t just bootstrap your way to weight loss. weâ€™d have a lot fewer fat people if that was the case.     so, what is the answer?       if you didn't have to work, or look after anyone, for 2 years, and you focussed solely on running as far as you could every week (building up slowly so as to not damage yourself) and cooking and eating high nutrition, low calorie foods, what would stop you from becoming slimmer?  if you really want to do it, you can.       one of my fairly close friends is a long distance runner and i've tried it out, i have a bit of interest in it.  over the past 10-15 years he's gone from looking like a regular guy to looking like a stick insect because his body has literally changed to make him more suited to what he spent a large amount of time doing.  his muscles have leaned out and he probably can't lift any particularly heavy weights, but his legs could lift lighter weights all day.  it's not even about speed, it's simply about time spent doing it.  he dedicated 8-14 hours a week to running, often not very fast, but he did it consistently. those kinds of things change you.      did you know that one of the reason marathon runners are all in their late 20's or 30's is because it takes considerable time for your body to adapt to be the most capable it can be for that?  some of the best footballers in the world are 22 years old, but none of the top marathon runners are.  bodies change depending on their environment.  if the environment stays the same, then likely so will your body.  it's never too late to make a change.  it's not easy, but with enough determination, it is possible.  as i said before, i believe in you, i know that you can make changes that you want to.  the first step, though, is wanting to.  (and i'm not saying you're even overweight, perhaps you just want to get stronger, or be able to run 10km in less than one hour, whatever it is, you *can* do it.  given time, support and inclination, there is a huge amount within your grasp.)",1,0,0

809300,"/u/lord_mayor_of_reddit has provided an excellent write-up, but there *is* a relevant stereotype of fat opera singers that may well have been in the public consciousness when the phrase was coined! in 1978, the same year the phrase became popular, the [new york times](https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/12/archives/now-its-doremi-fat.html) wrote about how a year and a half of dieting had taken luciano pavarotti from a scale-tipping 5'11"" and 350 pounds to a comparatively slender 240:   &gt;but who says pavarotti is normal? as he is physically immense, so is he personally larger than life, and he has captured the public's fancy like no male singer since enrico caruso [also on the heavier side, incidentallyâ€”wulf]. in pavarottian terms, then, the lighter luciano is wraithlike and hugely proud of his ironâ€willed triumph. but he knows he will never be anything resembling thin, nor does he want to be. &gt; &gt;singers, you see, tend to be patsies for the hoary myth equating great voices with great girth. while pavarotti doesn't go along totally with prevalent italian belief that â€œthe fatter you are, the better your voice,â€ he does feel that â€œgreat voices generally go to the important body. i don't want to say the fat body.  there's a particularly strong association between fat sopranos and *richard wagner's* operas. for non-opera buffs: the italian operas from the early 19th century that dominate today's opera repertory chiefly require supple and agile voices, especially in female roles. wagner's operas, by contrast, are very long and very loud (sometimes using orchestras twice the usual size) and his vocal lines, which in musical construction are basically brass parts with lyrics attached, require singers with unusual power and endurance more than agility. compare [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43e9fqkdl0s) with a few minutes of [this](https://youtu.be/qx55emifadg?t=12575) (two of my own favorite opera excerpts, composed less than 30 years apart!) for a rough sense. wagner's most famous operas, *tristan und isolde* and the tetralogy *das ring des nibelungen*, both end with long, challenging solos for the heroines (fifteen minutes in the *ring*!), and the received opinion seems to be that ""till the fat lady sings"" is a particular reference to the end of the *ring*.  i think this is plausible. even if the coiner of the phrase wasn't an opera buff, wagner and the *ring* have permeated popular culture and had an outsize effect on popular ideas of opera as a whole. wagner [wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3szgxcrebfw) the only [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggu1p6lbw6q) pieces of opera music to have reached near-universal recognizability. (you may recognize the second one, an orchestral interlude from the second installment of the *ring*, from its use in the *apocalypse now* soundtrack or a [bugs bunny parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wehnnsmy82a).) contemporary [parodies of opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbgw3a9dg-q) often feature singers in horned helmets, a [wholesale invention](https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/f90aoo/if_the_whole_horned_helmets_ripped_black_leggings/) by the *ring*'s first costume designer (the real vikings never wore them).  and the general stereotype about ""great"" voices belonging to fat singers  especially applies to wagnerian sopranos. *empirically* this seems questionable: the last century's leading wagnerians were kirsten flagstad, who was slim, and birgit nilsson, who was maybe somewhat overweight. but the *stereotype* and whatever its evidentiary basis is go back at least to george bernard shaw, who wrote in a prologue to a play published in 1893:  &gt;the drama of pure feeling is no longer in the hands of the playwright: it has been conquered by the musician, after whose enchantments all the verbal arts seem cold and tame. *romeo and juliet* with the loveliest juliet is dry, tedious, and rhetorical in comparison with wagner's *tristan*, even though isolde be both fourteen stone and forty, as she often is in germany.  fourteen stone is 196 pounds or 89 kg, an ample weight for a woman, even a hardy teutonic one. shaw had been a regular music critic for london newspapers for several years, so he would know as well as anybody. there's at least some support for this. one recent [book chapter](http://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/library/final%20chapter%20moravcsik%20v2%20comments.pdf) on why good wagner singers have become scarcer mentions ""fat-shaming"" and casting directors' increased focus on singers' appearance as a cause:  &gt;heavy-weight singers are increasingly at professional risk. young singers today seek to avoid the fate of the soprano deborah voigt. londonâ€™s royal opera house fired voigt, one of the worldâ€™s great dramatic sopranos at the time, from the title role in a 2004 production of *ariadne auf naxos* when the stage director complained that she could not fit her figure into the â€œlittle black dressâ€ he imagined her character wearing. the alternative to temporary unemployment can be worse: voigt responded by having surgery to lose weight, which, some observers feel, permanently shrank and damaged her voice. the evidence is compelling, if not conclusive, that maria callas degraded her voice in the same way. heated controversy over â€œfat-shamingâ€ singers arose around a 2014 performance of *der rosenkavalier* at glyndebourne in which mezzo-soprano tara erraught sang octavian. andrew clark of the *financial times* called her â€œa chubby bundle of puppy fat,â€ michael church in the *independent* as a â€œdumpy girl,â€ andrew clements in the *guardian* as â€œstocky,â€ and richard morrison in the *times* as â€œunbelievable, unsightly and unappealing.â€ the internet erupted, with female singers claiming gender discrimination and some male singers claiming that fat-shaming happens to them as well. no one contested that this marked a fundamental shift in standards.  and, i'll mention in closing, [one recent scientific study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408481) found (in a very small sample) that overweight women can, in fact, produce louder voices, so there may be something to the stereotype after all!",1,0,0

last call was 1:30? i've never heard of such a thing before. every place i've ever been, last call was as late as 1:50. and surely last call must have been like 1:15, for the clubs to be empty and locked by 1:30. this is pathetic. it can't be true, maybe one of the other places like tavern j are still open, i'll loop around downtown to check this out, and maybe open a few drunks. who knows what might happen?  but as i turn and walk away from my club, suddenly i am in the midst of another bridesmaid party! they're out on the street in a group, they must have just ejected from one of the clubs. i start chatting them up, explaining i just spent 2 hours at a bar with 2 other bridesmaid's parties, and now this is the third tonight. we are laughing and joking around, it's like the mood from the last 2 parties has just resumed. they ask where i got the mardi gras beads, i said i confiscated them from bridesmaids that were not having sufficient fun, and they better get busy or i'll confiscate *their* beads too! everyone is having a great time, i'm kinoing them and insist that the bride kiss me, so she gives me a long kiss on the cheek. i decide it's time to eject and try to find that elusive last call. but the moment i turn around, there is another bridesmaid party walking past. that's #4. i call out to them, and they look at me and the other party with some surprise. i tell them the same story about being caught in the middle of 2 parties way out in the suburban road house, so i came downtown, and now here i am again, in the middle again. they're all laughing, i lock in to the new party, run some of the same routines, get a kiss from the bride, grab some bridesmaid ass, a good time is had by all. but i am pretty drunk, and the details are starting to blur a bit here, one hot bridesmaid is starting to look like all the others. i must eject and continue on to last call.  i'm strolling down the street, a couple stops me and the hb7 woman asks me for a light. i must look particularly approachable tonight. i light her smoke, cupping my hands around the lighter, and she cups hers around mine. i say that i am glad i could help, i can't count the number of times i had a smoke but no light, that's even more frustrating than having a light but no smoke. she laughs. they both start asking me questions like where'd i get the mardi gras beads, i run the same routines about confiscating them from bridesmaids. i ask them about last call, and the guy is all up about that too. i say i've never heard of such an early time, when i lived in la (quick dhv) we didn't even go out to clubs until about 1:30, that's when we'd start looking for underground all-night clubs. they start walking along with me, and the girl grabs my arm, she's walking with a guy on both arms, she loves it. but i have to turn the corner and go the other way, it was fun while it lasted.  i round the corner heading towards tavern j, and wtf? i see a girl wearing a bridal veil again, there is another bridesmaid party outside, #5. the tavern is closed, and they're all sitting on benches. i go up to them and open, this is starting to become a canned routine. i explain this is party #5, i spent all night between parties, blah blah blah, yeah i confiscated these beads, blah blah blah. well it was getting pretty funny at this point, but no sense in repeating it again here. i start pulling my hair dramatically, and exclaim, ""what is going on here tonight? is this june or something? this can't be just a coincidence. too many women are going off the market all at once."" there's a guy who points to a hot young woman and says, ""hey, this one's available!"" i know it's his girlfriend, but i go up and take her hand, and then gallantly kiss her hand. she giggles and blushes, but turns away, back towards her boyfriend. so i turn to the bride. she offers her hand so i can kiss it like i did the other girl, but i grab her by the wrist and another hand holding her elbow, and kiss her all the way up her inner forearm, lingering with one final kiss (and lick) on the inside of her elbow (style has a routine for this, but i'm just winging it). she giggles and says, ""i'm covered in glitter, you're going to get it all over you!"" i hold her forearm close to my eyes for inspection, and kiss the inside of her elbow again. she's melting. or maybe just wobbling due to drunkenness. then i tell her, ""now it's your turn, kiss me."" and she kisses me on the cheek. i've been kissed on the cheek so many times tonight, i must have lipstick all over my face by now, but i have no way to tell. i tease and squeeze the bride a little, and it is time to eject.   i am headed back towards my old club, and at the same spot where i first ran into a bridesmaid party, now i see a different bunch of girls wearing identical t shirts, they look like those ""bar crawl"" shirts. but one of them is wearing a little tiara and a bridal veil. i approach, and ask, in a stern, questioning voice, ""ok, now what is this? a bar crawl, or a bridesmaid party?"" one of the girls replies, ""both!"" i say it can't be both, and there is obviously a bride here, so it has to be a bridesmaid party. i start doing the whole routine again, yeah this is party #6, what is this, june? yeah i confiscated these beads, yeah, the bride has to kiss me. the bride is sitting down on a low bench around a tree but she seems wasted and sullen. i reach down and give her little tiara a tug, and say ""hey i want to wear the tiara. tonight i've been far more of a bridesmaid than any of you guys! none of you could keep up with me."" she laughs, but holds down her tiara with both hands. ha. finally i wrangle a kiss from the bride, she gives me the briefest possible peck on the cheek. i think it's time to eject, and i am looking away from the group for an exit, and wtf? right across from them is *another* obvious bridesmaid party, i can see another veil. this is the same place i started downtown, meeting two parties sitting right across from each other, in these exact same locations.  but this party is different. these women are pigs. they're morbidly obese, i'd be generous to rate them ub2. the most ""beautiful"" of them is the mother, she's less fat, but short and has a very wrinkled face. i feel like pestering these hags just for my own entertainment. i go up to the mom, start running my routines, yeah this is party #7. as i have my arm wrapped around here, i go with the bit about how she is the most experienced woman and look at these bridesmaids, they're sitting there like bumps on a log, and she's the only woman left standing, the girls are looking to her for party leadership. surely you girls can't be finished partying, it's early. the mom is eating it up. it is unlikely that a woman like her ever gets some play. then the biggest, fattest, ugliest young girl asks me in a slightly angry, drunken tone of voice, ""you've been to seven bridesmaid parties tonight and you're still alone?"" what impertinence. i tell her that these were all by chance, you know men aren't invited to these parties. suddenly the girl stands up and pulls the mom away from me. she's totally drunk and wobbling like a bowl full of jello. she says, ""this is my mom, i'm very protective of her, you can't have her."" she drunkenly takes a slap at my face, but i lean back and she only manages to snag her fingers in my eyeglasses, dragging them off my face. i grab my glasses back, put them back on, and mom is sitting on her daughter's lap, but she seems irritated to have been ""protected"" from me. well this is the point i was waiting for, i said i'd push inappropriate kino until i got slapped, and she did take a slap at me. but i am disappointed that it was the ugliest, meanest woman of the night. i would have much preferred to have been slapped by a hot girl. i am regretting that i did not push more inappropriate kino that would have made a hb slap more likely. oh well. but as if to reinforce the point, the ugly girl says, ""it's time for you to go now."" the mom gives the daughter a questioning look, like the girl is being so rude. i retort, ""i'm not leaving until the bride kisses me."" she does, so i eject, and i am glad to get as far as possible from these hags.

991252,"chapter two  silent. wordless. reserved.  each man keeps his thoughts to himself. it was a tiresome day and sadly, a conversation at that point felt like too great of an effort, regardless of how superficial it might have been.   both focus what energy they have left only on what is in front of them. the road. the newspaper. the uneventful drive back through the night, and nothing more.  the asphalt path curves and bends occasionally; rises and falls with the hills. slices through the middle of the forest like an unforgiving blade. it's only in the extended, straight-away stretches that the threat of boredom exists great enough to lure the driver into a slight state of slumber.  if it was not for the uneven bumps and jolts felt through the vehicle's poor suspension, dosing off would have been dangerously easy to fall prey to.  and whereas the rough ride would normally have been cause enough to keep one alert, it was not necessary on this particular night. for something else had come along to perk up the attention of both men.  something mysterious. something unexpected. something peculiar.  as the straight stretch of road continued and the truck barreled on, a faint glow of two red lights appeared in the darkness up ahead, just out of range of the truck's headlights. like a pair of inhuman eyes, they burned through the night as a warning, and grew larger and more menacing as the truck neared.  the heavy-set friend began to slow down as they approached, and his gangly friend lowered his newspaper to see the reason for the reduction in speed. the truck's headlights came upon the scene of a stalled car, parked halfway off the side of the road, just before the edge of a single-lane bridge that extends over a river, thirty feet below.  originally headed in the same direction as themselves, the compact sedan was left with its lights on, its hood propped open and smoke gently billowing out from the front end. no sooner than had the truck stopped behind it, did a fairly young woman appear out from the front of the stalled car, waving her hands above her head, as if to signal to the men that she needed help and was glad they stopped.  definitely attractive. definitely in distress. definitely foreboding.  she was a ghostly apparition, appearing out of nowhere, and although she seemed innocent enough, there was an inkling of suspicion behind her eyes. there was no sensible reason why a female of her stature would be out on such a desolate road at that time of night.  it was dangerous to be alone, so far from civilization, and she had taken a big risk not only in choosing that road to travel on, but also in choosing to flag down these two strangers and ask for their help.  to both of the hunters, they felt a fleeting thought that this scene was a bit too odd; rare to come upon when they have never come upon such a thing in all their travels across this barren land before.  but the uneasy thought was not one to last long, as both men sat there in the idling truck, a good twenty feet or so back from the stalled automobile. they quietly agreed to each other that the woman should be offered some assistance, as it would be the humanitarian thing to do.  however, the lanky individual apparently decided that the situation did not require the efforts of both of them, so he raised the newspaper back up to his face and resumed closely reading the print in the dim cabin light. his silent and juvenile way of telling his stocky friend, ""not it"".  so the driver gave a sigh and a contempt-filled glance at his friend before shifting into park and turning off the engine. as he got out, the other spoke, from behind his newspaper wall, to his companion for the first time in hours.  he simply asked him to leave the keys.  the slender individual need not explain to his friend why. it was obvious that the keys were needed to keep the engine running for heat, and the overhead light illuminated. so he sighed again, nonchalantly tossed the keys onto the driver seat and shut the door.  he zipped up his coat for added protection against the seasonal chill, and trekked onward towards the immediate situation.",1,0,0

381423,"&gt;slimness indicates health ... in the the contemporary era. throughout human history, where food shortages and food scarcity have been a huge concern, having extra weight was a better indicator of health than being skinny.   this is what i was talking about when i said in times of famine the opposite was true.  i meant both thinness wasn't a sign of health and that it wasn't considered widely attractive.  &gt;as well, caring a little extra body fat is better than having no body fat. if you get cancer and you start losing weight, your body starts with the fat. if you don't have any, it goes for the muscle, which is much worse for your health in the long run.  yes its possible to so little body fat as to be unhealthy.  that condition affects roughly 2% of the population of america vs 60% who are overweight.  assuming you were looking for either the thinnest person you could find or the fattest you are much more likely to find a healthy person risking underweight than overweight.  &gt;so the extreme thinness we idealize in contemporary western culture is totally out of sync with historical ideals of beauty, and out of sync with what is actually healthy.  firstly i'm not going to discuss historical standards because its a huge topic and for the most part unrelated to current standards.  secondly i think you are mischaracterizing those standards as ""extreme thinness"".  twenty to twenty-five bmi is generally considered healthy and every time i've seen the ""who's most attractive"" polls related to bmi pictures the range considered attractive is generally 19-25 so it includes the entire healthy range slightly favoring the lighter portion.  also i'm not saying guys are consciously giving out medical exams or that those medical exams would be correct if they were.  what i'm saying is that our current society views thin people as healthier and men subconsciously associating that societal belief with women being healthier.  even if its not true the perception is still there and still has influence.  &gt;anorexia (which kills one in five) and other eating disorders (which are illnesses! not a signifier of health) along with cocain abuse run rampent in the fashion industry.so they achieve a skinniness that is unhealthy, then that gets photoshopped to make them even thinner. so cultural influence is what's driving the slim ideal, not nature or health.  before i go any further i'd just like to point out that the fashion industry is a poor indicator of what men are finding attractive in women as the average guy isn't really their target demographic.  hollywood actress's or porn stars would be a better standard.  those women are still thin but not to the same extent.  secondly this ignores the point of my previous statement.  what came first the chicken or the egg?  why are is any industry striving towards one standard of beauty if a different standard would sell to a wider audience?  again i think you are correct that selling any particular image of attractiveness will increase the likelihood of that image being found attractive.  i don't think you are correct in believing that image isn't somehow originally based on some general preference.  &gt;the preference for thinness isn't as innate as evo-psych theorists like to think. they rarely include cross cultural studies or historical examples.  i'm not saying societal attraction to a particular standard is instinctual, i'm saying its not a product of media marketing.  the only instincts humans are born with as far as i know is suckling.  everything else is learned behavior.  i'm saying there is a reason particular those standards came about and that its as if not more likely that those trends were recognized and exploited by media to increase sales than media picking a beauty standard at random and it brainwashing people into find it attractive over what their preferences would have otherwise been.  &gt;in most parts of the world women who look as thin as north american women do are sickly looking.  um...where?  firstly i'm pretty sure north america is the fattest continent in the world.  secondly  i've traveled extensively and i've never been anywhere that any of my skinny female friends would be considered ""sickly""  &gt;when cross cultural studies do happen, it's found most men prefer women who carry some extra weight - not obese but in the higher end of healthy weight ranges while north americans prefer those at the lower ranges, or those who are medically underweight - so those who would be in trouble if food scarsity or a plague hit.  when was the last time anyone in north america had to worry about a plague (if you don't count obesity)?  probably less recently or less often than in those cultures you are referring too.  again people don't make conscious decisions as to who they are attracted too.  they just have general preferences.  a girl who is a little underweight when we start dating is likely to move into the healthy range if we stay together long enough, while one who is at the upper end is likely to become overweight.  in a different society the opposite might be true.",1,0,0

116000,"jezebel is an awful site and you should have posted a mirror since fuck giving them hits.  here's what it feels like to be a fat person on a plane.    on a crack-of-dawn flight from new york city to seattle recently, i had my first ever, um, altercation with a seat mate. i'd almost missed the planeâ€”i was that person staggering on board just before the doors closedâ€”and i'm sure he thought he was going to have the row all to himself. i flashed him an apologetic smile (i know that aeronautical heartbreak too well!) and pointed to the middle seat. ""hey, sorry, i'm over there."" he looked at my body, sort of glared blankly at my hips, but didn't respond or make eye contact with me. then, as i went to put my bag in the overhead bin, i heard him mutter something sour.  ""[something something] say excuse me.""  my adrenaline went bonkers. was someone being a dick to me? in person? at 7 am? in an enclosed space? for no reason? when i have a hangover? and we're about to be stuck next to each other for the next five hours? i'm used to men treating me like garbage virtually, or from fast-moving cars, but this close-quarters irl shit-talking was a jarring novelty.  me: ""what?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no, you said something. what did you say?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no. what did you say? tell me.""  other passengers: [silent screams]  him: ""i said that if you want someone to move, it helps to say 'excuse me' and then get out of the way. you told me to move and then you just [gestures at my body in the aisle].""  me [head melting]: ""i'm putting my bag in the overhead bin. you know, because that's how planes work?""  him [dripping with disdain]: ""yeah, okay.""  i sat down. they closed the doors. i said, ""looks like there's no one in the middle seat, so you won't actually have to sit next to me. since i apparently bother you so much.""  him: ""sounds great to me.""  as soon as he fell asleep (with his mouth open like a nerd), i passive-aggressively jarred his foot with my backpack and then said, ""oh, excuse me,"" because i am an adult. we ignored each other for the rest of the flight.  it felt foreign to be confronted so vocally and so publicly (and for such an arbitrary reason), but it also felt familiar. people say the same kind of thing to me with their eyes on nearly every flightâ€”this guy just chose to say it with his mouth.  this is the subtext of my life: ""you're bigger than i'd like you to be."" ""i dread being near you."" ""your body itself is a breach of etiquette."" ""you are clearly a fucking moron who thinks that cheesecake is a vegetable."" ""i know that you will fart on me.""  nobody wants to sit next to a fat person on a plane. don't think we don't know.  i have, in my life, been a considerably thinner person and had a fat person sit next to me on a plane. i have also, more recently, been the fat person that makes other travelers' faces fall. anecdotally, i can verify that being the fat person is almost indescribably worse.  this year, for the first time ever, i got on a plane and discovered that i didn't fit in the seat. i've always been fat, but i was the fat person that still mostly fit. i mean, i couldn't fit into clothes (more tunics patterned like a parisian suitcase, please), and i had to be careful with butt safety (i'll take the chair side, not the banquette, thanks), but i was still the kind of fat person who could move through the straight-size world without causing too many ripples. until this fall.  it's been an incredibly busy year for me professionallyâ€”i've probably flown 20 times in the past eight monthsâ€”and one day i sat down and it just didn't work. i was on a flight home from texas, i think, and the flight out there had been fine. suddenly, on the return flight, i had to cram myself in. i mean, i know i ate that brisket, but i was only gone for two days! i'm no butt scientist (at least, not certified...anymore), but how fast could a person's butt possibly grow!?  if you've never tried cramming your hips into a jagged metal box that's an inch or two narrower than your flesh (under the watchful eye of resentful tourists), then sitting motionless in there for five hours while you fold your arms and shoulders up like an origami orchid in order to be as unobtrusive as possible, run don't walk. it's like squeezing your bones in a vise. the pain makes your teeth ache. it fucking hurts.  but even worse than any physical pain is the anxiety of walking up the aisle and not knowing what plane you're on. am i going to fit this time? will i have to ask for a seatbelt extender? is this a 17-incher or an 18-incher? did i get on early enough that i can get myself crammed in before someone comes and sits next to me? is the person next to me going to hate me? does everyone on this plane hate me? i paid money for this?  people's butts might be getting bigger, sure, but it's a certainty that seats are getting smaller. i fit in every other chair. (some people don't. that's fine too. those are good bodies too. those people deserve respect and accommodations too, without caveats.)  i'm sure some fat people are fat by their own hand, without any underlying medical conditions, but a lot of other fat people are fat because they're sick or disabled. and unless you're checking every human being's bloodwork before they pull up kayak.com, you do not know which fat people are which. which means, inevitably, if you think fat people are ""the problem"" (and not, say, airlines hoping to squeeze out an extra $200 million a year in revenue, or consumers who want cheap airline tickets without sacrificing amenities), you are penalizing a significant number of human beings emotionally and financially for a disease or disability that already complicates their lives. to me, ethically, that's fucked up.  a few weeks ago, i went to seattle's museum of flight for my nephew's 6th birthday party. they have the body of an old airliner from the '60s in there, and you can go hang out in it and pretend you're a mad man or whatever and honk the buns of invisible flight attendants. whatever you're into. and you know what? those seats are fucking huge. it's like sitting in a normal human chair, but in the sky. the difference was incredible. (it was definitely the most interesting exhibit in the museum, and that place also has, like, the first plane. which, to be fair, didn't have seats at all. so...upgrade? i guess?)  soon after that museum visit, i came across this post: ""it is now physically impossible for an adult to fit on a plane."" the wall street journal reported that seats are getting smaller and smaller, even on long international flightsâ€”some squeezing below an already scrunchy 17 inches. in case you don't know how small small is, that is crazy small. that's not just too small for fat people, it's inhumanely small for ""normal""-size people too. another headline: ""airlines squeezing in even more seating.""      southwest, the largest domestic carrier, is installing seats with less cushion and thinner materials â€” a svelte model known in the business as slim-line. it is also reducing the maximum recline to 2 inches from 3.   my boyfriend is 6'5"". his shoulders are so wide that he physically must use both armrests (and then some), and his legs are so long that the person in front of him absolutely cannot recline their seat. he doesn't fucking fit. he fits worse than i do. even though fat people are always blamed for ruining everything on planes, i realized the other day thatâ€”thanks to insecurity and my proficiency at origami-armsâ€”i've literally never used a plane armrest. even when i'm in the middle seat. i hear it's nice, though!  none of this is news. the should-fat-people-be-allowed-on-planes debate has been raging for years, and i have no interest in pointlessly rehashing it all over again. some people will always disagree. that's fine.  but i just want to say this: before the day i didn't fit, this conversation was largely an abstraction for me. my stance was the same as it is now (if people pay for a service, it's the seller's obligation to accommodate those people and provide the service they paid for), but i didn't understand what that panicky, uncertain walk down the aisle actually felt like. how inhumane it is. how much it makes you question your worth as a human being. i've done it a dozen or so times now, and i've also had a fat person sit next to me and squish me a little bit for six hours. there is no comparison.  i'm telling you this right now not to get sympathy or pity, or even to change your opinion about how airplanes should accommodate larger passengers. i'm just telling you, human to human, that life is complicated and fat people are trying to live. same as you. regardless of your stance on the ""obesity epidemic,"" these things are objectively true: airplane seats are too small. they're too small for everyone except for small people. it's bad. passengers are going fucking nuts. and, sorry, it's not my responsibility to fix it.  that guy next to me didn't call me fat to my face. i don't even know if that's what was bothering him, although i know the way he looked at my body (my body, not my face, not once, not ever). i can't be sure why that guy was mad at me, but i know why people are mad at me on planes. i know that he disliked me instantly, he invented a reason to be a dick to me, and then he executed it. at 7 am. in a flying fart-can. when i had a hangover. and, much more importantly, i see other people staring those same daggers at other fat people's bodies every day, in the sky and on the ground. it's just a shitty way to go through life, for everyone.  you don't have to change your mind about fat people. but you could just be fucking kind. you could give it a shot. it's the holidays, and we're all in this fart-can together.",1,0,0

what makes you think that is healthy, besides believing dominant, but false assumptions demonizing carbs in favor of protein and fats? humans thrive when eating the majority of their calories from carbs from whole or minimally processed starches along with fruits and vegetables. a free education for junk food vegans: satisfying the appetite begins with filling the stomach. compared to cheese (4 calories per gram), meat (4 calories per gram), and oils (9 calories per gram), starches contribute only about 1 calorie per gram. they help you to feel full for just a quarter of the calories in cheese and meat, and one-ninth of those in oil.[3] plus, they offer a great deal of satisfaction. research comparing the way carbohydrates and fats appease the appetite shows that carbohydrates lead to hours of satiety, whereas fats have little impact. in other words, when you fill up on starch you stay full for a long time, whereas when you fill up on fats and oils you still want to eat more.[4,5] ... excess starch does not turn to body fat: a widely held myth holds that the sugars in starches are readily converted into fat, which is then stored visibly in our abdomen, hips, and buttocks. if you read the published research, you will see that there is no disagreement about this whatsoever among scientists, and that they say that this is incorrect![6â€“14] after eating, we break down the complex carbohydrates in starchy foods into simple sugars. these sugars are absorbed into the bloodstream, where they are transported to trillions of cells throughout the body for energy. if you eat more carbohydrate than your body needs, youâ€™ll store up to 2 pounds of it invisibly in the muscles and liver in the form of glycogen. if you eat more carbohydrate than you can use (as your daily energy) and store (as glycogen), youâ€™ll burn the remainder off as body heat and through physical movement other than sports, such as walking to work, typing, yard work, and fidgeting.[10,14,15] turning sugars into fats is a process called de novo lipogenesis. pigs and cows use this process to convert carbohydrates from grains and grasses into calorie-dense fats.[6] thatâ€™s what makes them so appealing as a food source. bees do it, too, converting honey (simple carbohydrate) into wax (fatty acids and alcohols). we humans ... are very inefficient at converting carbohydrate to fat; we donâ€™t do it under normal conditions.[6-15] (the cost for this conversion is 30 percent of the calories consumed.[12]) subjects overfed large amounts of simple sugars under experimental laboratory conditions, however, will convert a small amount of carbohydrate to fat. for example, both trim and obese women fed 50 percent more calories than they usually ate in a day, along with an extra 3Â½ ounces (135 grams) of refined sugar, produced less than 4 grams of fat daily (less than 1â„8 ounce).[11] thatâ€™s just 36 extra calories stored as fat per day. youâ€™d have to overeat all of those extra calories and table sugar every day for nearly 4 months just to gain 1 pound of extra body fat."" ... the warning about carbohydrates turning to body fat is a myth and nothing more: in humans, even substantial quantities of refined and processed carbohydrates contribute only a trivial amount to body fat.[6-15] the same is not true of animal and vegetable fats, however. a passenger on a cruise ship gains an average of 8 pounds on a 7-day voyageâ€”caused by dining on buffets of meats, cheese, oil-soaked vegetables, and high-fat desserts. so, where does all the belly fat come from? it bears repeating: the fat you eat is the fat you wear. fat is the metabolic dollar saved for the next famine: after you eat dairy, meat, nuts, oils, and other high-fat foods, you absorb their fat from your intestine into the bloodstream. from there, it is transported to billions of adipose (fat) cells for storage. this is a very efficient process: it uses up only 3 percent of the calories you consume to move the fat on your fork and spoon to your body fat.[12] this storage takes place almost effortlessly after every fat-filled meal. if you have your body fat chemically analyzed, it will reveal the kinds of fats you commonly eat.[17â€“20] margarine and shortening, for example, result in high proportions of trans fats in stored body fat. a diet high in cold-water marine fish shows omega-3 fats. the saying â€œfrom my lips to my hipsâ€ expresses the real-life effect of the western diet. fortunately, starches contain very little fat for you to wear."" rolls bj. the role of energy density in the overconsumption of fat. j nutr. 2000 feb; 130 (2s suppl): 268s-271s. blundell je, lawton cl, cotton jr, macdiarmid ji. control of human appetite: implications for the intake of dietary fat. annu rev nutr. 1996; 16: 285-319. rolls bj, kim-harris s, fischman mw, et al. satiety after preloads with different amounts of fat and carbohydrate: implications for obesity. am j clin nutr. 1994 oct; 60 (4): 476-87. hellerstein mk. de novo lipogenesis in humans: metabolic and regulatory aspects. eur j clin nutr. 1999 apr; 53 suppl 1: s53-65. acheson kj, schutz y, bessard t, et al. glycogen storage capacity and de novo lipogenesis during massive carbohydrate overfeeding in man. am j clin nutr. 1988 aug; 48 (2): 240-47. minehira k, bettschart v, vidal h, et al. effect of carbohydrate overfeeding on whole body and adipose tissue metabolism in humans. obes res. 2003 sep; 11 (9): 1096-1103. mcdevitt rm, bott sj, harding m, et al. de novo lipogenesis during controlled overfeeding with sucrose or glucose in lean and obese women. am j clin nutr. 2001 dec; 74 (6): 737-46. dirlewanger m, di vetta v, guenat e, et al. effects of short-term carbohydrate or fat overfeeding on energy expenditure and plasma leptin concentrations in healthy female subjects. int j obes relat metab disord. 2000 nov; 24 (11): 1413-18. mcdevitt rm, bott sj, harding m, et al. de novo lipogenesis during controlled overfeeding with sucrose or glucose in lean and obese women. am j clin nutr. 2001 dec; 74 (6): 737-46. danforth e jr. diet and obesity. am j clin nutr. 1985 may; 41 (5 suppl): 1132-45. hellerstein mk. no common energy currency: de novo lipogenesis as the road less traveled. am j clin nutr. 2001 dec; 74 (6): 707-8. tappy l. metabolic consequences of overfeeding in humans. curr opin clin nutr metab care. 2004 nov; 7 (6): 623-8. levine ja. non-exercise activity thermogenesis (neat). best pract res clin endocrinol metab. 2002 dec; 16 (4): 679-702. thomas lh, jones pr, winter ja, smith h. hydrogenated oils and fats: the presence of chemically-modified fatty acids in human adipose tissue. am j clin nutr. 1981 may; 34 (5): 877â€“86. london sj, sacks fm, caesar j, et al. fatty acid composition of subcutaneous adipose tissue and diet in postmenopausal us women. am j clin nutr. 1991 aug; 54 (2): 340â€“45. baylin a, kabagambe ek, siles x, campos h. adipose tissue biomarkers of fatty acid intake. am j clin nutr. 2002 oct; 76 (4): 750â€“57. brevik a, veierod mb, drevon ca, andersen lf. evaluation of the odd fatty acids 15:0 and 17:0 in serum and adipose tissue as markers of intake of milk and dairy fat. eur j clin nutr. 2005 dec; 59 (12): 1417â€“22. the source is: mcdougall, john.

237906,"the best alternative by far would be to aggressively attempt to do everything to keep yourself from needing these kinds of services; further, thereâ€™s different levels depending on how infirm and ill people are, and the more care you need the more costly it will be.  the flip side to this is that usually the more care you need, the worse your quality of life is and the worse you feel in a general sense, the more of your time youâ€™ll spend in the hospital, the more surgeries youâ€™ll end up needing, etc etc.  for some folks stuff just happens and thereâ€™s little choice, but for many of us itâ€™s more of the slow accumulation of problems from worsening health troubles and increasing disuse of our bodies as we age.  source:  iâ€™m a rn with about 8 years of experience in acute care, with a large portion spent in the icu (and part of that means caring for people during their *last* stay in the hospital where they either pass or transition to hospice care/comfort measures), and my wife is from asia - many of her elderly relatives have a ton more movement and mobility built into their day to day lives compared to older americans, and thereâ€™s an enormous difference in how capable they are physically as an older adult.  this has an insanely potent effect how debilitated they get during the acute bouts of illness that happen more often when youâ€™re older, and how debilitated (and whether youâ€™re able to recover to a normal level of function) are the biggest predictors of if/how much assistance youâ€™ll need).  things you can do:  stay fit and limber.  mobility is far and away the most important, next strength, and finally your cardiovascular conditioning.  going for long walks regularly (ideally daily) is all you need from a longevity standpoint for your heart and lungs.    can you comfortably sit on the floor?  how difficult is it for you to sit down and get back up?  the loss of this ability really, really fucks us up.  if you regularly get down in the floor and sit there for a while and then get back up and do this multiple times a day every day you will be ahead of 95% of the rest of westerners.  in parts of the world where people use squatting commodes most people have no issue with squatting down in their heels and staying there indefinitely, even when theyâ€™re older.  itâ€™s common for americans in their 50â€™s, 60â€™s, and 70â€™s to have difficulty sitting down in chairs if they are too low.  the reason this fucks you up is because when you get sick, or have surgery, itâ€™s harder to get around; if youâ€™re already *barely* able to get by getting knocked down a few pegs can make you bedbound for a bit, and that means physical therapy and a stay at a rehab for typically several months while you get back to being able to move around.  immobility is lethal, so while this is happening all your chronic problems get worse and you get overall weaker, and every time this cycle repeats itself youâ€™re worse and worse off until youâ€™re completely dependent on round the clock nursing care.  your brain will work worse as you deteriorate physically, and youâ€™ll be unable to do many of the things that would help slow or prevent the development of dementia.  if you spend a lot of time stretching your legs and hips, retain the ability to squat down deeply and sit down on the floor/get back up with ease, go for long walks, and regularly learn new skills (especially physical ones, like dancing, or playing a new musical instrument or new sport) you may have decades more functional life than you would have otherwise.  if you also donâ€™t smoke or drink (or quit smoking and drinking beyond an occasional drink once or twice a week), and donâ€™t get fat (but also donâ€™t be super skinny.  youâ€™re actually better off to have a slight cushion of body fat when youâ€™re older because most illnesses will involve some cachexia, or wasting away while you donâ€™t eat much.  think very mildly overweight or slightly chubby, not fat, regular-chubby, rotund, or obese), youâ€™ll have done virtually everything you can do to maximize your chances of needing the least amount of care for the shortest amount possible.  the only other things you can would be to try and take as good a care of any chronic health problems you have as possible.  if you exercise regularly, stay mobile and agile, donâ€™t get fat, and donâ€™t smoke and drink, youâ€™ll already have an insanely fewer number of health problems compared to the rest of the world as you age, but whatever ones you do should get regular doctor visits and supreme diligence with whatever meds they recommend.  if you say â€œeh i donâ€™t feel that bad i donâ€™t wanna take these blood pressure pills or stop eating fried chickenâ€ for years when youâ€™re blood pressure is 160/100, youâ€™re going to have a heart attack, get kidney failure, or have a stroke, and then youâ€™re fucked.  itâ€™s too late to do anything about it.  itâ€™s much easier and cheaper to just take the goddamn meds as soon as your docs recommend it.  lisinopril is like $10 a month without insurance.  i know this is off-topic sort of, but lifestyle moderation and preventative care is so much cheaper and easier itâ€™s absurd, and i donâ€™t think most of us realize how much different the later portions of our life could be with a little bit of investment in our health (especially mobility) now.   itâ€™s much, much easier to budget for 6 months of care in your 90â€™s than it is to budget for 10-15 years of increasingly involved nursing care.",1,-1,-1

 but, enough about spiders.  gather round, boys and girls, and let's take a trip to nature's kingdom:  we journey through great leafy blades taller than houses, a whole forest of them.  it's grass!  we see a huge, tubular, rippling creature the size of a bus as it climbs the stem of an large green tree topped by a feathery white globe!  it is a caterpillar, climbing a dandelion.  a huge tank-like creature with armored segments and dozens of feet crawls by!  it's a common wood-louse, often called a roly poly.  but wait!  we look back, and the caterpillar has encountered a smaller red creature, fast moving and curious.  we see it's agile body has three segments and six legs, and black eyes.  it's an ant!  a fierce and industrious creature, it lives in huge colonies, the entrances of which are marked by piled dirt.  the ant pauses to inspect the caterpillar, and suddenly it climbs onto the great worm and bites it!  this ant is different, though.  it latches on with its jaws, hunches its back, and jabs the tip of its tail segment, the abdomen, into the caterpillar, which rears half its body into the air, throwing the ant all the way down to the ground!  it's a fire ant!  the ant has delivered a toxic poison to the caterpillar!  the ant, unharmed, runs wildly and finds its way back up the trunk of the dandelion as we notice other ants move about close by and pause before running and searching in alarm.  the ants are alerted!  we can see more and more ants through the grass, and behind them a great red mound - the ant hill.  soon, all the ants in the vicinity are searching madly for the chemical trail marking the way to the battle!  the caterpillar writhes and squirms as more and more ants climb onto it and bite down to inject it with poison, and it finally falls off the dandelion stem, to the ground - where the entire dandelion and the caterpillar and ants are suddenly crushed under a gargantuan foot like the base of a skyscraper!  a towering giant is attacking!    several brave ants, already looking for a fight, climb onto the great shoe and they almost seem to have a chance, but they are brushed away by an enormous hand.  the giant's foot, the size of a large, five-story building, slowly lifts up and as we watch it blocks out the sun.  confused ants rush about seeking something to sting, anything that moves, but dozens of them are crushed as the foot crashes down again with immense force, shaking the ground and stirring thousands of ants to alarm deep in the ants' subterranean lair!  thousands of ants begin swarming into view atop the ant hill, mad with frenzy and rage, but hundreds tragically die as boulders the size of houses begin impacting the nest and the swarm of ants!  the ground is shaking as meteors drop from the sky and obliterate untold numbers of overwhelmed ants.  their titanic nemesis, not entirely satisfied with raining boulders onto the ants, periodically slams his prodigious foot down on hundreds of ants at a time.  what he does not see, though, is a small squad of ants grappling courageously up his immense hush-puppy shoe.  they reach the sock, but time is short.  the ants must ascend the white sock unseen despite having no concealment or cover from the eyes of the ruthless titan!  they begin the ascent, fanning out and sensing with their probing antennae as the climb.  one ant gains height quickly - but another ant has made a foolish move that could jeopardize the whole mission!  knowing no better, it is risking everything by trying to sting the sock!  it has a slim chance to find a gap in the threads of the sock, but it may alert the giant.  the ant latches on and crouches its back to sting, but it's no good for now - the sock is stung harmlessly, but the ant isn't giving up.  the lead ant, though, soon has its feet grappling the skin of their enemy, and in only a moment more, it jabs a dose of toxin into the immense leg of their attacker.  the ant releases and moves in a circle, and injects venom again as a great shadow drifts across overhead.  another ant latches into skin with its jaws and delivers a toxic dose, and the ant on the sock has found a gap in the sock to deliver a sting.  the valiant ants are bowled over and crushed by the giants hand seconds later, however, giving their lives for the good of the colony.  but, wait!  odd, unhappy sounds are heard from high overhead, and the great and towering titan retreats from the area.  the ant colony, still in an uproar, is surrounded by tens of thousands of ants, and large numbers of insects in the area have been attacked and killed, and their corpses are being carried back into the colony.  the panic seems to be slowly diminishing, and some ants begin to go back underground.    until, suddenly, a vast column of water blasts the entire nest in a deluge from a huge green tube in the sky - held by the giant!  the entire colony is quickly flooded!  some ants on the surface drown, but many grab onto blades in the forest of grass, and others float, drifting out of control in the flood waters.  almost all the entrances to the nest are now blocked by immense rocks or washed shut by the spout of water from the sky!  the nest panics all over again!  the giant, though, is far away, and only a few ants are within range to attack, hundreds of ants having spread throughout a large area around the nest.  but, as quickly as it began, the deluge ends.  the spout of water and the great green tube are nowhere to be seen.  the colossus drinks from the hose and ties its shoe.  dead ants litter the saturated ground.  some cling to blades of grass and attempt to set foot on ground, but instead are reduced to unsticking their feet from the water.  those ants who did not drown still attempt to target and attack whatever may threaten the colony, but their progress is slow, and their numbers are greatly diminished.  a few ants begin to collect their dead.  a shadow passes overhead.  the eyes of the gargantuan aggressor look coolly down on the aftermath of total mayhem.   we see, from the perspective of the ants, the arm of the titan extending over the nest, with the sun in the background.  at the end of the immense arm is a mysterious disc, transparent and gleaming in the sunlight.  we have to look away as the disc tilts a bit and the sun is reduced to a terribly intense spot by the strange disc in the sky.  around the nest the ants are unaware and - *great gods!* - a burning bright spot hunts the ants across the ground, and the ants explode one by one!  in a sadistic crescendo to the titan's apocalyptic war on the colony, it has brought out the ultimate weapon against the ants!  it is using the power of the sun as a death-ray!  above ground, more and more ants are singed and detonated as we look on in horror.  they pop and sizzle, and hazy columns of smoke rise from the ground all over.  one heroic ant has not given up, though, and, from atop its perch on the tip of a blade of grass, it searches the air with its antennae, not caring how far it must go to find the titan.  it will not give up the frenzy.  but, the burning point of light drifts over the ground directly for the searching ant!  the blade of grass begins to smoke and burn. . . and the sun is again blotted out.  an awesome demigod with its head in the sky, so high the ants cannot see but a hazy blur, fills the air with a roar and, so high up, it points with an arm almost as long as the first giant is tall!  the destroyer of ants flees!  the ground shakes as the demigod of the land strides away having demonstrated its awesome power.  below ground, the queen, receiving news of the tragic, failed war against the titan in defense of the colony, decides they must all start over, and begin again in a new home.  she decides they must move twelve feet away, where surely nothing like the day's events will ever happen again.    /*childhood*",0,,
403711,"ok, hereâ€™s two similar animals to compare seeing as you failed to see my point: a jaguar compared to a cheetah. cheetah is longer, and taller at the shoulder, but lighter, less muscular, and weaker. now youâ€™ll say, â€œbut cheetahs are designed for running fast, and spinosaurus was a semi-aquatic fisherâ€... my point is, donâ€™t get hung up on the length of the animal. i was not saying a giraffe is similar to an elephant, it was simply an example of length vs mass.  femur diameter is said to be a much better indication of an animals weight, and is used in more recent estimates for dinosaurs. now which theropod had the most robust femur again? hmmm. this makes sense as bones are there to support weight, and they model themselves according to the stress they are put under. more weight = thicker / denser bones. if giga was heavier, its leg bones would show that.  giga was probably heavier than spino, but rex was certainly the heaviest on average. i donâ€™t think itâ€™s too close to call. also, ribs have a hell of a lot of muscle attachment, so you canâ€™t say giga would be heavy because of its spinous processes, but rexâ€™s large rib cage doesnâ€™t mean it had more muscle haha! internal organs contribute a lot to weight as well anyway. think of a skinny guy next to a guy with a barrel rib cage and a stocky build. even if the skinny guy is slightly taller, the stocky guy is heavier.   go have a look at sue or trix (that was actually pretty much the same size as sue, some argue larger, just less known) and then tell me that is not the largest theropod to ever walk the earth (that we currently know of).   not to do with the weight debate, but just to address something you said: thereâ€™s new studies arguing that spino couldnâ€™t swim at all, because it was so slim and top heavy due to its sail (or hump) it would just float and flop on its side. so itâ€™s more likely that it would stand in shallow water and dip its head in to catch fish, rather than swim around after them.",0,,

""small fat cells produce a ""good guy"" hormone called adiponectin, which makes the liver and muscles sensitive to the hormone insulin, in the process making us less susceptible to diabetes and heart disease. when people become fat, the production of adiponectin slows down or shuts down, setting them up for disease"" (did you read that?  it says when people become fat..."" ""visceral or ""deep"" fat wraps around the inner organs and spells trouble for your health. how do you know if you have it? ""if you have a large waist or belly, of course you have visceral fat,"""" (so don't ask why everyone assumes overweight people are not healthy) it goes on to say that ""visceral fat drives up your risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and even dementia. visceral fat is thought to play a larger role in insulin resistance -- which boosts risk of diabetes -- than other fat"" ""whitmer investigated the link between visceral fat and dementia. in a study, she evaluated the records of more than 6,500 members of kaiser permanente of northern california, - the records included details on height, weight, and belly diameter -- a reflection of the amount of visceral fat. those with the biggest bellies had a higher risk of dementia than those with smaller bellies. the link was true even for people with excess belly fat but overall of normal weight.""  (did you see where it said that height, weight and belly diameter is a reflection of the amount of visceral fat?) then it explains here how the fat is literally the source of a substance that adversely affects the brain. ""she doesn't know why belly fat and dementia are linked, but speculates that substances such as leptin, a hormone released by the belly fat, may have some adverse effect on the brain. leptin plays a role in appetite regulation but also in learning and memory.""  (as if hypertension and diabetes weren't enough reason to get your shit together.) then in summary ""belly fat has gotten a mostly deserved reputation as an unhealthy fat"" and just in case troluxus wants to pick and choose what to believe from the information, this quote ""unsightliness aside, emerging evidence suggests that pear-shaped women are protected from metabolic disease compared to big-bellied people"" does not say that pear shaped people are protected from metabolic disease... but that they are protected as compared only to their big bellied counterparts.",1,-2,

143598,"&gt;&gt;but since neither exercise nor going to the doctor has been proven to result in weight loss, isn't it time we stopped using fat-shaming to force people into these behaviors?  &gt;what?????? exercise isn't proven to result in weight loss? are you on crack?  an article came out in time magazine this year, [""why exercise won't make you thin""](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914857,00.html).  this is why you are hearing this phrasing more and more.  it's true, exercise **alone**, with no dietary changes, will not make you thin.  [here is a breakdown of a couple of studies showing this from precision nutrition, a for-pay nutrition site.](http://www.precisionnutrition.com/when-exercise-doesnt-work)    i used to be obese.  i am six feet tall.  at my heaviest, i weighed 265, my bmi was 35.9.  i lived in northern louisiana, but i'm from the midwest.  the heat made me sick, so i stayed inside during the summer.  the cold, damp winters were drab and uncomfortable, so i stayed inside during the winter.  the produce i had access to was ... not good.  i ate a lot of homemade bread and processed foods because it was what i knew how to cook.  i moved to seattle, where there is beautiful, plentiful, and relatively cheap produce.  i tried fruits and veggies that i had never heard of before.  i discovered that i actually *like* veggies, particularly when they are raw or only slightly cooked.  i rode the bus to work, which resulted in walking roughly two miles every workday on my way to and from the bus and at lunch.  i got down to 210, my bmi was 28.5.  i plateaued there, but was impressed with my progress.  last spring, i decided that i wanted to see if i could take this further.  i joined a gym and hired a trainer.  i started doing serious reading about exercise, weightlifting, and health.  i ended up firing my trainer.  he told me that i would get big if i lifted heavy weights.  he also gave all his clients the same workout to do in a day, no matter what their goals.  these workouts never had anything in common with the previous one, so there was no real way to track progress outside the scale or body fat measurement.    i started lifting my heavy weights, doing exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench press, with no machines involved.  my body started to change shape and gain definition, but i wasn't loosing much fat.  i started reading a lot about nutrition and ""eating clean"".  i finally settled on 5 meals a day, with a protein and at least one fruit and/or veggie with each meal.  no processed food, no wheat bread (i eat ezekiel bread).  90% compliance, which means 3-4 meals per week are allowed to break those rules.  two weeks of this plus my weight training, and i've lost enough fat to loose a pant size.  exercise alone *did not* work for me.  i had to change my eating habits as well.  i'm still on this journey, making tweaks as i go and learn more about myself.  my weight did not change one pound between when i started this and now, this is entirely a fat/muscle balance issue.  this is an important distinction that people don't make.  exercise alone will make you build muscle and raise your metabolism.  it will make you lose a very small amount of fat, but you will see plenty of powerlifters that have a large amount of fat.  run a google search for powerlifter, you will see what i mean.  look at the people you see in step and aerobic classes every day, they have plenty of extra fat.  diet alone will make you tired, so you move around less.  you might lose some fat, but you also lose muscle due to becoming more sedentary.  that's why people that only diet gain the weight right back, their metabolism is lowered by having less muscle than when they started.  this information is available, but it's hard to dig through all the fad diet information and find people that actually know what they're talking about.  we do know how *most* healthy overweight people can slim down and remain healthy.  that said, it's hard.  it takes dedication and support.  i'm sorry for such a tangentially long post, this is something that i have become fairly passionate about.  tl;dr; there are a lot of misconceptions and misquotes that leave people feeling helpless when it comes to fat loss.",1,-1,
542992,"you're probably thinking of [warren vs. district of columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warren_v._district_of_columbia), the commonly cited case for police not having a duty to ""protect"".  that case established that the police do not have a liability for failing to provide protective services to individuals, if a special relationship does not exist - basically if the police fail to protect you, you cannot sue them.  this is frequently cited and bent a bit to promote the idea that the police do not serve the interests of individuals (a larger discussion i'm not going to get into).  the better way to look at it is in comparison to the other emergency services a town performs.  if your house is on fire and the fire department fails to prevent it from burning down, should you be able to sue them for the value of your home?  what about if you have a heart attack and the town has no ambulance available?  i think most people would not expect the provider of the emergency services to be held accountable in these cases, and this court ruling basically puts the police, for better or worse, into the same category.",0,,

908271,"the â€˜body condition scoreâ€™ is generally used for livestock and pets, but i wanted to do an interpretation of it for kerbals. here is a 7-point system that ranks from severely underweight to severely overweight, with â€˜4â€™ being ideal. the kerbals on the low end of the scale are a bit hard to look at; for me at least.  &amp;#x200b;  1. **appearance**: visible and prominent ribs, collar bone, hip bone, and cheekbones. individual spine vertebrae are visible and the abdomen is tucked. overall skeletal appearance.    **description**: a kerbal who reaches this level of malnourishment will incredibly weak, often having difficulty remaining upright under the weight of their own head. in a panic response, their body will often enter an involuntary partial hibernation state, where their bodily functions will slow down considerably to conserve energy. in this state they will move very little, and will likely become quiet, distant, and docile. they may also, counter-productively, lose interest in food due to this state. a kerbal in this condition requires immediate medical attention, and faces a potentially difficult recovery. reaching this state may also cause permanent fertility issues, particularly in female kerbals, as well as potential damage to other organs.  2. **appearance**: prominent collarbone, visible ribs and hip bone. spine is prominent but individual vertebrae are only faintly visible. cheeks are sunken and the abdomen is tucked. overall bony and angular appearance.    **description**: a kerbal in this state is likely very weak. they will retain most of their normal personality, but will be much more lethargic and may have a fixation on food. female kerbals in this condition are likely to stop ovulating, and may experience permanent fertility issues if left undernourished for long periods of time. male kerbals in this state are also likely to experience fertility issues, and may be unable to produce healthy offspring.  3. **appearance**: flat abdomen, visible collarbone, defined shoulders. edge of ribcage may be visible.    **description**: a kerbal of this condition is considered thin, but otherwise normal. their behaviour will likely be normal, aside from potential self-consciousness associated with this body type. though kerbals in this condition generally donâ€™t face notable health issues, female kerbals wishing to have children are advised to gain weight before attempting to carry an egg, so as to ensure the health of her offspring.  4. **appearance**: defined shoulders and collarbone. abdomen is round but not sagging. ribcage can be felt but is not visible. arms are slender but not bony; legs are stocky but firm.    **description**: this is the standard body condition for healthy kerbals, though the exact shape and proportions may vary between individuals.  5. **appearance**: soft around the shoulders and collarbone, abdomen round and sagging slightly. shoulder blades not visible.    **description**: kerbals in this condition, as many professionals would say, â€œshould lay off the snacksâ€. kerbals in this condition are considered overweight, but not severely so. they are still encouraged to lose weight so as to not risk any long-term health issues.  6. **appearance**: noticeable sagging of the belly. visible creasing at the limb joints and rounded cheeks due to excess fat tissue. ribs can be felt only with firm pressure applied.   **description**: kerbals in this condition are very overweight and at risk of various health issues, including metabolic disorders and heart disease. they may experience fertility issues, with pregnancy being considered risky in this state. mobility also tends to become an issue at this stage, with the usual kerbal gait becoming difficult.  7. **appearance**: large, sagging belly, swollen limbs with creases at the joints. lack of a jawline due to excess fat around the neck and cheeks.   **description**: without the advent of modern agriculture, technology, and consumerism, a kerbal would not be able to reach this condition. obese kerbals tend to become reluctant to move around, as mobility becomes difficult and uncomfortable, and their bones and joints suffer under the stress of the excess weight. these kerbals are at serious risk of weight-related health issues and generally have a much shorter lifespan than their healthier peers. they also generally have great difficulty reproducing.",1,0,0
245671,"usually i try to cut this kind of stuff out of the original creature pages in the interest of keeping them sfw and accessible.  so here we goâ€¦a compilation answering all the b e s t questions iâ€™ve gotten about looming gaiaâ€™s creatures. b) strap in, itâ€™s about to get weird.  (warning: the following text contains some nsfw-ish stuff, but nothing pornographic or violent. itâ€™s all explained clinically. read at your own discretion if youâ€™re easily grossed out.)  **overview**  looming gaia is home to a variety of very different peoples. the magical fae, the hardy gaians, and the adaptable commoners live unique lifestyles based on their very different anatomies and capabilities. one must wonder how such different creatures function in their day to day lives, though it isnâ€™t always polite to ask an elf why they never gain weight, or why trolls smear their offspring with dung.  but fear not, for this document aims to answer all the most awkward questions!  **do aquarians sneeze?**  no. aquariansâ€“such as sirenes, cecaelia, and mermaidsâ€“lack hairs in their noses which trigger sneezing. they can, however, force-eject water from their gills at will. this appears explosive and something akin to a sneeze, but it is called â€œgushoutâ€. to gushout is a frequent and important function to keep the sinuses and gills clean. it isnâ€™t considered unsanitary or impolite like sneezing, since aquarians are wet all the time and spraying water on eachother doesnâ€™t warrant a second glance.  the social faux pas occurs when they gushout onto a foreign land-dweller who may believe were just rudely blasted with bodily fluids. this misunderstanding once infamously caused a decade-long war, in which an elven dignitary felt disrespected by a cecaelian king.  **why do trolls smell bad?**  in their traditional societies, trolls practice man customs which often result in foul odors. this starts right from birth, as the trolls live in densely-packed underground societies where disease can run rampant. so right out of the womb, a baby troll is smeared in excrement from their mother and father to build a strong immune system.  these practices continue throughout their lives as they push the limits of what their stomachs can handle, eating food which has long since gathered flies and bathing in mud rather than water. odors which most species find repulsive are actually pleasant to the trolls, while aromas like flowers and fresh food are considered foul.  **where are the fat elves?**  it is possible, though notoriously difficult for elves to become overweight. this is because like all fae, magic runs naturally through their veins and they depend on it to keep them alive. elvesâ€™ bodies in particular are not very efficient at managing this arcane power compared to other fae. this allows them to use more powerful spells, but at the cost of colossal calories.  this is why they eat so much sugar and carbohydrates all while staying trim. casting spells will burn through calories even more quickly, and casting beyond their means can cause fainting or even death. this is called â€œarcane burnoutâ€. building a higher tolerance to arcane burnout takes years of dedicated practice, much like a human must exercise to build strength and endurance.  **do cecaelia have butts?**  there are two types of cecaelia: walking and drifting. walkers have two legs and six tentacles, while drifters are legless with eight tentacles. regardless, all cecaelia have a cloaca which is located below these tentacles, somewhere near the center. this versatile orifice is used for both excreting waste and laying eggs.  cecaelia produce just one type of waste that goes by many names depending on region, most commonly â€œoilâ€ or â€œinkâ€. this black, sludgy material is actually quite sterile and can be used to make a variety of things, most notably potions and water-proof ink.  **how do cecaelia mate with no genitals?**  cecaelia donâ€™t exactly â€œmateâ€. female cecaelia lay eggs from their cloaca on a regular basis. but if they wish to bear offspring, they lay these eggs in calm, still waters and the father deposits his sperm over them.  if they are strong enough and the water is calm enough, the sperm will fertilize the eggs before they die or the eggs become too old. a malesâ€™ sperm is secreted through one of his lower tentacles, usually the one centered with the back of his head. this tentacle otherwise functions just like all the others (though its host may be a bit more protective of it!)  **how does a centaur scratch their back?**  centaurs are surprisingly flexible, but there are still areas on their equine bodies that they cannot reach. luckily their cultures are very herd-oriented and it is expected that theyâ€™ll be groomed by others. more isolated centaurs may not have this luxury, so they have adapted by fashioning handy tools such as back-scratching sticks and extra long brush handles.  **can a centaur survive having their two bodies separated?**  no. a centaurâ€™s humanoid and equine halves are connected by many vital systems. most notably, their spines, digestive systems, and circulatory systems. they have two hearts and two stomachs, one in each half. they need to work in tandem to support the centaurâ€™s complex body. if one is destroyed, the other will soon fail.  **where are a gorgonâ€™s genitals?**  gorgons have humanoid torsos, but in place of legs are long snake-like tails. there are no thighs to protect their sensitive bits, so these bits are instead sheathed in their fronts, about where their crotch would be if they had one. both males and females can push out their genitals at will to mate or excrete waste. they actually have two sets for the two different purposes, their genitals being the topmost set.  **can a mermaid transform while wearing pants?**  mermaids take terrestrial forms out of water, but when submerged their legs fuse into a scaly fish-tail. what happens when something such as pants obstructs their legs? as they transform, they are consumed in a white light. what is actually happening is a total separation and reconstitution of their very atoms, and the forces at play are intelligent enough not to wrap the mermaidâ€™s body around foreign matter.  pants simply phase through their tails and are pushed aside, removed completely from the mermaidâ€™s person. most mermaids prefer to just wear skirts and avoid the hassle altogether.  **can a roshava breastfeed four babies at once?**  technically, yes. roshava are commoners with four arms and subsequently have four pectoral muscles to support them. female roshava have four breasts which will all produce milk after giving birth, though the top set are larger and a little more productive, so the bottom set are rarely used. in general, a roshavaâ€™s top set of arms are bigger and stronger than their bottom set.  **why are lycanthropes so greedy?**  in short, their appetites are never satisfied. lycanthropy is a magical disease that affects commoners. it causes them to transform into fearsome beasts called â€œwerewolvesâ€ under the full moon. simply having the disease burns a lot of calories, as the lycanthropeâ€™s muscles will naturally grow bigger and their healing factor increases drastically.  they must eat a lot to maintain these powerful bodies. in addition, the disease causes severe aggression if they allow themselves to become hungry, so itâ€™s not unusual for them to behave irrationally at the buffet table. the actual transformation process is a massive calorie-destroyer in itself, which leaves the werewolves angry and ravenous from the start. this is why werewolves are eager eat anything or anyone in their path.  **why do female dworfs have beards?**  dworfs are unique in that they are the only commoner species with bearded females. female dworfs produce a lot of testosterone similar to female roshava, but roshava lack follicles on their faces and therefor cannot grow beards. all dworfs have these follicles and lots of them.  as a result, both sexes of dworf grow beards, though malesâ€™ tend to be longer and more robust. itâ€™s believed this was an evolutionary trait which helped them survive their cold native environments.  **can vampires survive off animal blood?**  short term, yes. long term, no. when vampires drink blood, they are also absorbing the magical life essence of the creature. the quality and nutrition of this essence varies from creature to creature, but only peoples have the vital essence vampires need to stay alive.  a vampire who drinks nothing but animal blood will find themselves growing weaker and weaker, and likely wonâ€™t survive the week. animal blood is only used in desperate situations when they need a quick burst of energy to get them through the hour.  **can vampires get erections?**  vampires hover in a strange state between life and death. though their blood has turned dark and unfit for other vampires to consume, their circulatory systems still function very well. in fact their hearts have grown even stronger to accommodate this sludgy, cursed bloodâ€“to the point that male vampires find themselves with shorter refractory periods during sex. this is part of what gives vampires their stereotypes as dark seducers of the night.  **â€¦what about zombies?**  no. thank god.  *  a lot of these questions came from redditors, so if you see yours give a shout. ;) and if you have any more weird questions, i'll do my best to answer.  you can see my lore masterpost here: http://mythicalshoes.tumblr.com/post/165447246045/looming-gaia-lore-masterpost",1,0,
111699,"&gt;i am 25 years old, 6â€™1â€™â€™ and 280 unathletic pounds. iâ€™ve been lifting for since i was a teenager and my numbers are 420 squat, 495 dead and a 350 bench. now i know my lifts arenâ€™t anywhere close to impressive due to my massive bodyweight, but i always kept telling myself that relative strength is for girls - absolute strength is what truly matters! but now looking like a sack of potatoes and getting whinded going up some stairs, iâ€™m starting to see the light.  **i've got a long story for you. it's about having been thin, then morbidly obese for a bit, then getting fitter/smaller/leaner and feeling great, then getting stronger but fatter, then moving onto bodyweight/calisthenics and going back to smaller, leaner, fitter-feeling but weaker. i hope you read it and get back to me! i feel we have stuff in common with our past workout experiences and goals.**  ---  the last time that i lifted weights (age 30-to-32 -- i am now 36 and have been doing bwf/calisthenics just over 4 years) i never got super strong or had impressive lifts, but for me because i had stuck with it for just over 2 years, the longest i'd ever done before, i was stronger than i'd ever been. i just took it slow and moved up in weight when i could. once 3x8 became too hard to hit i switched to 3x5. i did barbell bench, barbell rows, barbell overhead press, barbell squats, barbell deadlifts, and weighted dips and weighted chin ups.  i also weighed more than i should. i'm short: 5'4"" tall. at the time i weighed between 160 and 165 pounds. i had some muscle, but i was also chunky/fat. i had a pretty big gut. i did have a bit of a chest, but there was extra fat on top of it.  as far as doing bodyweight stuff i didn't really give that a serious chance until i'd become so unhappy with weights that i couldn't stand doing them anymore. i also began to think that it would be better for me to be lighter and to aim more for higher reps for some things, smaller reps and 'strength work' for some other things. i'd already lifted weights on and off a few times before and would last maybe 1 year, 1/2 a year at a time, stop, do nothing, try again, hate it. repeat.  the very first time i'd gotten into exercise was from age 20-to-21. i had been thin for most of my teenage years, but then once i got closer to age 18 i got fatter. i then became obese. then i was bordering on morbidly obese. i remember weighing 225 pounds at just 5'4"" tall at about age 19. i learned to eat less and better, lost a ton of weight, started lots of fast walking, and lifted weights (3x10 with 1 min. rest between sets for 1-to-1.5yrs) and got to around 145lbs. i stopped lifting regularly the closer i got to 22, then stopped completely.  when i was still lifting weights i felt strong, but not really too fit and i remember looking and feeling way fitter at 145lbs at age 22  once i gave bodyweight/calisthenics a shot after i'd read several books and had been reading this subreddit and other websites for a few years i fell in love. i've only ever wanted to work out to stay in shape and to take care of myself, so i'm not looking to be the strongest and to master all the most complex moves or skills.  these days my weight stays between 140-to-145 pounds. i feel much better in general. i enjoy what i do far more. i feel much better about my body. i'm not big, but i do have muscle on me, but more importantly i feel so much better being around this size and i feel that i just do much more so much more easily when it comes to physical activity in real life.  we all want something unique to ourselves out of what we do for fitness. this can change over time as we grow older, learn more, and realize things. some want to be the best and focus in some area of competition for strength training or sport. some want to be the strongest they can be at a hobby for fitness they enjoy. many of us just end up wanting to be physically fit, healthier, feel better mentally and physically, feel better about ourselves, make life easier, and just be content with that while working hard to stay that way.  so far as the amount of weight i can lift for dips and chins i'm far weaker than i was. i used to weigh 160-to-165lbs when i was still lifting weights and i could do weighted chins for 3 or 4 reps a set with +32.5lbs and do weighted parallel bar dips with +72.5lbs for i think 4 or 5 reps per first or second set. at age 32 when i was the same weight and reached my birthday i recorded a video of me doing just 2 reps of weighted chin ups with +50lbs on the dip belt.  the weighted chins didn't help me do more quality/easier bodyweight chin reps or pull up reps. heavy weighted dips didn't lead to higher or easier reps of bodyweight dips. neither helped me to get higher easier reps for anything else i did bodyweight/calisthenics-wise.  now i want to have a good balance of relative strength, some maximal strength for some harder progressions at few reps, but mainly good strength endurance/higher reps along with general cardio fitness while doing tons of fast walking (which i love!)  these days i focus on bodyweight pull ups and am slowly getting my reps back up (slowly, they're low because i slacked off a long time), and for weighted dips at 140-to-145lbs i dropped the weight to +50lbs and am still just doing 3 or 4 reps in the first and second sets. i want to take my time and get up to 3x8 now for weighted dips.  i'm much happier being smaller, leaner, with defined muscle on me, and feeling that i'm more balanced between strength and strength endurance. it really helps to apply to real life physical demands. i help my senior citizen father split firewood sometimes. he's still fit for his late 60's, but i can do a lot more at a steady pace than he can. splitting firewood is amazing exercise, by the way! especially if you're splitting oak hardwood!  thanks for taking the time to read. please write back as much as you

383864,"i've  been very, very fat my whole life. currently 36 yrs, female, 5'4"" and  470-ish lbs. my father was thin, my mother was, and still is, rather  fat, but not huge.  mother was very  loving and an incredible cook. she showed love by making huge delicious  meals and dishing out way too much for me. i think she did that because  it's how she was raised as well.  father  was an abusive, controlling ass. at least to me. he seemed to genuinely  love mom, but he acted like i was an inconvenience at best, and a  burden at worst. he would beat me (and i do mean beat, not spank, i know  the difference) on a weekly basis for the smallest/dumbest things  (taking too long in bathroom, getting a c on report card, dropping my  fork at dinner, etc.).  we had a rule in  his house: at the table, you clean your plate. no exceptions, no excuses.  whatever you're given, you'd better eat. this isn't that unusual, but  combined with mom's habit of overfeeding me, it meant i'd be stuffed to  the gills at every meal. and that led me to putting on an awful lot of  weight from a very young age.  of  course, my stomach eventually adjusted to the large portions i was  getting, so i'd be able to eat it all without complaining. then mom  would increase my helpings, thinking i wasn't getting enough.  my  father hated me for being fat. he'd berate me almost constantly, tell  me how ugly i was, etc. strangely, he never said any of that about mom,  or did anything to stop her from feeding me so much. the thought did  cross my mind that he wanted me to be fat so he'd have more ammunition  against me. looking back, i'm almost 100% sure that was true. anyway. as  a way to cope, i turned to food. i associated food with comfort and  love because of mom, so it felt like a natural way to escape. as you can  imagine, this did nothing to solve my weight problem.  i  was over 400 pounds at age 14. by 18, i was nearly 600 (i don't remember  what exactly i was at my heaviest, but it was in the low 590s. enough  that my doctor rounded it up and used 600 as a shortcut in her  conversation with me afterwards).  now, i  do believe it's possible to be fat and healthy, even if you're morbidly  obese. if you eat good foods and get exercise, you can be in good shape  even if you're overweight. but, let me tell you something about being  almost 600 pounds. it hurts. a lot. i. was. so. fucking. heavy. all that  extra weight on me was murder on my joints. my feet would hurt within a  few seconds of standing up. my ankles and knees ached when standing or  walking. my back ached 24/7, 365. i was almost always just a little out  of breath, because my lungs couldn't provide for my huge body. i was so fat, i could barely move. i walked  with a very slow, careful waddle, with my arms swaying awkwardly to keep  myself balanced, because i knew if i moved the wrong way i would throw  out my back, or trip and fall (i couldn't see where i was stepping  because my belly was so big). i fell a few times and couldn't get back  up. at my heaviest, it took 4 people to help me up off the floor.  remember, this is an 18 year old girl we're talking about. i'd have to  scuttle through doors sideways because of how wide i was, and even then,  it was a squeeze. even getting into and out of bed was becoming a  serious production.  now, you're  probably asking why i let myself get so big. surely i could see what was  happening, how debilitating my weight was. well, yes and no. i was  fully aware that i was extremely overweight, and clearly unhealthy, but  it's also something that happens over time. the fat doesn't just pile on  all at once and make you go holy shit i gotta do something. it's a  gradual process, fools you into thinking everything is normal. my back  didn't just start hurting like hell one day. it started as mild  discomfort, slowly morphing into a constant twinge, then a gnawing ache,  then chronic pain. i didn't just lose my breath suddenly and never get  it back. first i'd get winded going up stairs, then walking quickly,  then walking at all, and finally, even when sitting i'd be taking deep  breaths to keep up with my body's demands.  i was the proverbial frog,  being slowly boiled alive. i was literally being fed to death by my parents.  a lot of fat  people get a sudden wake up call. that one thing that happens and makes  you go, ""holy fuck, if i don't lose weight i'm going to die next year.""  that didn't happen for me. what was my turning point? i moved out. that  was it. i moved out of my parents house, got a job (office receptionist)  and an apartment, and just lived on my own from that point. without my  father's constant abuse and harassment, i all but stopped stress eating,  and away from my mother's cooking, my portions decreased. i was still a  very big eater (i do still love to eat, honestly), but nothing like i  was at home. i made a few friends and would go to the gym with them, and  the weight began to come off. eventually i stopped going to buffets and  mcrestaraunts, and began eating healthier like them. i hated how hard  it was to move and do things, so i started lifting weights too.  it's  been about 18 years since i left home. i'm still very fat. i know this.  i only lost about 125 pounds. that might seem like a lot, and it is,  but it was only 1/5 of my highest weight. i'm not really making a  focused effort to slim down. i'm just trying to be healthy, and it's  happening on its own. i know i'll never be thin. i'm okay with that. i  can do so much more now. i still waddle, but it doesn't hurt to move. i  still get winded on stairs, but i'm not constantly struggling to catch  my breath. my back still hurts on occasion, but i don't constantly feel  like i'm being crushed by my own weight. and yes, i do still eat more  than i really should, but i'm not going to bed feeling like my stomach  is about to pop.  i'm still losing  weight, though very slowly. if i can get to a bit over 400, or maybe  even less, i think i'll be alright. my body knows what it wants to do. i  try to make good choices in food, and in amounts that feel comfortable  for me, but yes, i do love pie, and i'm going to have some every  saturday. it's my special treat for myself. when my body gets to a  weight its comfortable with, i'll probably stop losing. and when that  happens, i'm sure i'll still be a great big fat woman.  but at least i'm not 600 fucking pounds anymore.",1,-2,

980278,"well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist. lets take cuba first. it was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s. today the population has a life expactancy longer than america. there's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the us' terrorist war and blockade of the island.  in venezuela poverty has halved in ten years, illiteracy has been wiped out, there are 50% more people voting in elections than before, malnourishment has been banished forever etc.   there's a common idea that what was called 'socialism' in eastern europe failed. well, it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument. i grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world. since 1989 the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again. sure, gdp might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything, such as the right to not die or the right to go to school.   at the heart of your question is what constitutes being 'poor'. i really don't think there are any poor countries left- maybe 200-300 years ago there were. let me explain; i imagine africa and asia were your ideas of 'poor places'. but this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the british. robert clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities, gold dripping from wall to wall. democratic republic of the congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world. and yet it may have more natural resources than any other. it is teeming with minerals and metals. where's the money going? into dutch oil companies, scandanavian electronic corporations and us rubber companies. in fact, the countries which 'should' be poorest, those with the least amount of resources, are the richest (western europe). there are no poor countries, only poor people.   what i'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out, these countries would be richer than the us and the uk were in the 20s and 30s. there are really only rich or mega-rich countries now, but, because of capitalism, the majority of the world still lives in poverty. so, in answer, the people would be much better off under socialism.",0,,

    framed in the center of the shot was an ebony skinned woman. her traditional purple ionian garb clung     to her shapely form as she fidgeted nervously on a plain leather couch in a rather remarkably featureless     room. although there was a black bar hiding her eyes, the identity of the woman was unmistakably     karma, the enlightened one.      â€œokay, we're rolling. tell us about yourself.â€ a male voice called out from behind the camera.      â€œthis is-- you're going to edit this out right?â€ karma asked, her voice wavering.      â€œwe'll make sure to censor it to 'protect' your identity...â€ the man assured her.      â€œ...alright. my name is k????. i'm ?? years old. i'm here to hopefully negotiate my standing on the     fields of justice.â€      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:03:32] -     karma was standing up, holding her hands together with her arms raised above her      â€œis this really necessary?â€ karma questioned. her face began to redden.      â€œits just part of the documentation procedure, don't worry so much.â€ he responded dryly, brushing off     her concerns nonchantly. â€œnow can you please turn around?â€     karma shifted her eyes apprehensively, hesitating for only a moment before twirling around. her     shapely rear subtly jiggling below her dress from the abrupt movement.     â€œdamn...â€ the camera-man said below his breath.     â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:06:50] -      â€œyou want me to what?!â€ karma snapped, blushing furiously at the man's proposition. she stood up,     ready to storm out the door.      â€œlook, you don't have to do anything. you came here on your own, remember?â€ he reminded. â€œyou     can leave at any time. but you wanted a better win-rate, right? and i can make that happen.â€     karma tapped her foot, contemplating. her expression softened from a glare to embarrassment as she     sank back down into the couch.      â€œ...no one is going to see this?â€ karma wanted confirmation.      â€œit will stay in my personal archives, i assure you. plus your identity is censored, you have nothing to     worry about.â€ the man replied, trying to sound as convincing as possible.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:08:49] -     karma unclasped the upper half of her dress, exposing her chest briefly before she maneuvered her     arm and covered and cupping both of her ample breasts, hiding her ebony flesh from view.      â€œ...this will get me buffs... right?â€ she asked, nervously      â€œyeah, of course!â€ the camera-man assured her. in 3 years. â€œnow... how about you move your hands     out of the way?     karma pursed her lips and looked nervously to the side, her blush deepening as the camera's focus     zoomed in closer on her chest. she lowered her arm, letting her ample tits fall and exposing her     quickly-stiffening chocolate nipples.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:10:22] -     karma was leaning forward on the mans desk, pressing her boobs together between her arms, looking     away from the camera.      â€œhow big are they?â€ the man asked, reaching out to grope her exposed chest.      â€œthey're an -nnh-,â€ she stuttered, trying not to react as the man cupped her right boob and gave her soft     flesh a squeeze. â€œ60 ??-cup.â€      â€œwow, thats quite big.â€ he commented, with mock surprise. â€œi wonder how many men dreamed of     groping these tits.â€     he brought his other hand forward and pinched both of her stiff nipples, causing karma to bite her lip as     she failed to hide her reaction.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:12:47] -     karma turned her back towards the camera, undoing her sash and slowly slid off the rest of her dress,     baring her wide hips and her immense ass. she was only clad in a thin, green, g-string which     disappeared between her ass.      â€œwow, thats some naughty underwear. do you always wear g-strings?â€ the camera-man asked,     surprised to find her wearing something so lewd.     â€œi-i find them more comfortable, considering the size of my ass...â€ karma squeeked.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:14:53] -      â€œ-so why don't you just own it? show us-- i mean me, what you got!â€      â€œthis is so embarrassing...â€ karma whined, but complied.     she turned her waist, and swung her hips side to side causing her booty to jiggle from each of her slight     movements. after her small dance, she hooked the sides of her panties and pulled them down, bending     forward and sticking her ass out directly into the camera, exposing her naked ass and exposed pussy.      â€œgoddamn...â€     the camera zoomed in.     â€¦ â€¦ â€¦          [00:16:21] -     karma was sitting down on the couch again, fully nude. her hands hid her face as she slowly opened     her legs to reveal her pussy. she was nearly clean-shaven with only a small maintained landing strip     adorning her crotch.     â€¦ â€¦ â€¦          [00:19:18] -     the camera view changed. instead of a steady angle from behind the camera-man's desk, it was now in     his hands, offering a first person point-of-view. kneeling below him was karma, on her knees looking     side-to-side trying to avoid eye contact with the man. even from this angle, her wide child-bearing hips     were on display.      â€œlet's get this going.â€ the camera-man stated.     karma looked up at him then at his crotch, and reached towards his pants zipper.     â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:20:32] -      â€œyou didn't tell me it was this big!â€ karma protested.     the camera-man's dick was sizable, even when not fully erect it covered half of karma's shocked face.     â€œyou didn't ask. you can always back out of this, but i can't guarantee any buffs unless we finish...â€ he     informed her without any sympathy.     karma bit her lip, stopping herself from protesting, and grabbed his hardening dick. after a few good     strokes she wrapped her plump lips around the head of his cock and began to suckle on the tip.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦     [00:24:56] -     tears welled up in karma's eyes as the camera-man held her head down on his dick, thrusting his thick     shaft into her throat over and over. she locked her lips around his meat and gagged as her saliva     lubricates his face-fucking.      â€œit's like your lips were made for sucking.â€ the camera-man panted between his frantic thrusts.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦     [00:27:15] -     karma looked up at man in a daze and opened her mouth as he pumped his cock. with a groan, he     shot his load, covering her face and mouth with strand after stand of his thick cum. karma swallowed his     man-batter and began to lick his dick clean.      â€œdamn, you're getting into this, aren't you?â€ he panted.     karma shook her head and groaned in disagreement as she milked out the rest of his load into her     mouth.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:30:44] -     the camera angle changed once again, resting on the table. karma was on the couch, laying on her     back, legs in the air while the man leaned forward, positioned to penetrate her.      â€œyou ready?â€ the man asked, unconcerned with her answer.     she turned her head to the side, refusing to look at him in the eyes and nodded her head. he slowly     pushed his length into her cunt causing her to bite her lip and gasp in pleasure.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:36:39] -     the man's thighs slapped karma's as he fucked her cunt fast and hard. karma moaned with intense     pleasure with each thrust, her mouth open and eyes rolling back in pure, carnal bliss. she began to     pinch her nipples, intensifying her moans.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:40:38] -     the camera angle changed again, once more providing the camera-man's point-of-view. karma was     now resting her head on the the couch's armrest, her thick ass stuck into the air, directly into the camera.     karma used one hand to grip the couch, and the other was currently massaging her clit in anticipation.     the camera-man slipped his shaft between her ass-cheeks, causing her to mewl in protest.      â€œplease... stick it back in.â€ karma whined.     the camera-man pulled back, took hold of her sizable rear and prepared to penetrate her again.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦     [00:44:17] -     karma's ebony ass jiggled with each thrust as the camera-man fucked her soaked pussy as hard as he     could, slamming his pelvis against her broad hips over and over. he loosened his grip on her cushiony     cheek and raised his hand in the air and quickly struck her behind with a sharp slap causing her yelp     with pleasure and her pussy to contract around his dick. karma began to slam her thick ass back against     the camera-man's hips matching his thrusts.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦      [00:48:55] -     the camera-man hilted his full length into her.      â€œcumming!â€ he groaned, as he gripped karma's ass tightly.     karma moaned , and the tattoos on her body began to glow an intense green as she came to an     orgasm. her pussy spasmed around him intensely as his cock throbbed inside of her, filling her insides     with his hot, gooey spunk. the glow on her tattoos died down as karma came down from her orgasmic     bliss, and the camera-man unsheathed his cock from her.      â€¦ â€¦ â€¦          [00:51:03] -      â€œalright, now say the line.â€ the camera-man told her, out of breath.     the camera was once again facing the couch, poitning directly at karma. she was sitting with her legs     spread, the man's cum leaking out from her pussy onto the couch. she raised her hands and formed     v'son them and gave a weak smile.      â€œi'm k????, the e??????ed one, and i formally request riot for buffs.â€ karma managed to weakly     plead.     the camera abruptly cut to black.     â€¦ â€¦ â€¦     riot games patch notes      â€¢ patch 4.5      â€¢karma      â€¢ base armor increased by 4",1,1,

783087,"so i was working on a project and found myself reassessing a couple of stray kids' body types. did a little searching and i found that changbin's widely typed as a soft natural. at least from my perspective, i don't actually see any kibbe width or blunt yang in him. i do, however, see flesh. *lots of beautifully lush flesh.*  after looking at many photos i found his shoulders to be pretty sloped, and his chest to hip ratio to give him a pretty slim and straight torso. the waist definition from the fitted suit, the slightly thinner tie, and the small pattern lines are pretty in line with kibbe's suggested romantic lines for men. changbin even looks surprisingly smaller here compared to his usual stage outfits.  leather skinny pants have always looked really good on him. the ones in his back profile photo look a little baggy and loose, but you can still see how delicate and round his silhouette is from behind. he also wears suspenders often, and they donâ€™t look too small or square on him.  changbin is often put in bulkier and baggy clothing, and almost never wears shorts or shows his legs much. i was practically sold on him being a romantic type once i saw his legs in the recent all-night skz episode. his knee caps are so delicate and the flesh laying on his bones gives his legs quite the curve.  as for his hands, his palms definitely look soft and plump. the bones in hands look short rather than wide, and i find it fairly cute the way his finger tips are almost pointed like a teardrop.  his face is where i began to think he could be a theatrical romantic. when he was much thinner you could see how sharp his eyes, nose, chin and jaw were. even then his under eyes, cheeks and lips were still very fleshy. if you compare that to when he was fuller, you can see how any tautness almost completely disappears and how gently the light casts round shadows on his face. his cheek flesh essentially becomes one and extends all the way down to his jaw. any wideness in his face comes from soft flesh rather than blunt bone.  to begin to wrap this up, i'll compare bang chan, someone who i wholeheartedly agree is sn, to changbin. immediately looking at their arms you can see that bang chan's shoulder bone is bigger. not to be confused with muscle, because in that case i think you can see more built up flesh on changbin's arm compared to bang chan's flatter looking arm, despite chanâ€™s arm being larger. nowadays changbin is fairly lush and he gives a bustier and rounder shoulder appearance. even still, the wideness we perceive comes from the way t-shirts drape over his curvy flesh, as opposed to the way bang chan's shirts drape over his wide blunt bones. kibbe does afterall describe romantic men as ""strong but not bulky.""  comparing their faces, it's pretty obvious how much more luscious, juicy, and curved changbin looks next to chan's. their necklace sets are rather similar, yet bang chan looks balanced in them while the necklaces on changbin look heavier and appear to weigh him down.  lastly, we have another set of suits. this time in a highly textured tweed fabric. i would honestly argue this to be bang chan's best suit look yet. they're sporting practically identical double-breasted jackets. the only difference being that changbin's is unbuttoned, has a lapel pin, and that there is a shirt underneath. in theory this look should be equally fabulous on both men. the heavy texture unfortunately looks a bit hefty and overwhelming on changbin. the thickness of the fabric coupled with zero waist definition give him a tragically boxy appearance. meanwhile, this same wide jacket compliments bang chan's broad and blunt torso exceptionally well, enhancing his squarish compact frame.  stray kids' concepts and changbin's image don't lend themselves very well to romantic lines, so sadly there's not much material of him in such clothing. i also believe that may be part of the reason he can be perceived as a soft natural.  what do you guys think? imo he's a great romantic family candidate, and i'm leaning towards ~~theatrical~~ romantic, but i can't say i'm 100% sure. would be great if we could see his style explore more lines rather than layered jackets and heavy boots all the time lol. but alas, i digress. thanks!",1,1,

843231,"i remember her from the time she wrote about going on a plane ride and assaulting people with her fat because they looked at her the wrong way (lemme just find it in my archives):  ------------------------------------  on a crack-of-dawn flight from new york city to seattle recently, i had my first ever, um, altercation with a seat mate. i'd almost missed the planeâ€”i was that person staggering on board just before the doors closedâ€”and i'm sure he thought he was going to have the row all to himself. i flashed him an apologetic smile (i know that aeronautical heartbreak too well!) and pointed to the middle seat. ""hey, sorry, i'm over there."" he looked at my body, sort of glared blankly at my hips, but didn't respond or make eye contact with me. then, as i went to put my bag in the overhead bin, i heard him mutter something sour.  ""[something something] say excuse me.""  my adrenaline went bonkers. was someone being a dick to me? in person? at 7 am? in an enclosed space? for no reason? when i have a hangover? and we're about to be stuck next to each other for the next five hours? i'm used to men treating me like garbage virtually, or from fast-moving cars, but this close-quarters irl shit-talking was a jarring novelty.  me: ""what?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no, you said something. what did you say?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no. what did you say? tell me.""  other passengers: [silent screams]  him: ""i said that if you want someone to move, it helps to say 'excuse me' and then get out of the way. you told me to move and then you just [gestures at my body in the aisle].""  me [head melting]: ""i'm putting my bag in the overhead bin. you know, because that's how planes work?""  him [dripping with disdain]: ""yeah, okay.""  i sat down. they closed the doors. i said, ""looks like there's no one in the middle seat, so you won't actually have to sit next to me. since i apparently bother you so much.""  him: ""sounds great to me.""  as soon as he fell asleep (with his mouth open like a nerd), i passive-aggressively jarred his foot with my backpack and then said, ""oh, excuse me,"" because i am an adult. we ignored each other for the rest of the flight.  it felt foreign to be confronted so vocally and so publicly (and for such an arbitrary reason), but it also felt familiar. people say the same kind of thing to me with their eyes on nearly every flightâ€”this guy just chose to say it with his mouth.  this is the subtext of my life: ""you're bigger than i'd like you to be."" ""i dread being near you."" ""your body itself is a breach of etiquette."" ""you are clearly a fucking moron who thinks that cheesecake is a vegetable."" ""i know that you will fart on me.""  nobody wants to sit next to a fat person on a plane. don't think we don't know.  i have, in my life, been a considerably thinner person and had a fat person sit next to me on a plane. i have also, more recently, been the fat person that makes other travelers' faces fall. anecdotally, i can verify that being the fat person is almost indescribably worse.  this year, for the first time ever, i got on a plane and discovered that i didn't fit in the seat. i've always been fat, but i was the fat person that still mostly fit. i mean, i couldn't fit into clothes (more tunics patterned like a parisian suitcase, please), and i had to be careful with butt safety (i'll take the chair side, not the banquette, thanks), but i was still the kind of fat person who could move through the straight-size world without causing too many ripples. until this fall.  it's been an incredibly busy year for me professionallyâ€”i've probably flown 20 times in the past eight monthsâ€”and one day i sat down and it just didn't work. i was on a flight home from texas, i think, and the flight out there had been fine. suddenly, on the return flight, i had to cram myself in. i mean, i know i ate that brisket, but i was only gone for two days! i'm no butt scientist (at least, not certified...anymore), but how fast could a person's butt possibly grow!?  if you've never tried cramming your hips into a jagged metal box that's an inch or two narrower than your flesh (under the watchful eye of resentful tourists), then sitting motionless in there for five hours while you fold your arms and shoulders up like an origami orchid in order to be as unobtrusive as possible, run don't walk. it's like squeezing your bones in a vise. the pain makes your teeth ache. it fucking hurts.  but even worse than any physical pain is the anxiety of walking up the aisle and not knowing what plane you're on. am i going to fit this time? will i have to ask for a seatbelt extender? is this a 17-incher or an 18-incher? did i get on early enough that i can get myself crammed in before someone comes and sits next to me? is the person next to me going to hate me? does everyone on this plane hate me? i paid money for this?  people's butts might be getting bigger, sure, but it's a certainty that seats are getting smaller. i fit in every other chair. (some people don't. that's fine too. those are good bodies too. those people deserve respect and accommodations too, without caveats.)  i'm sure some fat people are fat by their own hand, without any underlying medical conditions, but a lot of other fat people are fat because they're sick or disabled. and unless you're checking every human being's bloodwork before they pull up kayak.com, you do not know which fat people are which. which means, inevitably, if you think fat people are ""the problem"" (and not, say, airlines hoping to squeeze out an extra $200 million a year in revenue, or consumers who want cheap airline tickets without sacrificing amenities), you are penalizing a significant number of human beings emotionally and financially for a disease or disability that already complicates their lives. to me, ethically, that's fucked up.  a few weeks ago, i went to seattle's museum of flight for my nephew's 6th birthday party. they have the body of an old airliner from the '60s in there, and you can go hang out in it and pretend you're a mad man or whatever and honk the buns of invisible flight attendants. whatever you're into. and you know what? those seats are fucking huge. it's like sitting in a normal human chair, but in the sky. the difference was incredible. (it was definitely the most interesting exhibit in the museum, and that place also has, like, the first plane. which, to be fair, didn't have seats at all. so...upgrade? i guess?)  soon after that museum visit, i came across this post: ""it is now physically impossible for an adult to fit on a plane."" the wall street journal reported that seats are getting smaller and smaller, even on long international flightsâ€”some squeezing below an already scrunchy 17 inches. in case you don't know how small small is, that is crazy small. that's not just too small for fat people, it's inhumanely small for ""normal""-size people too. another headline: ""airlines squeezing in even more seating.""  southwest, the largest domestic carrier, is installing seats with less cushion and thinner materials â€” a svelte model known in the business as slim-line. it is also reducing the maximum recline to 2 inches from 3. my boyfriend is 6'5"". his shoulders are so wide that he physically must use both armrests (and then some), and his legs are so long that the person in front of him absolutely cannot recline their seat. he doesn't fucking fit. he fits worse than i do. even though fat people are always blamed for ruining everything on planes, i realized the other day thatâ€”thanks to insecurity and my proficiency at origami-armsâ€”i've literally never used a plane armrest. even when i'm in the middle seat. i hear it's nice, though!  none of this is news. the should-fat-people-be-allowed-on-planes debate has been raging for years, and i have no interest in pointlessly rehashing it all over again. some people will always disagree. that's fine.  but i just want to say this: before the day i didn't fit, this conversation was largely an abstraction for me. my stance was the same as it is now (if people pay for a service, it's the seller's obligation to accommodate those people and provide the service they paid for), but i didn't understand what that panicky, uncertain walk down the aisle actually felt like. how inhumane it is. how much it makes you question your worth as a human being. i've done it a dozen or so times now, and i've also had a fat person sit next to me and squish me a little bit for six hours. there is no comparison.  i'm telling you this right now not to get sympathy or pity, or even to change your opinion about how airplanes should accommodate larger passengers. i'm just telling you, human to human, that life is complicated and fat people are trying to live. same as you. regardless of your stance on the ""obesity epidemic,"" these things are objectively true: airplane seats are too small. they're too small for everyone except for small people. it's bad. passengers are going fucking nuts. and, sorry, it's not my responsibility to fix it.  that guy next to me didn't call me fat to my face. i don't even know if that's what was bothering him, although i know the way he looked at my body (my body, not my face, not once, not ever). i can't be sure why that guy was mad at me, but i know why people are mad at me on planes. i know that he disliked me instantly, he invented a reason to be a dick to me, and then he executed it. at 7 am. in a flying fart-can. when i had a hangover. and, much more importantly, i see other people staring those same daggers at other fat people's bodies every day, in the sky and on the ground. it's just a shitty way to go through life, for everyone.  you don't have to change your mind about fat people. but you could just be fucking kind. you could give it a shot. it's the holidays, and we're all in this fart-can together.",1,-1,

109490,"zephon kneeled before p'thandu. the university's founder was situated in a large pool in the center of a chamber that served as p'thandu's central study, itself a library of waterproof books. a skylight cast silver moonlight reflections off the chamber's pool. p'thandu had entered through a subterranean chamber, while a smaller door served as the entrance-way for visitors.  ""you told me to come, p'thandu?"" zephon inquired.  ""yes, my boy!"" the large elderly y'seral burbled from his pool, his many eyes focused on the sol'anfarol man.  p'thandu continued, ""have you documented *all* of your findings and ensured the entirety of your understanding of necromancy has been passed along to the scholars?""  ""yes, founder.""  ""*goood!* now, do you know what happened to mor'inon in the chamber?""  ""yes. vividly. i can even recall exactly what went wrong and... what *changed* in the process.""  ""are you aware that the change was greatly dampened from her demigodly blood?""  ""yes, i suspected a demigod would suffer lessened effects. why?""  the y'seral began rubbing his tentacles together in a way that suggested he was hatching a nefarious scheme, ""we've done some experiments, you see, and i think i've got a good grasp of what the blood does to mortals. first, you suffer the same effects as mor'inon; your body becomes heatless, regardless of your race, and the undead perceive you as not only one of their own, but accept your commands. in addition, effects that affect the living exclusively will be... dampened. disease, afflictions, many curses, things like that. that includes several forms of healing, but there's a... manner of circumventing that. you see, that's where the similarities end.  ""mortals effected suffer a *drastic* anatomical change. their digestive, circulatory, and muscloskeletal systems incur several noteworthy changes. you become stronger, faster, your response time increases, and you gain a number of external changes, including sharp fangs and unusual skin pigmentation. it appears some variants can make these traits invisible, tucking them away or shifting color like a... hmm. something that shifts color. but these traits are not without costs.  ""these powers dampen, becoming considerably weaker in sunlight. you will likely return to a mere mortal in doing so. the biggest problem that arises, though, is the new diet. it appears that whatever it does kills part of the body. it results in you technically dying, while keeping your soul in your body and allowing all organs to function, hence the undead not noticing you, the cold body, and afflictions not working. this does mean, however, that your body doesn't provide many of the nutrients it needs, and so you need to take them from other individuals, via consuming their blood.""  ""*wait a moment.*"" zephon shouted, standing up, ""isn't this the same affliction that the baroness of granil has? vampirism, was it?""  ""yeah, actually. you know, you could have saved me a lot of time if you just tol-""  ""why is the affliction mor'inon got and the one the baroness got the same? how did the baroness get it?""

""i was fairly surprised myself when she gave the order, but knew it was for the good of undalos. so, do you accept?""  zephon thought for a long time, then asked, ""how do you get the blood?""

""oh, nononono, we wouldn't give the blood to *citizens.* only kalina's most trusted generals are accepting the blood, and only the ones who have passed an extensive psychological evaluation involving mind-reading. i know this is a bit of a breach of privacy, but in order to determine if you were ready, i've been scanning your memories for the past few months. sorry.""

""i did it."" he said, ""i forget... whatever i saw. let's just hope i didn't mess up my own mind; last time i tried that, every sentence i spoke for the next week ended with the wrong cranberry. well?""  zephon continued to think, then answered, ""i'll do it. i'll accept the transformation.""  p'thandu's eyes widened, ""huh. i was not expecting you to agree. well, no matter. the transformation ceremony is ready to convene, then. stay here...""  p'thandu closed his eyes, and zephon felt a psychic pulse target several individuals, obviously a message of some kind. over the course of ten minutes, five people entered the chamber, each in the glorious full-plate armor of an undalean general. some flew in on ascendant wings, others teleported in from thin air, others simply... walked through the door.  the one who arrived first teleported in via cosmic magic. he was a middle-aged light meijint. his armor was more akin to robes than actual protective armor. his fingertips were placed together, his body in the posture of the political elite. his hair, as white as his skin, was oiled back.  the next to enter flew in through the skylight. she was a middle-aged alkhara, her armor chain-mail. her red hair fell to jaw-length. she seemed to stand stoic but energetically, as though eager for the blessing.  walking in through the door was a khalash. she was tall and imposing, her armor heavy. at first, one could have mistaken her for a valrak. she stood silent, removing her helmet. her fur was gray with dark streaks. she was likely a young adult, based on the coloration.  the fourth general flew in through the skylight on ascendant wings. it was a valrak. due to their bodies being highly armored, its armor was just a few intricate plates added on to parts of its body. fire seeped from crevices of the armor. its wings slowly evaporated as it landed. it was also bulky, but even it was not as built as the khalash.  and finally, materializing in the air, filling the large room, was a y'seral, plates of armor decorating its body to show its status. zephon could not determine its gender, but its body was a light gray, and was a bit larger than normal.  p'thandu then said, ""ah, you're all here. just so you can all get to know each other, what are your names?""  the meijint spoke first, ""general malek of the starsunder legion, at your service, esteemed founder of the great university."" he bowed to p'thandu.  next was the khalash, ""general thuuva, thunder legion."" she said nothing more.  the valrak spoke, ""general abaelos, dawnbreaker regiment. it is an honor."" he bowed.  then the alkhara, ""general virdaela, oculus regiment.""  the y'seral's voice boomed, it's masculine tone revealing gender, ""general xa'dulath, skyguard regiment.""  ""zephon, student of p'thandu university."" zephon said. he, too, bowed to p'thandu.  p'thandu exclaimed, ""excellent! then, let the ceremony commence...""  from a hidden compartment on the wall next to p'thandu's pool, he drew out a comparatively small box, about the size of a large chest for a normal mortal, and procured a key from the very air, it seemed. he unlocked the chest, pushed the key back into its pocket dimension, and placed the chest before the group.  ""would the student who made this worthwhile do the honors?"" p'thandu encouraged.  zephon hesitantly stepped forward, opening the chest, flinching as he did so. he ceased flinching when the only contents in the box were something that appeared to be an unlabeled wine bottle and six chalices lay within, surrounded with protective leather. zephon looked at the contents, and removed the bottle from the protective leather.  ""is this-?""  ""yes.""  zephon uncorked the bottle and took a chalice, as did the rest of the group. zephon, one by one, filled each chalice, then his own, emptying the bottle. he set the bottle down, then raised his chalice. the rest followed.  ""cheers."" zephon said, his own attempt at humor failing to relax him.  the six drank in unison. malek made a sound of disgust. virdaela coughed. thuuva burped. zephon himself was not enthused by the taste, but only made a face of mild disgust.  then, he began to feel cold...  it started in the stomach, and spread outward, growing in intensity. he doubled over, and felt so nauseous he would vomit, but when he began heaving, nothing happened. all six of them underwent this, falling over clutching their stomachs. xa'dulath crashed into a row of desks, shaking the ground. abaelos' fire seemed to sputter and die out.  as the icy cold spread to zephon's heart, he felt it stop. he reached out towards p'thandu and tried to call for help, but he couldn't breathe. his vision went dark, and he died...",0,,

329700,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,

 definitely not the ones handing out advice, like myself, /u/anbeav , /u/darthluiggi, /u/ashsimmonds, /u/causalcorrelation, /u/targash and many others that browse /r/keto/new. you should see some meals posted. they are so fatty they'd give your cardiologist a heart attack on the spot! ;)  &gt; how many of you focus more on the calories and low carb aspect than on the high fat aspect?  the paradigm is largely shifting more towards electrolytes and protein maintenance at this point. i aim to get iodine on the list for the ""feel good"", but stalls are 95% of the time a calorie issue. sorry, but the fact that people come back saying it worked clarifies the issue. forcing the dogma of eating more fat solves nothing and if it doesn't work... then what? fat goes into fat cells. period. carbs do not become fat hardly ever (about 5% of carbs consumed in excess for obese people turn into fat).   &gt; i'd be willing to be that you're stalling, or you're feeling sick and weak because you aren't eating enough fat.   actually i find that it's not enough protein. the pendulum has swung very far towards fat since you've been gone and people neglect protein, a *vital* aspect of keeping metabolism going:   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2129159/  &gt; when muscle glycogen and blood glucose concentrations are low, the incorporation of the carbon skeletons from amino acids into the citric acid cycle is important for maintaining the concentrations of the intermediates, and therefore a high rate of mitochondrial respiration. thus, both muscle fat and carbohydrate burn in an amino acid flame.  in other words, fat is not necessary, your body has a whole bunch of fat on it to take from as it pleases. however, to metabolize that fat, it needs aminos.  trust me when i say i'm totally on board with you that calories are [extremely misunderstood](http://caloriesproper.com/nutrient-partitioning-a-very-high-protein-diet/), but a bigger aspect is to realize that your body does use a specific amount of matter to form chemical reactions. i don't like the term calories, and most of us don't use calories but we encourage tracking through individual macros in grams, because we know that 100 calories from carbs is not the same as 100 calories from protein and that is not the same as 100 calories from fat. nutrient partitioning is so important.   welcome back to keto. i hope you do well! :)",1,0,

(whether manure or other.) whatever air is trapped inside will cause problems the first few weeks, but eventually the oxygen will be used up, and at that point the anaerobic bacteria take over, and produce roughly 50/49/1 co2/methane/hydrogen sulfide.  the co2 would be interesting if it could be filtered off somehow. used to make dry ice, or even pumped into a greenhouse where people were locked out of it for a few days. the hydrogen sulfide causes it to smell, but most claim not enough for that to be a real issue smell-wise. it's also strongly caustic, so either plastic or stainless steel is needed for pipe fittings.  designed right, a biogas pit has enough pressure that none is generally needed for most uses.  some designs allow you to remove the waste from it easily, which can still be composted, the bacteria are only getting rid of something like 7% of its mass. it's tricky to remove the old waste and not the new if it's mixed in, so i've been wondering about some of the continuous plug systems i've heard about (commercial plants). it's basically a big tube and you put the new stuff in one end, and remove the same amount from the other.  &gt; sometimes a $100k in solar panels sound like a good deal, what do kidneys go for on the black market?  didn't they just catch someone here a few weeks back who was a broker? i think he was only giving them $4000 a piece and holding a gun to their heads when they started getting cold feet.",0,,

915905,"to understand the true size of the american obesity epidemic, we first need to understand what it really means to be overweight. generally, doctors and nutritionists classify people as either underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese. these different classifications are determined by body mass index (bmi), or a measure of body fat based on your height and weight. to get a basic idea, this chart from the cdc approximates what that means for someone who is 5'9"" tall.  as for what is driving america's chronic weight problem, there are no definite answers. scientific studies often reach conflicting conclusions, meaning many theories are out there, but the preponderance of evidence points to the two causes most people already suspect: too much food and too little exercise.  the u.s. department of agriculture (usda) reports that the average american ate almost 20% more calories in the year 2000 than they did in 1983, thanks, in part, to a boom in meat consumption. today, each american puts away an average of 195lbs of meat every year, compared to just 138lbs in the 1950's. consumption of added fats also shot up by around two thirds over the same period, and grain consumption rose 45% since 1970.  the role of diet in the u.s. obesity epidemic is obviously major, but it's also complex. consumers are sent wildly mixed messages when it comes to what to eat and how much. one one hand, larger portions, processed packaged food, and drive-thru meals are branded as almost classically american â€” fast, cheap, filling and delicious. on the other hand, we spend over $20 billion annually on weight loss schemes, from diet books and pills all the way up to last-resort surgeries like lap-bands and liposuction. it's no wonder we're looking for fast food and fast weight loss options, we spend more time at work and less time in our homes and kitchens than our parents did. sometimes you only have time to pack a leftover pizza slice and a slim-fast for lunch, irony be damned.  this schizophrenic relationship with food is easy to explain in terms of marketing schemes. as decades of soda and tv dinners caught up with our waistlines, the u.s. diet industry grew bigger, faster and smarter. since the 1970s, popular nutrition wisdom and fad diets have flamed in and out just as quickly as the arch deluxe or the mcrib. in the 1990s, our big enemy was fat. low-fat and fat-free products flew off supermarket shelves. it took us decades to learn that when something is fat-free and full-flavored, it's probably too good to be true.  as it turns out, most food companies were just swapping hydrogenated oils and sugar in for the animal fats they removed from low-fat products. hydrogenated oils are restructured vegetable oils that carry high levels of trans-fats, an amazingly evil type of fat that can raise your bad cholesterol, lower your good cholesterol and increase your risks of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. while somewhat less sinister, added sugar can also wreak major damage on a diet. technically low in calories, high-quantities of sugar disrupts our metabolisms, causing surges in insulin and energy levels and ultimately contributing to weight gain and diabetes.  lack of exercise is also a major culprit in the obesity epidemic. it's been decades since most americans worked in fields and on factory floors, a far greater majority of us are sitting throughout our workday. this means less exercise each day. according to one study, only 20% of today's jobs require at least moderate physical activity, as opposed to 50% of jobs in 1960. other research suggests americans burn 120 to 140 fewer calories a day than they did 50 years ago. add this to the higher amount of calories we are packing in, and we get a perfect recipe for weight gain.  but lethargy goes well beyond the workplace. it is also how we get to work and what we do after. americans walk less than people in any other industrialized country, preferring to sit in cars to get around. and at the end of the day, 80% of americans don't get enough exercise, according to the cdc.  a number of other factors are thought to play a role in the obesity epidemic, such as the in utero effects of smoking and excessive weight gain in pregnant mothers. poor sleep, stress, and lower rates of breastfeeding are also thought to contribute to a child's long term obesity risk. of course, these factors are not explicit or solitary causes of obesity, but they are reliable indicators of the kinds of systemic healthcare failures contributing to this crisis.  in the end, though, we can't lose sight of the big picture. over the past years, diet fads have come and gone, with people rushing to blame red meat, dairy, wheat, fat, sugar, etc. for making them fat, but in reality, the problem is much simpler. genetics and age do strongly influence metabolism, but as the cdc points out, weight gain and loss is primarily a formula of total calories consumed versus total calories used.",1,0,

607758,"edit: part 2  &gt; trivially false. there are 22 players on the field; generally 8-9 of them are linemen. in 2016, there were 2201 players with 730 of them being linemen. 33% is a far cry from ""overwhelming majority"". including tes raises that to 40%, but still not close to a majority.  so first, your link doesn't show that, and a tiny bit of nfl knowledge completely refutes this. there is exactly one instance of the word ""linema(e)n"" at all in that link, and at no point are the players separated by position. it does have them organized by race, state, age, home town, college, division and a few other metrics, but it's not a list at all. it's telling us how many players are within these groups. second, you can go to http://www.nfl.com/players/search?category=position&amp;playertype=current to see how many players there are. there are currently 1047 linemen in the nfl. there are 75 players per page, with 8 pages for offensive linemen (575) and 7 pages for defensive linemen (472). this is in contrast to the 1696 total players, as each of the 32 nfl teams are only allowed to have 53 players on a roster. these are the only players counted on nfl.com, so if 1047 are linemen, then 649 are anything else. there are quite a number of extra potential players who did not make the roster, but we have no metric for them nor a number for them. so yes, there are in fact 398 more linemen than there are of all of the other positions combined. i'm not a massive football fan, but dear god surely you can look this up before you say something as stupid as ""trivially false"".  &gt; it's not! you said are claiming those athletes would be strong; that they could deadlift 600 lbs. they are not and they cannot.  they can. just because they do not, does not mean they cannot. and i am making the very obvious argument that they are stronger because they are overall stronger. i've already said, a person who can lift deadlift up to 600, but lifts it consistently without getting winded, has control while doing so, and can also perform other forms of physical activity to a good to great degree, and you compare him to a guy who can lift 900 lbs or more, exactly once, and then get winded, and who cannot do any other form of physical activity at anything more than average, i'm going to tell you flat up that the guy lifting 600 is stronger, because strength is not measured in **how much you can lift, bro**. and yes, a person who consistently strengthens their body will not only reach 800 lbs, they will surpass it. most people who go to a strongman competition fall into the category of ""mildly ok at everything except the one single thing they do good"". and yes, that sucks. but that's what happens when you focus entirely on fast gains in one area, as opposed to constant gains in all areas. you progress faster overall, and are overall stronger, when you don't focus on one single thing. and to answer a question that i know is boiling up from inside you, yes, i would steer people away from body building.  &gt; it is easily in the top 1% of populationâ€”even restricting it to people who are specifically training to squat a lot. so, yes, it's strong.  no, it is not. in fact most of the people who are fully capable of squatting 1200+, most of them don't bother. they see no reason in doing it, as they would rather be strong than big. they would rather be consistently strong than have one single good jump in them.  &gt; yeah, really fit/strong people can do it. that's my point. also, deadlift and squats are not the same and you can generally deadlift 25% more than you squat.  yes i'm aware, for safety reasons due to the nature of how you perform the dead lift and squats. and no, moderately fit people can do it, too. you are confusing ""can"" and ""will"". again, most people don't go down that path of ""i want to be huge, and be able to lift this once"" most would rather go ""i want to be in good shape, and i want lift as much as i can, run as fast as i can, as long as i can, jump as high as i can, swim as far as i can and do everything that i can and then do more."" that is the fundamental difference in a ""body builder"" and an ""athlete"".  &gt; in your opinion.  you mean the opinion of people who recognize that focusing specifically on huge muscles, and using exercises designed to make huge muscles, has detrimental effects on a persons body. i like being healthy, and fit. you clearly like having big muscles. it's going to suck for you later down the line. that's health data arguing with you.  &gt; yes, it literally does. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24610245  so first, you should read the results, method and conclusion, not just the conclusion. the results state ""percentage gains in v(m) correlated with percentage changes in imvf (r = 0.527; p = 0.002) and 1-rm (r = 0.482; p = 0.005) but not in explosive force (r â‰¤ 0.243; p â‰¥ 0.175). **percentage changes in imvf, 1-rm, and explosive force did not correlate with percentage changes in agonist, antagonist or stabilizer semg (all p &gt; 0.05).** percentage gains in Î¸(p) inversely correlated with percentage changes in normalized explosive force at 150 ms after force onset (r = 0.362; p = 0.038).  your cited article is an experiment testing the effects of using hypertrophy to reverse light muscle atrophy, which is why the subjects were 33 untrained but healthy men between 18 and 30. the results flat out show that while muscle atrophy is reversed, they gained no strength. explosive force is their terminology for strength. this study literally proved that bigger does not equal stronger. it goes into more detail if you read the actual study, but it's fairly long and you clearly didn't even read the basis of the study.  &gt; yet he's famous because he dominated in body building.  he's famous because he dominates body builders, often much bigger than himself. it's funny what happens when you focus on being strong, not on being big.  &gt; no, he's the guy on the left. for fuck's sake. so, yeah, literally the biggest of the three guys in the picture.  no, he's in the middle. first, because you can see and recognize the faces of all three. second, because he won that competition, and the 2nd and 3rd place winners are on the right and left. there is an organization to where 1st, 2nd and 3rd place competitors stand.  &gt; he's 300 lbs, homie. that's massive.  no, that's heavy. his muscles are hard as shit because they are condensed and lean. he has simply worked them so hard, for so many decades, that they are also fairly large. ronnie is one of the 1%. you will always gain size regardless. you will gain it a lot slower if you don't focus on size. this is why body builders tend to be the weakest.  &gt; no, they train for their sport and thinking anything otherwise is fucking criminally dumb. they train to get big in specific areas and this gets them pretty strong as a result because the two are related. not the same; not equal; related.  no, they do not train to get big. that is a misconception within body builders specifically, and why so few of them are strong.  &gt; the strongest people in the world like hafÃ¾Ã³r bjÃ¶rnsson or eddie hall are still huge, but there's a clear difference in results that shows a difference in training.  let me correct you. bjornsson is 6'9. hall is 6'3. both weigh over 400 lbs. and both are body builders with the same mentality that i am criticizing, and it has already hurt them. bjornsson has bells palsy. he figured this out in 2017 for problems he has had sleeping after heavy meals, because the intake and type of food he needed to maintain hypertrophy to his insane degree was literally killing him. eddie hall has had similar problems. hypertrophy ravaged his body, and now that he has had to stop abusing it, his muscles have deflated and his mid section is rounded out. he's actually morbidly obese now and literally passes out after any single strongman act.  but i suppose that's fine, since both of them were able to lift over 1000 lbs in the deadlift and right at 900 in the squat. once. and then pass out (hall) or suffer debilitating physical pain for weeks due to the stress that the weight put on his internal organs (bjornsson). and neither of them can run even short distances without getting winded, become fatigued after short exercises, and can do only a small handful of these ""look at my one good jump"" feats, once, at great harm to their bodies due to the long term effects of hypertrophy. they are not the strongest men in the world. i know i've used him as an example already, but the rock can dead lift and squat almost as much as they can, but he can also do literally everything else to a more than average degree as well, and he's only slightly smaller than bjornsson. he also doesn't suffer from any of their permanent debilitating health conditions, because he does not abuse hypertrophy.  &gt;

684285,"hmm, i'm getting a sense of deja vu here.  it's like i already had this conversation with you before.  you really misunderstand me in some very important ways, plus you have some severe gaps in your reasoning.  and there are many places where you and i agree, where you are actually preaching to the choir (unsuspectingly?).  i am not an extremist.  you really should understand what that means.  i am not arguing for any kind of extreme ""solutions"".  for example, ""take away all the money from the rich and give it to the poor"" is an extreme.  the other extreme is ""no taxes"".  i do not like the extremes.  extremes are for the idealists.  i am, at this time, not an idealist.  idealism doesn't work because ideas do not match reality in an accurate or reliable way (it's actually even better [or worse, depending on your pov] than that, but that's too philosophical for this conversation).  i am really tired of people constantly assuming i'm an extremist.  but i know why it happens.  it's because those who assume i'm an extremist are likely themselves extremists, and they believe everyone out there is just like them.  &gt; the stage is not the result of someone necessarily trying to impose something on you, but rather the free choices of individuals trying to determine their own destiny.  i agree completely with the second half of that sentence.  what we see before our eyes is an outcome of free choices of individuals.  however, where you miss the boat, is that a person doesn't have to make a conscious decision to impose in order to be imposing.  for example, people who buy suvs just want to enjoy a nice, safe, cool looking car that handles well in snow.  there might be one or two jerks who get suvs expressly to screw with others, but i think pretty much everyone who gets them is just thinking in terms of bettering their own experience without the slightest thought of imposing on others.  nonetheless suvs impose heavily on people with normal cars that the roads were originally designed for.  they block line of sight.  they blind other drivers with their high head lamps.  they eat more gas, which imposes on all of us who breathe air (this is an externalized cost that's passed onto the community).  for another example, take someone doing 120mph on a 70mph highway.  that person is likely simply enjoying the thrill, or maybe that person is late, or even, maybe that person is rushing a dying friend to the hospital.  clearly none of these intentions mean to consciously and purposefully impose, and yet they do.  someone driving 120 mph is putting many lives at risk.  there is a good chance that not only would the dying friend die, but 3 more people would be killed in addition to that in a car wreck.  that's why even ambulances and fire trucks do not speed beyond a certain safe point.  because even something as noble in intention as a fire truck (firemen rule), is nonetheless going to impose on its way to the fire.  people don't mind some level of imposition, but if the fire truck did 60 mph cutting through a busy parking lot with a 10 mph speed limit, fire or no fire, people would find such imposition intolerable.  that's why fire trucks do not speed much or at all.  that's also why they are careful when crossing the intersection, even though they have sirens blaring.  i will give you that generally, at their deepest core, people are decent, and as a rule, don't wish to impose on others.  but they impose anyway.  &gt; the stage is not the result of someone necessarily trying to impose something on you, but rather the free choices of individuals trying to determine their own destiny. it is a natural outcome of society, a natural outcome of free choices. &gt;  &gt; what is not natural is the government deciding one stage that everyone must walk on.  wrong.  the government is simply a natural outcome of having a society.  when you have a society, as opposed to various scattered loners, some agreements and compromises have to be made.  for example, some people may want the road here.  others want the road there.  still others don't want a road at all.  if we just let it stand, hardly anything will ever get built due to squabbles and arguments.  people with guns will put up tolls just cause they feel like it.  (think wild west).  etc...  basically life without some basic ground rules and agreements is not going to be smooth.  people **chose to organize** as a *natural* outcome of making free choices.  in fact, strictly speaking, everything in the natural world is natural.  people are natural.  we are part of nature.  our minds are natural.  what we say and so is natural.  if someone emitted radio waves with a mouth and shitted bricks of pure titanium, that, my friend, would be unnatural (in this realm anyway).  everything else is natural.  when you say that governance is unnatural, you're simply being childish, obstinate and immature.  it means you probably grew up in a small family, perhaps an only child, or in a large family with overabundant resources, where you never had to learn to share and where your parents never taught you the value of sharing and the value of building consensus.  i don't know if that's true in your case, but it's a pattern i see, so i'm throwing it out there.  government is simply a result of governance and governance is natural.  for example, corporations have governance.  i bet you don't think that's unnatural, do you?  if you really want to be consistent, then you must oppose all forms of governance and not discriminate.  if you oppose corporate governance then you will definitely gain respect in my eyes, simply for consistency.  now, what governments do is not always good.  but that's another story.  don't throw away the baby with the bathwater, as they say.  &gt; no, people need to carefully consider for themselves what is moral and ethical. i don't believe they are irrelevant, but i don't think what governments enact to ""make people moral"" is moral at all. should we let christians (or muslims for other countries) enact all of their moral principles? no, we should not. people not governments, need to decide what is moral or not. and there is plenty of room for this inside private contracts.  exactly.  and government is really just people too. :)  what you say applies to all people and not only to non-governmental people.  i favor small and unobtrusive government that goes very light on enforcing morals through laws.  that doesn't mean there aren't rich assholes.  if there is an asshole, i can say ""hey you, asshole!"", without implying i want a new government regulation, understand?  there are rich assholes who screw us over.  they are not loners either, but they belong to a community.  they know and talk to each other.  i want the ability to criticize them without appearing as if i call for some government spanking.  government needs some reform.  however, it is my strong preference that the rich assholes (as distinct from nice rich people) straighten their asses out voluntarily.  and before that can happen, what they need is **feedback**.  because if no one complains, how is it assholish?  for example, if i am playing loud music, but no one ever complains, am i an ass?  nope.  but if i play loud music and my neighbor has a nasty migraine and asks me to quit, and yet i insist on playing it, am i an asshole?  yes i am.  so feedback is absolutely essential for any morality to be valid.  feedback of course is not to be taken at face value, but nonetheless, it has to be there, available for evaluation, in order for morals to be valid.  that means i have a full moral right to criticize rich assholes.  and when you attempt to make fun of me and shut me up, you are interfering in the process, since you're not the type of rich i am talking about.  as a matter of fact i generally like small businessmen, because in small business things tend to be less formal and more transparent and there is much less bureaucratic opaque shadow available to hide the bullshit in.  large corps are opaque.  opaque, need-to-know basis social environment is a perfect breeding ground for bullshit.  now, when it comes to individuals, i am all for privacy.  but the more highly organized something is, the more it needs to be transparent in my view.  corp government should be completely transparent and so should all government levels.  also, i am kind of blind to the differences between various governances.  i see all forms of governance as the same animal, only different by size but not by kind or its inherent nature.  &gt; i believe in personal moral development. forcing people to give to charity is not somehow moral. only people freely giving to charity can be moral, see the difference? people should constantly work on their own morals, laws on the subject should stay the hell out of it.  i agree 99%.  the 1% where i disagree is where some of the biggest morals come in, like murder.  avoiding murder is a moral imperative.  and yet we have a government enforcing it.  i don't mind it.  i bet you don't mind it either.  so basically i agree with you, but i want you to recognize that most likely you do want the government to enforce some moral principles, just not as many as the current government does perhaps.  the point here is to steer you away from extremist tendencies of thought.  do you see how your thought leans toward extremism?  i doubt deep in your heart you're an extremist, but if you say this kind of crap long enough, you will eventually convince yourself to be a real to the bone extremist.",0,,

374441,"i think there's an issue with conflation of ""realistic"" and ""common"" or ""average"". celebrities are real people who really look the way they do, so by definition their bodies are realistic. but that slim, toned look doesn't come free, either: they have to work for it through diet and training. it's realistic, but not necessarily common.  as to whether we perceive lean bodies as ""unrealistic"" simply because we're used to people around us being overweight, i would have to say the answer to that is categorically ""yes"". all you have to do is look at photos and media showing crowds and public places from the 1950s through 1980s to see that: north american people then were universally and significantly thinner than they are now. and being a few pounds overweight was enough for bystanders to notice; whereas today, many would consider that person to be slim.  if you go back even further and look at photos of sideshow attractions like the ""world's fattest man/woman"" from the early decades of the 20th century, it's pretty alarming to see a photo of a body shape that could be found in multiples at any north american wal-mart any day of the week.  the average and the extreme high end of human weight are on an upward trend, and the result is that people of healthy weight are beginning to be seen as underweight. and the more weight you lose, the more you'll notice peoples' reactions to this. at my heaviest, i was just crossing the line into obese, and i had people tell me i was *skinny*. that's just straight-up delusion. now that i've crossed the threshold into the healthy weight range, people caution me against ""losing too much weight"" - i still have a noticeable gut and some under-chin flab, for crying out loud. it's as if people think there's no middle ground between fat and emaciated.  rant aside, to address the last question in your post, i find it motivating to look at celebrities with their fit, well-maintained bodies, because it reminds me of what i could potentially achieve with the right attitude and by putting in the work. it's not healthy for people to think they're obligated to look that way, and i don't, but it's equally unhealthy to limit oneself by dismissing it as impossible and using that as an excuse not to try.  **so my tl;dr answer is:** hollywood bodies are uncommon, but not unrealistic. they're seen as ""unrealistic"" because three-quarters of north americans are overweight or obese, so we have limited day-to-day exposure to lean bodies. it's also important for people to understand that not all bodies have the same shape, even when lean. a trim and toned woman isn't necessarily going to look like scarlett johansson; maybe she has a straighter-lined, boyish figure. that's okay too.",1,0,0
258506,"i disagree.  this sort of scenario usually suggests a difference between what you want and what you need which is common for people with out much dating experience.  if you haven't dated for ten years you're probably deeply out of touch with what actually makes you happy in a relationship.  there are a lot of things that seem like they would make you happy... hotness, intelligence, liking the same bands etc... but these aren't the things that really make a relationship work.  i've dated some people rather reluctantly, which resulted in a change in the way i saw the person and some of my most satisfying relationships.  i want to qualify this and say that you should always treat people with respect and a reasonable amount of transparency.  for instance, if it's clear after a date or two that you don't see the other person as a long term potential, you have to make this clear to them.  don't deceive them or give them inappropriate expectations.  if you tell people you're experimenting around to see what works for you, they'll be understanding.",0,,

358417,"quite a few.  i am currently in nm, and the bottom has dropped out of horses.  that is due to people not wanting to incur the cost of shipping.  i would guess that only one tenth of the horses previously shipped from this territory are still going for slaughter.  here, most of the meat shippers ship to canada, despite mexico being closer.  i suspect that is because canadian markets can export more meat, due to slaughter practices (such as cleanliness and safety of product).  in this territory back in the 80s and 90s, a single shipper would ship more than 1000 horses a week to the dallas crown and bel-tex plants.  at that time, any fat horse would bring right in the neighborhood of a thousand dollar a head at auction.  skinny horses would only bring a few hundred.    currently, many fat horses only bring around 500 in the spring, and 300 in the fall.  skinny horses are only bringing in the 50-60 range.  the need to feed them through the winter is influencing prices a lot too.  but to have to go through the cost of health certificates, moving the horses up north for slaughter has saved many horses' lives.  especially the fuel portion of it.  but it isn't just that.  it isn't as though canada will just slaughter an unlimited number of horses, or everything everyone can get up to them.  the pmu farms there generally will put about a years growth on the draft horse foals they raise, and slaughter them.  with only 6 months on solid feeds, the babies are as big as light horses, and what is considered a good slaughter size.  the whole thing where they are saying that crippled horses go for slaughter is for the most part myth, though.  i had seen an own daughter of joker b (big name appaloosa in the 70s and 80s) get on the truck to the plant.  i had seen loads that were made up of more registered horses than grade horses.  because people took better care of the registered horses, where many grade horses were allowed to get thin.  roping horses, 4-h horses, people's personal pets, just every cared for horse - the fat ones were the ones that were most prized for meat.  i was reading a book the other day, and i think i know what the people mentioned in the article  you had linked were trying to do.  it spoke of how in the old days, if a horse was fatally injured at a show or a race where there were a lot of people in attendance - and they didn't want to shoot in in front of everyone, to find a clean looking form of death for the horse.  it mentioned putting one's arm up the horses rectum, and cutting the main veins that ran along the horse's spine, and that the blood would be contained mostly within the abdominal cavity.  i wonder if they are trying to accomplish something similar.  i had originally gotten my start by trading foals, and as i grew to be friends with the meat shippers, they would often let me take a skinny mare with a foal on her side, feed her out while the baby had a chance to mature, and when i sold the baby, they would take the mare back.  sometimes if i was lucky, i could find a buyer for the mama who would pay more than the meat rates, and they could just pay the guys who would have shipped the mama for meat instead. because i was just a teen at the time, i couldn't afford the larger, more expensive horses.  so i often would buy starved out horses, fatten them up and sell them to homes.  i still dabble in horse rescue and an equivalent of horse hospice.  i buy starved out horses, and fatten them up, but i no longer sell them.  i either keep them or will give them to homes that can provide long time references as to how they properly care for their animals.  many people will get a horse and care for it for a little while, and then lose interest and neglect it after that.  so i only give them to people who have had horses continually for a few years at least, and have never neglected the animals.  i get a few that are in so much pain, that they can't eat - which is why they are skinny when i bring them home.  those i try to treat by vet or chiropractor, and if we can't find anything to get them out of pain, we give them a small happy time (all the food, all the attention and love), and then we euthanize them.  mainly because i feel that after a lifetime of service, we owe them as painless a death as possible.  but i have picked up starving horses for as low as $35. in the past year.  i bought one horse that had been to world (aqha) 6 times, placed top 5 two times, and has 185 pts for $525.  he was only 8 when i bought him.  i also got a papered paint mare in foal for $500.  just to give you an idea of availability of the horses right now. these horses wouldn't be available at that kind of price if horses were still going to slaughter in large numbers.",0,,
275815,"because generally it's just a surgery any guy might might get.   so for you it might just be a chin implant which a ton of cis guys also get.   it's not a bunch of things that pretty much everyone getting it wants like with ffs.    what you are saying is only partially true and most of it can be overcome.   and a lot of the things you think can't change likely can.  while men and women do have different skull shapes there is a lot of over lap. your head and face is also covered in muscles and ligaments which can grow on t. same for the rest of your body.  even if growth plates have fused you still can get changes because cartilage and stuff between bones can get bigger. this is most noticeable in your hands and feet. it's common for trans guys to go up in shoe size.  its long bones like the ones in your arms and legs that have growth plates that close. there are other bones that aren't done or fused until later. also all the stuff between your bones and the other tissues like ligaments, tendons, muscle will grow.  you can still have a lot of skeletal changes even if you are done getting taller.  people tend to think once you're done growing taller then you're done growing all together, but that is false. not all of your bones stop at the same time. things like the collar bone grow through the 20s. if that is growing then your shoulders and rib cage will have to get wider with it. your head bones are still fusing. the larynx cartilage just starts becoming bone in the 20s and will take many years to finish. there is a lot of cartridge in your chest and rib cage that can grow. your nose can grow.   and even your bones that are done growing aren't static. they are constantly remodeling. up to about 10% of your skeleton is replaced every year. on t as your muscles, ligaments, cartridge grows and strengthens. your muscles and all pull on your bones to move. this will slowly guide your skeleton to be more masculine. you head and face is also covered in muscle. over time these muscles will increase and help shape your face. you don't reach peak bone mass until your 30s. you can still significantly increase your peak bone mass with diet and exercise.  hypothetically even if your bones, cartilage and what not didn't grow you could still drastically change your shape by gaining muscle.   find me a single example of a afab person, cis or not, that can do pull ups with hips wider than their shoulders. every single afab person i've seen that can do pull ups had bigger shoulders than hips. i have been into fitness for decades and have adsorbed a ton of related media. this is something i have noticed and looked for.   point is you're not doomed with your body shape forever. you can change it. people really underestimate what is possible.  your body is completely covered with muscle and you can make all of it grow.  i think body fat percentage is a big factor in what you are seeing. it makes the face rounder, softens the jaw and other facial features.   most americans are overweight or obese and an even grater percentage of trans people are overweight or obese.  &gt;just under 66% of cisgender adults had a body mass index of at least 25, qualifying them as overweight. that may sound high, but it was significantly lower than the 72% share for the transgender adults. [source](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-transgender-health-disparities-20170530-htmlstory.html)  that would be about 3 out of 4 trans people.   so most of us are carrying too much fat.   to make it worse, with body fat the acceptable range for women is obese for men.   that will give a softer look even if you have never been overweight.   women  essential fat 10-13%  athletes 14-20%  fitness 21-24%  acceptable 25-31%  obesity &gt;32%  men  essential fat 2-5%  athletes 6-13%  fitness 14-17%  acceptable 18-24%  obesity &gt;25%   so even if you weren't overweight you may still be over fat.   you can be skinny and have high body fat percentage.  fat distribution doesn't work the way a lot of people think it does. fat redistribution doesn't move existing fat. your hormones just determine where new fat will be placed. if you maintain weight and/or continue to gain it it can just stay in some places even after many years on t.   when you maintain weight you are slightly gaining and loosing little amounts so it will slowly creep to new areas. if you are gaining weight but don't look heavier. unfortunately it may not be muscle.   on t you will hold more visceral fat. this is fat inside the abdominal cavity that isn't seen. you subcutaneous fat will redistribute to visceral fat if you don't loose it. so you can look thinner but have the same amount of extra fat or even more.  t will make it significantly easier to gain muscle and a lot of people expect that just being on t will put them into the male range for muscle mass. this may not be the case since there isn't a surge of growth hormone that occurs with cis male puberty. and the vast majority of adults do not move around and engage in physical activity like a teenager.  a lot of people wont gain much muscle without working out. gaining significant muscle takes a very long time and a lot of energy. your body is energy efficient and adapts to demand and most of the population is largely sedentary and not creating the demand.",1,0,0
536232,"this doesn't ring wholly true to me. the catholic church distrusted the nazis as it could not exercise any influence or control over ithem. however, contrast this with the church's much more cosy relationship with traditional fascist regimes in spain, italy, portugal, [croatia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e#connections_with_the_catholic_church), etc where fascists could be relied upon to uphold catholic values.   see [clerical fascism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clerical_fascism) for the links between religion and fascist movements.   the catholic church was also [instrumental in helping prominent and wanted nazis to flee to south america](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratlines_%28history%29#the_roman_ratlines) after the war as it also did with croatian fascists - who, it could be argued, outdid the nazis in cruelty and violence.   the nazis certainly found broad support from large sections of the catholic church which also profited greatly from the [church tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_tax#germany) which i am sure played no part in it's refusal to condemn the nazi regime.  edit: if anyone wants to know what principled and uncompromising opposition to fascism by a religious organisation really looks like, check out the [jehovah's witnesses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_jehovah%27s_witnesses_in_nazi_germany) in this period.",0,,

558071,"satan sunk her teeth into a foot-long subway melt and tongued the greasy bacon as it slid down her throat.   today was a special day, so satan had splurged, crawling up to the surface of the earth, and ordered a special sub from subways.  she was in subway franchise number 551 to shoot a commercial advocating the now famous subway diet, and here she was feasting on a sub sandwich well over the six gram limit.  forbidden condiments splashed across her demonic tongue.  *how ironic* she thought, *how deliciously ironic*, as the turkey and ham fought with the cheese over the right to stimulate satanâ€™s taste buds first.  her complimentary sandwich finished, satan made her way to the makeup chair, her long red hair swaying from side to side around horns.  as the minutes passed, her tired satanic skinny whore countenance was transformed, beneath layers of creamy goo, into a stunning visual of perfect devilish whorishness.   she glanced in the mirror and took in her own beauty.  she was ready.   ready to meet her idol, her sandwich guru, the hunk of fatty flab.  jared fogle.  yes, the evil god that had trundled his way across satanâ€™s tv screen on many lonely nights.  satan thought about jared, and her hand slid down her pants.  a production assistant escorted satan to the set.  he brought her to an unusually large chair screwed into the floor and pointed to it.  satan, well aware of the standard subway seats recognized this one as a fake.  ""i donâ€™t understand, why canâ€™t i just sit in a regular booth?""   the pa smacked her red rear end.  ""shut up and sit down, ya dumb satanic bitch. just get your lines in your head â€˜cuz weâ€™re about to start filming.""   satan sat down and sulked.  her daddy, god, had never talked to her like that before.   her mommy, jesus, had never been so forceful.  it was hurtful, yet it excited her.  she slid her hand down her pants.  the director of the commercial named demetri approached the set and called for places.  demetri noticed satanâ€™s hand down her pants and commanded the cinematographer to tilt up a bit.  satan was getting nervous.  her guts twisted beneath her perfectly flat stomach, with itâ€™s creamy red complexion.  this was her first time before a camera.  she was about to star in a commercial and she had never even been in a school play.  there had been times when satan considered a career in adult films in hell, but the purely vignette kind where there would be no lines involved, save for the the lines of coke snuck in between double-wang fuckstorms.  satan did her best to suppress her nervousness.  she squirmed in her oversized chair.  ""striking,"" demetri called out as he switched on the movie lights.  satanâ€™s eyes struggled to adjust to the brightness.  she focused across the restaurant.  a shadow emerged.  it lumbered seductively across the sticky subway floor and sat itâ€™s big-boned rear end next to satan.  ""how do you like these chairs? there made big, so that we appear smaller, slimmer, sexier.""  it was jared.  if satan had been nervous before, she was terrified now.   her claws shook.  her stomach turned, and her breasts quivered.  how was she to act?  what was she to say to her idol, her *other* god, her tv toughguy.  jared set his heavy hand upon satanâ€™s thigh and whispered comfortingly in her ear, ""i have a pickle cock.""   satanâ€™s tension faded.  she felt warm and loved all over, from the tip of her toes, to the tips of her big, brown, satanic nipples.  the director demetri called for quiet on the set.  all that could be heard was the thumping of satanâ€™s heart and the wheezing of jaredâ€™s breathing.  soon both sounds were drowned out by the whirring of the camera motors.  the director yelled action, and satan proceeded to extol the virtues of subway, and the greatness of jared, her role model, her inspiration, her six-foot-two, two-hundred pound, dream fatty.  her lines flew subconsciously from her sensuous, sharp toothed mouth as she thought of nothing more than this man, this god, this jared.  all that man, all that sexy.  she was obsessed with the diet that he had passed on to her (and who knows how many others) but she secretly wished that jared had never dieted.  he was so hot now, so sweaty and hot.  he was also attractive.  how much more attractive must he have been in all his obese glory, before the diet had stripped away so much sexy.  ""thatâ€™s a wrap."" the director demetri made his way to the pisser to snort some blow as the rest of the crew broke down the set.  jared turned to satan. ""i wish it were a turkey wrap.""  satan tilted her head. ""what?""  jared rubbed his belly. ""demetri said â€˜itâ€™s a wrap,â€™ and i said i wished it were a turkey wrap.""  he rubbed his belly again as he saw visions of turkey wraps and pudding cups dancing before his spectacled eyes.  if there was one thing jared liked, it was fatty foods.  oh how he yearned for them.  it was hard to tell from observing jaredâ€™s beautiful, yet slightly overweight, fat loving chubster body, but the gumpy stud hadnâ€™t eaten anything over six grams since 1998.  the two phantom turkey wraps lowered, hovering side by side, dripping with honey sauce, as the two pudding cups centered themselves in front of the wraps.   jared was transfixed, aching for their tasty goodness.  he reached out and grabbed them.  the production crew had faded out of view.  satan sat there.  satan wouldnâ€™t have said anything even if she had known what to say.  it was a dream, a dream she did not want to wake from.   she sat there in silent ecstasy as jared handled her perky turkey red breasts.  he was in another world, a mystical realm populated by himself, turkey wraps, and pudding.  satan was in a physical world of hands, breasts, and stirring juices.  her seafood and crab sub was fresh and moist between her asiago cheese thighs.  suddenly jared snapped out of his hallucination. ""woh, i think i need something to eat.""  he noticed his hands on the devilâ€™s breasts.  he did not move them.   the production crew left to go eat at taco bell, and the two subway dieters were alone in the subway restaurant.  minutes passed.  jared, always the gentleman, removed his hands from satanâ€™s breasts.  she was still speechless, not knowing how to act in the presence of her idol.  should she play coy?  or should she just undo his size 42 belt, grab his meatball sub, and mow down on it like a satanic whore sucking so much cack?  ""hey, what do you say i make us lunch?"" jared walked behind the counter and masterfully produced to six-inch veggie delight subs.  satan was impressed.  how did jared know that, out of the whole below-six-grams subway menu, the veggie delight was satanâ€™s favorite?   no one could have told him.   surely there was some sort of cosmic connection.  the gods of love had conferred, satan thought to herself, and they had made the destination of jaredâ€™s subway train satanâ€™s vast station.  he was the â€˜râ€™ train, and she was the 34th street stop.  she watched as jared devoured his veggie sub, made another footlong one, devoured it, and drank 32 ounces of diet faygo rootbeer.  the brown liquid dribbled jaredâ€™s chin.  satan couldnâ€™t take it anymore--the fatboy was too much sexy.  she jumped across the counter, licked the faygo from jaredâ€™s weak chin with her long tongue and ripped off his shirt with her sharp demon claw like nails.  ""make sure to lick the underside of my man boobs,"" cried jared. â€œi love children, but you will do.â€  satan ravaged every inch of his pasty torso until she could not resist the urge to splurge any longer.  she depantsed the manly tower of two-hundred-twenty-five-pound losing doughboy and went for his white-bread love bun.  she spent about ten minutes looking for it before she gave up.",1,−1,

392523,"what that did was giving me insight to myself and my shitty situation. that emotional death i experienced turned into depression. which i would fight for the next three years to come.   i started eating more. sitting on my ass all day. doing nothing of worth or purpose. i was just waiting to die, really. the bigger i got the less i cared about what i saw transforming in the mirror. that hamplanet status was within reach, and i didnâ€™t care about the morbidly obese monster who took over my life.   the way i saw it, thinness was a key to happiness and confidence, and i deserved neither, so it was only appropriate that i evolved even more in the opposite direction. i broke up with my girlfriend, too. she did not take it well, and pleaded me to fight for our relationship even if we lived in different places, but i had no will or strength to fight for it. i didnâ€™t want her to be pulled down the pit i was falling into, so i felt it had to be done.   my family grew concerned. pleading me to lose weight and do something about my problem. they even waved pamphlets of institutions to help fat fucks like me in my face. it was just rubbing salt in the wound to me. i rejected any attempt to help.   but then the day came. the day i had feared would eventually come, and now it was here. the day when putting on my own socks felt heavy. i became sweaty from putting on my damn socks! that demon in the mirror was trying to kill me, and up â€˜til this point i had let him, and welcomed it, but a sudden fear and realization struck me hard. imagine the face of a hamplanet discovering theyâ€™re out of his favorite brand of hamburgers in his local store and actually has to go somewhere else to get them. that was my face.   i was losing myself to this demon. all my life that has been the thing i valued most in my life. my soul. the part of me that makes me into me. itâ€™s not a religious thing. it was just important to me to always know who i am, what my principles are, and what i am, and i had somehow allowed the beetus demon to feast on that.   it was getting less and less room for my soul in that massive, ever-expanding fleshy prison it was held captive in, and it was time to free it.   no, not suicide. weâ€™ve had two suicides in my family, and iâ€™ve seen first-hand what sort of impact it leaves on those left behind. i could not do that to my family. i didnâ€™t want my death to be another source of anger. it would taint the memory of me. iâ€™d only be remembered as the fat loser who couldnâ€™t handle the real world, and that was not me.   the time for change had come.   i started walking. every single day. i knew i had to show myself no mercy. make no exception, but i was still eating like a pig, so that had to be changed as well. gradually i changed my eating habits, and that was the hardest part.   hell, quitting beetus juice was tougher than quitting smoking, which i did almost at the same time.   it came to a point where all i ate was the healthiest crackers. five each day in total, and 400 grams of minced meat. that was it. thatâ€™s less than 1000 calories every day. that was all i ate, but it gave results. i was losing weight again, and i stepped it up a notch. instead of walking on flat ground i started walking in the mountains. the snow was gone, so it was safe for a hike. i thought iâ€™d puke up my own lungs when i started, but i didnâ€™t quit. i kept at it, and to my relief, that familiar sensation of pain was back. the kind of pain that told me it was worth it, and the more i suffered the better i would feel in the long run.   i watched myself become an exercise fanatic. something i never, ever, thought i would become, but there i was. getting thinner and fitter than i had ever been before, and the compliments and praise started rolling in. i basked in it. i loved it. i had never received that kind of praise before over anything iâ€™ve done.   but hereâ€™s the irony: the more weight i loss the less happy i was with my reflection in the mirror. before i started working out i had not cared about what i saw there, but now i did, and i believed thinness was the key to happiness once more, and for the first time ever it was within reach.   i increased my exercise habits. i started jogging and lifting weights. 7 days a week. i felt proud about my accomplishments. my family was proud. my friends were proud.   i felt my confidence return. i felt better about myself. i felt i had a future again. i wanted to live.  after a year and a half of sweat, tears, and blood i had gone from 135kg (297lb) to 90kg (198lb)!  i was finally thin.  guys, i made it!  i wish i could end the story there. that would have been a good way to end it, wouldnâ€™t it? but that would just be a lie.   my view on life had led me to believe once i was thin iâ€™d be happy. i would have confidence. i would have potential sweethearts lining up outside my door hoping for a chance to court me, and why wouldnâ€™t i believe that? the beetus demon was the source of my unhappiness and my low confidence, so why wouldnâ€™t the complete opposite lead to the complete opposite feelings as well?  my confidence was better, at first, but i wasnâ€™t happier, because in my eyes i was still fat.  i wasnâ€™t blind. i could see i was smaller, but the smaller details became my main focus of concern this time. so, those small details just grew bigger and bigger, and before i knew it i was fat again, but no one else but me saw it. the sweethearts were nowhere to be seen, and i felt i just had to work a little harder, and lose more. then everything would be better.   the voices of praise and compliments had been silenced. once more they had taken the form of concern.   first my family. â€œare you eating enough? you donâ€™t have to exercise so hard anymore. you donâ€™t need to lose more weight.â€ bullshit, i thought. itâ€™s not like iâ€™m some teenage girl with daddy issues, iâ€™m fine! but then my friends started saying the same things.  iâ€™ve always held my friendsâ€™ opinions in higher regard than those of my family. probably because i moved from my parents when i was 13 years old, and my friends became a substitute for the family closeness any teenager needs.   thatâ€™s when i realized what kind of path i was heading towards. so why didnâ€™t i turn around again? i had reached the point of no return. i was deathly scared of any type of food. all i drank was pure water. all i ate was just enough to keep myself alive. thatâ€™s how i liked it, and thatâ€™s what i intended to keep doing. i hate food now. i hate it so much.   i still exercise. i still eat those kinds of meals. granted i donâ€™t exercise every day now. i donâ€™t have time for that while being busy with university and all, but i exercise when i can.  i canâ€™t stop.   what may shock some people is that iâ€™m fully aware that this isnâ€™t healthy, and that iâ€™ve probably traded one eating disorder for another. iâ€™m aware of this possibility, but yet i also believe i am still fat even though my ribs have made a permanent appearance on my body. iâ€™m 187cm tall (6â€™2ft), and iâ€™m 80kg now (176lb). iâ€™m torn between logic and delusions. i cannot make my mind up about what reality is.   wouldnâ€™t that be ironic? a fat loser escaped the beetus death and made changes in his life. he defeated the eating disorder, only to find himself in the other end with a new one.  i used to envy anorexic people. yes, i was one of those. i wanted their problem, because it didnâ€™t matter to me as long as iâ€™d be thin.   iâ€™ve seen both sides now, i think. itâ€™s not made me happier as i thought it would, but it has given me a wider perspective of things. i donâ€™t envy any of them anymore, but not because iâ€™m scared of the path iâ€™m walking. no, iâ€™m still walking that path, and i donâ€™t want to look back.   the reason i donâ€™t envy the anorexic anymore is because i miss the apathy i had about all this shit. ignorance is bliss they say, but iâ€™m unable to return that state. being thin means everything to me, and i actually enjoy the feeling i get when iâ€™m hungry. that starving feeling. i like it. it gives me the feeling of mastery over my own body. steel discipline. iron will. it still makes me proud.   i donâ€™t know whether or not that will kill me in the end. youâ€™ll have to form your own opinion about that, but at least my coffin will not be heavy.   i'm sorry if you all came here to get your jimmies massaged. i'm not even sure why i'm posting this. i've wanted to post a [f2f] story for a very long time. also, first time poster here. i thought about just cutting it in half, and end it where i was happiest, but like i said, that would be a lie.   for anyone curious, this is the transformation: http://imgur.com/h7xulrt  tl;dr: always been fat, got started on life and became a little less fat, life went to hell so got even fatter than ever. started exercising and diet. stopped being fat. made it. made it some more. still making it. can't stop making it.",1,−2,1

491882,"it wasn't until the 1970s that people in general - men or women - began to make exercise a high priority in daily life. before then there were physical education classes in school, boot camps in the military and a slowly growing interest in exercise since the 19th century, but nothing like the ubiquitous emphasis on muscle tone that we see today. there weren't huge, extensive fitness clubs in most towns, no pilates classes, aerobics, jazzercise, stairmasters, treadmills or jogging tracks. the average person didn't have a set of weights at home nor an expensive multi-speed bike to ride for miles on the weekend.  previously, when most folks lived in an agricultural society, leisure time exercise wasn't needed to keep fit. farming, chopping wood, and hundreds of other chores like fetching water from a well, feeding and milking cows, catching and preparing game, churning butter and washing clothes provided enough physical activity to fill a day.  in the 1800s, [there was a movement advocating gymnastics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/physical_culture) ""in order to sustain public morals and to mold better citizens"". eventually,  &gt;numerous exercise systems were developed, typically drawing from a range of traditional folk games, dances and sports, military training and medical calisthenics...printed works and items of apparatus generally addressed exercise as a form of remedial physical therapy.   &gt;certain items of equipment and types of exercise were common...including exercises with indian clubs, medicine balls, wooden or iron wands and dumbbells...fencing, boxing, savate and wrestling were also widely practiced...  for women in particular, [the definition of an ideal physique fluctuated drastically during the 1900s](https://greatist.com/grow/100-years-womens-body-image#1). coming out of the previous century, ""a showstopping feminine body like a looping figure-8, thanks to a super-cinched corset"", was what most women wanted. â€œthe gibson girl was not daintyâ€¦ she was dark, regal in bearing, [and] quite tall.â€  &gt;[the beginning of â€œphysical fitnessâ€ for women](http://ironplatestudios.com/blog/2019/4/1/the-history-of-women-in-fitness) began in the 1900â€™s with stretching (while wearing long skirts!). rowers and stationary bikes were introduced between 1910-1920, but were considered a big luxury...   but then, &gt;unlike the frozen beauty of the decade before, the flapper is constantly in motion. the exaggerated curves of gibson are gone and replaced with small bust and hips...margaret gorman, crowned as the first miss america in 1921, was the eraâ€™s ideal. her 5-foot-1, 108-pound frame was a full 180 from the gibson era...  &gt;in 1920, a device called the vibro-slim was introduced to â€œshake the weight offâ€.  &gt;following the stock market crash, spirits dip back down and so do hemlines. dresses are now draped on the bias. translation? a less boxy, more fitted silhouette. the natural waist (around the belly button) comes back and thereâ€™s a hint of shoulder too. and the flat-chested look so popular in the 1920s gives way to a small bustline, likely a direct result of the new bra-cup sizing invented in this era. the media embraces a slightly more curvaceous body, making this era a stepping-stone from the streamlined, petite look of the 1920s toward the curvier 1940s...  &gt;thanks to world war ii, military shoulders (broad, boxy, and aggressive) become the look du jour. angularity is the order of the day. bras take on a pointed look too, with names like â€œbulletâ€ and â€œtorpedo.â€ all that translates into the look of the moment: a long-limbed, taller, and squarer silhouette. donâ€™t be fooled by rosie the riveter, the ideal body type still doesnâ€™t include flexing biceps. but it does become taller, and more commanding, possibly echoing womenâ€™s expanding role in the workforce while men are on the battlefield...  &gt;[exercise for women in the 1940s was characterized by stretching...](http://wellness360magazine.com/fitness-trends-over-the-decades/)body weight exercises were introduced...jumping jacks were adopted by the u.s. army because of the low level of fitness amongst drafted soldiers, sparking this exercise to become popular among men. jumping jacks and toe-stretches were thought to keep bodies toned and in shape...  &gt;after the angularity of the war era, a soft voluptuousness was prized above all else. ads of the time even advised â€œskinnyâ€ women to take weight-gain supplements like wate-on to fill out their curves. playboy magazine and barbie were both created in this decade, echoing a tiny-waisted, large-chested ideal...  &gt;hula hoops and dancing the twist were popular workouts...  &gt;the swinging 60s brings the pendulum back in the other direction. thin is in...the look is now fresh-faced, girlish, and androgynously trim. models like twiggy and jean shrimpton (aka â€œthe shrimpâ€) represented a new ideal: doll-faced, super slender, and petite...  &gt;it seemed to be a widespread belief in the â€™60s that you could jiggle away unwanted fat. the machine originally gained popularity in the early 1900s, but had a big comeback in the â€˜60s. you would loop a wide belt around any area problem area, turn it on and bam! your fat would magically â€œmeltâ€ off. the vibrations were supposed to mimic a massage. at the time, massages were believed to cure fatigue, remove toxins, increase muscle tone and improve circulation. no sweat, no problem! except that it did not really work. people eventually came to realize this, and the vibrating belt faded away...  during the 1970s, &gt;the party girl of the day was still pressured to maintain a slim-hipped, flat-stomached body in order to rock these fashions at the discotheque. synthetic fabrics like polyester and spandex are embraced, but theyâ€™re also far more revealing and less forgiving compared to fabrics of the past. the overall look remains lean, especially in the torso, but curves start to come back...  [jim fixx](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/jim_fixx) is credited with helping start america's fitness revolution by popularizing the sport of running and demonstrating the health benefits of regular jogging with his 1977 best-selling book the complete book of running.  also,  &gt;the â€™70s brought in a new, high-intensity form of exercise called jazzercise, which is still practiced today (although not as widely). jazzercise is a mix of jazz dance (no surprise there), ballet, pilates, yoga and kickboxing. the routines are usually set to a popular song of the instructorâ€™s choice. this trend was the beginning of choreographed exercise set to music...  next, &gt;amazonian supermodels reign supreme. these tall, leggy women come to represent the new feminine ideal...  &gt;the 1980s also ushers in an era of fitness... aerobics and jogging take off, and for the first time, muscles are acceptable and desirable on women. itâ€™s both empowering and discouragingâ€”one more beauty standard to add to a lengthening list...  &gt;aerobics sprung up as a spinoff of jazzercise. while the two exercises are similar, aerobics is less of a dance routine than jazzercise. it was originally invented in the â€˜60s, but it was not put on the map until jane fonda came out with a book and aerobics workout tapes. the dance moves used were mixed in with fitness movements, like elevating knees or marching in place. aerobics became a workout empire and inspired many different spin-offs, such as water aerobics and step aerobics.  this was helped along by two technological advances, vcrs and the widespread availability of cable tv. celebrities sold video tapes of their work out routines and exercise programming became a cheap and popular schedule filler as stations atruggled to fill time slots.  and there was one more flip-flop before the end of the millennium. the 1990s &gt;...ushers in the era of the waif. naysayers also dub it â€œheroin chicâ€ for the gaunt look associated with seattleâ€™s grunge music scene. at 5â€™7â€ [kate] moss is undeniably petite for a model and thin, even by industry standards. itâ€™s a firmly unathletic look and a reaction to the amazonian, uber-fit woman of the 80s...",1,0,2

539033,"your body converts food to energy â€“ calories. it burns these calories to lift the weights, and recover from your workouts. most guys need at least 3000kcal/day to gainÂ strength and [build muscle](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/) on stronglifts 5Ã—5. [skinny guys](https://stronglifts.com/gain-weight/) with fast metabolisms may need to eat even more.  hereâ€™s why: building muscle is low on your bodyâ€™s priority list. if thereâ€™s a shortage of food, your body will use it for critical tasks first.Â so you canâ€™t recover well on a caloric deficit. and if you canâ€™tÂ recover well, you canâ€™t add weight next workout. you miss reps which means you canâ€™t progress.  eating maintenance calories is better but not ideal. youâ€™re not trying to maintain your situation on stronglifts 5Ã—5 after all. youâ€™re trying to improve it by gaining strength and muscle. eating over maintenance ensures thereâ€™s no food shortage that hinders recovery between workouts.  good calorie calculatorsÂ will suggest guys 16kcal/lb forÂ maintenance. if you weigh 75kg/165lb thatâ€™s 2640kcal. but again, youâ€™re not trying to maintain but improve. and adding weight every workout is hard work. it therefore makes sense to eat more. this brings us to 3000kcal/day.  if that number scares you, remember forms follows function.Â your body changes in response to the work you do. it gets skinny, fat, and weak from a sedentary lifestyle. and it gets strong, muscular, and fit from lifting heavyâ€¦ but only if you give your body the food it needsÂ to train hard and recover.  i know you donâ€™t want to get fat. unfortunately itâ€™s hard to build muscle without gaining any fat. you have toÂ eat more to build muscle. but [you need to eat less to lose fat](https://stronglifts.com/lose-fat/). these goals contradict. if you try doing both, youâ€™ll either end up eating too little to build muscle, or too much to lose fat.  this is why bodybuilders traditionally alternate muscle gaining and fat loss phases. they eat more food during the bulk, but less food during the cut. this is the simplest way to build muscle without gaining fat that actually worksâ€¦ if youâ€™re not obese, havenâ€™t trained before, and donâ€™t use drugs.  obese guys can indeed build muscle while losing fat when they start lifting. their bodies use their fat reserves to build muscle. they build strength and muscle faster without needing as much food. and since muscle is denser than fat, theyÂ end up looking slimmer at the same body-weight.  people who have lifted before canÂ also build muscle while losing fat. thanks to muscle memory you can regain lost muscle and strength faster after a long break. if i quit lifting and resume a year later, iâ€™d rebuild strength and muscle faster than it took the first time â€“ while leaning out.  and if you use drugs or have great genetics, then you can do things that naturals and mere mortals canâ€™t. but most people who try to build muscle while losing fat end up spinning their wheels. they donâ€™t progress because thereâ€™s too much food to lose fat but not enough to build muscle.  you can get away with eating a caloric deficit the first weeks of stronglifts 5Ã—5. if you startÂ light, the weights will increase and youâ€™ll gain some muscle. but the heavier the weights get, the bigger the stress, and the bigger theÂ recover need. youâ€™ll need to eat more to keep progressing.  you wonâ€™t like eating moreÂ if youâ€™re an ex-fatty who worked hard to lose fat. youâ€™ll be afraid to gain it back. same if you have six pack abs â€“ youâ€™ll be afraid to lose it if your body-fat increases from eating more.Â unfortunately you canâ€™t have it all at the same time. you have to choose.  choose muscle. you can easily lose 1lb of fat a week later. but you canâ€™t gain more than [2lb of lean muscle a month](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#rate_of_muscle_gain). and [you need to lift heavy](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#strength_is_size) to gain that much muscle. this requires eating a lot food. besides, a low body-fat is useless if you donâ€™t build muscle mass first â€“ you just end up skinny.  dedicate the next year to building strength and muscle. your body-fat will decrease if you started out obese. if you [started skinny](https://stronglifts.com/gain-weight/) with single digit body-fat, it will increaseÂ to lower double digits. but you can easily decrease it in one year after youâ€™ve added [24lbÂ of lean muscle](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#rate_of_muscle_gain) and squat 300lb.  you might actually not even need to decrease your body-fat later. i donâ€™t have single digit body-fat levels. neither do mostÂ athletes. yet my abs are visible. bigger muscles stick out further. they can push through the fat under your skin. so they can show despite a higher body-fat percentage.  eat quality, nutrient-dense food. you need the vitamins and minerals to help recovery. the occasional junk meal is fine. but you should eat mostly quality food. donâ€™t eat junk food all the time â€“ it builds bad habits that willÂ make you fat if you quit lifting. and itâ€™s bad for your health.  youâ€™ll need to eat three to four meals a day to get your calories. for mostÂ people working 9 to 5 and training around 6, that will be breakfast, lunch, dinner and an extraÂ pre-workout meal. dinner is your post-workout meal. if you train in the morning,Â eat first so you can train harder.  everyÂ meal should have vegetables. a lot of vegetables. think half a plate. the rest should be a good source of protein with carbs and goodÂ fats. example is chicken with broccoli,Â tomato, avocado and a big potato. eat a fruit for desert and youâ€™ve hit all your macro and micronutrients to gain.  ## protein  protein is the main muscle building nutrient. your body uses protein to build new muscle. it also uses proteinÂ to repair damaged muscle tissue after your workouts. you need about 0.82g of protein per pound of body-weight (1.8g/kg). thatâ€™s about 126g of protein if youâ€™re 70kg/154lb.  if youâ€™re obese, your daily protein requirement may look too high with that formula. use your lean body mass instead (without the fat). if you have a normal weight there will be little difference between your body-weight and lean body mass. just use 0.82g/lb in that case.  protein shakes can be tempting. they take less time to prepare, and are cheap. but they donâ€™t keep you full long. and real food contains tons of micro-nutrients on top of just the protein. you need the minerals and vitamins to help recovery, as well as fiber to improveÂ digestion.  most of your protein should therefore come from real food. if you eat like an omnivoreÂ this is easy. eat some meat, chicken, fish orÂ eggs with every meal. a 250g/8oz steak forÂ lunch will provide you with 50g of protein, which is almost aÂ third of your daily required intake.",1,0,0
721034,"so, i've looked around a lot on the web and the leatherman.com site.  so far i'm leaning towards finding a a juice cs4 or a used pst/ii.  i still need to investigate multi tools from victorinox.  i wrote up some notes, mostly for myself, but then i thought they might possibly be useful for others, so i cleaned them up a tiny bit and am including them here.  (and i really want scissors but i have this major urge to get a skeletool cx or a oht.)  criteria;  * price - not that big a deal for me, i can afford it and it's money well spent as long as i don't lose it. :-) * light! (note, wave is 8.5 oz, for comparison, pulse is 6, pst/ii is 5) * easy to use (so, light, but not tiny, decent sized handles) * one handed opening of at least the main blade, more is better * locking tools/blades - i like blades especially to lock when opened * tool selection - after thinking about what i use on the wave other than the blade and the pliers, i realized i  must have scissors.  the saw is pretty handy too. corkscrew, awl, file, are nice to have. * i don't care about color much.  suggestions came from this post on reddit /r/edc and also from this really really long forum thread i found; ""best lightweight multitool???"" http://edcforums.com/threads/best-lightweight-multitool.58082/  1) leatherman skeletool cx - the skeletool is the lightest fullsize, i recall seeing comments on the web or reddit that it is not as sturdy as one might like. the cx blade is made of better steel than the non cx.  one handed opening blade is really easy to use, unlike the juice blades which are reportedly awkward but possible to open one handed..  one random thing, the carabiner lets you clip it to something momentarily to let you then one handedly open tools (i.e. if your other hand is full).  no scissors.    note, the skeletool and skeletool cx look to be exactly the same, same set of tools, same size and weight, except for the steel in the blade.  all tools lock.  2) leatherman oht - one hand tool - i dig the one handed opening concept a ton http://www.leatherman.com/product/oht 4.5 inch (closed) and 9.9 ozes yikes heavy - maybe good for camping or whatever, rather than edc.  $60 to $80 depending on where you get it (rei is $80) having trouble finding it on amazon wow, lacking tools, considering it's weight, but everything it has is one handed and locking; 420hc knife, 420hc serrated knife, spring-action needlenose pliers, spring-action regular pliers, spring-action 154cm replaceable hard-wire cutters, spring-action 154cm replaceable wire cutters, large screwdriver (fixed), medium screwdriver (fixed), phillips screwdriver (fixed), small screwdriver (fixed), saw, bottle opener, can opener, integrated lanyard attachments, #8-32 cleaning rod attachment, oxygen tank wrench, strap cutter.  no scissors.  3) leatherman juice line - c2, cs2, cs4, xe6  (cs4 has more tools, slightly larger ""the cs4 adds wood saw, corkscrew and awl"") - reddit guys recommended it, meant for carrying in pocket, smaller than a fullsize multitool, from forum ""the best lightweight mt imo is the lm juice s2. it has a better tool selection than the skeletool and it has scissors!""   all of them have 420hc knife, needlenose pliers, regular pliers, hard-wire cutters, wire cutters, extra-small screwdriver, medium/large screwdriver, phillips screwdriver, small screwdriver, bottle opener, can opener  * juice c2 - 4.3 oz, corkscrew w/assist, * juice s2 - 4.4 oz, scissors * juice cs4 - 5.5 oz, corkscrew w/assist, saw, awl, scissors,  * juice xe6 - 6.7 oz, 420hc serrated knife, corkscrew w/assist, awl, saw, diamond-coated file, wood/metal file.  weightier but nice.  compare with pulse or pst/ii.  4) leatherman charge?   someone on reddit recommended this, it's 8.2 oz, barely lighter than the wave/   charge tti is the ""lightest full size leatherman tool"" according to forum. tons of tools. needlenose pliers, regular pliers, wire cutters, hard-wire cutters, crimper, s30vÂ® knife, 420hc serrated knife, cutting hook, saw, scissors, wood/metal file, diamond-coated file, large bit driver, small bit driver, medium screwdriver, ruler (8 inch/19 cm), bottle opener, can opener, wire stripper, bit kit: phillips #1-2, screwdriver 3/16"", screwdriver 1/8"" and torx #15, hex 5/32"" and 9/64"", hex 1/8"" and 7/64"", hex 3/32"" and 5/64"", hex 1/6"" and .050"", square drive #2 and #3, phillips eyeglass screwdriver and flat tip  5) leatherman pulse - buh, wait, i have one of these, it was a gift for being a best man and i loaned it to my brother some time back.  discontinued so look for it on ebay, but apparently pretty light and small, 5.8 oz, 4 inch when closed,  more tools than the skeletool and the tools lock. 420hc stainless steel clip-point knife, 8 in | 20 cm ruler, bottle opener, can opener, diamond-coated file, extra-small screwdriver, hard-wire cutters, large screwdriver, medium screwdriver, needlenose pliers, phillips screwdriver, regular pliers, scissors, wire cutters, wood/metal file.  i like the form factor on the wave better.  partly because of how the handles on the pulse are designed, the edges kind of bite into my hand.  6) leatherman kick - it is 5.2 0z, .2 oz heavier than skeletool, apparently cheap, has bigger pliers than the medium sized juice pliers.  looks like it's discontinued. no scissors. like a sideclip, minus medium screwdriver and plus wire stripper  7) leatherman pst/ii or sideclip - (both 5 oz) from forum ""you could also try and find an older pst/ii or sideclip (my all-time favorite leatherman tool), they are both the same weight as the skeletool, yet smaller overall with larger pliers.""  pst/ii has more tools than sideclip, looks like the sideclip is larger but less stuff.  sideclip - 420hc stainless steel clip-point knife, 8 in | 20 cm ruler, bottle opener, can opener, hard-wire cutters, large screwdriver, medium screwdriver, needlenose pliers, phillips screwdriver, regular pliers, small screwdriver, wire cutters. no scissors. pst/ii - same as sideclip plus the blade is partially serrated, and add scissors, wood/metal file, diamond-coated file  8) victorinix swisstool - slimmer versions - suggested by reddit, good quality, lighter than wave at least.  went to the website, i'll have to check it out more later, they have a bunch of 5 oz tools, a bunch of 11 oz tools, and a handful that have no weight listed.  honorable mention   leatherman zrex - is not what i want, but it's a $26 strap cutter/window breaker, looks a lot sturdier than the resqme, should get one for the car  leatherman krunch - too heavy, but neat, looks like locking vise grip style.  might be awesome for woodworking.  $116 at country knives  leatherman piranha - 1.9 oz - super small and neat, this is one of those flat piece of metal things, $35 at country knives, open wrench (english), pretty slick.   1/4"" hex bit driver with phillips/flat bits, bottle opener, scraper, box wrench (metric)",0,,

263334,"i've never been over 130lbs in my life. i'm 5'2. this is what i eat. i currently do not exercise at all.   during my lightest times (90lbs in grade 11/12) i would not eat breakfast but id eat lunch and dinner and all the mcdonalds i wanted usually just a regular big mac meal or smaller but i was very active. as in cheer practice i hated, fitness class, and gymnastics plus babysitting at 4am that was basically sleeping. if i wasn't active i ate less. if i had had a big meal that week i'd eat less every other day. because i worked at mcdonald's i'd replace certain things in the sandwiches. no sauce. they are pretty much cake in liquid form. replace with a slice of tomato. extra charge but worth it. replaces the moisture for something healthier. i've never counted calories but i made myself aware of certain items. i'm not a stress eater i'm a stress starver. if i feel unworthy i don't eat. i don't deserve it. yes those statements are still true for me don't internalize them.   during not so anorexic times i balance my meals. i eat only till satisfied. my whole family is over weight some obese and their attitude around food honestly disgusts me. (sorry peeps if this sounds like you i'm just sharing my story) the more you eat the funnier you are. so not healthy. so i practice the rule that if you feel satisfied while eating,  or simply just not ""hungry"" anymore. wait 20 min before you decide to go for more. it takes about that long for the food to reach your stomach and for your stomach to send the message to your brain that you're full.   my mom low key hates me for my size but honestly she eats more often than 2 of the tallest people i know combined. even after beriatric surgery. eating more often with smaller snacks is definitely a way to not over eat at meal times. but if you end up just constantly eating, especially a lot of nutrient rich food like nuts or charcuterie stuff it adds up super quick and gives you more than what you feel. for example of the amount, what she eats for a snack between 2 meals is what i would eat for a breakfast or lunch meal if i'm not at a restaurant. i've practiced listening to my body my entire life. she is right that i don't try anymore but to claim (she does) that i never had to try is blatant ignorance and invalidating of the exercise and training and ed traits i struggled with for 3 decades now. just because i trained myself to not have to think about it doesn't mean i didn't try.   restaurants the meals are built around the plate size and presentation, not around how many calories is useful. i prioritize veg and meat then the starches are to ""fill in the cracks"" because of this. i don't think i've ever finished a restaurant plate without being absolutely stoned out of my mind. they are heavy and not usually very healthy. pop is the worst thing to have with a meal. aside from the asinine amount of sugar in them (don't get me started on energy drinks) the constant swelling and releasing from the carbonation and burping tricks you into thinking you're hungry again, when really you may just be needing some water. or really your stomach is just not stretching the limits anymore. i've heard (may be untrue) that the body never really developed a way to tell you you're thirsty vs hungry during our evolution and now that we live in abundance a lot of people are dehydrated and big. see where i'm going? so if you've eaten already, have a glass of water and re evaluate. have pop as a liquid dessert.   one horrifying tidbit i learned while working at mcdonald's  the large chocolate milkshake in canada is 1800 calories (approx 10 years ago). that would sustain the average person at a healthy weight for the entire day. not counting legitimate nutrients.  but people never have just a large chocolate milkshake a day do they? that's an after lunch or dinner treat for them or them and their family. so plus that with all the other things they're eating and drinking and you may understand why people don't understand how they got so big. then add their alcohol (beer is heaviest i think with stouts being some of the worst.) and after dinner snacks while watching tv or playing games.   every swallow adds up. every. single. one. nothing is free. except water. and you only have a certain amount before it's excessive so choose wisely. this is why i'm choosing things in day to day like veg is the highest priority because it will do the best for you. and fibrous so it can sit heavier in your tum. ever tried eating a lot of raw broccoli? that shit is so heavy. so good for you too tho. then the meat. we don't need the amount if meat we serve ourselves. it's quite a large portion at restaurants. really we only need the amount that would fit in our palm. then starch. whole wheat, brown rice, taters and yams and sweet potatoes and parsnips are all good for you and very yummy but will (i think) turn to sugar in your tum as energy for immediate use. that's why athletes carb load before a thing whatever their thing is. if you don't use that energy it is stored. diets don't work because they're temporary abs are meant to be. companies that sell diets don't want you to lose weight because then you wouldn't be a customer anymore. lifestyle changes work.   i heard sometime during working at mcdonald's that drinking a hot drink with greasy unhealthy food will ensure the fat will stay liquid in your body and pass easier. i think i heard later it was horse shit but it definitely made me feel less gross afterwards than a pop,  nvm the sugar crash. when i do drink pop now, it's 250ml at a time. the sugar is real.   so to compile tldr eat what you need carefully. avoid sugar for 70% of meals. if you think you're hungry still challenge that idea with milk(heavy liquid) or water. commercial juice is full of sugar too so don't treat it as healthy. i honestly treat juice as a mixer or oj with breakfast. but oj for breakfast is a 3rd choice for me after coffee and water. cheat to be sane and make healthy substitutions. (most restaurant burgers i ask for half sauce cuz i don't like the mess and i don't need the calories). tofu is lovely if treated right and don't be afraid of vegetables. roasted veg is to die for. if you have a big meal compensate the rest of the week. fasted exercise does wonders. a 30 min walk before breakfast is a great way to start.   i hope this helps shed some light on what makes skinny people skinny, and how to train yourself to listen to your body. i started out with an eating disorder but unconditional love changed my view point. the experience with an ed i will not deny set me up for success, but it's not healthy to think that way. treat yourself with love and respect. and talk to your doctor before you take any internet stranger's advice. good luck.",1,−1,

""care for a complimentary drink? it's free for all vip guests!"" the drinks on the tray he held were fizzy looking and pink, contained in a rather fancy looking glass cup. before you had time to respond, you shoved a cup into your hand and darted off towards the next vip guest. you shrugged and took a sip.   the pink liquid tasted vaguely like bubblegum, and fizzled as it made its way down your throat. it must have been heavily caffeinated, because immediately after hitting your stomach, a burst of energy spread throughout your body, leaving you feeling quite energetic. that burst of energy also removed all the body hair from your legs, arms, and chest, but you failed to notice it...  you practically sprinted around the convention center, taking everything in. with every step you took, a little bit of height disappeared, but you didn't notice it at all; you were much too engrossed in all the cool stuff around you. you had never really been obsessed with nerdy junk like this before, but it felt a tad more interesting now that you were here. you spent a solid ten minutes at a booth displaying models from some old sci fi show, and as you toyed around with the little spaceships and mechs, your beard grew thinner and thinner, the strands of hair pulling back up into your skin, until your face was totally smooth.  next, you went by a booth featuring some old comic books. the price tag on some of the issues were outrageous, but your vip pass had come with a $300 gift card to the con, so you had no problem dropping $150 on a 1st edition issue of violenceman. you couldn't remember if you felt this strongly about comics before entering the convention, but hey, when in rome...  all your frantic movements about the convention building must have been good for your health, because your previously slightly pudgy body had been tightening and getting slimmer with every step. your belly was now flat and taut, your arms were now willowy limbs, devoid of both muscle and fat, and your legs were nice and slender. of course, all that body mass has to go somewhere...  while in line for an autograph from the creator of trek wars, you felt a sudden pain in your chest. politely asking the guy behind you to hold your spot, you ran over to the bathroom, concerned that you might be getting sick. you knelt before a toilet and leaned over, ready to vomit. of course, that's not exactly what was going to happen. a burning sensation spread throughout your chest, focusing on your nipples, and your body began churning out decades worth of estrogen and milk. two fleshy mounds began pushing out from your chest, starting at minuscule bee stings, but growing larger by the second. the burning sensation didn't stop during their frenzied growth, and before long your shirt was tightening as your breasts grew larger and larger. a cups, b cups, c cups...you failed to stifle a moan as your newly sensitive nipples brushed against your shirt. your breasts stopped as they reached a hefty, voluptuous d cup, and you nearly passed out from the pleasure.   resting for a few minutes in the bathroom stall, you finally managed to get up and shuffle out towards the sinks. you stared at your new, massive chest in awe and terror. before you had a chance to react or say anything regarding your new assets, the burning sensation began again in your face. your lips began pumping up into a pout, your nose shrank and turned up slightly, your eyes grew a tad, your eyebrows thinned, and your short, masculine hair cascaded down your neck into a long, silky, feminine mane. the burning sensation then focused on your throat, and morphed your vocal chords until your deep voice was destroyed completely, replacing it with something high, airy, and feminine.   your groin started tingling, and you whimpered slightly. your left testicle was forcibly sucked up into your body, followed shortly by its partner, and the two were melted and dissolved, before starting their transformation into ovaries. whatever cum had remained in your body was then forcibly expelled out your rapidly dwindling shaft, or converted into fertile eggs. after your womb had finished being constructed, your penis shot out one final, pathetic drop of cum, and then finished its transformation into a clit. a small hole opened up where your balls once were, and the remaining skin formed into your labia. you had a vagina.  the final change was rather lackluster, but incredibly important. deep within every cell of your body, the xy chromosomes that once dictated your life were permanently and irreversibly shifted to xx, making you completely female. after a few minutes staring at yourself in the mirror, you realized your vision was getting foggy. you stumbled out of the bathroom, and almost bumped into several con-goers, before the sharply dressed staff member that gave you the drink stopped you and fixed a pair of glasses over your eyes.

327225,"i think it is pretty normal to feel fat at that bmi, or really any bmi at certain angles. that doesn't mean that the feeling is reflective of the truth, but you are normal to feel that way.  at a bmi of 24 you could potentially be overweight or obese by body fat percentage, or you could potentially be very fit and athletic and lean. if you don't know where you stand you can ask your doctor or use a tape measurer to check your waist circumference or get your body fat checked (note: don't rely on body fat measuring scales, they are highly inaccurate and overestimate for people who are normal weight, for me the scales add 6% vs my body fat measurement from a scan, the most accurate method. if you can't get your body fat measured professionally measuring your waist in combination with your weight is good enough).  i have found that even at an underweight bmi and low body fat % i still feel chunky at certain angles or look fat in my opinion in some photos.  i've learned you have to rely on facts. if you can measure your weight or body fat and show that it is in the healthy range you know you are not fat even if it feels like you are. if you don't trust the weight measurement's assesment then add in a waist measurement or body fat assesment as a sanity check.   if all of that is normal and healthy, you could still lose a little weight or body fat in a healthy, slow way, or you could increase activity and improve the quality of your diet to build lean muscle. but you have to base your reality in the numbers, because fat and thin are subjective and you could find you still feel large at a low bmi and lean composition. trust the measurements and your doctor if you cannot trust your own subjective feelings or the subjective opinions of those around you. so long as you do not allow yourself to become underweight or go on crash diets where you are not consuming enough food to get the nutrients you need from your diet you can play around with what looks best to you, but you may also find that you will only be satisfied when you learn to accept some supposed ""flaws.""  i have gotten to a point where i cannot allow myself to lose any weight or i will become underweight, and i cannot lose a lot more body fat either or i will be underfat, so i have reached a limit where i have to accept the flabbier bits of my body that i do not like or face health risks.  i generally know that i am thin objectively and see myself as slim for the most part most of the time, but there are certainly positions i could put myself in where i look quite fat or chubby, and there is still a rare photo that is taken of me that is quite unflattering to my body. you will never, ever get to a place where you look 100% slim 100% of the time, even very thin people with abs have some stomach rolls or fat if they bend over. show me someone who is quite in shape and i bet you i can take a photo of them in just the right lighting or position where they look pudgy.  not to mention, there will always be people who think you are fat. i have been called ""fat"" while underweight before, and i have been called anorexic at a healthy bmi.  that is why you have to base your reality in measurable facts. that is all that matters. it doesn't matter if someone thinks you look too fat or too thin, you will never please these people. and it doesn't matter if you sometimes feel fat or look fat at certain angles, that feeling will never go away with weight loss. your life will be easier and more enjoyable if you maintain a reasonably low weight and sufficient strength and conditioning, but chasing some undefinable subjective aesthetic ideal will leave you spinning in circles.",1,-1,0

270276,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,
294835,"i have personally dealt with being overweight for most of my young adult and adult life. i was never a small kid, and was actually at my heaviest when i was 15 years old. i went hit a growth spurt, however, and slimmed down quite a bit until i was around 200, where i now stay. this is about 10-15 pounds heavier than where i would like to be, so i am not obese, per se, but i do carry a few extra pounds.   i went on weight watchers back on september and lost a lot of weight. i went from 213 to 185. i was working out regularly, and i felt fantastic. however, i had to eat a lot less than i normally would have. makes sense, right?   well, here is the thing. i personally know a guy who weighs 150 soaking wet, and he can eat me under the table every single time we are together. i really don't eat that much, despite my size. i eat what most would consider a normal amount for any guy, and perhaps even on the lower side. this kid, however, can put it away like there's no tomorrow, and he doesn't gain a single pound.   that said, both of my parents are larger. not fat by any means, just large. both sides of my family are broad chested, have huge legs, and tend to carry their weight around their middle. i am prone to that simply because of genetics.   to sum all of this up, yes, i am overweight because of my choices, as evidenced by my ability to lose nearly 20 pounds. there is certainly quite a bit i can do to get it off and keep it off. however, it is going to require a much more drastic lifestyle change than, say, someone who comes from a more slender, athletic family. i have come to realize that genetics really do play a huge role in how much you weigh, where you carry that weight, and how hard it is to get it off. more importantly than that, however, it determines how hard it is to keep it off. in my case, my lifestyle would have to completely change. taking what i learned from my nearly 4 months on weight watchers and working out at least 3-4 times a week, i know that i would have to maintain a near perfect diet and work out that much, if not more, to reach fantastic fitness. yes, that's a goal i want, but i usually come up with an excuse as to why i can't reach it.   so in response to some of your questions: i have always dealt with my weight, even at an age that i didn't really understand what was going on. i really did not eat the normal ""house and home"" type amount that most guys in puberty do; i just had that extra weight during that time! i did, at one point, try to reverse the process, and succeeded quite impressively. however, as soon as i left the absolute rigidity of that diet, even for a week, it started to come back. that in and of itself is discouraging: i mean, you feel like you're walking on a damn tightrope and the least slip is going to knock you over the edge. dealing with that is exhausting, and you have to be be willing to put 200% into your goals. yes, i am unhappy with my current weight, but only because i don't like how i feel. i don't even look that fat, necessarily. i actually have quite a bit of muscle mass, and carry my weight in places not immediately visible. that being said however, it's about how i feel. i feel like i'm fat, and i feel like everyone sees that.   to answer another question: i am indeed trying to change it, and this thread is actually pretty interesting to come up today. i say that because i actually started trying to lose weight again this week; i have been trying a diet plan and working out. i have slipped up on the diet plan a few times this week, and i seem to be having a hard time staying focused. i just started a new job, so i feel like that has something to do with it.   first off, i will say that this is a great question. however, i would say to be careful in judging, and not only because i am overweight! i am not at all offended by this and, quite honestly, wouldn't be offended if you asked me in person. i joke about my size all the time because, although i don't like it, i am still very confident in who i am as a person. the friends i'm around don't mind it, and love me anyway, so at the end of the day who cares how i really look? they aren't all bad. now, there are honestly some people even i can look at and know that they are royally screwing themselves over every single day. they eat constantly, eat crappy food, and never move unless it's to get more food. i actually know people like that. i don't judge those people: i pity them. it breaks my heart to see them so helpless.   i think obesity and, heck, overeating in general is an epidemic that needs to be dealt with in the same way we deal with alcoholism. they are both about the abuse of a substance that is ultimately ruining their life. i know a man that i love like a brother that weighs over 400 pounds. he has a wife and two children, and he can barely bend over to tie his shoe. i worry about him because i know he probably won't live to a ripe old age.   so what if we treated overeating the same way? i know there are many places that do this, and i can't commend them highly enough. as i said for me, i know that is is a lifestyle change. this is not just about what food you eat or how much you exercise: it's about how you live your life on a day to day, and truthfully, even an hourly basis. i have succeeded, and i have failed. however, because i have seen both sides i look at both differently having gained my weight back up to 200 pounds, i am more than ready to drop it again. i hate the psychological aspect of it more than the physical.   ok, and don't be afraid to ask about this subject. if you yourself are not overweight and have been fit, do two things: 1) be sensitive. like me, there are people that lower weights and fitness come much harder to just simply because of the family you are born to. way too many people use it as a cop out and even justification, but genetics really do play some role in it. 2) you haven't had to deal with it, i assume, so talk to someone who has; it might be just what you both need. i know that talking to my ""skinnier"" friends who achieve fitness goals really encouraged me the first time, and made me feel like i could get there too.   so there, have my novel! great questions! don't be afraid to ask them. this is probably the most honest thing i have posted anywhere on my long voyage around the internet. enjoy.",1,-1,

969357,"&gt;why do you agree or disagree with this article?  i'd say i agree with most of it. i just don't really think that the storytelling 'problem' is actually a *problem*. i have no objection to people trying to tell better stories in games, but i don't think it's a *problem* if they don't.  &gt;is anita's video both true and a little off the mark?  anita's broad statement - that there is very little diversity in female body types depicted in games - is true. i have complained about it myself for years. unfortunately, anita seems to have no grasp on why this problem exists, how she, in some ways *contributes* to it, or how it doesn't just effect female characters but manifests differently in male ones. when the only tool you have is feminism, everything looks like the patriarchy.  &gt;are men not held to the same body standards as women across all media, but are not free from mockery when outside the body norm? (like homer simpson and family guy)  pretty much. it's a manifestation of the galbrush paradox - laughing at the failings (percieved or otherwise) of men is usually seen as acceptable, laughing at the failings of women is usually seen as rude, chauvinistic, misogynistic, etc. anita complains about fat princess being a joke, then acts like obese, perpetually drunk gragas isn't every bit as much as one. she shows roadhog as an example of male body diversity, totally ignoring that the comically fat guy is literally styled and named after *pig*. i've seen accidents with laser cutters produce smaller blind spots than the one that obscures such double standards from anita's vision.  &gt;why is there not much difference in the body types of the call of duty protagonists, nathan drake, and the gta5 protagonists?  1. thematically,  it's a body type that conveys 'physically capable but not a not a superhero', and all of those games attempt to convey a sense of realism. 2. technically, if everyone's got the same proportions, it's less work to model and animate them all, and in the case of cod, which is centered around multiplayer, different body types pose a gameplay problem in that the the most competitive player model instantly becomes the smallest, skinniest one because it's the easiest one to keep in visual cover, even if the hitboxes are the same.  &gt;why do we rarely see male characters with blond hair? should we see more of that?  cross culturally, all around the world, darker features are associated with masculinity, and lighter ones with femininity. 'tall dark and handsome' is a real thing and it's biologically burned into people's brains all the world over to see it as a masculine ideal. a lot of the time when you see blond haired males, they're the bad guys - and not just when they're pure aryan nazis. hell, at the end of metal gear solid, liquid snake goes on a (very kojima-esque) monologue in which he basically blames his blonde hair for making him a bad guy, complaining that solid snake got all the dominant genes and he got the recessive ones, and because of that, he was cast aside.   as for 'should we see more of that?', i'm going to go full shitlord and say that i don't think blonde haired men are quite as self-absorbed and thin-skinned as slightly chubby humanities-studying women are.  &gt;is it true that ""across all entertainment mediums general ideas of whatâ€™s attractive and what isnâ€™t are enforced, largely because that (at least theoretically) sells"" ?  i'd say so.  &gt;is it true that ""video games need better characters in general. of course video game characters often fall into either very narrow ideas of attractiveness (slender women, tough men) or become jokes outside that norm: video game stories tend to be very shallow""?  it's true if you *want* video games to be about *stories*, but ultimately, video games are not stories - they are games, and they are ill-suited to most the storytelling methods of print of and film, and few people, 'pop culture critics' in particular seem to understand that you cannot simply write a story and shove it into a good game, or make a game and shove a good story into it. it just is not that simple, and yet critics are there, full of complaints, and void of any useful suggestions.  &gt;would there be any real point in making croft more plain looking? or more rotund?   well, croft has *already* been made more plain looking. (side not: the original was not outrageously busty - she had an outrageously small waist that made her bust appear larger in proportion. her bust size is merely above average, and has remained mostly constant throughout) she was made more plain for no other reason than that apparently being what's 'in' now, because 90's riot grrl feminism is now called 'adolescent male fantasy'. all aboard the feminist treadmill.  &gt;is the reason we donâ€™t have many video games that cast men or women like john goodman or kathy bates in the leading roles, because video games are so often stories about action and violence?  that's certainly part of the reason, but let's also bear in mind that most video games have you assuming the role of someone else, and usually, that someone else is someone you're supposed to want to be, for whatever reason. very, *very* people want to be fat - and i'm not saying that in a /r/fatpeoplehate kind of way, i'm saying that fat is almost always something people accumulate involuntarily or without paying attention to. almost nobody is ordering supersize mcdonalds every afternoon, rushing home to weigh themselves and getting excited about gaining another pound. almost nobody has the *aspiration* to some day become fat, or fatter. it happens, but it's a vanishingly small percentage of the population. being indifferent to gaining weight is not the same as actively aspiring to it, and escapist wish fulfilment is the bread and butter of most videogames. there's little market for wishes so few people have.  &gt;why hasn't the industry as a whole hasnâ€™t made video game equivalents to the big lebowski or misery?  you mean, in the context of 'fat person in leading role whose weight isn't a joke'? like... *mario*?  &gt;would simply having more female protagonists that are in the same age bracket as joel from the last of us would be a great step? (like carol from the walking dead)  sure, why not? honestly though, physically capable 50 year old women don't look much less attractive (read: triggering) than their 21 year old counterparts, because physically capable people are almost always attractive, because that's what we're biologically programmed to be attracted to. so once we've got grandma badass running around killing demons, excpect feminists to complain about unrealistic beauty standards for older women. *they will never be pleased*.  &gt;is kain correct to think nobody playing games is against this sort of thing?   'nobody' is an absolute and therefore obviously wrong on a literal level, but broadly speaking, yes, he is correct. sigourney weaver was one of the oldest members of the main cast in aliens (not certain, but i think only bishop is played by an older actor), and i don't know any gamer who doesn't think that movie rocks. ripley was a fucking badass and everyone loved her.  &gt;is the reason we don't have it that the industry as a whole has very little incentive to break out of what sells? if so, how do we give it an incentive to do that?  chance are, focus groups are the reason you don't have it. they get a batch of plebs from &lt;target demographic&gt;, show them a bunch of designs and ask what they thought. now, remember what i said about how nobody *aspires* to be fat? yeah. that's why. it's also why you only typically see the kind of variety we're talking about in games with large numbers of playable characters. they can afford to spread their shots further apart. most aaa games, though, are designed by a committee with a market research spreadsheet that was written up from responses in those focus groups.  &gt;is it true that ""it becomes a little thornier when you get into heavier set body types, because many of these games feature characters of enormous athleticism""?  i'm not entirely sure what he's getting at here. is he criticizing people who refuse to accept that human beings who actually do the kinds of things depicted in video games are in great shape simply through the act of what they're doing? that's a valid criticism in my book, but as i'm not the person it applies to, i find it hard to be certain.  &gt;is it true that sarkeesian focuses too much on how this impacts women, and not enough on how it impacts people in general, men and women alike? does the constant pop culture image of the muscular, impossibly slender, tough badass male archetype has exactly the same impact on boys and men?  it is true, and sarkeesian's feminist tunnel vision is her single biggest problem. she is generally blind to anything and everything that falls outside of feminist media criticism. she seems to have zero understanding or interest beyond that tiny, narrow strip of the spectrum.  &gt;is part of the problem also in us, in what we want and what we demand and what we keep buying? if so, how do we change what enough of us demand and buy so that we stop being a problem?  the most popular stuff is always shit. aaa will always be shit. lowest common denominator will always bring in the biggest bucks. that's why a piece of shit like twilight can go on to make untold mountains of cash, and a masterpiece like let the right one in, with the same fucking premise, released at the same time, can go on to make next to nothing.  you're always going to sell more cheap, shitty coffee than you are going to sell rich, high quality coffee. filthy casuals are always the bigger market.  the sales of games will be determined by masses of people who've never read a word of any of this drama or given it a second thought.",1,-1,0

752054,"how about the changes in how we measure ""obesity""? when i was younger, it was height/weight tables, eventually replaced by the equally unfair bmi (body-mass index) by the cdc.  there's a serious flaw in assuming that a given person is obese simply because the ratio between their height and weight doesn't compare favorably to a statistical average. for instance, i'm currently 6'1"" and somewhere around 300lbs, giving me a bmi of about 39. ok, i'm fat, and i'll admit it.  however, i have a fairly large build to begin with and most people don't think i weigh that much when i tell them. since i reached my current height, the lightest i've been since the end of puberty was 215 lbs. at the time, i wore size 34 pants and was in rather good shape, hitting the gym at least 3-4 times a week, cycling 10 miles a day before work and rollerblading many miles on the weekends.  however, putting those numbers in to a bmi calculator still says i was overweight then. in a pool, i would sink like a rock. using a flotation tank, i was 19% fat at the time. but my bmi would have worked out to 28, which is the high side of overweight and bordering on obesity. at that point, sure i still had fat to lose, but since fat weighs more than muscle, i would likely have gained weight with increasing my activity level. gaining weight would have increased my bmi, pushing me closer to being defined as ""obese"". while i was certainly larger than your stereotypical ""skinny guy"", i was in good shape but physically larger than my peers. i could out skate and out ride my ""thinner"" counterparts, but by the numbers, i was still close to ""obese"".   bmi does not take into account body size, skeletal size or muscle mass, it simply assumes that your body has a simple ratio of fat to lean mass to height and is really no different than those old tables from the 70's and 80's.  to be considered ""normal"", i would have to weigh about 185, and that's just not physically possible given my skeletal size.   let's use a pro football player as an example. i'll use ladanian tomlinson from the sd chargers. his nfl stats say that he's currently 5'10 and 221 lbs. according to the bmi calculator, he scores a 30.1, with 30 being the cutoff by the cdc to be considered 'obese'. would you call lt obese? hardly, and he's not really considered big by nfl standards. how about randy moss from the patriots? he's 6'4"" and about the same weight as lt, but he calculates out to an overweight bmi of 25.6. even tom brady comes out as overweight by this standard (he's the same height as moss, but 15 lbs heavier). are these guys some serious heifers and part of the two-thirds of adults mentioned in the article?  try the numbers for yourself at:  http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.htm.   is america really becoming more obese, or is the cdc's interpretation of obesity faulty? without a realistic method of calculating obesity that encompasses different body types and structures, you can't really say for sure. the standards for measuring obesity have changed, how can you compare them accurately to data from 30 years ago?",1,0,0

i am attracted to women that can hike a few miles because i love hiking, o m g, i can't believe how much i shame fat people.   sorry, but *come on*. i am not saying and have not said that fat people should be shamed. they *can* be desired as overweight people. of course they can! but when i see these campaigns that tell me i *have* to desire them? that they are some ideal version of humanity? no. i *don't* have to desire them anymore than they have to appeal to me.   &gt;i'm an a-cup. which is pretty small tits. some people don't like that. some people do. everybody likes different things. you have every right not to be attracted to me, and i can't force you to say that you like a-cups. but you also don't have the right to walk up to me and tell me that girls with a-cups shouldn't be in movies or porn and that they gross you out and that it isn't ok for me to look like that.  people keep saying ""you can't walk up to me and...""  well, duh. only an asshole would say something mean to another person, a *random stranger*, about their appearance. of course i don't have a right to (well i do under the freedom of speech bit, but i never would because i'm not an enormous asshole on two legs wandering around spraying insults at anyone i can). this is avoiding the argument. again, *no one is saying it's okay to walk up to strangers and yell ""heeeeeeey, fatty fatty fat-fat! how's it being fat?!""*   that's obviously horrible and anyone who does anything like that, be it making fun of weight, height, hair, boobs, skin color, etc., is an asshole. clearly! that much is obvious.   &gt;i think australia is wrong. the fact that they made a law that says i can't be in porn isn't ok to me, because it just encourages body shame.  i completely agree. all types of people are attracted to all types of other people/thing/etc. (not comparing you to a ""thing""-i personally don't care about breast size and think it's dumb to refuse to date a girl over something that shallow). and i know there are people who aren't attracted to skinny people *and that's fine*. again, all i'm saying is that encouraging obesity is a *bad thing*, objectively, because obesity is unhealthy and causes mental and physical illnesses, and also death. so yeah. that's *all i'm saying.* we should not say ""you are totally fine the way you are,"" we should say ""you are an awesome person, an incredible part of society,"" if they are. sure. but if they ask if they're overweight? if they ask if they need to lose weight? yeeeeeees. lose weight. i'll help you. i'll take you to the gym with me. i'll help you with your diet. you'll feel *amazing* afterward.   if your friend was a drug addict, you'd stage an intervention. but if your friend is obese and asks if they are fat, you say ""oh nooooo, honey, you're beautiful.""   why?  it makes no sense. help people by being honest or lie and say they aren't what they're afraid they are, what they *know* they are.   &gt;everyone deserves love and everyone wants to be attractive. and yes, overweight people are considered attractive to as high of a percentage as skinny people. but there are people who aren't attracted to skinny people.  hahahahaha what? no, everyone does *not* deserve love. there are plenty of horrible, awful people in the world who will never be loved for good reason. are there amazing, wonderful people who have bad luck and don't get loved? of course. but no, not everyone *deserves* to be loved and be attractive. being loved means you find someone who sees things in you of value, someone who likes what they see. it's earned, not given. being attractive is the same. a 450 lb. 5'2"" woman who says she ""deserves"" my attraction is going to be disappointed. i don't have to be attracted to anyone i don't want to and i damn sure don't have to *love* anyone i don't want to, and yes, the world is full of bastards and assholes who deserve neither attraction or love.   i don't understand how you can possibly think love or attraction are entitlements, things that just *are.* how would they be special *at all* if everyone had them just *because*?   that's ridiculous.   &gt;i think instead of encouraging skinniness or fatness, we should just encourage healthiness. for some people that will result in weight loss, and for some people that will result in weight gain.  that would be great! so it would be equally fair for a skinny person to be told by a friend ""yeah, you should eat more and hit the gym!"" as it would be for a fat person to be told ""yeah, you should eat less and hit they gym!""   sounds good. but if everyone is beautiful and attractive and deserving of love in every way already, why should they bother to change?  &gt;because seriously, half of hollywood is underweight. and nobody seems to have a problem with that.  i do. anorexia and general underweightness is ridiculously unhealthy and unattractive, and i feel bad for those actresses whose bones are sticking through their skin.   but here's a puzzler--  1/2 of hollywood is underweight, and nobody cares. you see that as bad.   2/3rds or more of america is overweight or obese, and i care, and you see that as bad.   wanna explain why one is bad and the other is ""beautiful and deserving of love?""   because i'm having a hard time here.",1,−1,0

851030,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,

(45% as people say, for gb10 and toan).   i use bella and vero 6*, while shannon and bernard 5*. the last member is usually darion just for the passive, or i may change it out for any dot monster/rep. i rather not use teshar as a gb10's 5th member since he dies so easily. the 5th member of the team isn't really necessary to complete gb10, but it's like an insurance/speeds up the run. if you're looking for consistency, use another debuffer/healer. make sure to max skill up shannon/bernard and bella (at least max the heal).  edit:  looked at your monsters.  bella's hp should be okay, if you 6* him, but his def and accuracy is pretty low. the speed is decent for gb10 runs i guess.  teshar's hp is low, but i guess that's normal. his cr and cd isn't really good, but it's a fatal set. i think working on your kona would be better for consistency.  vero's hp is fine for a 5*, but that def is low. speed is okay, and accuracy is at borderline okay.  bernard's hp is fine, but again, that defense is pretty low. the thing about bernard is that his def is pretty high, so maybe you would wanna put in some def% instead of only hp. his accuracy is extremely low, but some people say bernard doesn't need high accuracy since his 2nd skill has high chance to land. i rather not risk it and put some accuracy on him. maybe change his ene runes into shield to help your team to take 1 hit.  your shannon needs a lot of work. hp, speed, defense too low. sacrifice that accuracy slot 6 for a hp rune, with acc and speed substats should be better. despair/ene works on shannon, as long as you maintain around 40-45% accuracy. despair helps you survive the stages, but if you have a shield rune on bernard, i don't think you have to use despair on shannon. change her runes to swift/ene until you get some decent despair runes with hp, speed and accuracy subs. since shannon doesn't have great base hp, you can substitute one of the hp runes with a def% with hp substats.  good luck",0,,
181177,"i'll jump in on this as someone who is obese. yes, i'm fat. some darlings out there may prefer heffer, porker, fatty, fat-ass, whatever... yes, i carry weight. probably about 100 pounds of it.  is it unhealthy? i don't think you need to tell anyone in the world who is overweight that it's unhealthy. we know. we're exceptionally aware of this. thankfully we have an army of armchair doctors out there who ensure we know day-in and day-out just how unhealthy it is. i certainly know that it is. we know the studies, we know what medical science says.  here's the point that i think you and most people out there who like to bring up, quote ""studies that find statistically significant correlation between obesity and adverse effects on cardiovascular health"", completely miss: the vast majority of us didn't choose to be this way. except for a very select few people out there, the majority of overweight people never woke up one morning all skinny and said ""you know what, i want to be fat!"" and started pigging out.  the truth of the situation is there are wide varieties of causes for obesity. some controllable, some only mildly controllable, and some nearly unavoidable. unlike cigarette smoking, which is literally something people actively choose to do, obesity is closely related to a very basic activity to sustain life: consumption of calories and nutrients. add that into a society which is built up and around the absolutely worst sources of calories and nutrients known to human kind, careers which lock humans inside of rooms behind a desk for long periods of time with no movement, cities and infrastructure which is entirely built for driving instead of walking or biking, pollution which contributes to asthma and respiratory illnesses, and the saturation of sugar, specifically sourced from high fructose corn syrup (because the dinguses in congress decided we should over-subsudize the corn industry and put that shit everywhere), well let's just say if you're already overweight it becomes a huge problem to stop being overweight.  and the solution isn't just a snap of the ol' fingers either. oh, for sure, if i had my druthers, i'd snap my fingers and be lean and swol with pecks that can dance. but life didn't work that way. instead of a beer belly, i got a keg. two if you count the ass.  and i used to be heavier. i went through surgery and mutilated my innards to not make my presence so horrible to the people around me, knowing full well my mere existence on this planet was putting undue stress on someone else. and it worked, kind of. i've dropped significant weight. i'm still overweight and working on maintaining my lower, smaller self. but some months i look at the scale and i've slid back up. not wanting to put any poor skinny people in a tight spot, i work harder.  it might be shocking to some to learn that really the only way someone of size can lose weight is through a very painful process. no, i'm not talking about surgery, although that does include pain that i never want to go through again... ever. i'm talking a process that is mentally painful. you might think that a medically controlled 900 kcal diet doesn't sound like a bad thing. until you realize what it does to the mind. such a diet has to be carefully monitored for nutrient deficiency. your food is pre-planned, shakes, maybe a bar, a soup that tastes something what i imagine horse piss to taste like. this is on top of sugar withdrawals. lets just say in the diet i had to complete to become a candidate for surgery, i found a new appreciation for my brothers-and-sisters who have drug problems. people grossly underestimate the addictive power of sugar sources.  the saddest part about it all is that it could have been corrected with a lot less effort a long, long time ago. but it didn't. pe teachers laughed when my asthma prevented me from breathing and insisted ""if i only ran the mile, i'd be fine"". yeah, i like to breathe thank you. peers could have not taunted me for being slightly overweight and ostracizing me from all social activities and sport which would have more than likely allowed me to keep my size down. depression is a major contributor to obesity, folks... being an asshole to someone only makes the problem worse. but, hey, i guess it's far too hard to be a decent human being. kick'em while they're down, that'll show 'em!  the whole point of this rant? the point is you're not going to ever tell anyone who is overweight something they don't already know. ever. i hate to say this, but it's like being a white person and telling a black person all about being black... they're kind of the experts, they know it, they live it. so feeling it necessary to point out the studies, the science... you're not doing anything helpful. you're actually doing the opposite. that, my friend, is why talking about the science is still ""fat hate"". we already fucking know the science. we're fucking living it. we get it from the doctor every time we go in to see if we're healthy and see if we can maybe get some help overcoming an enormous challenge. but, all too often, we don't. we get the usual ""eat less, exercise more"" line. well, no shit doc... i ain't fucking stupid.  it took me going into the nutritional medicine specialists to actually get some real help, and to do that i had to have that uber awesome sweet corporate medical plan. one that would actually pay for that assistance. i still had to pay $8,000 of my own money toward the surgery.  if you want to help people not be overweight? try treating them like human beings, first and foremost. being just a decent human who treats someone else like an actual person and not as this gross monstrosity, or as stupid and needing to be educated, does a great deal toward people losing weight. the path to weight loss is a long one, probably one of the most grueling processes any human being should ever go through. it is mental and physical torture, especially if you're not otherwise healthy. but the first step of the journey is actually self-acceptance. breaking the cycle of seeing one's self as a complete and abject failure by existing, and learning to accept who they are is an important first step. second, is deciding on their own that they're ready for a change and getting a shit ton of support. and no, i'm not just talking about good luck sayings and pats on the back. i'm talking support, everything from watching one's own eating habits around them, not shaming them from falling off the wagon, to including them in activities that help create a healthier lifestyle. you know, real genuine support. you can't help someone lose weight if your idea of eating around them is to take a large meat lovers, fold the bitch in half, and eat it like a taco. i mean, cool if you have the metabolism to do that and still be rail thin, but you're going to become the worlds largest hypocrite in about 30 seconds of doing so, totally removing all credibility (and contributing to their psychological torture).",1,1,

620277,"the sight of the norn queen was something that uriel would never forget for as long as he lived. the creature was massive, easily the size of a battle titan, its bulk filling the chamber with countless means of producing its monstrous offspring. a vast, mucus-ribbed tube hung from the walls, pulsing with disgusting motion and dripping great swathes of egg sacs to a slime filled pool where nurse organisms carried them away in great, scooped pincers.  huge pools of protoplasmic ooze bubbled and burst with motion as screeching infant beasts were drooled from its surface along bony chutes to begin growing almost as soon as they hit the ground. thousands of gelatinous incubation larvae hung from resinous mucus on the great arched ceiling, supported on huge ribs of bone, each thicker than the columns in the temple of correction on macragge. stinking fluids coated the floor and foetid steam gusted from millions of tiny orifices in the walls. ropes of dripping intestine and nutrients pumped viscous fluids into the belly of the norn queen, its vast, bloated head fused with the ribbed ceiling of the chamber. six-legged creatures that resembled fat spiders crawled all over its body, cleaning, feeding and ministering to their queen. huge javelin-like spines protruded from her bony carapace, each dripping with hissing poisons.  the norn queen itself was as much a part of the bio-ship as an individual creature. warrior organisms patrolled the chamber, snapping their glossy claws at any of the slave-beasts that approached too near the queen. bigger than the largest tyranid warrior uriel had ever seen, these warrior beasts were bred for once purpose and one purpose alone - to defend their queen to the death.  'how do we proceed?' asked damias.  'with this.' said uriel, unholstering the weapon kryptman had given him. it was the silvered pistol with which the servitor had administered the gene-poison to the lictor, but with an added refinement. fitted atop the barrel was a long, metallic tube, its blue-steel sheen subtly crystalline. at the end of the tube was an offset ring of nine small spines that slotted over the barrel of kryptman's pistol. it was always distasteful to use the weapons of the xeno, but inquisitor kryptman had assured him that hrud fusil technology was simply a symbiosis of melta and plasma technology. a product of vile alien heresy to be sure, but one that, in this case, would prove useful in administering the gene-poison.  'what is it?' asked pelantar.  he slid the gun back into its ill-fitting holster and said, 'it is the means by which we can end this. just get me to the hivequeen.' uriel rose to his feet and said, 'but first we need to fight our way in, and we'll have to do it the old-fashioned way, with flesh, blood and steel.'  the deathwatch followed their captain as he marched into the norn queen's chamber, pasanius beside him, henghast on his left and damias on his right, pelantar covering them with his heavy bolter.  almost immediately, a warning screech sounded from one of the nurse organisms and the guardian warriors spun to face the intruders. a cacophonous wailing echoed throughout the chamber, a furious beat thrashing the walls as the tyranids rushed to defend their queen.  pasanius bathed the first attackers in fire, the guardian creatures howling in anger at such destructive energies being unleashed in their queen's chambers. pelantar fired a hail of mutagenic bolts into the mass of aliens, chanting the rites of firing as he slew.  uriel ran forwards, the energised blade of his power sword cleaving through alien flesh and bone with ease. the smaller beasts fell like wheat before the scythe and though he felt the killing rage building behind his eyes, he made his peace with it, turning the taint of the bringer of darkness into a positive force. flames lit up the hellish glow of the chamber and crackling arcs of energy flared from damias's power glove as he battered his way forward. henghast howled in fury as he charged the alien creatures. pelantar's heavy bolter ripped a path through them.  uriel spun under a scything blow from a leaping beast that was more fanged maw than anything else, hacking it in two as he sensed the presence of something huge behind him. he threw himself forward, barely avoiding being sliced in two by a guardian organism.  the alien beast towered above him, larger than a carnifex, but more slender and quick. its jaw was filled with dripping fangs and its upper pair of limbs ended in flashing talons that slashed for his head. uriel rolled aside as they gouged the floor and slashed his sword at its legs.  the creature bounded over his blow, smashing its claws against his armour. ceramite parted under the blow and blood washed down his side before the larraman cells halted the flow. pain-suppressors pumped into his body and he staggered as the beast struck him again. he flew through the air, landing on the edge of a bubbling pool of stinking ichor. whipping tentacles burst from the pool and wrapped around his midriff.  uriel cried out and slashed his sword through them, rolling to the base of the pool.  the guardian organism bounded across to him, its hooves throwing up gouts of stinking fluids. uriel rolled desperately, pushing himself to his knees and raising his sword to block just as the claws hammered down towards him. sparks flew and he grunted as he held the strength of the beast at bay.  he rolled beneath the claws, releasing his block and thrust his sword upwards into the creature's groin. it howled and collapsed to one knee, driving the blade deeper into its flesh.  uriel ripped the weapon clear and hacked it through the monster's midsection. it thrashed as it died, insectile creatures swarming over its corpse to devour it as food for their queen. uriel staggered towards his target as pasanius joined him. his sword was bloody and the armour of his silvered arm was missing.  brother damias fought with skill and cunning, his power fist reaping a bloody tally in the furious battle. henghast killed with all the ferocity he and his chapter were famed for as pelantar sprayed shells throughout the chamber, bursting egg sacs and perforating the gristly tube that snaked across the chamber walls.  three warrior organisms blocked their path, each as deadly as the one uriel had killed.  damias and henghast fought their way towards the two ultramarines.  'the old fashioned way.' he breathed. 'straight through them, eh? pasanius, henghast and i will hold them, you get to the queen!'  uriel nodded and the four space marines raced towards the guardian beasts.  pelantar saw what they intended and fired a carefully aimed blast towards the tyranids. two reeled from the fusillade, their carapaces no match for the blessed ammunition of the deathwatch.  but in doing so, he neglected his own defence for a fraction of a second.  and that was all his foes needed.  with a snap of claws, the heavy bolter was smashed apart and pelantar was lifted from his feet in a massive set of powerful talons. he fought with every last bit of strength, punching bloody holes in the beast's carapace, but it was too late. with a bellowing roar, the beast ripped pelantar in two, tossing the shorn halves away for the scavenger beasts to feed on. damias and pasanius attacked while the beasts pelantar had given his life to wound still staggered from his shells. one burned in the flames as damias punched through the other's carapace with the lethal energies of his power fist. henghast joined pasanius in attacking the burning monster.  uriel ran for the bloated belly of the norn queen, his sword raised to strike down the final beast between him and his goal. its claws snapped shut and uriel swept his sword through them. he leapt to meet the creature, ducking inside its guard as it flailed its razored claws at him, slashing its own flesh to ruin.  uriel pulled himself up the creature's body, its bony exo-skeleton providing ready-made handholds. the creature thrashed as it sought to dislodge him, hacking itself bloody as its claws tried to pluck him from its body. secondary jaws punched down through his breastplate, biting a fist-sized chunk of flesh from his chest and tearing free a portion of his pectoral muscle.  uriel roared in pain, but kept his grip on the beast's ribs. he pulled himself to the armoured plates of its shoulders and drove his sword into its neck. black blood spurted and the beast screeched in agony as it died. the monster's death spasm wrenched the sword from his grip.  before it collapsed, uriel vaulted from its shoulders onto the glistening walls of the chamber, his fingers closing on the hardened flesh of the norn queen's hide. hordes of me scavenger organisms closed on him as he climbed, biting and clawing him. they clambered all over him, even squeezing inside his armour, their weight alone mistereatening to prise him loose.  despite the pain-suppressors, his chest was bamed in agony. he batted clear the scavengers long enough to draw kryptman's pistol and press it against the belly of the norn queen.  feeling his grip on the queen's flesh sliding free, he pulled the trigger.  he felt a blast of unimaginable heat as the hrud mechanism activated, lancing a column of fire, hotter that the heart of a star, through the thick flesh of the norn queen. a fraction of a second later the pistol bucked in his hand as the shell containing the gene-poison fired into its body.  - warriors of ultramar",0,,

449712,"before we consider rise of sentience in any species, we should try to figure out which factors guided sentience from simple lemur like primates to the present state, in humans.  we can assume that desperation must have led primates away from arboreal ecosystems. when shorter toes, flat feet and weaker upper body muscles gave way to a highly imbalanced body with a heavy head, characteristics which otherwise would be a disadavantage. it must have arisen in times of shortage of food, when early hominids needed to pursue prey and evade predators, on foot, for hours, using nothing but there own body and intelligence.  this must have also been the phase our predisposition towards mathematics must have arisen. visualising large areas, plotting several different paths between two points, choosing one considering various factors. and it must have been further accelerated if homonids started attacking/hunting each other which doesnt seems to be unlikely, considering how diverse they were.  physical characteristics of frogs are the morphology of their webbed limbs, their torso, neck. maybe their eyes as well. so conditions around them need to change, in a manner in which it would be an understatement to call it dramatic, encouraging problem solving while not changing their shape.   to define the problem even further: frogs would need to become bigger in size. maybe no where near human levels, but still atleast 3-3.5 feet, to house and maintain a bigger brain, a ""snapping"" jaw, which is more suited to delivering one killing blow instead of biting rapidly, like ours or other species of carnivora, which gives it its unique arrow shape. their changing situation would still necessitate hopping.  situation: all rocky objects under go a process called ""differentiation"". in this process, substances of heavier density closer to the centre of gravity, and lighter substances are pushed away from it. that is why we have relatively lrge amount of silicon on earth's crust even though its not as abundant in the universe, simplye because there was a lower amount of silicon present, all of it got pushed to surface.  now most of earths iron and other heavier substances are in the core. but imagine if there is a large nodule, primarily of radiactive elements, still making its way to the core. veins emmanting from this nodule poke on the ocean floor, and are percived to be untapped uranium mines.   suddenly, this nodule meets another nodule and goes critical. it heats up magma flow, leading to supervalcno burst in indonesia. this leads to water perforating to nodule, issuing forth massive amounts of extremely energetic lava, driven by steam. these lava deposits, due to the energetic explosion, remain primarily concentrated in one direction instead of like an explosion, creating strips of land masses across the indian ocean, not wider than a kilometer at a time, farthest point crossing into the south atlantic ocean. several more strips of land are created as the explosive fission is sustained for a few hundred years, sustaining the supervolcano.  mass extinction ensues in this age. a combination of a nuclear winter and global warming exacts the planet for some centuries.  slowly, life starts to recover, over the nex thousand years. frogs, capable of surviving as long as their eggs have a bit of moisture, survive in pockets across south america. slowly life starts reclaiming ""stripes"", the new continent.  this new continent is unique in a way that most of the rock formations are of oceanic basalts, infused with  extremely hard crystals. erosion will take its toll in few hundred million years, but not any time soon.  another unqiue feature is that there isnt a great degree of variation in elevation across the stripes. highest elevation reaches upto 50-80 meters, not more.  the rest of the land mass is reclaimed during high tide. thus it gives rise to a gigantic continent, whose ecosystem is primarily tidal in nature. with upto 90% of its surface going under the ocean during them.  frogs are continuosly brough to these elevations by forces of nature. swept away batches of tadpoles, eggs, and sometimes larger adult populations.   many populations eventually die off. soon one arises which learns to keep track of the day. go out, hunt, return. leaping from rock formations, squad by squad. they soon thrive, exploiting food source and energy never present to a species before. they become leaner, with no need to store much energy in the form of fat, because of availibility of food. their hind legs become longer, stronger. their skin becomes thicker, tougher. characteristics like leaping, biting power, larger eyes, better vocalisation for squad regulation arises. but most importantly, the basic characteristics behind developing higher mathematical capabilities, and social coordination arise as well.  soon, however, ocean starts to claim the lands. rocky formations are claimed by ocean, decimating it to sand, sweeping them away. the land inundated by tides shrinking, so do the rock formations that kept the frog ""apes"" safe. they start building nests for their eggs, out of remains of their prey, shells and bones, biting it into thick paste, and letting it harden in the sun. some variants could even float in water. they accidentally discover building dams through this method.  they thrive a bit longer. however, one powerful storm sweeps away such a dam-nest colony of a rock formation. for days they remain drifting on the ocean, grabbing what little they could catch. sometimes even resorting to eating some of their eggs and tadpoles. but then: land.  this new land is different from their home. the ground gives way to their legs when they leap. there are too many sea weeds, except they can stand in their own, are hard....and not on sea but land.  through frog-ape prodigy, or by a fluke, they discover they can shape their bone past into other shapes. the prodigy learns to make a helm like structure, sharp along its arrow head. it could cut down a land-weed(a tree) in a single blow. and other frog-apes as well.  conquest follows, frog-people spread like a wild wire. several variants of the frog paste a re discovered, by combining it various other materials. tools, basic buildings. sometimes, really hard and old frog helm can strike a rock to create sparks. frog-promotheus is born.  thousand years later, frog people return to their homeland, and create first natural park.",0,,

437915,"the only one that is viable in clan wars is the maus, but if you don't expect to play tier 10 cw any time soon, then it really comes down to personal preference. rather than deciding for you, i'll tell you a bit about each of the vehicles, so you can decide for yourself. i'll go from heaviest to lightest: maus, e 100, pz.kpfw. vii. they have similar playstyles, and really only significantly differ in armor (where their weakspots are) and firepower.  if this wall of text is too much, there's a summary at the bottom.  maus ----  the heaviest tank ever built at 189 tons, this superheavy behemoth lives up to its real life reputation. sporting incredibly thick armor all around, this tank has the largest health pool in the game, at an incredible 3000 hitpoints. it pays for it in mobility - despite an enormous 1750hp engine, this thing has low acceleration, very slow traverse, and a top speed of only 20 km/h (though it also gets a great reverse speed of 15 km/h).  the armor is tough, but not invincible. the side hull and turret armor are fantastic, allowing you to angle at incredible angles; in particular, it is very difficult to track and penetrate this tank from an angle, even with gold. the lower front plate, at ~240mm thick against ap, is vulnerable to silver rounds, but is thankfully very small and easy to hide. the upper front plate is actually only ~305mm effective against ap, making it vulnerable to gold, but only tds will ever shoot at it. the main weakspot is the turret cheeks - at 260mm thick, this can be easily penned with gold, and it means that every time you shoot at an enemy, they can pen you. on the other hand, if you're angling correctly, that's the *only time* they can pen you, allowing you to control engagements.  the firepower is solid. a large 128mm gun offers 490 damage per shot, which at this tier is a bit above average for a heavy tank. it has good accuracy, good aim time and incredible gun handling - when only rotating the turret, it is practically fully aimed, allowing you to snap shots in very easily. the dpm is on the low end at 2200, and the low-ish 246mm ap pen means you'll be firing lots of gold. your 311mm apcr pen is ""good enough"", and the stupidly high ammo capacity means if you're cheap, you can fire disgusting amounts of he instead, which at this caliber is reasonably effective.  e 100 ----  weighing in at a more modest 129 tons, this vehicle is quite different than the maus, sacrificing turret armor to get an enormous 15cm gun, the largest of any tier 10 heavy tank. only a handful of tds hit harder than this monster does, and with 2700hp even fewer can out-trade it. it's a bit faster, with a top speed of 30 km/h and 50% better hull traverse speeds than the maus; however, it has the same poor acceleration.  the hull armor is a little bit worse, but the turret armor is a different story. the lower plate is much larger on this vehicle, and at only ~225mm effective against ap is weak to every tier 10 silver round it sees (and even those found on lower tier vehicles); however, the upper plate at ~350mm effective against ap is not weak to tier 10 tds. the side hull is still quite strong, although this time it is weak to being detracked and penned through the front drive wheel. the turret is where things start to fall apart - the sides are thinner, and the front is big and flat, ~280mm effective against ap but very vulnerable to standard 330mm pen heat. angling isn't enough to protect this turret - you'll have to hide most of it entirely in order to avoid damage.  the gun makes up for this. with a massive 750dmg per shot, this tank hits very hard. on paper it is rather inaccurate, and you shouldn't snipe, but in practice it's ""okay"". poor accuracy, poor aimtime, decent gun handling, and a rather low dpm of only 2250 rounds out the rest of the gun. ap pen isn't terrible, but between your poor accuracy and glacial reload time, you'll find yourself firing lots of gold. the he rounds on this are pretty nasty in a pinch, but it's very rare for that to be the best choice. this tank is often called the heat-100, because it relies on its impressive 334mm heat pen very frequently.  pz.kpfw. vii ----  the lightest of the three, at a mere 120 tons, this tank is the fastest of the trio, with a 33 km/h top speed, better hull traverse than the e 100, and very slightly better acceleration. however, it has the fewest hitpoints, at a still very respectable 2500hp. although you get 7 degrees of gun depression over most of the tank, you only get 5 degrees over the very front hull; this is easy enough to work around.  the armor is not bad, but unfortunately it's riddled with weakspots. the lower plate is enormous and only ~255mm effective against ap, but the upper plate is a very strong ~365mm effective against ap, allowing it to shrug off even many tier 10 td gold rounds. the side armor is strong... in theory. with a rear mounted turret and nice flat 160mm sides, this tank *should* be a great sidescraper, but unfortunately the hull bulges out a lot to make room for the turret, and at less than 200mm effective at most angles this is extremely weak and fairly easy to hit. the turret armor is quite different from its peers, because it's actually good frontally, with an enormous well-angled gun mantlet covering most of the turret face. you have a small cupola weakspot, but the real problem is that your gun mantlet has two invisible holes in it that are ~220mm thick, one on each side of the gun, which are easily penetrated. the effectiveness of your armor really comes down to your ability to manage the weakspots - if you can work around them, it's fantastic, but if you cannot, then you'll feel rather helpless.  the gun appears at first glance to be the same that the jagdtiger gets, but it's considerably worse. 560 alpha is nice to have at this tier, and with its decent accuracy and good gun handling it's pretty capable at connecting these rounds. the dpm is particularly bad, at only 2100, and although the ap pen is good (258mm) the apcr pen is only ""good enough"" at 315mm. this time around, you don't have a stupidly high ammo capacity, so you can't lob lots of he (not that i normally recommend it).  summary ----  the maus is the heaviest, slowest, and toughest, with the weakest but most accurate gun of the bunch (and it's not a weak gun). the e 100 has better mobility and a way harder hitting gun, but it gives up a lot of turret armor and accuracy to get it. lastly, the pz.kpfw. vii has the best mobility, firepower somewhere between its peers, and impressive armor that is largely negated by the multitudinous weakspots - still, it's much tougher than a regular heavy. the maus is for slow and careful players, who like having tons of bulk that enables them to simply push through enemy resistance... once it gets to the fight. the e 100 is not a regular superheavy, because it's only good for trading shots one-for-one, but it's damn good at it (albeit extremely expensive to run due to the heat spam). the pz.kpfw. vii has superior flexibility and an interesting armor layout that requires clever play to fully utilize, but its gun fails to do damage very quickly, and lacks the overwhelming alpha of some similar tanks.  all three vehicles require patient play, and unfortunately they also require a lot of goldspam, because you simply lack the mobility to flank enemies. they all have their counters, but as long as you play to their strengths, all three are quite rewarding to play.",0,,

(not how he got his food delivered)  --you really never were educated as a basic muslim to see flat earther jibe in this verse ~ yusuf ali â€œuntil, when he came to the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom we had provided no covering protection against the sun.â€ how you conclude â€œthis verse is unmistakably implying that the earth is flat. the first part of the verse, talks about the place of the rising sun as if there could actually be such a place on our round planet, but it's really the second part of the verse leaves no room for doubt.â€  if i sail to a western shoreline and found people living there with no trees or shade, i could say â€œâ€œi came to the rising of the sun, and found it rising on a people for whom had provided no covering protection against the sun.â€ how you derive flat earth from this is a stretch of your own imagination and not taken by any muslims.  ----no time for more now--- refer to #1 arguing with non muslims. this is a moderate waste of time cause your obviously not serious about your agama. you donâ€™t write about takdir, ibadah, or even hadeethâ€™s --hanging your dingly bright trinket arguments like christmas ornaments on a skeletal tree which represents the amount of knowledge you have regarding the true islamic knowledge corpus.  its not fair to our viewers.  ragging over our texts like a christian who may digest a bible at literary face value (where as we have written semantic meaning, auditory inflections, and have research analysis) sugar bomb gulping scripture like reading a cereal box is obviously frowned upon by us as it denigrates deeper meanings, reflections, subtexts and massive secondary hadeeth contexts â€“ those being the bones of contention and human corruption. thatâ€™s why veracity of scripture is so hard core and not gobbled up blindly, contrary to what you might hear. thinking is a must.  you atheists are fun questioners and definitely better than those who blindly follow, even those in religion as deaf and dumb, they are the worst hypocrites as you must know what you digest and why.    good luck with that â€˜forever aloneâ€™ finality you buy into. itâ€™s so limited and narrow a road you make for yourselves planning on going nowhere in your grave. what a rude surprise in reality spectrum awaits you. best be thankful for what life you have to be tested with now, good or bad- as this temporal world &amp; life we have is just one big exam.",0,,

519181,"i read a lot of different genres, but the one i've been reading the most these past 2 years or so have been romance. it's not a big deal at all if you just read romance! many people don't read at all!  but if you want to start reading more of other genres, maybe start with some books that have good romantic subplots or plot lines that you're more into.  for example, i'm real big into villains, vampires and enemies to lovers, so i like branching out and reading books with interesting villains such as interview with the vampire, picture of dorian gray, ladder to the sky, etc.  ya fantasy can be good because they often have romantic plots without it being the main thing.  you can also try romance-adjacent works. works that feature a love story but aren't really romances. like wuthering heights or even something like mexican gothic which has a fun romantic subplot but isn't the main story. also try works such as jane eyre or pride and prejudice for a more ""high brow"" conversation-starter classic, but still more of a romance.  that's how i started reading more outside the romance genre. then when i appreciated those kinds of books i could slowly get into more high-brow books and intense classics or philosophical works.",0,,
970405,"elijah was always eager to please.  as valerie stepped towards the shower she put a little bit extra into her walk before slipping through the curtains with a last grin at elijah.  ""come and get me~"" she teased.  elijah, ever the pragmatist, drew his wand. ""*auferte vestimenta,*"" he commanded, and with a flick, the tearaway shirt and jeans he'd intended to use in an entirely different manner flew off his back and legs.  compared to his lover, elijah wasn't very impressive. sure, he was in good shape, but he was toned, while valerie was built. he was shorter, thinner, more slight. how he survived with her night after night, god only knew. but he did, and he always came back for more.  right now, elijah left on his own underwear and stepped into the shower. once you stepped through the curtains, you realized that the showers were a bit bigger than they looked on the outside. in the center the floor protruded into a circular seat, and the walls had any number of knobs along them, all of them leading to a grate in the ceiling.  valerie sat with her back to him, her hands to her sides, holding the edge of the loveseat-sized pedestal. if she heard him come in, she didn't show it.  elijah located a few knobs he was particularly fond of: he turned a pair of pearl-studded handles, one a quarter, on only half that. hot water began spilling down from above in a circular curtain, like heavy rain off an umbrella. the curtain caught on her back and she flinched, tensing up as the hot water struck her skin.  briefly turning another knob, this one with a blue, table-cut jewel in it, clear, fruity oil spilled across her shoulders for a second before he turned it off.  walking back around to her, elijah crawled through the curtain of water, and saw her stiffly wetting her hair. crawling onto the seat on his knees, his hands reached out on their own, and fingertip by fingertip, touched her back, pressing into tough, tense muscles until his hands were flat against her back. slowly, with firm but gentle movements, he pressed the heels of his hands into her shoulder blades, working tired muscles in a circular motion. already, she began to unravel his hands.  ""how's that?"" he asked in a low voice.  a guttural sound of approval rolled out of her, and elijah grinned reflexively. he knew her weak spots, *thanks to many, many nights of wandering hands and lips,* he remembered as she leaned forward. his hands worked further down her spine, and around to her sides, so his thumbs could work the small of her back.  valerie squirmed, and chuckled a little. ""you're really sorry, huh?""  elijah didn't say anything, just making a sound of confirmation.  ""i'm not convinced."" she admitted. elijah's hands snaked further around her, his fingers tracing through her impressive six-pack, leaving oil and a gentle tingling sensation wherever they went. ""if you think that's enough to-- ah~!"" she arched her back in immediate response when he touched her navel. ""elijah, nohohooo~"" she giggled as his fingertip circled it slowly. oh yeah, elijah knew her weak points alright. another of his favorites, and her most sensitive...  elijah straightened up and bit his lover's ear. not enough to break the skin, just enough to pinch her lobe.  ""ah~!"" she arched her spine, her skin tingling. the water seemed a lot hotter all of a sudden, and she was starting to feel a different liquid on the scene. ""you cheeky little-- oh~!"" her back rolled again as his tongue swept behind her ear.  ""forgive me yet?"" he teased.  she stood and whirled, pulling him forward and shoving him back and lying down with her legs hanging off the edge of the seat. from where he was, he could see her sculpted, goddess-of-war body, from her perfect v at the hips to her equally beautiful breasts, firm from the muscles behind them and full enough to tempt a saint. she peeled off the soaked red-and-gold boyshorts she would no longer be needing before leaning back and putting her perfect, smooth and hairless pussy right where he could get at it.  ""shut up, and put that forked tongue to work, snake-boy.""  elijah smirked, his face turning redder by the second. ""yes, ma'am!"" he piped. immediately the slytherin prefect dropped to his knees, opened his mouth so wide it looked like he was actually planning on unhinging his jaw, and clamped down on her, exactly like a snake. his tongue ran back and forth across her vulva, nimbly, but lapping up every drop of fluid he could get off of her. she responded violently, her body writhing in ecstasy and slackening allowing him to begin probing inwards with his tongue. it was remarkably long, and he knew how to use it.  ""elija~ah!"" she moaned, her hands scrambling to keep her balance. elijah's tongue swirled in all sorts of shapes and patterns, each one sending a new wave of pleasure rippling up her spine just as the one before subsided. ""oh god don't stop!"" her hands curled into fists at her sides, his pace quickening until valerie's legs came up and wrapped around his neck, squeezing, and he bit down slightly as she came hard. her entire spine shuddered with the force of the orgasm, and she threw back her head in ecstasy.  panting slightly, valerie looked down to see elijah grin proudly at her from between her folded legs. ""heheheh. i know your weak spots."" he chuckled.  she grinned back and unfurled her legs, grabbing him by the face and pulling him up to her. ""i know yours."" she growled, kissing his neck as her hands traced down his smaller, slimmer hips, until their reached his underwear. pulling him by the waistband, the two of them sat under the circle of water, valerie holding him gently, careful not to be too rough as she peeled off his wet briefs. elijah, though he looked fit, was easily hurt. as she'd learned the first time they'd acknowledged these feelings...  she gripped elijah firmly in one hand, and he flinched, on eye shutting itself instinctively. slowly, the other eye closed as her oiled palm slowly worked up and down the tan-skinned shaft in her hand, sh then with her free hand, she pointed at the turned handles, they shut off, and the water stopped. redirecting her attention to a little knob with a single square diamond in the center, it turned all the way around on its own. a thick, hot mist sprayed across them both, beading up and rolling off their skin in waves. rising on her haunches, she reached around his waist and mounted him. elijah was exceptionally long and thick, more so than any ordinary girl would reasonably be able to take, and as she slid down onto him, her thighs rested on his lap and she was reminded for the umpteenth time why she would never be satisfied with any other guy: her larger frame overall made her a giant compared to the ordinary girl, and as such, she fit him like a glove, and he fit her like a piece of her she didn't know was missing.  she wrapped her arms around his waist and gripped his rear. ""val...?"" he asked, his own arms around her neck as he looked up into her eyes, dark and full of the same desperate need that she felt burning in her own chest.  ""yes?"" she asked quietly.  ""i need you."" he whispered into the base of her neck, nuzzling her chin from below. she rocked her hips back and forth atop him, and he responded in kind, thrusting up into her. their hands roamed each other's bodies, their tongues returned to the familiar corners of each other's mouths, and every inch of their skin burned under the shower's water. he, taking her distraction as an opportunity, pushed her onto her back (no easy feat had she struggled, but she just let it happen) and began pumping his cock in and out of her, fast and hard and deep. their breathing grew heavier in unison, and both felt themselves nearing their edge.  elijah winced and tried to pull out. ""val, i'm about to--""  ""do it inside me!"" she ordered, grabbing his hips and forcing him to continue slamming into her. ""don't hold back!  ""w-what?!"" elijah looked shocked. ""are you craz-- ohhh, shit. oh, oh, ohhhhh!""  his eyes rolled back and his back arched as he came.  now, valerie wasn't a squirter. elijah, on the other hand, was the male equivalent of a squirter. he came like old faithful, pouring shot after shot deep into her, quickly filling her womb and continuing to pump, until she was so full the pressure forced him out of her, and he sprayed up into the air and across her abs and chest, spurting over and over until she was as covered in his sperm as his own cock was.  ""oh my god... oh my god."" he panted, try hard not to fall onto her. ""i have not... cum like that... since the first time we did this.""  she grinned up at him, even as the water and oil cleaned them both off. she chuckled breathlessly. ""yeah, i think you're right. of course, i teased you for a bit today.""  ""can we... not do that in the future?"" he asked deserately.  she smiled wickedly and tapped the underside of his chin lovingly. ""c'mon, i wanna snuggle you in the tub.""  ""it's too deep!""  ""i'll hold you. and i'm not letting go.""  ""you promise?""  ""i promise.""  #the end  for now...",0,,

659089,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,
227848,"long post...  so i have an interesting relationship with food, people's perspectives on health, and the underweight-healthy-overweight spectrum.   my family is split between underweight / wiry persons and heavy-to-morbidly-obese persons, with a few actively healthy types like myself populating the middle.   i grew up in asia, where it is typical to be in the underweight / wiry demographic. asians and europeans can generally vouch for how this lack of exposure to american-level obesity affects your frame of reference regarding the possibility and likelihood of human size.   a stout or fleshy person (think chris pratt 2015) would be described in local terminology as ""fat"" because that's what you are if you're not ""normal"" (skinny as fuck). there, ""fat"" was generally considered a compliment, because on the american scale that's just ""pudgy"" or ""curvy."" even my mom, who was quite athletic at the time, was occasionally called ""fat."" no harm, no foul. entirely different framework.   note that this is quite literally what many haes activists *think they are referring to* when they talk about how ""in the old days everything was pure and good and fat was a compliment because it was socially valued because food is important.""   what they are largely ignorant of (or have tried to forget) is the experience of low-grade starvation as an endemic phenomenon. when you are all starving, the ""fat"" person is the one whose ribs you can't see anymore. in the thinnest populations i've lived in (where men and women are all ripped because they work hard all damn day and have 4% bodyfat from burning the few calories their labor produced), the highest bmi i witnessed was probably around 24-25, which is *huge* there. (it was a chinese business owner who did very well for his family and was able to, for example, eat chicken and rice every day - a luxury there.)  for the first ~22 years of my life my way of thinking reflected on this. we did move back and forth between there and the midwest as my parents' work required; in the midwest i began to witness the ... outswelling ... of humans who do not depend on physical activity for survival and yet could access massive amounts of food via a phone call or a short drive in a comfortable vehicle. *we all know about this.*   to this day, at 30, i am astounded at the fact that our grocery stores never run out of a high quantity of food, never run out of a high variety of food, and never run out of high-impact, high-caliber, arguably high-quality food that can be easily replenished in most cases (barring luxury and niche goods).   on top of that, mainstream american food culture seems to loathe anything that is not served in large portions and not coma-inducingly sweet or fat-saturated. *we all know about this.*   we can explain all this away with our cultural history, but that doesn't make it acceptable. i can't eat half the shit they sell out there, it fucks with my blood sugar almost immediately.   and what's more: in our physically sluggish culture, there is little to no value-add in creating high-calorie but otherwise nutritionally bankrupt food. this is where the food market argument comes in: ""i can't help that i'm fat because this is what i can afford / find to eat."" i agree and disagree. it is horrific that on a massive, industry-wide scale, so many valuable calories are being rendered useless *and simultaneously* leading to an incredible loss of health across swathes of the population. think about it: every seriously overweight person out there is carrying *and* consuming the same stuff that could be curing starvation worldwide. *i'm not saying they're evil, i am saying it is a tragic waste of resources and industry.*  on the other hand, the knowledge and effort that goes into cooking nutritious, efficient, inexpensive food is actually minimal. it takes practice, but so does walking, riding a bike, having sex, being a good listener, and basically all other things that make life worth living. i live in a fairly expensive city (for the us) and i eat relatively well on $5-7 per day - and that's for ~3000 calories and the appropriate amount of protein for a 6-foot, active, semi-athletic guy.   every health/figure/whatever conversation i've had with a weight-insecure person - usually a woman, unsurprisingly, considering what they're bombarded with on the daily - turns from a general exchange about my health habits into some screwed up argument that they inevitably start.   the thing is, i don't bring these things up except casually, and i don't push my views unless asked. but as soon as the first hint of habit change comes up, they assume a defensive position, and i start to hear a loooot of excuses. i've been accused of all sorts of things just for being obviously healthy and willing to talk about exercise &amp; healthy eating in front of someone who is weight-insecure.   this girl i dated for 6 months would express anxiety about her curvy figure but  categorically refused to consider any notion of exercise (aside from walking to the grocery store or a local bar, all within 10 blocks of her apartment) - and yet one day i happened upon a box of weight loss pills tucked away on her kitchen counter. i didn't bring it up, but i had some weird feelings about that. she hated whenever i mentioned pride at making progress at the gym - and then would swoop to snitch from any of my food that she coveted. fries, milkshakes, beer, the usual suspects.   (side note: considering my background being underweight, being around starving people all the time as a kid, and taking great lengths to budget and control what i eat, i am *very protective* of my food.)  then i got mono, my body crashed, a complication of tonsillitis meant i couldn't eat solid food for weeks, and as i was recovering *she kept snitching my food*. literally all over again. i broke it off (for other reasons as well). just a couple months ago i ran into her and she'd added about 40 pounds and was wearing turtlenecks everywhere. i felt so fucking sad, like she was happy with her new boyfriend but my god this girl is gonna have a heart attack at 50 and wonder what went wrong.",1,-1,

329145,"i find it amazing every time i read articles about people that look for excuses about life's problems. everyone has something to deal with that makes life more difficult. people are in wheelchairs, others have conditions (my sister has epilepsy) and some people are fat.   the difference here is fat people (a good number of them at least) have the ability to change things. i understand that it's hard, very hard for some. i am underweight and have been for 2 years trying to get to an 'average' weight level through healthy means. i have seen progress but as soon as you don't take it seriously (and you have to take it like a job) the results fade away very fast.  the biggest problem with losing weight is that people have misconceptions about healthy. 'light' doesn't mean healthy. if it's processed, no matter what the box says, it likely isn't very healthy.   when my father had a stroke, almost two years ago, he completely changed his diet (fyi he was skinny, but that doesn't translate to healthy). from going to healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole wheat pasta and lean meats and fish 2 things happened:  1- the grocery bill doubled  2- both had more energy and my mom (who wasn't necessarily obese) lost 15 lbs.  if your looking for a point i have 2. the foods you eat are the most important part of regulating weight and sometimes doing this costs money (something which is a shameful part of north american culture).  some people ""can't"" afford to eat properly, and i feel for them. but most just don't budget properly. save the $2 a day you spend on coffee and put it towards groceries.",1,−1,

343438,"### 2018 nfl draft - ranking, projecting the best running backs in the class  saquon barkley, who is perhaps the most hyped running back prospect since reggie bush, arrives at an interesting point in nfl history. the running back is no longer a ""premier"" position in the draft -- nfl teams would much rather use a high pick on a quarterback, offensive tackle, pass-rusher, or wide receiver.  proponents of advanced statistics have been at the forefront of this change of thinking, pointing out that running backs often have short careers and are usually replaced with ease.  accordingly, any team willing to go against this trend and use a high pick on barkley should be fairly certain that he is likely to live up to his hype. enter backcast, which is football outsiders' metric for projecting the likelihood of success for running back prospects in the nfl draft.  historically, a college running back with a good size-speed combination, a high average yards per carry, and who represented a large percentage of his college team's running attack is more likely to succeed at the nfl level. backcast considers these factors and projects the degree to which the running back will exceed the nfl production of an ""average"" drafted running back during his first five years in the nfl. for example, a running back with a plus-50 percent backcast is projected to gain 50 percent more yards than the ""average"" drafted running back. backcast also projects whether each running back is likely to be heavily involved in the receiving game or is more of a ""ground-and-pound"" back.  we have run backcast for all of this year's top prospects, and there is a huge gap between no. 1 and the rest of the group. this draft is also a weak one for receiving running backs -- with one notable exception.  would it surprise you to learn that the top prospect and the top receiving back are both saquon barkley?  for more detail on how backcast works, check out the bottom of the article. what follows is a ranking of the top running back prospects for 2018 according to our model:  * * *  ## saquon barkley, penn state nittany lions  **backcast score:** plus-181.9 percent   **type of back:** receiving   **similar historical prospects:** ricky williams, ladainian tomlinson  you can believe the hype: barkley has a massive backcast projection. in fact, he has the second highest projection of any running back in backcast's dataset, and he is a relatively close second to ricky willliams' best ever plus-190.1 percent projection.  ## top 12 backcast projections, 1998-2018  |player|year|round|pick|backcast| |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- | |ricky williams|1999|1|5|190.1%| |saquon barkley|2018|?|?|181.9%| |t.j. duckett|2002|1|18|160.0%| |ron dayne|2000|1|11|154.7%| |leonard fournette|2017|1|4|145.6%| |dalvin cook|2017|2|41|141.2%| |ladainian tomlinson|2001|1|5|136.2%| |darren mcfadden|2008|1|4|130.8%| |ronnie hillman|2012|3|67|128.5%| |deangelo williams|2006|1|27|119.1%| |todd gurley ii|2015|1|10|118.2%| |ezekiel elliott|2016|1|4|118.0%|  barkley's historically great projection is primarily driven by his great size-speed combination. barkley is the heaviest running back in backcast's dataset to run a 40-yard dash in 4.40 seconds or better.  moreover, barkley is not just a workout warrior. penn state gave barkley 42.8 percent of its rushing attempts when he was only a freshman and gave him more than 50 percent of its rushing attempts each year thereafter. nobody knows a player's talents as well as his coaches, who see the player's performance in practice as well as on game day. any competent coach (as well as most of the incompetent ones) will try to get supremely talented players the ball. barkley's coaches gave him the ball a lot, and history shows that barkley's coaches' vote of confidence is an excellent sign for his potential success.  the weakest aspect of barkley's projection is his yards per attempt. barkley averaged 5.73 yards per attempt, which is above average. it is just not stratospherically above average like the rest of his metrics. to top it off, barkley is also likely to be effective catching passes out of the backfield.  barkley's numbers don't nullify all the analytics that caution against using a high first-round pick on a running back. and despite all of these positive indicators, there's always the slim chance that he could bust. however, it is hard to imagine a much better prospect at the running back position than saquon barkley.  ## royce freeman, oregon ducks  **backcast score:** plus-88.1 percent   **type of back:** balanced   **similar historical prospects:** michael turner, kevin jones  in last year's draft, backcast had three very good prospects that it rated relatively close together: leonard fournette, dalvin cook and joe mixon. this year, there is a huge gap between barkley and backcast's second-rated prospect, freeman. that said, freeman is actually a pretty nice prospect who may be severely underrated as a mid-round pick.  a good all-around prospect, freeman received relatively heavy usage at oregon, he has a good size-speed combination, and he had a better yards-per-attempt average than barkley.  ## derrius guice, lsu tigers  **backcast score:** plus-86.8 percent   **type of back:** ground-and-pound   **similar historical prospects:** jamal lewis, rashard mendenhall  guice is appropriately rated as a first- to second-round pick. he had a relatively heavy workload during college, especially considering that he had to compete with future top-five pick leonard fournette for carries up through 2017. guice also did a lot with those opportunities -- he averaged 6.4 yards per attempt, which is one of the best marks of this draft class.  the downside to guice is that he is unlikely to give his team much in the receiving game. he averaged just more than seven receiving yards per game and is a larger than average back, which are both bad signs for his receiving prospects in the nfl.  ## rashaad penny, san diego state aztecs  **backcast score:** plus-81.0 percent   **type of back:** balanced/ground-and-pound   **similar historical prospects:** melvin gordon, tevin coleman   aside from barkley, penny may be the most intriguing prospect in this year's draft from a backcast perspective. penny averaged a phenomenal adjusted 7.37 yards per attempt, which is the second highest score all time in backcast's database. penny also has a good size-speed combination -- he is a big back at 222 pounds, but he has the speed of a running back 20 pounds lighter (4.46-second 40-yard dash).  penny's projection takes a big hit, however, because his workload was comparatively light. in fact, he has the largest disparity between adjusted yards per attempt and college workload in backcast's dataset. until his senior year, penny was stuck behind other running backs on the depth chart; most notably, current philadelphia eagles running back donnel pumphrey.    there is some evidence that san diego state's coaches may have simply been mistaken about who was the better running back. every year he played, penny beat every other running back on the roster in yards per attempt. in particular, he averaged over a yard per carry more than pumphrey as a junior. in fact, if you follow the running back rotation at san diego state closely, it appears that the coaches gave a lot of weight to experience (san diego state also diverted carries to senior running back christian price during penny's sophomore year). if that is the case, then penny may be much more talented than his college workload suggests.  in sum, penny's backcast projection is good, and there is significant reason to believe that the one negative aspect of his profile does not reflect his true ability.  ## ronald jones ii, usc trojans  **backcast score:** plus-60.0 percent   **type of back:** balanced   **similar historical prospects:** laurence maroney, jordan howard  ronald jones had a reasonably heavy workload at usc. as a junior, jones accounted for 52 percent of his team's carries, while the average drafted running back only accounts for 36.5 percent of his team's carries as a junior. jones was also explosive when he touched the football, averaging over six yards per carry.  jones is a bit of an odd case, however, because he is a smaller back and he never was much of receiver out of the backfield in college.  ## nick chubb, georgia bulldogs  **backcast score:** plus-76.2 percent   **type of back:** ground-and-pound   **similar historical prospects:** jonathan stewart, ahman green  ## sony michel, georgia bulldogs  **backcast score:** plus-16.8 percent   **type of back:** balanced   **similar historical prospects:** ryan williams, shane vereen  chubb and michel shared the same backfield at georgia, and so it makes sense to consider the two running backs together. scouts inc. values michel as a first- to second-rounder, and chubb as a second- to third-rounder. backcast, however, thinks that chubb is a far superior prospect, as he outperformed michel on all of backcast's metrics.  chubb shouldered a much larger share of the workload than michel, and there is no reason to believe that any unusual circumstance caused chubb to get more attempts than michel. in fact, the disparity would have been even larger if chubb had not missed the second half of the 2015 season due to a knee injury. georgia's coaches, who saw chubb and michel in practice every day, clearly preferred chubb. michel did not get within 60 carries of chubb's totals in any year when chubb was completely healthy. chubb was also more productive on a per-carry basis.  chubb is also bigger and faster than michel: chubb has a 13-pound advantage and had a slightly better 40-yard dash time (4.52 seconds versus 4.54 seconds).",0,,

676712,"britney pumped her fist, â€œhell yeah! letâ€™s get vacuumed out!â€  hannah laughed, ""okay then! if you'll just follow me, i'll take you to the extraction room.""  the girls got up and wobbled after hannah, their thighs and butts jiggling with fresh fat. she led them back into the building and further down the hallway. they then entered an austere room with white walls, empty except for a wall-to-wall mirror and a very large, hi-tech device that looked a bit like a giant water cooler.  hannah addressed her charges. â€œas you know, our proprietary system uses an elegant combination of magic and technology. and it not only eliminates unwanted fat; it also leaves you with the exact figure that you desire. using the information that you provided in your surveys, we have selected body blueprints for each of you. now, you get to view personalized 3d models and request any changes that you may desire.â€  â€œsweet!â€ said valerie, hands on her hips, â€œi canâ€™t wait to see what i look like!â€  â€œthen iâ€™ll preview your model first,â€ said hannah, tapping on her tablet. a full-color hologram appeared. there stood a perfect, life-size replica of valerie about 100 pounds slimmer.  â€œweâ€™ve set you up with our busty beauty package. the ample hips, flat tummy, and generous bust are sure to make your boyfriend want you more than ever.â€  â€œwow!â€ valerie exclaimed, walking around the hologram to view her model from different angles, â€œitâ€™s perfect! donâ€™t change a thing. storm is gonna go down on his knees when he sees me like this.â€  â€œboth knees? or just one?â€ beth asked, grinning.  valerie blushed, â€œweâ€™re nowhere near that phase, but after this, who knows?â€  britney could no longer contain her excitement.â€ me! me! show me!â€ she squeaked, bouncing up and down like a schoolgirl. the movement caused her boobs and butt to jiggle rapidly.  â€œyes maâ€™am!â€ hannah laughed, swiping right on her tablet. valerieâ€™s hologram was replaced with that of britney. she, too, looked much slimmer, though not quite high school skinny.  â€œbased on your responses, we selected our curvy cutie package. the hourglass shape and perky bottom make it a very popular choice.â€  britney beamed as she, too, circled around to inspect her doppelgÃ¤nger.  â€œi really, really like it! butâ€¦ do you think you could make my tush a little bigger?â€  valerie laughed, â€œyouâ€™re always complaining that your butt is *too* big!â€  britney shrugged, â€œhey, i want to lose weight, but i donâ€™t want to lose what makes meâ€¦ me, you know?â€  â€œof course!â€ said hannah, sliding her finger across the tablet. instantly, hologram britneyâ€™s perky little cheeks expanded, growing until she had a medium sized bubble butt.  â€œo-m-g! love it, want it, need it!â€  hanna smiled and swiped again, â€œfor you, beth, we started with our supermodel stunner base and added some extra definition to the abs.â€  beth looked at her physically-fit simulacrum and chuckled.  â€œyep. thatâ€™s me after five weeks of training with my mom.â€  â€œwell *this* transformation should only take about five minutes,â€ said hannah, â€œare there any changes youâ€™d like to make?â€  beth tilted her head slightly, â€œcan i see what i would look like with d-cups?â€  â€œsure!â€ hannah replied, tapping away. like magic, hologram beth experienced a targeted growth spurt. her now-larger breasts bulged, stretching out her yellow bikini.  ""oh yeah,"" said beth, ""me likey.""  hannah beamed, ""well, if everything is in order, we'll start the slimming process. who wants to go first?""  britney was a little nervous, and beth was still admiring her hologram, so valerie volunteered. hannah helped her up onto a platform and into the capsule, which was a glass cylinder with a large gasket at the top. valerie stepped into it. motors whined as the cylinder rose around her, and she had to wiggle to get her hips, butt, and belly through the soft seal. fortunately, the cylinder was large enough to accommodate all the extra pounds that valerie was currently lugging around. the chamber rose until the gasket was just below valerie's breasts. then, hannah tapped some buttons on her tablet, and there was a brief hiss as the rubber gasket around valerie's waist inflated, sealing her inside the machine.  now, valerie was a little nervous, ""is this going to beâ€¦ unpleasant?"" she asked, trepidation in her voice.  ""not at all!"" hannah replied, ""in fact, most of our guests find the experience enjoyable. i would describe it as a kind of full-body massage. however, if at any time you do experience discomfort, let me know, and i'll stop the process.""  valerie took a deep breath and let it out, ""okay, girls! wish me luck!""  ""you got this, val!"" britney cheered.  hannah tapped on her tablet once again, and there was a loud whirring sound as the machine started up. at first, not much happened. then, valerie gasped as all the fat in her body suddenly lurched upward.  ""whoaâ€¦"" said valerie.  it happened again. her butt and her belly rapidly rose, pushed upward by some unseen force, only to drop down and jiggle with a soft *blorp* sound.  ""what does is it feel like?"" britney asked.  valerie's eyes were wide, ""i don't know how to describe it! it's like my fat reserves have the hiccups. whoop!"" it happened again. *blorp!* and again. *blorp!* the frequency was increasing.  ""does it feel like you're getting a workout?"" beth asked, curiously.  by this time, valerie's fat was bouncing every second or so, ""kind ofâ€¦"" *blorp!* ""but i'm notâ€¦"" *blorp!* ""putting inâ€¦"" *blorp!* ""any effortâ€¦"" *blorp!* ""it actuallyâ€¦"" *blorp!* ""feels good!""  *blorp! blorp! blorp!* the machine continued humming and valerie's extra pounds continued jiggling. as they did, a faint sound became audible. it sounded a bit like a milkshake being sucked through a straw. *squelch! squelch! squelch!* valerie gasped and her friends watched with interest as some esoteric combination of technology and magic caused her to shrink. it first became noticeable around her middle. as her belly fat slowly disappeared, her waistline receded. soon, her weight loss became apparent in other areas. her double chin became less noticeable, her thighs narrowed, and her butt deflated.  ""this is amazing! i can actually feel myself shrinking!"" valerie said excitedly.  ""that thing works fast!"" beth agreed, staring at valerie, who now looked more-or-less the way she did when they arrived - not obese, but fairly chubby.  ""where does the fat go?"" britney asked.  ""it's pumped into an enchanted, vacuum-sealed container,"" hannah explained, ""the container is later emptied into a furnace, where the fat is burned as fuel to generate electricity.  ""it literally burns your fat for you? hallelujah!"" beth exclaimed.  ""i am gonna look so hot!"" valerie said as the machine continued working its magic. *blorp! squelch! blorp! squelch!* by this point, valerie just had thick thighs and a bit of a muffin top, and whatever process had caused her to shrink was also shrinking her bikini. no longer truly chubby, she looked like a supermodel who had let herself go a little. as the last of her unwanted fat was sucked away, her breasts were reduced in size only slightly; they remained quite full and round, just like those of her hologram.  at long last, the machine stopped pumping, and there was a quick *ding* that sounded like an oven timer going off.  ""all done!"" hannah said, tapping on her tablet once more. there was another loud hiss as the seals on the machine were released. hannah opened the door for valerie, and the vixen stepped out of the machine looking curvy, busty, and undeniably fit. no one looking at her would suspect, even for a moment, that the fox had just gorged herself on pizza and cheesecake. in fact, she looked as though she had just finished up an intensive training regimen. flipping her hair, she runway walked over to the large mirror to gaze at her new body.  ""oh yes! yes! look at me! i'm thin!"" she exclaimed, turning to admire herself from every angle.",1,0,

910930,"**part ii**  * **gear**  this is the fun stuff. remember, every ounce counts. seriously. that shit adds up. if your pack is heavier than 25 pounds without food and water, it's too heavy.  * shelter  for most hikers, this means a tent. but there are alternatives, mainly including hammocks and tarps. so the first thing for you is to decide what kind of system it is that you want.  disclaimer: i've only ever used tents.  tents: i think the warmest option, most privacy, most ""house-like,"" most protected from the elements, but usually the heaviest option and needs flat ground.  hammocks: arguably the comfiest by itself, can set up anywhere there's trees, you have a fucking hammock.  no room in your hammock for your things, just under your tarp or in the shelter.  tarps; lightest option and you look like an elite hiker, but you're also the most exposed.  the tent i used was the msr hubba, a pretty popular choice. it's a 1-man tent that's heavier than other options but sets up without any staking and has plenty of room for a 1-man.  there's no reason to have anything but a 1-man tent unless you're hiking with a significant other. other good options in the low price range include rei's quarter dome t1 and big agnes' fly creek ul-1. as with all gear, there are lighter and better options, but they're going to cost you a lot and, in my opinion, the extra couple hundred dollars aren't worth it for a few ounces.  * sleeping system  the therm-a-rest neoair is an expensive sleeping pad, usually around $120 or so. but it is worth. every. cent. it is the comfiest goddamn thing in the world and that is so important when your entire day is about beating yourself up. i'm not going to talk about other pads; i'm just going to tell you to buy that one.  as far as sleeping bags, in the southern half i carried a marmot pinnacle 15 degree bag, and switched in harpers ferry to an old l.l. bean 45 degree i had lying around the house.  most people use their clothes bag as a pillow. but i'm better than that. for my luxury item, i carried a six ounce therm-a-rest compressible pillow, which i carried the entire way and loved every single night. clothes bag works fine, but i'm just sayin, i loved my pillow.  * pack  your pack should be under 4 pounds, as a hard and fast rule. you should also be using an internal frame pack, which is all that's really sold anymore, anyway. i used black diamond's infinity 60 liter pack, which was plenty of room. you shouldn't need anything over a 60. the smaller the better, as long as you have what you need.  * boots and socks  important. i never got a blister on this hike, but i know from previous hikes how much blisters really, really suck. take care of your feet, and that starts with socks. liner socks are the best step towards preventing blisters. i used injinji toe sock liners to prevent skin-on-skin friction between toes.  toe socks are gay, you say? well if not having blisters is gay, you can call me marcus bachmann.  smartwool socks for the outer layer. comfortable and breathable.  as for boots, it's really what fits you. i wore keens because i have wide feet and that's really the only company that makes a comfortable fit for me. all through the trail i wore keen voyageurs, ankle cut through the southern half then cross-trainers in the northern half. note that my experience with only having two pairs of boots is atypical. most hikers went through more.  * clothes  don't wear cotton, duh. synthetics and wool only.  smartwool is a wonderful company with wonderful products, just be advised that they size small, so if you wear a medium, buy a large. i wore their 1/4 zip fleece top as a lighter, warmer garment and it was great. for heavier duty warmth, i wore a columbia ballistic fleece, which was a bulkier and slightly heavier option than i could've gone with, but water resistant and very warm. in the winter, i hiked in smartwool long underwear and some hiking pants.  once it got warmer, i switched to a synthetic tee (mountain hardware but they're all the same) and a pair of mesh shorts. no underwear; that's just extra weight.  as for rain, i used a marmot gore tex shell which worked pretty well, but i honestly didn't use it much. once it's warm enough to walk shirtless in the rain without freezing to death, that's your best option.  * cooking  most of your food is going to involve boiled water rehydrating something, hence why i went with the jetboil. a very efficient, self-contained, cannister fuel system. when it's 70+ degrees, it boils 2 cups of water (usually what you need) in 90 seconds. when it's cold, a little longer.  something i'd do differently on another go 'round would probably be to ditch the stove altogether once warmer weather sets in and just go no-cook. i never did so i can't give too much advice here, but it seemed like people who did had lighter packs later in the week after resupply and spent much less time preparing food.  also, don't bring a frying pan, you idiot.  * water purification  your options here are a water filter (heavy, one-time investment), chemicals like aquamira ($15 every month or so, have to wait 20 minutes), or a uv light which according to some is questionable (also, very fragile).  honestly, i stopped purifying my water in new jersey, though that's not necessarily something i'd condone for you. the danger here is giardia, which is a waterborne disease that makes you shit your face off for weeks. but apparently 10% or some bullshit statistic of people are immune to it and i figured that i'd never gotten sick from stream water before, why would i start now? and i was fine. but you might not be, so use your own judgement.  * first aid  painkillers are essential. neosporin's probably a good option. beyond that, any injury you can't fix with a bandana and some duct tape, you're going to need a hospital anyway. first aid excess was the #1 thing people were sending home by the end of georgia.  * compass and map  you don't need a goddamn compass or map.  * misc  a pack cover for when it rains. i had an rei duck's back which worked great. a journal. i can't keep up with a journal but i sure wish i could. a camera, of course. other stuff that i'm forgetting but you can ask me if you think you need something.  * replacing shit  gear companies are really, really accomodating to thru-hikers. ""hey, i'm thru-hiking the at..."" are magic words to get anything replaced by anyone, no matter what you did you it. this is because we get asked all the effing time by day-hikers and whoever else what gear we use and what we think of this or that, and those companies want thru-hikers speaking well of their products.  * food and supplies  normally, you're carrying at most five days of food. resupply involved hitchhiking into town and heading to the grocery store, then either spending the night in town or heading back to the trail. some people have maildrops that they pick up in post offices, sent either by themselves before the trail or by their spouse or friend along the way.  after a few weeks of hiking, you will develop an ungodly appetite, and calories are important. it's important to find calorie dense food, and you eventually have to start eating empty calories (processed little debbie shit and the like, not that i minded that much) to keep weight on. i lost 40 pounds from georgia to harpers ferry, and gained 20 back from there to maine only by making an effort to eat as much unhealthy shit as possible. my meals, in general, were like so:  breakfast: i don't normally eat breakfast irl and i didn't on the trail, though i know that's bad practice. when i did, it was a meal replacement bar or maybe a couple pop-tarts. in the winter, i ate a ton of oatmeal. but oatmeal gets old fast.  lunch: i also didn't really stop for lunch much. i'm more of a dinner guy. when i did have lunch, it was usually something wrapped in a tortilla. when it was still cold enough to carry blocks of cheese, i'd have pepperoni and cheese tortillas. when it got warmer, peanut butter and granola with honey on a tortilla.  snacks: clif bars, trail mix, snickers.  dinner: if you can afford it, mountain house freeze-dried meals. they are fucking delicious and filling but like $7 a piece. more affordable and what i usually ate were knorr rice sides with a packet of tuna or salmon or chicken or something. not great, but it fills you up and costs about $3 all told.   * **trail life**  some miscellaneous things about life on the trail.  trail names: nobody uses their real name while hiking. it's just a thing. my trail name is jukebox, some guys i was hiking with were malarky, shepherd, burly, spoon, downhill, hazard, it's wacky. trail names usually come in georgia or north carolina from something notable or funny or unique that you've done or whathaveyou.  shelters: every 10 miles or so, there's a three-walled, wooden shelter along the trail. there's room to camp around them and almost always a water source, so nearly every night people end up at one of these areas. i normally didn't hike with my group all day, but we'd know which shelter we were going to. that's where the actual camping and sitting around the campfire aspect comes into it, which is so great when it happens, but a lot of the time (especially after a couple months) people are just so tired they go to sleep soon after they get in. but most nights were a lot of fun, hanging out around the fire listening to whoever had some instrument or commiserating about our feet.  drugs: there's a whole lot of weed on the trail. if you're not alright with that, too bad. not much of anything else, though.   **that's all i guess**",0,,
595281,"&gt; removed pointless swearing  **preface** ***** iâ€™ve been seeing a ton of posts about dressing college students, high school seniors, and whatnot.  the current sidebar guide to the basic wardrobe might be slightly dated and it doesnâ€™t really cover where to get these so called basics, so here it is an updated guide.    this guide applies to **all** ages, body types, social standings, or self-perceived personal archetypes.  this guide just lists the absolute **basics** and will point to some budget-minded options for this.  yes, i know about other articles of clothing like chinos and cords, but this guide is for the noobs.  read this guide understanding that a lot of noobs can't afford $150 gitman shirts, or $300 for sick ervell knits.  remember though, generally, you get what you pay for.  before you say this guide isnâ€™t for me cuz iâ€™m in middle school, high school, college, graduate school, whatever - please read the guide.   side note: **fit is king**, nothing can make cheap clothes look better like a good fit, and conversely, nothing can make expensive clothes look terrible like a bad fit.  tagged clothing size varies widely by manufacturer, a small isn't always a small and a large might be a medium.  **section i â€“ the blue jean** ***** the classic blue jean, the most basic piece of workwear and staple to any manâ€™s wardrobe you can imagine.  anyone can wear these.  * [**leviâ€™s 511** â€“ clean dark - $39.99]( http://www.amazon.com/levis-young-mens-skinny-32x32/dp/b001o29nl0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1314943197&amp;sr=8-1) â€“ slim fitting, tapered leg for the skinnier guy. * [**leviâ€™s 514** â€“ tumbled rigid -$ 37.99](http://www.amazon.com/levis-straight-dirty-rigid-36x30/dp/b002dutkp6/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1314943345&amp;sr=1-1) â€“ slimmer than youâ€™re used to, if youâ€™re actually skinny, go for the 511s. * [**leviâ€™s 501** â€“ clean rigid - $42.99](http://www.amazon.com/levis-mens-original-stonewash-36x32/dp/b0018on49g/ref=sr_1_1?s=apparel&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1314943420&amp;sr=1-1) â€“ a cornerstone of americana, the original cut, which has been recut into mediocrity.  the original 501 fit closer to what the 511 is today.  wear these if youâ€™re a bigger dude.  **section ii â€“ the shirt** ***** someone said that a shirtâ€™s collar frames the face, which is pretty important cause people look at your face.  for this reason i prefer v-necks, plain ol' v-necks, maybe some solid colors here and there.  graphic tees you ask?

553782,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,

646002,"in short: instead of changing their life habits for something better for their health, many obese people, mostly women voices, decided to change the beauty standard after getting inspired by the body positivity movement.  ----  in not so short:  with all those beauty standard issue with women, a lot feel insecure about themselves, they feel jealous of the ones they see on tv and on the internet. everyone can be physically beautiful, although there are some exceptions, the principal parameters that makes someone beautiful are health, hygiene, attire and personnality. obesity is not pretty since health is a major parameter for beauty.   however, not everyone is built the same. there are folks who can eat a lot without gaining weight thanks to their metabolism, other can gain weight way easilly. some will say that it is unfair that some people can look fit while eating like pigs, but the world is a cruel and unfair reality, at least you should be thankful that you're not malformed or physically disabled to the point that pretty much no one will get interested in you. what i just said sounds cruel? that's life for ya.  so faced with the fact that to be beautiful you need to have an healthy body, and some people can have a healthy body with minimal effort, many overweight people refused to accept that they need to put extra effort to achieve body health. changing your life habits for healthy ones is no easy task, but not impossible. the trick is to start slowly, getting used to the changes you've made and adding up more until you achieve an healthy life-style. what a lot of these jealous obese people don't realize is that a lot of fit people are not obese simply because they have healthy lifestyle, not because they are gifted. yet, people are lazy, working out, eating better and watching your quantity of food you consume is too hard. people don't like change, changing themselves that is, because the next step to this laziness and jealousy was to change the beauty standard.  in the past couple of years, women in magazines, model and suchs, were mostly extremely thin, pale skin people. faced with the reality that anorexia wasn't healthy we started to see more normal sized model women. we went from underweight to appropriate weight, but some just saw that society started to accept ""heavier"" women. (i want to quickly point out that weight distribution is also a thing, straight up weight should not be an absolute parameter for health because of that. a human scale numbers don't represent your health condition.)  another good thing is that women of color also got more and more present in the world of beauty. society enlarged they views for the good of the people. years past and we started to see the apparition of ""plus size"". women with large frame, not necesserally overweight that's important, started to appear. ""no more only petite, we accept everyone now!"" remember those ""dove"" commercial showing groups of women of different colors, shapes and sizes few years back? this what the prime example of people starting to accept various body sizes so every women could find themselves in the beauty standard: every women that are healthy at least. this is often refered as the ""body positivity movement"" but then it evolved again. seeing that more and more body types were accepted as beautiful in the magazines, by more body type we saw more larger frame women, many understood the situation in a different way. they started seeing that beauty standard should accept larger women, but larger as more corpulent as they understood. we got introduced to plus-plus-size women and it got overboard. now they wanted obese women to be accepted, not only natural sizes.  the world of beauty standard openned their door to women of every color, every shape and every size, and by shape and sizes it refers to build and frame, not slim and fat. but seeing this openned door was an opportunity to include corpulence and obesity since ""we should accept everyone"".  magazines gradually stopped promoting underweight bodies since it was unhealthy, and now some people want to promote overweight bodies, which is also unhealthy. they misunderstood the whole point of body positivity.  back to unhealthy life style. if you are an aldult that do the groceries, you probably saw that healthy food is most of the time more expensive than junkfood. this makes it harder to switch to healthy meals, especially to poor people. note that lots of people nowaday don't have the courage to make their own meal when coming home from work, thus they eat premade meal, often fast food, which is unheathy too. it justifies why we see lot of poor american people being fat. cheap food isn't good for your body, but it's all they can afford. sugar is the worst enemy, fat isn't as bad at media says, sugar is way worst. but sugar bought the media, made their product appear not as bad as they actually are. stop drinking juice and sodam just drink water only and you'll see an extreme difference.  ---  but like i said previously, switching to an healthy life style is hard but not impossible.   who am i to say that? someone who used to be overweight but made up is mind and changed for good. granted i was a teenager when i made that switch, ""i had all the time in the world"" not stuck in the vicious cycle of adulthood, it was easier, but i still had to make efforts other people of my age would have never done. i started getting fat at around 10 years old, and i didn't really bothered. i was more of an intellectual so to me it was justified that i was not as in shapes as others. my brother and sister also got a bit of weight in these years, another reason to accept it i thought. my father wasn't a big fan of that, he had an old dumbell rack that he wanted us to play with but training wasn't fun so we didn't touched them. he also like to mess with us whenever the show called ""biggest loser"", a competition of fat folks losing weight through intense supervised exercise, came up on the tv. he liked to say that if i continued gaining weight i would end up on the show. but i shrug it off. i remember one day eating one third of the cookie tray for dessert and having a little sentiment of guilt, but just a little, it was the start of becoming consious of what i was doing to myself. years past and eventually we got a wii with a wii fit. this white smart controller-scale thing would collect our weight and give you progression of your weight loss, that is, if you were using it as a training program. for a boy like me, it was a toy more than anything else, but everytime i got on it, i didn't like how it called me, i didn't like the progression. i was fine with the word ""overweight"" next to my weight, but one day it got to ""obese"" the the little mii with my face on it on the screen became chubby. i didn't like that, didn't like becoming fatter. luckily as was never victim of bullying, i wasn't pushed by others, but that hunk of plastic did.   pre-teen, i started eating less, smaller portions, but is wasn't enough. so, at around 13 years old i started eating smaller portions, reducing high-sugar food and doing 30 minutes of cardio every evening, got more serious at 14 years old. how does one can start and keep doing 30 minutes cardio? find something to motivate you. losing weight was my personnal journey, i had to find motivation myself, so i found the best way for me: i loved listenning to 80s rock music so i would allow myself to only listen to music when i was training. i wasn't exited to run every night, but i was exited to finally be able to listen to my music. eventually i found my routine and kept at it for a few years. with the growth spurt of the summer of my 15 years old, i grew taller i had become slimmer way faster, attained my healthy normal weight. not much muscular mass, i prioritized cardio tho. when highschool ended i went to college and i wasn't able to do cardio every night, didn't had the time because of school, then adult me got more and more problem with my left knee, but i kept watching what i ate, cut sugar a lot, only drink water and get enough sleep, and never became fat ever again.   i know what it mean to be overweight, i got the courage to lose all that weight and achieved beauty. it's hard but not impossible. seeing people just being lazy, coming up with things like ""fat acceptance"" instead of being wise and coming up with courage to change for the better makes me lose faith in the society. but on another level, i feel even better. i realized that i am, in a way, better than a lot of people of my generation, i had resolve. is it better to be have been always slim, or to overcome yourself and become slim through sheer commitement?  ---  so that whole story with fat acceptance boils down to jealousy, laziness and misunderstanding of the body positivity movement. life is unfair we have to accept it, some got to work more than other, that's it, that's what we got to accept, not corpulence.  (and i am aware that i have used the word ""healthy"" so many time in that text i know.)",1,-2,

569744,"the choice you end up making really will be a matter of preference, and of how much time you're spending on and off road. a full-on mountain bike can really be taken anywhere, but if you're spending a lot of time on the road and not much time off, it may be worth it to you to go a bit lighter and quicker (say, with a cyclocross bike).  one more thing-- f you're hardcore into riding, frames and bike types make a big difference for handling and stuff. but in terms of determining what kind of terrain your bike can handle or manage, tires make the biggest difference. any bike with clearance for fattish knobby tires can be taken off road and onto any surface other than ice, snow or sand. the rest just determines how quickly and aggressively it can be ridden on that surface.  for all-around tires, there are three general areas of thought. the first is semi-slicks, which have smooth center treads and knobs on the sides of the tire. the idea is that on hard surfaces, the center line touches the ground and you don't get much rolling resistance. on soft surfaces, the tire sinks in a little and the knobs come into contact with the ground. i (and many others) don't like this design at all. it seems okay at first, but they're horrible on pavement. when turning, you're riding on the knobs, which can bend and deflect, making them prone to losing traction unpredictably while cornering.  the next school of thought is the typical cyclocross tire-- skinny and aggressively knobby. for muddy cx conditions these are great; knobs are the only thing that work in mud and slush, but the skinniness keeps the contact patch, and thus the rolling resistance, to a minimum on paved sections. however, for recreational riding i don't much like these tires. knobby tires on pavement will always feel not-so-great; they deflect while turning and send up all sorts of buzz. and, if it's not really wet or soft out, super tall knobs don't help that much in the dirt, either.  the all-rounder tires i like best are kind of the opposite: very fat, and with minimal knobs. stuff like the intense micro-knobby or the kenda small block 8. the fatness gives you a lot of contact patch off road, but the knobs are small enough and closely spaced enough that cornering is predictable on pavement. the only time you really miss having tall knobs is when it gets wet outside-- mud is only fun to ride with really aggressive knobs. otherwise, these tires are perfect; dirt, sand, pavement, slickrock, etc.",0,,

 _i know you._  a moment of clear understanding. a moment of familiarity. a memory.  &amp;nbsp;  creatures of battle, engineered from natural animals specifically for combat. thousands of them broke against each other, a wave of teeth and jaws and claws. a mist of blood and venom and worse. a battlefield rained upon by screeches as their human handlers looked on.   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;two scuffled alone, fought tirelessly in their moment; they'd been born for this, they existed for this. for the fight, for the victory. for master. one wrapped its jaws around the throat of the other, pressed down its sabres, and drew blood. the wind of a choking throat, great paws weakening under talons. but as quickly as their ears found sounds, both faltered.  &amp;nbsp;  _you. i know you._  &amp;nbsp;  a memory of another life, a human life. flashes in grey, flashes in colours it'd never seen, of sounds that sounded distrinctly like the language of its handler. it was smaller now, in this memory, a youngling of the master's kind. a child. strange things and strange animals. dull nose, dull ears, eyes to see all the colours of the world.   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the child turned. a dog approached. friendly and furry and tail held high. beautiful golden fur dashed with brown, perky ears. cautious.  &amp;nbsp;  _wait. i know you. it's you. is this how it has to be? not even a fight, this time?_  &amp;nbsp;  the dog lunged. it latched and bit, it pulled and tore. first the arm, then the shoulder, and the back of the neck. it remembered, then, that they'd done this before. but when? how many times, and where? when before had they fought and killed one another?  as the killing bite fell, the time before leapt into the dog's memory. a gunshot rang, burning like fire, and there would be only a little time for remembering.  &amp;nbsp;  ice and snow and grey-green plains forever into the horizon. dark trees, rocky land, hard ground and a cliff. over the edge and far below was the hunting pit, still bloodied from last summer's hunt. the great beasts were near. massive, cloaked in brown wool, all power and meat and fight, even the younglings.   &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;trumpeting and bellowing, did they ever think themselves quiet? did they even care? fewer and fewer came with each passing season, with each longer warmer summer and wetter winter. less meat, less hide, less to last the year.  &amp;nbsp;  someone began it, cast fire into the grass, to drive the beasts into the pit. they went in a panic, as always, toward the cliff. the dogs followed, and then the rest of the hunters.  the young hunter remained in the rear, behind the herd with the learners. they did not anticipate the straggler. large and ancient and broken-tusked, its fur matted and weathered, trunk scarred from countless axes and spears and claws. it came upon them from behind in a thrashing rage.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;it knocked down the young hunter, trampled him underfoot, but not before his spear sunk deep into its chest. it toppled over the cliff after its herd, a river of hot blood melting the snow behind it. the young hunter lay still as death approached, and he remembered. bright and clear as icy water on the face, the memory of the great old beast. a foe. not in this life but another, someplace else, someplace strange.  &amp;nbsp;  the great old beast lay on the splintered logs, dying. they were not enough to kill instantly, they never were. the screeches of her herd were all around, desperate and hopeless. the hunters with the fire had tricked them, like they'd tricked the others, and it now was too late. but she remembered. a new memory, unlike the others of decades of life.  &amp;nbsp;  _i know you. we've done this before._  &amp;nbsp;  a world without ice. hot as if always alight with fire, bright and colourful and filled with trees greener than it'd ever seen. the same moon hung in the sky, the same stars to point the way. but it was different.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a life where she was not a great beast, strong and massive and invincible, larger than any other. no, in this life, she was smaller and slimmer, like the lions and the bears. proud and sleek, feathered like the tundra birds. but this was no tundra, and here, not a wanderer but a hunter, a hunter who killed her prey with talons and teeth.  &amp;nbsp;  she leapt upon her prey from the shadows, talons deep in the back, wings outstretched for balance, teeth tearing through feathers and flesh. nearly there, nearly there! it shrieked and thrashed and attempted to free itself, to no avail. she would have her meal.   weaker and weaker, slower and nearer the ground, and the prey gave in. she began her feast. another day and another victory.  &amp;nbsp;  from behind, the quiet footsteps. gigantic but terrifyingly quiet. it had snuck up on her, attracted by the blood, come to steal her kill. ten times her size, jaws to swallow her whole, the one that feared nothing. dark feathers and thick skin, like a walking tree with jaws.  she fluttered away just out of reach of the snapping teeth, just far enough to get a warning and not a wound. it thrummed its booming call at her, another warning, _""this is my kill now""_, another hunt lost.  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the swift hunter hung away in the distance, shielded by trees. she would wait until the great jaws had taken their fill, and if any remained, she would have her meal. but this one was familiar. they had clashed before, at some other time. they were then not as they were now. it was fleeting pieces of memory, strange and foreign and confusing.  &amp;nbsp;  _i know you. we fought._  &amp;nbsp;  they were immense and heavy bodies, featherless and strong. they were unstoppable. the females watched on. this was perhaps the only chance he'd ever get.  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;it was the crack of horns. the deep rumbles of competitors. a great amount of force, through the head and the neck. scales dislodged, skin bled, feet dug deep into the ground. great frills brandished but not damaged. colours flying, for it was time to mate.   they pushed and brawled, their quarrel carried on for hours. when eventually the younger one gave up, driven off, they paused. this happened every year, always with a new competitor, but this time was different. they had fought before, but not like this.  &amp;nbsp;  _you! you've killed me. i know you._  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;small and struggling, new troubles in a new world. a life half on the shore and half in the water. a strange new realm, unlike the sea. unlike anything else. weight and heft and effort to move, but fewer predators. best to stay above, on the sand and the rocks, but not too far away. fins too stubby to do much more than shuffle, but tail not as elegant and strong as the ones the swimmers have.  teeth always lurking, always ready, under the surface.  teeth from the land! bigger, stronger fins. faster. too fast to escape. death in needle teeth and dry jaws.  &amp;nbsp;

849735,"google felice fawn, you'll get a big dose of both reality and relief--at least, about the fact that there is absolutely nothing fucking wrong with yourself and only with the insecure, angry manchildren of reddit. for those who can't be half-arsed: ff is a very thin, albeit sick 23-year-old woman seemingly literally dependent on the internet and the devotion of her fans. recap? she lost perhaps over 60 pounds due to anorexia nervosa, however after the scandal where she scammed her fans out of 500 pounds worth online (and got away with it), other things started surfacing where it was revealed ff was always the way she was even when she was large; a reflection of that would be the time she bragged about stealing $300 from her mother before she became sick and many who personally knew her came forward to say how self absorbed, vain, and unsatisfied she always was, also frequently adding that she seems to be a magnet for drama and how she got kicked out of her family when she was sixteen. more shit on her on encyclopediadramatica.se but there are many triggers on the article so i don't recommend for anyone battling any sort of body image issues to go there. she is literally idolized simply for her thinness and ""fragility"". very tragic.   i remember fondly when i was fourteen--i was 5'4, petite, and thin with curves. after an unexpected eight day stay at a mental institute, i guess i can say i developed bed. within less than two years i was almost 80 lbs heavier, and the same people who supposedly loved to be around me and supported me left, and my long term boyfriend even went so far as to make me cry with a fake alias over texts the same weekend my grandfather died.   it should be encouraged for people to learn that obesity isn't as a direct link to all the morbid health problems the media harp on all day. media literally glamorizes the unhealthy kind of skinny and anyone who criticizes that dangerous portrayal usually are demonized and people attack them for ""being a jealous fatty"". i have seen far too many horrific images on tumblr that were legitimately personal accounts of someone's anorexia and not thinspo, and my heart breaks for them. their terrors of gaining weight and having even natural fat, etc., usually have some links to unrealistic portrayals glorified seemingly everywhere and also how their peers treat them. direct or indirect links, i don't know. but it was awful and made me angry--not at the people suffering, but at the people behind their torture. and the saddest thing is, it is fueled by fat hatred and fat phobia.  i'm sorry if this wasn't helpful, but please remember your weight is no one's business. three words for anyone, even those who are slim: no. one's. business. go out and fucking wear the thinnest, flimiest, most sheer pair of leggings you can find if it makes you happy! as for me, i suppose i was always twisted so when i do such a thing, it actually makes my heart swell and my eyes are metaphorically filled with tears because it confirms how shitty and brainwashed society is and it's just like fucking weeding out the gene pool of stupidity, but with what conscious options you have for befriending people and laughing at the idiots who obviously feel the need to comment on how their poor, feeble feelings are repulsed because a big girl did x for herself and is actually happy. some people are just terrified of that.   however, yes, reddit can be disgusting and with the way some things get out of hand for the most unreasonable of things, internet just isn't how it used to be, and if for any reason you legitimately start to worry for any aspects of your own health, please try to walk away. reddit is a big walking trigger for a lot of people, not just big people. so, i suppose i'm getting winded, but... take it from me, and perhaps the sad story of felice fawn, walking away from the internet has far less strings attached than any other thing.",1,2,1

769505,"your body converts food to energy â€“ calories. it burns these calories to lift the weights, and recover from your workouts. most guys need at least 3000kcal/day to gainÂ strength and [build muscle](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/) on stronglifts 5Ã—5. [skinny guys](https://stronglifts.com/gain-weight/) with fast metabolisms may need to eat even more.  hereâ€™s why: building muscle is low on your bodyâ€™s priority list. if thereâ€™s a shortage of food, your body will use it for critical tasks first.Â so you canâ€™t recover well on a caloric deficit. and if you canâ€™tÂ recover well, you canâ€™t add weight next workout. you miss reps which means you canâ€™t progress.  eating maintenance calories is better but not ideal. youâ€™re not trying to maintain your situation on stronglifts 5Ã—5 after all. youâ€™re trying to improve it by gaining strength and muscle. eating over maintenance ensures thereâ€™s no food shortage that hinders recovery between workouts.  good calorie calculatorsÂ will suggest guys 16kcal/lb forÂ maintenance. if you weigh 75kg/165lb thatâ€™s 2640kcal. but again, youâ€™re not trying to maintain but improve. and adding weight every workout is hard work. it therefore makes sense to eat more. this brings us to 3000kcal/day.  if that number scares you, remember forms follows function.Â your body changes in response to the work you do. it gets skinny, fat, and weak from a sedentary lifestyle. and it gets strong, muscular, and fit from lifting heavyâ€¦ but only if you give your body the food it needsÂ to train hard and recover.  i know you donâ€™t want to get fat. unfortunately itâ€™s hard to build muscle without gaining any fat. you have toÂ eat more to build muscle. but [you need to eat less to lose fat](https://stronglifts.com/lose-fat/). these goals contradict. if you try doing both, youâ€™ll either end up eating too little to build muscle, or too much to lose fat.  this is why bodybuilders traditionally alternate muscle gaining and fat loss phases. they eat more food during the bulk, but less food during the cut. this is the simplest way to build muscle without gaining fat that actually worksâ€¦ if youâ€™re not obese, havenâ€™t trained before, and donâ€™t use drugs.  obese guys can indeed build muscle while losing fat when they start lifting. their bodies use their fat reserves to build muscle. they build strength and muscle faster without needing as much food. and since muscle is denser than fat, theyÂ end up looking slimmer at the same body-weight.  people who have lifted before canÂ also build muscle while losing fat. thanks to muscle memory you can regain lost muscle and strength faster after a long break. if i quit lifting and resume a year later, iâ€™d rebuild strength and muscle faster than it took the first time â€“ while leaning out.  and if you use drugs or have great genetics, then you can do things that naturals and mere mortals canâ€™t. but most people who try to build muscle while losing fat end up spinning their wheels. they donâ€™t progress because thereâ€™s too much food to lose fat but not enough to build muscle.  you can get away with eating a caloric deficit the first weeks of stronglifts 5Ã—5. if you startÂ light, the weights will increase and youâ€™ll gain some muscle. but the heavier the weights get, the bigger the stress, and the bigger theÂ recover need. youâ€™ll need to eat more to keep progressing.  you wonâ€™t like eating moreÂ if youâ€™re an ex-fatty who worked hard to lose fat. youâ€™ll be afraid to gain it back. same if you have six pack abs â€“ youâ€™ll be afraid to lose it if your body-fat increases from eating more.Â unfortunately you canâ€™t have it all at the same time. you have to choose.  choose muscle. you can easily lose 1lb of fat a week later. but you canâ€™t gain more than [2lb of lean muscle a month](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#rate_of_muscle_gain). and [you need to lift heavy](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#strength_is_size) to gain that much muscle. this requires eating a lot food. besides, a low body-fat is useless if you donâ€™t build muscle mass first â€“ you just end up skinny.  dedicate the next year to building strength and muscle. your body-fat will decrease if you started out obese. if you [started skinny](https://stronglifts.com/gain-weight/) with single digit body-fat, it will increaseÂ to lower double digits. but you can easily decrease it in one year after youâ€™ve added [24lbÂ of lean muscle](https://stronglifts.com/build-muscle/#rate_of_muscle_gain) and squat 300lb.  you might actually not even need to decrease your body-fat later. i donâ€™t have single digit body-fat levels. neither do mostÂ athletes. yet my abs are visible. bigger muscles stick out further. they can push through the fat under your skin. so they can show despite a higher body-fat percentage.  eat quality, nutrient-dense food. you need the vitamins and minerals to help recovery. the occasional junk meal is fine. but you should eat mostly quality food. donâ€™t eat junk food all the time â€“ it builds bad habits that willÂ make you fat if you quit lifting. and itâ€™s bad for your health.  youâ€™ll need to eat three to four meals a day to get your calories. for mostÂ people working 9 to 5 and training around 6, that will be breakfast, lunch, dinner and an extraÂ pre-workout meal. dinner is your post-workout meal. if you train in the morning,Â eat first so you can train harder.  everyÂ meal should have vegetables. a lot of vegetables. think half a plate. the rest should be a good source of protein with carbs and goodÂ fats. example is chicken with broccoli,Â tomato, avocado and a big potato. eat a fruit for desert and youâ€™ve hit all your macro and micronutrients to gain.  ### protein  protein is the main muscle building nutrient. your body uses protein to build new muscle. it also uses proteinÂ to repair damaged muscle tissue after your workouts. you need about 0.82g of protein per pound of body-weight (1.8g/kg). thatâ€™s about 126g of protein if youâ€™re 70kg/154lb.  if youâ€™re obese, your daily protein requirement may look too high with that formula. use your lean body mass instead (without the fat). if you have a normal weight there will be little difference between your body-weight and lean body mass. just use 0.82g/lb in that case.  protein shakes can be tempting. they take less time to prepare, and are cheap. but they donâ€™t keep you full long. and real food contains tons of micro-nutrients on top of just the protein. you need the minerals and vitamins to help recovery, as well as fiber to improveÂ digestion.  most of your protein should therefore come from real food. if you eat like an omnivoreÂ this is easy. eat some meat, chicken, fish orÂ eggs with every meal. a 250g/8oz steak forÂ lunch will provide you with 50g of protein, which is almost aÂ third of your daily required intake.",1,-1,-1
883854,"just out of curiosity, what would you call someone who uses the word ""obese"" to refer to any figure ampler than the most obsessively athletic or anorexic?  there's a lot of talk around here along the lines that the larger of any two female figures is ""fat"" by definition, (regardless of whether she's actually obese or even medically overweight) and thus judging the smaller one as more desirable because ""smaller is always better"".  sounds like you're cherry-picking the least-appealing physical traits you can think of and then just presuming that the bigger of any two women must automatically have those traits.  i wouldn't even call ms. before ""big"", and i doubt she'd even qualify as medically overweight; i didn't see any cellulite on her thighs in that pic, and i've been with gals fuller-figured than her who were smooth and firm through-and-through, so it sounds like you're speaking more from some irrational dread than from actual experience.  it's fine if you prefer gals with a slighter figure and all, but you don't have to justify it to yourself by conjuring up unrealistic mental images of frankly average-figured gals that make them seem as unappealing to you as possible.",1,1,0

653521,"&gt;thatâ€™s some bullshit and it shows you may not have experienced extreme weight gain or loss.  ...oh boy, are you wrong on that one!  i'm 33 right now and fairly fit. until the age of 31, i have always been somewhere between overweight, to obese, to even morbidly obese at my lowest point. i was better at some point than others, but to put it this way: at no point until the age of 31 did i ever experience not having a belly that hung over my belt line.   for a large part of my life i, like you seem to, was convinced that it just couldn't happen to me. that i rolled snake eyes in the genetic lottery. i saw friends and family members do what, i thought at least, was a similar diet to mine, but they'd stay thin, and i stayed fat! unfair! i tried several times, half heartedly sometimes, and in incomplete and ignorant ways - i didn't know better, and neither did my parents (because that's how kids get overweight). at some points i simply gave up - i simply would never be fit... whatever ""fat cell build up"" you can have? i doubt i don't have a lot of it...  you see, i like my fats, and my carbs, and my large portions. a thick ass cheese sandwhich, with a lot of fresh butter and the kind of cheese that just melts with fat? i can eat that shit non stop. i enjoy good food. always have. worse, my satiety reflex, the thing that tells you ""you're full, stop eating""? mine is kind of absent. i remember roughly 2 times in my life when i was like... proper full. couldn't eat another bite. that's why i track all i eat to this day. cause i can still pound back a meal for 4 people, no problem, wash it down with a gallon of juice and chase it with a kilo of ice cream.   and let's not go too far into borderline chronic depression.  let's just say ""comfort eating"" was a thing.  so when it comes to ""handicaps to lose weight"", whatever excuses you wanna find? i can't say i was the absolute worst, but i'm not exactly low down the list, yeah?  ...until i decided ""fuck this"". no bullshit. no excuses. i decided to learn about the process, and stick to it. and guess what? done, boom, easy. about 4 months to go from obese to flat stomach. once you realize that this subject is borderline mathematical, to ""appropriate"" an old idiom: science talks, bullshit walks.   i learned a lot of things along the way. number 1: i thought i knew how to lose weight. i didn't know fuck all. i didn't even know what i was eating, let alone what i should be eating. i learned that a lot more goes on behind the scenes in other people's lives than what we see at face value. a lot of the times that person that ""just stays thin no matter what they eat!"" don't actually eat as much as you think. they might eat a lot at times, but then very little at other times, averaging out at not quite the gargantuan amounts i thought. other times they ate a lot... but they also had a much higher physical activity, or muscular build up (muscle burns more calories than fat kids!), or they were ""skinny fat"", actually building up visceral fat, just not subcutaneous fat... or a million other variables that i wasn't accounting for because all i saw was ""man, we're both going to mcdonalds, but that dude doesn't jiggle like a pack of jello when they jump.  i also learned that, like my past self, whenever people say they're ""doing everything right but just can't lose weight"", they are almost always full of shit. sometimes unintentionally, mind you. sometimes they just don't understand that some of the things they're doing are setting them way back, like people who track their calories all fine and dandy, but then just ""snack a little"". they don't count that! it's just a few calories! yeah, the moment you start adding them up suddenly their supposed 400/500 calorie deficit becomes a 300...400....700 calorie surpluss. or the classic ""i don't need to track my macros, i know what i'm eating!"" dunning krueger bullshit - statistically speaking, unless you've been doing this for a long while or are a professional in the area or something you don't, and you severely underestimate what you eat.   but the most important thing i learned, by a landslide? ""others"" don't fucking matter. at all. 0. when someone else loses or gains weight, what happens to your own weight? fuck all. but here's the thing: that's good! great, in fact! because this is one of the few areas in our lives where, if you're an adult living on your own, it depends almost entirely and exclusively on you. yes, your genetics may help or not, but that only means shit might be a bit easier or harder, and not nearly to the overblown extent most people make it out to be. it really is just a little. the biggest hurdle is psychological.  if you do the process right - maintain a caloric deficit and, if that's a goal for you (and it does help!) add some physical exercise and good protein intake, and do it consistently, you will lose weight, and you will keep that weight off. again, outside of absolutely extreme cases, your genetics don't matter. they matter if you're going for ""competitive body builder"", but for healthy lean? even ""beach lean"" or ""ripped""? not at all.  so, believe me on this one, ""experience"" is something i have a lot of on this subject...",1,-1,
346646,"iâ€™m an older guy who grew up before the internet. i think that made a huge difference because i had no access to information about bbws or â€˜fat admiration.â€™ from my earliest sexual stirrings, i noticed that my eye tended to be drawn in a different direction from that of my buddies. because at that stage the girls i was stirred by tended to be chubby or plump rather than really big, it wasnâ€™t even clear to me at first that there was a pattern here â€“ that those girls were all â€˜fat.â€™ i was quietly aware of not quite fitting in with other guysâ€™ preferences, though, and it didnâ€™t take me too long to figure out the difference.  there were still years of slow, confused discovery ahead. for instance, the â€˜how big?â€™ question. i think for a while i repressed this. because i do find â€˜merely plumpâ€™ (say, 180-200 lbs) women attractive, especially if theyâ€™re bottom-heavy, iâ€™d deflect my own interest in much larger women: ok, iâ€™d think to myself, i like bigger girls, but not that big. as if somehow limiting my tastes to â€˜somewhat fatâ€™ made me more normal. it took me years, probably well into my 20s, to acknowledge that, although iâ€™m still not into the mega-obese â€œmy 600-lb lifeâ€ type, i have a much wider range than just what theyâ€™re nowadays calling â€˜thick.â€™ it all depends on how the gal in question carries it, but i can easily find someone hot who is well over 300 lbs.  then thereâ€™s the whole eating/weight gain thing. iâ€™d been sexually awake and had at least one girlfriend before i started twigging to how unbelievably sexy these are. so again, it took me years to figure that out. iâ€™d had little glimpses, of course, but it wasnâ€™t until my college days that the light began to dawn. whether it was the freshman 15 types, or working summers in a cafeteria and observing fat girls overeating, i started putting two and two together. when, in my mid-20s, i met the woman who became my wife i couldnâ€™t believe my luck. here was a hefty gal (maybe 180 lbs) who clearly loved food. she always took good portions, always went back for dessert, none of this â€œiâ€™m watching my waistlineâ€ stuff. i made sure to bring treats, take her out to dessert places, etc., and it wasnâ€™t long before she was openly overeating in front of me. iâ€™ve really enjoyed her gradual weight gain over the years and her occasional self-stuffing sessions.  so basically it took me a decade to figure out a whole set of questions around my preferences which iâ€™ll bet could have been worked out much sooner in the age of the internet.",1,1,
892822,"the original hmmwv was not designed as a front-line combat patrol vehicle; it was designed with fiberglass sides, plastic zip-up windows, and a canvas roof, for driving around high-ranking people, and to be used for utility purposes (hauling trailers, shuttling small groups of dudes around training areas/ rearward areas, etc). the humvee replaced the old jeep - which was also unarmored and meant for utility/ brass-transport (the high-rank kind, not the kind you have to police up at the end of a day at the range).   fast-forward to gwot (global war on terror). you didn't hear about this much in afghanistan because there are a lot of mountains and a lot of the action happens there. the place does have roads, but the stereotype is that the light-guys go to afghan and the mech guys go to iraq.   so anyway, iraq happens. it's a big flat country with the best-developed national highway system in the mideast, with big stretches of wide open nothing between the cities. naturally, we roll in with huge fucking mechanized columns of abrams, bradleys, 113s, 5-tons, lav-25s, aavs, humvees, hemmits, and whatever those little 4-wheeled apcs are called that mps like to use. just huge columns of vehicles rumbling across the berm and grinding north. so the invasion's over, and we begin the occupation. the fedayeen, the baathist-loyalists, the ia, they're pretty much over with quickly enough so that we go right into occupation-mode - with the vehicles we brought with us.   then, the people who got beef with us figure out that we run our wars on jp8 and rip-its. huge, massive kbr convoys resupplying the fobs. motorized and mechanized patrols doing the majority of the patrolling. vehicles, ya dig? you can't beat an army or marine infantry platoon in a gunfight. so they had to figure out another way to hurt us: ied. the first ones were smaller: mortar and arty rounds, enough to pop a tire, maybe hurt some fellows. probably scratch the paint on an abrams.   they got bigger. suddenly the fiberglass-body, canvas-back humvees were vulnerable. so you hear the ""horror stories"" of fellows lining their floors with sandbags and welding on scrap-metal to armor their unarmored trucks. remember, these trucks are not combat vehicles; the pickup-truck-ones don't have a roof hatch, so the gunner is standing in the bed, his m249/m240 propped up on its bipods on the roof. if it's the full-body one, the gunner's standing out of an open hatch, with no turret walls around him. just a hole in the roof and everything from the waist-up is exposed.   ""the politicians are sending the troops to war without the proper equipment!"" well, they sent them to war with trucks designed to haul mres to a field exercise and told them to conduct combat patrols in them; no shit, it's the wrong equipment.   so we make an armored version. the canvas/fiberglass one, the army called the m998. i'm sure the usmc calls them something different. we come out with one that has a metal body: m1025. they even throw a turret-shield on it, so the gunner has a foot and a half-high metal wall around him and a blast-shield in front where his gun pokes through. his shoulders-up are still exposed, but he can always duck - so that's cool, but as they figure out how to make bigger and better bombs, it doesn't last long.   so they come out with a new model: m1114. this guy's got heavier armor, heavier suspension to handle that armor, a turret-wall for the gunner, air conditioning... it's pretty cool. so we run with that. and the ieds get bigger. so instead of a new model, they just replace some of the cabin armor and the doors with better armor; they call it frag-2. ieds get bigger? frag-3. bombs get better. frag-4. now they're using deep-buried homemade explosive charges and explosively-formed-penetrators and 55gal drums filled with hme and diesel? frag-5 armor kit. also, let's weld/bolt some ballistic glass above the turret-walls, so the gunner can stand up fully and still be protected. also, let's slap some electric turret motors so he doesn't have to hand-crank the heavy sonofabitch anymore. sweet.  partway through 2007, the m1114s were upgraded to frag-5. this is during the troop-surge; things are bad all over. frag-5 is so fucking heavy, if you let the door hang open, you will literally see the hinges begin to bend and the door sag under its own weight. if you park the truck on a grade and it's leaning to one side, good luck pushing that several-hundred-pound door open. bear in mind, at no point did they upgrade the engine, transmission, or suspension - as they tacked on thousands of pounds of extra armor. so these trucks are breaking down fairly frequently from the unrelieved stress. meanwhile, the bombs are getting better.   but that's cool because we've been working on a new truck, since it's silly to continue to pile armor on the already-stressed frame of the 1114. may i present the m1151: its armor/doors have better armor protection than frag-5 but they're lighter, thinner and easier to handle. no need to upgrade manually-operated turrets to electric, or weld on ballistic glass: comes from the factory.   also, some were upgraded with a remote weapons station: mount a 50-cal to the roof and it's controlled by a guy sitting down inside the truck with a joystick and a screen connected to a thermal-camera on the turret. advantages: bracket-mounted gun is more accurate than a guy holding the gun. disadvantages? only 4 passengers fit in the cabin of a humvee, plus the gunner who stands in the turret. driver never dismounts unless he's helping hook up a vehicle to be towed. remove the standing-gunner and make one of the passengers the gunner with the joystick, and you now only have 2 passengers that can dismount - effectively limiting your boots-on-the-ground capability (to conduct raids, foot patrols, etc).   but wait, what happens to all the old m1114s if we're replacing them with the new m1151s? hey iraqi army, want some slightly-used trucks?   so to answer your original question, humvees (since the m1114 came out) have been fitted with bulletproof turret shields - not to the extent of the one you linked to, with overhead protection. but the turrets have walls on the back/right/left, and the gun pedestal has a gun-shield that the gun pokes through.   &gt;  what sorts of advantages are there to having a more 'open' turret?  situational awareness; the gunner is the eyes and ears of the truck since he has the best view and his hearing isn't as muffled by engine noise or radio chatter. that's not to say it's desirable to not have a turret, but having been a humvee gunner (and mrap, same type of turret), i can say i wouldn't want to be closed in like the turret you linked. advantages to that kind of system? it's be harder for someone to drop a grenade down your hatch. disadvantages? i imagine your sa would be slightly lowered, and if a bomb went off under the truck you wouldn't be ejected from the turret but instead smashed against the inside of the roof-glass.  also, i almost forgot the end of the humvee story. the m1151 was in full swing by mid-2007. end of 2007, a new vehicle comes out, mimicking the v-shaped underhull of the eod/engineer buffalos, cougars and rg31s. a vehicle steamlined to be issued to all regular line units: the mrap. you got 3 versions, from smallest to biggest: maxxpro, caiman, rg33. the maxxpro is pretty shitty, but that's forgivable because it's the first mass-produced line-unit mrap to come out, so it kinda paved the way for the awesome-as-fuck caiman and slightly-less-awesome but way-bigger/heavy-as-a-bradley rg33.  the mraps saved a lot of lives; not only can they take a hit way better than a ""deathbox"" (yes we called them that) humvee, but they took a hit better than a bradley fighting vehicle. it was a great idea.   ""what happens to all those m1151s that mraps replaced?"" don't think too hard, it might make you angry next time you file taxes.   then the iraq war ended. then the matv came out and is being used by troops in afghanistan.

(make sure you know they are being honest, cornering us makes us scared because many men fear not being seen as pc.)  let me rewrite my statement if you will.  men in general, prefer women who are slightly overweight to underweight but very few men like a hideously obese woman. i imagine it is much the same for you is it not? would you date/marry/shag a 7 stone man?",1,-2,-1

""oh yeah,"" said beth, ""me likey.""        hannah beamed, ""well, if everything is in order, we'll start the slimming process. who wants to go first?""        britney was a little nervous, and beth was still admiring her hologram, so valerie volunteered. hannah helped her up onto a platform and into the capsule, which was a glass cylinder with a large gasket at the top. valerie stepped into it. motors whined as the cylinder rose around her, and she had to wiggle to get her hips, butt, and belly through the soft seal. fortunately, the cylinder was large enough to accommodate all the extra pounds that valerie was currently lugging around. the chamber rose until the gasket was just below valerie's breasts. then, hannah tapped some buttons on her tablet, and there was a brief hiss as the rubber gasket around valerie's waist inflated, sealing her inside the machine.        now, valerie was a little nervous, ""is this going to beâ€¦ unpleasant?"" she asked, trepidation in her voice.        ""not at all!"" hannah replied, ""in fact, most of our guests find the experience enjoyable. i would describe it as a kind of full-body massage. however, if at any time you do experience discomfort, let me know, and i'll stop the process.""        valerie took a deep breath and let it out, ""okay, girls! wish me luck!""        ""you got this, val!"" britney cheered.        hannah tapped on her tablet once again, and there was a loud whirring sound as the machine started up. at first, not much happened. then, valerie gasped as all the fat in her body suddenly lurched upward.        ""whoaâ€¦"" said valerie.        it happened again. her butt and her belly rapidly rose, pushed upward by some unseen force, only to drop down and jiggle with a soft blorp sound.        ""what does is it feel like?"" britney asked.        valerie's eyes were wide, ""i don't know how to describe it! it's like my fat reserves have the hiccups. whoop!"" it happened again. blorp! and again. blorp! the frequency was increasing.        ""does it feel like you're getting a workout?"" beth asked, curiously.        by this time, valerie's fat was bouncing every second or so, ""kind ofâ€¦"" blorp! ""but i'm notâ€¦"" blorp! ""putting inâ€¦"" blorp! ""any effortâ€¦"" blorp! ""it actuallyâ€¦"" blorp! ""feels good!""        blorp! blorp! blorp! the machine continued humming and valerie's extra pounds continued jiggling. as they did, a faint sound became audible. it sounded a bit like a milkshake being sucked through a straw. squelch! squelch! squelch! valerie gasped and her friends watched with interest as some esoteric combination of technology and magic caused her to shrink. it first became noticeable around her middle. as her belly fat slowly disappeared, her waistline receded. soon, her weight loss became apparent in other areas. her double chin became less noticeable, her thighs narrowed, and her butt deflated.        ""this is amazing! i can actually feel myself shrinking!"" valerie said excitedly.        ""that thing works fast!"" beth agreed, staring at valerie, who now looked more-or-less the way she did when they arrived - not obese, but fairly chubby.        ""where does the fat go?"" britney asked.        ""it's pumped into an enchanted, vacuum-sealed container,"" hannah explained, ""the container is later emptied into a furnace, where the fat is burned as fuel to generate electricity.        ""it literally burns your fat for you? hallelujah!"" beth exclaimed.        ""i am gonna look so hot!"" valerie said as the machine continued working its magic. blorp! squelch! blorp! squelch! by this point, valerie just had thick thighs and a bit of a muffin top, and whatever process had caused her to shrink was also shrinking her bikini. no longer truly chubby, she looked like a supermodel who had let herself go a little. as the last of her unwanted fat was sucked away, her breasts were reduced in size only slightly; they remained quite full and round, just like those of her hologram.        at long last, the machine stopped pumping, and there was a quick ding that sounded like an oven timer going off.        ""all done!"" hannah said, tapping on her tablet once more. there was another loud hiss as the seals on the machine were released. hannah opened the door for valerie, and the vixen stepped out of the machine looking curvy, busty, and undeniably fit. no one looking at her would suspect, even for a moment, that the fox had just gorged herself on pizza and cheesecake. in fact, she looked as though she had just finished up an intensive training regimen. flipping her hair, she runway walked over to the large mirror to gaze at her new body.

'cause i'm 5'5'' and when i was her age i weighed between 117 and 122 pounds, and looked huge in comparison. part of this is because i'm short-waisted and hippy. but i digress, at her lightest, when she was approaching skeletal, when she was so thin even her boobies kinda disappeared/started to sag and her posture was suffering, she probably weighed something along the lines of 105 pounds. she may have weighed even less.   to put this in perspective, the average regular-in-a-tv show 5'3'' actress in hollywood weighs about 105 - 110 pounds and wears a size small (sometimes medium depending on the breast size) top  -  and a size 0 - 4 pant (which means their true waists - not drop waist - measures between 22- 25 inches. now, go measure your girlfriend's waist. i dare you. if she's a size 7/8, she has a 27-28 inch true waist - true waist is where she is thinnest in the middle, above the hips and below the rib cage. a size 8, and she's thin. so imagine how thin these actresses are. so, yes, these numbers will go up a bit as the actresses get taller, but often, the tallest women are also the thinnest - by necessity. the bigger your bone structure, the bigger you look. think christine lahti. she swims in a size 4.    actresses all lie about their weight, and height (if they are quite thin, they will say they are heavier and taller), and, i can't blame them, doing so is a necessary part of building both a career - where they have to be extra tiny to combat the automatic bulking/weight adding effects of their 3d bodies being transformed into 2d imagery- and a social image, where they need the common woman to feel she can be like them, and not reject them for being (probably) unhealthily thin.    from a woman's perspective, the most striking thing about these actresses in person is, they have almost no shape to their hips. often they are shaped rather like pre-pubescent boys, with (sometimes spectacular) boobs. the two best examples of this i've seen in person is alyssia milano, only she's more like 5'2'' tall on a good day, and holly hunter, who is listed as  5'2'' but i swear can't be taller than 5 feet. until i saw her in person, alyssia was the tiniest actress i've ever laid eyes on (and yes, she was stunningly beautiful) but holly wins in the itty bitty contest, hands down.   source: growing up around l.a., with a much-older sister who was a 5'1 inch, 101 pound (and didn't look anorexic) actress and ad print model for most of my childhood; my best friends are a costumer and a makeup artist; i've worked on various sets - i'm common riff-raff, so don't get excited; and i shop at it's a wrap on an embarrassingly regular basis.   for the tl;dr set: most successful film and t.v. actresses are usually shorter, and always thinner, than you think. the camera really does add bulk.   sources: i been around.",1,0,-1

(wrist bone measurement reference image: https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/17182.htm)  u may be not seeing any result because ur not really counting ur calories.  no matter what u do, if u dont keep track the calories u eat, nothing changes.  cos u think u may be eating less, but actually ur taking in more calories than ur body needs because ur not counting the calories.  weight loss and weight gain is done in a very simple way, its called  ""calories in, calories out"".  that means if u eat calories ur body dont need, u will gain weight. if u eat less calories ur body needs, u will lose weight.  if ur body requires 2500 calories a day, eating 3000 calories a day will make u gain weight by 1 kilo every 7 days.  if ur body requires 2500 calories a day, eating less(2000-1000) calories a day will make u lose weight 1-2 kilos every 7 days.  but dont go 1000 calories a day, eating that less calories can kill u.  2100 calories is the minimim calories a person needs to function.  the time of eating doesnt matter.  as long as ur eating more calories or less calories, u will gain or lose weight.  (thats why not eating after 6pm is a myth, it doesnt matter if u dont eat after 6pm, if u eat more calories than ur body needs before 6pm, u will still gain weight.)  (even if u only eat once a day, if in that one meal includes all the calories ur body needs, u will still gain weight.) (time and frequency of eating doesnt matter. what matters is how much calories u are eating.)  (if u ate 2100 calories at breakfast, ur body can function the whole day without eating anymore cos u already ate the whole caloric needs of ur body at breakfast.)  eating fatty foods doesnt make u fat.  too much calories makes u fat.  because unused calories(energy) are transformed by ur body into fat to be used as reserved/backup energy in times when theres no food available to eat and digest.  thats why fat goes away when u dont eat, because ur body uses fat as energy when u dont eat so ur body can function.  1 cup of rice = 250 calories.  4 cups of rice = 1000 calories.  1 glass of coka cola = 180 calories.  1 liter of coka cola(4 glasses) = 1000 calories.  1 sachet pack of skyflakes = 120 calories.  10 sachet pack of skyflakes = 1000 calories.  1 liter of red horse beer = 700 calories.  1 flat can of century tuna = 60 calories.  17 flat cans of century tuna = 1000 calories.  3 tablespoons of bear brand milk = 150 calories  30 tablespoons of bear brand milk = 1500 calories.

562671,"i was seventeen years old when i heard the horse cries. the sound was new to me then, but thereâ€™s something unmistakable about the awful primal moan you hear when a creature is dead. iâ€™m used to that misery now, but as a young woman i couldnâ€™t imagine walking home without trying to help whatever poor creature made them sounds. i sprang through the woods right quick dodging conifers and leaping over rock. i settled at the edge of a small cliff and peered through piney branches at a depression some ten meters below me. it wasnâ€™t so much a battle as what was heading towards a slaughter; four grizzly bears, hungry and angry after hibernation, cornered four horses. every hair on my childish ass done stood on end then, the way it would if you stepped on a branch that turned out to be big ole snake. grizzly bears are fearsome creatures by themselves. four adults grouped together on one hunt â€“ i never heard of something like that happening before. it was downright supernatural. yet even in the clamor of tortured cries and hungry growls, even with the terrifying sight of four massive grizzlies, it was hard not to notice them horses. their color was so brilliant it seemed otherworldly. the first was the whitest white i had ever seen, so white it glowed in the sun and damn near blinded me. the second was red but not no normal red, a fiery red that looked hot to the touch. the third was a black horse so dark it sucked the light into it, like a hole in a painting except the painting was real life. finally, there was the pale horse. not white or gray or blue, some mixture that was just pale, and frankly gave me the shivers.  i remember acting decisively. i had a knife, a leather pouch of bullets and a yellow boy that was too big for me but i had to carry anyhow because tensions were high with the kerns down south. the grizzlies were picking their targets, not used to working in concerto and i would guess not experienced with eating horses anyhow. i climbed a tree and hacked off a few branches on my way up, cursing the fact i decided to wear a pale yellow dress that day. there wasnâ€™t no manual on how to shoot bears and survive, so i wasnâ€™t sure where i got the idea to cut them branches. it was instinctual. i aimed down the site of the winchester rifle and opened fire on the bears.  to this day, i wish iâ€™d shot them horses instead.  on account of their sizes i thought of the bears as hungry siblings. little brother took off running the moment it heard the first blast. little sister took off after i clipped her shoulder. the larger pair identified me immediately and scrambled up the cliff like it were carpeted stairs. big brother made it to the base of the tree when i put one into his right eyeball. big sister made it right up the tree when i shot her in the chest. she snagged onto my right leg and gave me the biggest scars i have, but collapsed under the branch i cut and fell to the ground. i was victorious, but victory didnâ€™t feel too good. my head rang from the battle rush, my heart pounded like a mojave drum, and my leg had a hell of a gash that rained blood onto the corpses of big brother and big sister below me. but most of all, i felt sad. them bears seemed like a family.  the four horses appeared on my ridge while i cut a piece of dress off to tie my wound. when i noticed they now had riders, i snatched up my rifle and trained it on them. but they didnâ€™t look like no kernish people to me. at first it was hard to describe them at all. the rider of the white horse dressed in fine clothes, smiled a bright white smile with teeth that could have been stole off his horses glowing ass, and his saddlebag jingled with the sound of loose rifle rounds. each rider after him looked to be in worse shape than the one before. a barebacked man with long red hair rode the fiery horse, and carried a big funny sword whose blade rested on his shoulder. a skinny man in dusty, torn black clothing rode the black horse. he slouched in the saddle and looked close to death. an apple dropped from his hand and splatted on the ground. rotten. the last man looked skin and bone. he wore shabby clothes that clung to his bony body for dear life, and i could see his teeth through the bandanna covering his face. but i couldnâ€™t see no lips, beard, or face. no hair flowed out from underneath his cowboy hat, neither. i donâ€™t remember exactly what they told me, they just thanked me for saving their horses and said they owed me. i got the shuddering feeling that i didnâ€™t want future transactions with them of any kind.  that was one wedding, two births, and many years ago, but i seen glimpses since. when war broke out with the kerns, i saw the white rider speaking with our leaders at a war council. i was mighty suspicious of him, but something about that bright smile and glowing horse made people revere him. they saw an angel, and now i do believe they met with a devil. the white rider brought war and large promises like those spoke by the saloon card dealer. war made everything hard. we had to think twice before setting cattle to pasture, three times before visiting a faraway neighbor, and think nothing at all of distant screams in the night. i sent my son to live with his cousins far away from the war, but couldnâ€™t afford to send his sister with him. i never saw my son again.  some time later i saw the red rider amid constant strife. with our fighting men gone the town was beset by all kinds of rustlers, criminals, kidnappers and worse. at night weâ€™d hear the sound of thundering hooves, and in the morning see smoke from another home looted and burnt. people started leaving their ranches and coming into town for protection at night, crowding into the town hall or the church or even the stables. usually at night i perched up on the roof and took shots at raiders until they died or fled. then one night my stomach dropped: on the horizon i saw my own home lit up like a candle in the darkness. no one believed me, but i swear i saw the red riderâ€™s long hair illuminated by the blaze and his great sword flashing in the firelight. some time later we got a message that my husband had been killed fighting the kerns.  the worst was yet to come.  with nothing but my daughter left in the world i swore to keep her safe and with me at all times. we planned on trading my rifle for food and taking off on our family mare, but then i saw the shabby black rider. he trotted through fields and skirted around what farm animals hadnâ€™t been stolen, still skinnier than the corn stalks he hid behind. all hope stopped with him and the famine he wrought. people said we started starving because there wasnâ€™t anyone left growing and harvesting and herding and butchering. but i knew the truth as well as i knew the hunger that gnawed my stomach and stole my fat; the black rider had come. my rifle wasnâ€™t worth two ears of corn now, and i soon fed the brown mare to my daughter. over time our bodies thinned, our hair fell out, and our bellies distended. many times i tried to scream at the black rider only to have the sound catch in my parched throat. finally, i saw the pale horse. hell followed with him. i was exhausted, iâ€™d cried all the water out of me, and thought i hallucinated into the darkness when i saw its rider. i was too hungry, to weak, and too near death myself to stop the pale rider as he rattled into our town hall. he put a bony finger to the lips of every man, woman, and child. everyone except me. first, my daughter started coughing. the next morning they all did. the next week they were gone. anyone still gasping for air when the kerns came were finished by them.  that was forty years ago. for forty years, iâ€™ve had nothing but time to think and hate. i think about those bears, and in my dreams they have human faces that look an awful lot like my husband and my daughter and my son. i wake up from nightmares and shoot blindly into the dark, hoping to hear the whine of a fiery red horse or eerie pale one. i hate the kerns, i hate the riders, and i hate the emptiness of the west. most of all, i hate that the apocalypse of my home and my people was just a blip in the history of man, a small footnote in the long and endless history of war, strife, famine, and plague.  the riders came into my home last night to make me an offer. my hate for them still runs deep, but i hate the kerns â€“ and the world â€“ more. i accepted their offer to be the fifth horseman of the apocalypse. the world will soon see horses of white, red, black, pale, and blue.  i am annihilation.",0,,

141556,"fbi effort will build biggest biometric database # $1 billion project will expand information; critics of plan worried about impact on privacy by ellen nakashima  washington post article launched: 12/27/2007 03:03:49 am pst  clarksburg, w.va. -- the fbi is embarking on a $1 billion effort to build the world's largest computer database of peoples' physical characteristics, a project that would give the government unprecedented abilities to identify individuals in the united states and abroad.  digital images of faces, fingerprints and palm patterns are flowing into fbi systems in a climate-controlled, secure basement here.  next month, the fbi intends to award a 10-year contract that would significantly expand the amount and kinds of biometric information it receives.  and in the coming years, law enforcement authorities around the world will be able to rely on iris patterns, face-shape data, scars and perhaps even the unique ways people walk and talk to solve crimes and identify criminals and terrorists.  the fbi will also retain, upon request by employers, the fingerprints of employees who have undergone criminal background checks so the employers can be notified if employees have brushes with the law.  ""bigger. faster. better. that's the bottom line,"" said thomas bush, assistant director of the fbi's criminal justice information services division, which operates the database from its headquarters in the appalachian foothills.  the increasing use of biometrics for identification is raising questions about the ability of americans to avoid unwanted scrutiny.  it is drawing criticism from those who worry that people's bodies will become de facto national identification cards.  critics say that such government initiatives should not proceed without proof that the technology really can pick a criminal out of a crowd.  the use of biometric data is increasing throughout the government.  for the past two years, the defense department has been storing in a database images of fingerprints, irises and faces of more than 1.5 million iraqi and afghan detainees, iraqi citizens and foreigners who need access to u.s. military bases.  the pentagon also collects dna samples from some iraqi detainees, which are stored separately.  the department of homeland security has been using iris scans at some airports to verify the identity of travelers who have passed background checks and who want to move through lines quickly. the department is also looking to apply iris- and face-recognition techniques to other programs.  the department of homeland security has a database of millions of sets of fingerprints, which includes records collected from u.s. and foreign travelers stopped at borders for criminal violations, from u.s. citizens adopting children overseas and from visa applicants abroad.  ""it's going to be an essential component of tracking,"" said barry steinhardt, director of the technology and liberty project of the american civil liberties union. ""it's enabling the always-on-surveillance society.""  if successful, the system planned by the fbi, called next generation identification, will collect a wide variety of biometric information in one place for identification and forensic purposes.  in an underground facility the size of two football fields, a request reaches an fbi server every second from somewhere in the united states or canada, comparing a set of digital fingerprints against the fbi's database of 55 million sets of electronic fingerprints.  a possible match is made -- or ruled out -- as many as 100,000 times a day.  soon, the server at criminal justice information services headquarters will also compare palm prints and, eventually, iris images and face-shape data such as the shape of an earlobe.  if all goes as planned, a police officer making a traffic stop or a border agent at the airport could run a 10-fingerprint check on a suspect and within seconds know whether the person is on a database of the most wanted criminals and terrorists.  an analyst could take palm prints lifted from a crime scene and run them against the expanded database. intelligence agents could exchange biometric information worldwide.  more than 55 percent of the search requests now are made for background checks on civilians in sensitive positions in the federal government, and jobs that involve children and the elderly, bush said.  currently those prints are destroyed or returned when the checks are completed. but the fbi is planning a ""rap-back"" service, under which employers could ask the fbi to keep employees' fingerprints in the database, subject to state privacy laws, so that if that employees are arrested or charged with a crime, the employers would be notified.  advocates say bringing together information from a wide variety of sources and making it available to multiple agencies increases the chances of catching criminals.  the pentagon has already matched several iraqi suspects against the fbi's criminal fingerprint database. the fbi intends to make criminal and civilian data available to authorized users, officials said.  there are 900,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers who can query the fingerprint database today, they said.  the fbi's biometric database, which includes criminal history records, communicates with the terrorist screening center's database of suspects and the national crime information center database, which is the fbi's master criminal database of felons, fugitives and terrorism suspects.  the fbi is building its system according to standards shared by britain, canada, australia and new zealand.  at the west virginia university center for identification technology research, 45 minutes north of the fbi's biometric facility in clarksburg, researchers are working on capturing images of people's irises at distances of as much as 15 feet and of faces from as far away as 200 yards.  soon, those researchers will do biometric research for the fbi.  covert iris- and face-image capture is several years away, but it is of great interest to government agencies.  think of a navy ship approaching a foreign vessel, said bojan cukic, the center's co-director.  ""it would help to know before you go on board whether the people on that ship that you can image from a distance, whether they are foreign warfighters, and run them against a database of known or suspected terrorists,"" he said.  skeptics say that such projects are proceeding before there is evidence that they reliably match suspects against a huge database.  in the world's first large-scale scientific study on how well face recognition works in a crowd, the german government this year found that the technology, though promising, was not effective enough to allow its use by police.  the study was conducted from october 2006 through january at a train station in mainz, germany, which draws 23,000 passengers daily.  the study found that the technology was able to match travelers' faces against a database of volunteers more than 60 percent of the time during the day, when the lighting was best. but the rate fell to 10 percent to 20 percent at night.  to achieve those rates, the german police agency said it would tolerate a false positive rate of 0.1 percent, or the erroneous identification of 23 people a day. in real life, those 23 people would be subjected to further screening measures, the report said.  accuracy improves as techniques are combined, said kimberly del greco, the fbi's biometric services section chief. the next generation database is intended to ""fuse"" fingerprint, face, iris and palm matching capabilities by 2013, she said.  to safeguard privacy, audit trails are kept on everyone who has access to a record in the fingerprint database, del greco said. people may request copies of their records, and the fbi audits all agencies that have access to the database every three years, she said.  ""we have very stringent laws that control who can go in there and to secure the data,"" bush said.  marc rotenberg, executive director of the electronic privacy information center, said the ability to share data across systems is problematic.  ""you're giving the federal government access to an extraordinary amount of information linked to biometric identifiers that is becoming increasingly inaccurate,"" he said.  in 2004, rotenberg's group objected to the fbi's exemption of the center's database from the privacy act requirement that records be accurate. the group noted that the bureau of justice statistics in 2001 found that information in the system was ""not fully reliable"" and that files ""may be incomplete or inaccurate.""  fbi officials justified that exemption by saying that in law enforcement data collection, ""it is impossible to determine in advance what information is accurate, relevant, timely and complete.""  privacy advocates worry about the ability of people to correct false information. ""unlike say, a credit card number, biometric data is forever,"" said paul saffo, a silicon valley technology forecaster.  he said he feared that the fbi, whose computer technology record has been marred by expensive failures, could not guarantee the data's security. ""if someone steals and spoofs your iris image, you can't just get a new eyeball,"" saffo said.",0,,

'captain!' bellowed pasanius. 'i know!' shouted uriel, leaping onto the bucking monster's back. the giant tyranid beast struggled to right itself, but uriel reversed the grip of his sword and drove the blade downwards through its skull.  hypersonic tyranid warrior confirmed.  &gt;karras barely had time to register the sheer size of balthazog bludwrekkâ€™s twin bodyguards, before their blistering assault began. they were easily the largest orks he had ever seen, even larger than the door guards he and rauth had slain, and they wielded their massive two-handed warhammers as if they weighed nothing at all. under normal circumstances, orks of this size and strength would have become mighty warbosses, but these two were nothing of the kind.  the two space marines opened fire at the same time, eager to drop the bodyguards and engage the real target quickly. their bolters chattered, spitting their deadly hail, but somehow each round detonated harmlessly in the air. â€˜heâ€™s shielding them!â€™ karras called out. â€˜draw your blade!â€™ he dropped the cryo-case from his shoulder, pulled arquemann from its scabbard and let the power of the immaterium flow through him, focusing it into the ancient crystalline matrix that lay embedded in the blade. â€˜to me, xenos scum!â€™ he roared at the hulking beast in front of him. the bodyguardâ€™s massive hammer whistled up into the air, then changed direction with a speed that seemed impossible. karras barely managed to step aside. sparks flew as the weapon clipped his left pauldron, sending a painful shock along his arm. the thick steel floor fared worse. the hammer left a hole in it the size of a human head. the ork bodyguard, on the other hand, did not miss its chance. it caught karras squarely on the right pauldron with the head of its hammer, shattering the deathwatch insignia there, and knocking him sideways, straight off his feet. the impact hurled karras directly into rauthâ€™s opponent, and the two tumbled to the metal floor. karrasâ€™ helmet was torn from his head, and rolled away.  considering that those space marines can barely see this orks in action, they are obviously very beyond hypersonic. mach 10+ orks confirmed.

blades blackened to minimise the chance of them glinting in the light and giving away their ownersâ€™ positions. there were seven of them, each a deadly foe in its own right, but even when taken by surprise, daelin was not about to easily fall victim to this xenos filth. he drew his bolt pistol and stitched a row of shots up the first orkâ€™s chest, culminating in a final shell between the alienâ€™s deep-set red eyes that blew its skull apart. then its fellows were on him. daelin lashed out with fists and feet and his mechatendrils, his every thought now focused on combat and survival. he shattered an orkâ€™s ribcage with a punch, lopped off an axe-wielding hand with his powerblade, grabbed a green-skinned wrist and pointed it at another ork even as the first one pulled the trigger of its firearm. he jerked his head backwards to avoid snapping, fang-strewn jaws, and ducked a decapitating swing, but there were too many blows to avoid altogether. he felt a shell carom off his left pauldron, and two strong hands seized one of his mechatendrils and hauled him sideways, directly into the path of a huge axe. the weapon, razor-edged and powered by the orkâ€™s brute strength, sheared through daelinâ€™s ceramite breastplate and buried itself into his torso. daelin roared in pain and anger: anger at the greenskinâ€™s temerity, and anger at his own fleshâ€™s weakness in registering the wound. his powerblade buried itself in the skull of the ork who had hold of his mechatendril and it dropped like a stone. he lashed out sideways with a boot, ignoring the screaming agony in his chest as he did so, and sent another ork crashing into the one whose ribs heâ€™d broken, even while seizing the throat of the axe-wielder in front of him. the ork snarled in anger and released its weapon to grab at his wrist, looking to prise it loose. daelin brought his bolt pistol up to put a shell through its head, but the ork let go of his left wrist with one hand and grabbed at the bolt pistol as well. they struggled for a moment, xenos muscle against warp-infused, genetically engineered might, before one of daelinâ€™s mechatendrils snaked up to pluck the bolt pistol from his hand and fire it before the ork could react. it fell backwards, now missing half of its head. daelinâ€™s backplate shivered as it turned a blow from another ork blade, but one of his mechatendrils extended a foot-long steel spike and rammed it into the orkâ€™s eye socket. daelin wrenched the axe out of his chest, releasing a gout of black blood as he did so. iron within, iron without. the weaponâ€™s edge had been dulled by his bloodâ€™s corrosive properties, but it was still keen enough to sever at the elbow the other arm of the ork from whom heâ€™d already taken a hand. the ork howled in pain and rage, and flung itself at him bodily: daelin swatted it aside, and into one of its fellows. it was the ork whose ribs heâ€™d broken, and the xenos showed almost admirable fortitude in rolling the handless ork off itself and staggering up to continue the fight, but it was alone and injured. daelin emptied the rest of his bolt pistolâ€™s clip into it to put it down, then advanced on the last member of the infiltrating party, which was trying to struggle up while leaking blood from two stump-ended limbs.  another case for hypersonic orks.    &gt;cortez would have enjoyed watching his friendâ€™s martial prowess in action, but two snarling orks, marginally smaller and lighter-skinned than the monster cortez had just slain, lunged at him from both sides. cortez slid backwards a single step, and the aliensâ€™ crude blades cut empty air. he did not give them time to recover. every blow they missed was an opening he was conditioned to exploit. lunging to the right, he rammed his combat blade deep into the belly of one, so deep he felt its point catch on the inner surface of the beastâ€™s vertebrae. instantly, he yanked back on the knifeâ€™s grip. the serrations on the back of the blade caught on the creatureâ€™s innards, and ripped them out through the gaping hole in its skin. for an instant, the creature stood looking down at its own looped intestines, a look of dumb curiosity on its idiot face. cortez had already turned to the other, kicking at its leading knee, hard enough to smash the kneecap to pieces. the ork went down on its other knee with a roar of anger and pain.  notice how cortez has to actually focus on the fight here and the fight lasted long enough for the orks to trade ""blows"" with him? instead of ""hypersonic reflexes lol"" and an easy speed blitz, since the orks would literally be standing still to someone with hypersonic reflexes, where every single twitch of the orks would be in slow motion. ever watched days of future past? yeah, that scene comes to mind. this applies anytime where space marines are fighting orks or nids or tau and don't view them as statues",0,,
623617,"10.    only pretty girls are allowed to cry. but why would they, when they have everything? i'm sitting in a pile of wrappers-- ten mcdonald's meals. ten burgers, ten orders of fries, ten drinks-- all trapped inside the expanse of my abdomen. swelling it, and as i look at my distended middle, i can almost smell the rot of my necrotic flesh, as my beautiful body dies before my very eyes. i hear it gurgle and i sigh, getting up to compromise, to sever the ties that bind my belly in the bathroom. i stroke my neck with my fat fucking fingers as gently as i'd stroke a murderer with my fists; and my throat's in remiss as i'm revisited by the slime that passed my lips less than half an hour ago. an estuary of liquid copper forces it's way between my teeth and in the toilet bowl, and i look up and catch my reflection in the mirror, and i can't help but wonder if vomiting burns calories. i can't help but wonder if i'm ever going to look like a pretty girl, because my daddy's been saying i'm a princess since the day i was born-- but i recently turned 16 and all anyone else has ever called me is ""pig.""   9.    i skipped school today. i didn't want to be around the other kids, looking the way i do. i know i probably look as (fat?) normal as ever, but i can't shake the feeling that i'm just afraid to go. my parents will never know, anyway, not when they're working 5-9. plus i figured if i stay home, i won't have to eat. i broke the rule, though. i ate a little bit. i undid it, though, and i'm back on track now. i went running for an hour and i won't eat tomorrow, then i should be okay.  8.    i heard you burn calories eating celery. i don't think it's worth the risk, though, food is food, and food is fat. (ha, that might mean *i* am food!) i had to go to school today, but i didn't eat. i didn't eat today, actually. i wanted to, i bought my lunch and everything, but as soon as i sat down, my stomach spilled into my lap, and i just couldn't. it's so big.. and i'm so heavy. i feel weighed down by my corpulence. i usually spend my lunchtimes alone, anyway, so no one noticed when i threw it away. i had pe next anyway, and i didn't want to run on a full stomach. i mean, my stomach's already full of fat, i don't need it to be even heavier with food in it as well.  7.    i did it! it's working. i'm smaller-- i lost 5kg. but i don't look different.. same fat arms, same tree trunk thighs, same fat stomach-- even without food in it. i have to keep going. i have to keep running.. i have to stay strong.  6.    i think my scale's broken. i lost another 5kg, but i still look disgusting. people are starting to stare at me. i have to try harder. maybe it's because i'm still eating? but.. how could an apple a day make me fat? it couldn't, right? if i don't eat, i'll plateau.. maybe i'll lose weight anyway-- after all, if i keep exercising, where's the energy coming from? my stomach will get smaller soon enough-- soon enough i'll be marble-sculpted and glowing like alabaster.   5.    i stopped eating, for the most part. i'm not starving myself, but my stomach's so small now that any little bit gets me full. it feels like a brick wall. the black hole in my chest keeps tugging on it, but it doesn't feel so bad when i sit down, anymore. it's not in my lap anymore. my arms don't jiggle so much. i can feel my cheekbones when i touch my face. but it's not pretty, yet. this is okay, though. i'm almost there. then i can eat again.  4.    we were in the changing rooms today, and one of the other girls-- mary, one of the only nice ones -- danced up to me and grabbed my fat between her thumb and her pointer finger. ""wow, you're so skinny!"" i blushed, and she looked pleased with herself. i felt nothing but shame.  3.    i haven't seen my parents in three weeks. they're always working overtime, and i think dad's been spending his offtime with his secretary. i don't really care, my parents had a mono-dimensional marriage, but i'm disappointed that he isn't around to see how i'm not ugly anymore. i'm not pretty, yet, but now if he calls me princess, he isn't lying so much.  2.    the sky starts to swim sometimes. blue brown black like a big bruise bleeding across the horizon, bubbles blowing across my field of vision and dancing in the back of my mind. i can't focus in school anymore, i'm too dizzy, my grades are dropping faster than the numbers on the scale. 4 more kilograms and i still can barely feel my ribs.  1.    i threw up this morning. it was bile, of course, and it wasn't a lot, but i'm probably lighter now. that's why i like running so much, because after you wash away all the sweat, you're usually half a kilo lighter. i love feeling lighter, it's like blurring the lines between earth and sky. it's like flying, but you stay grounded.  0.    water is all i drink nowadays. all i consume, actually. but it feels so good, to fill my emptiness with emptiness. like if someone were to take a cross-section of my body, they'd still be able to see through my stomach. that's how it should be. my nails are peeling and my hair's fallen out but at least i'm getting there. i'm getting there-- not thin yet, not *pretty* yet. i don't have the energy to exercise anymore, but i haven't eaten in days. it's fine. now there's a rock of resolution that weighs me down, every time i see food. if i see food, i salivate, but i don't give in. because there's something about the way that i can count the bones in my body like the lines in a limerick that makes me swell with pride. it's almost like a prize that i can fit a finger in my intercostal muscles and i can play my ribs like a xylophone-- like the anthem of the slowly shrinking, slowly successful. i'm not there yet, but i will be. just a bit more, then i can eat again. soon, i'll be thin.    soon, i'll be perfect.",1,-2,2

[common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_law) is the legal system used by countries with british historical roots, notably the uk, the usa, australia and canada.  it is a body of law that dates back to the 13th century.    [civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romano-germanic law), also called roman law is the continental european legal system.  they are totally different.  one big difference is that common law recognizes a right to bear arms and civil law does not.    i am unaware of a duty to retreat in the roman law system.  it is uniquely a common law principle.  and, i grant the point that the usa has in recent time diverged from the ancient common law system, because, i guess, that our gun culture likes to shoot people. (aka blood lust.)   regardless, we live in a legal system with solid ancient roots that include a duty to retreat when possible before using lethal force.",0,,

809903,"the composition of diet matters enormously.  a simple ""calories in, calories out"" conception doesn't work.  there has been a dramatic shift towards refined carbohydrates and a reduction in fat intake over most of the world in the last generation.  sugar intake has skyrocketed.  the last surge in american obesity coincided with the low-fat craze.  furthermore factory farming, food processing, soil depletion, and avoidance of animal organ meat and fat has lowered micronutrient and vitamin intake.  soil depletion is probably the most important issue here; vegetables have a fraction of the mineral content they did years ago.  all our food is substantially less nutritious than it was.  people eat excessive calories because they are actually malnourished and their body is telling them so.  something like 30% of americans are deficient in vitamin a, for one example.  another suspect is endocrine disruptors from plastics and pesticides.  all over the world sperm counts and testosterone levels have fallen by about half since the 1940s.  this is best explained by the prevalence of xenoestrogens.  female hormones cause higher body fat composition while testosterone causes lower body fat.  the growth of the automobile lifestyle all around the world is a big contributor to obesity.  where people walk a lot they are generally thin, and people are fat where they drive a lot.  the human body is a machine built for walking long distances every day.  intelligence as a hominid evolutionary adaptation was really secondary to the ability to cover large distances more efficiently than most other land animals by bipedal walking.  one could simply blame fat people who live in suburbia for not getting more exercise, but telling people to jog on a treadmill for 20 minutes a day runs against genetic wiring.  we want to walk to places, but we can't.  and i think more blame lies with those responsible for civil infrastructure than with individual laziness.  in america a conspiracy of corporations and government at all levels worked to gut walkable towns and create massive suburban sprawl built for automobiles only.  it was a development the average joe didn't have very much control over.  the corporate jobs went out to the sprawl before the people did.",1,0,

709041,"**highs and lows**  **lows -**   where do we begin? in one of the worst seasons in franchise history, itâ€™s hard to pick just a few moments, but here are what i consider the worst.   **new york eludes a winless season and picks up their first victory versus lar -**   winning a game and avoiding 0-16 should be a good thing, right? not so fast. the biggest fear of any jets fans heading into the late season was winning a game and knocking us out of the number 1 overall pick. the tankfortrevor train was full steam, and weary jets fans identified a few trap games throughout the season, namely the raiders, browns, and week 17â€™s matchup against the patriots, but iâ€™m not sure many fans were worried about squeaking out a win versus a good rams team. however from the very beginning, this game had a different feel. the jets jumped out to a quick 13-3 lead and were largely in control throughout the first half. the 2nd half was filled with moments that wouldâ€™ve allowed the rams to pull ahead and control the game, take a 28 yard touchdown run being called back, or mcvay choosing to go for it in field goal range and failing, or jets punter braden mann making a game saving tackle on a potential pr for a td, but in another sick jets twist, the jets would prevail. the lawrence dream was effectively over at this point. due to sos, the jags were in control of the 1.01, and they were not letting it go (yes, they were tanking too). the echo of â€œeven when the jets win, they loseâ€ was all too familiar for jets fans.   **gase mismanagement of becton -**   while this moment could have gone a lot worse, it was a low point that i think was overlooked by the national media. heading into a week 4 matchup against denver, lt mehki becton was out but dressed with a shoulder injury he sustained in the previous weeks matchup against indianapolis. this is a no-brainer. becton is your rookie franchise lt who will be protecting your qb for the next 15 years, donâ€™t play him, right? not according to adam gase. 90 seconds into the game, bectons replacement chuma edoga went down with an injury, and becton went into the game. becton only lasted until halftime, and wouldnâ€™t appear in the game again. post game, gase said â€œbecton tried to come in, he went as long as he could, but he couldnâ€™t go anymoreâ€¦ he just had no strength.â€ in a fortunate turn of events, becton didnâ€™t severely injure himself further, and was back in the lineup 3 weeks later versus buffalo and would go on to continue his stellar rookie campaign. regardless, every nfl fan (minus jets ownership) knew how horrible of a coach gase was, but iâ€™m not sure many fans predicted he would be this stupid to potentially injure a star rookie.   **leâ€™veon bell gets cut -**   a disastrous contract from the very start, once again thanks to football genius mike macaggnan, bell was given $28 million dollars for just 4 touchdowns in 18 games. gase and bell reportedly never really got on the same page, he even admitted that he got complacent after he was given his contract, and overall in his time here, he just never even looked close to being the back he was in pittsburg. making matters worse, his subpar play and massive contract made him arguably a negative asset for new york, so the only real option was to cut him. i donâ€™t think fans were necessarily sad he was gone, but this was just another stereotypical, embarrassing jets free agent bust that fans of the team had seen time and time again.   **high points -**   iâ€™m gonna cheat a little bit here and not necessarily pick singular moments. a 2-14 team (shockingly) does not have many of those, but there were some impressive performances from young players that were enjoyable to watch.   **everything mehki becton -**   the 6 foot 7, 364 pound mountain of a man exceeded expectations coming into his rookie season. i can try and write a paragraph about some awesome pancake blocks, or him throwing guys off the screen, but i just canâ€™t do his dominance justice. instead, here are [39 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x6ruyrbpug) of becton blocks broken down by great brian baldinger.   **the dominance of quinnen williams -**   the last of the draft picks of the tumultuous mike maccagnan regime, williams was selected 3rd overall in the 2019 draft, but had a rough rookie season in new york. many fans, myself included, were left frustrated by his lack of production, especially compared to stellar seasons from guys like josh allen and ed oliver. tides would soon turn, however, as williams excelled in his sophomore campaign, racking up 7 sacks, 10 tfl, 14 qb hits, 3 pd, and 2 ff. once again, iâ€™m cheating in the sense that there is no defining quinnen williams moment that can be viewed as a high, instead, enjoy [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msbbesbbxy8) of his phenomenal sophomore campaign. between becton and williams, the jets have two legitimate building blocks with all-pro potential that the team can turn too.   **frank gore reaches 16k**  jets fans had a bit of a strained relationship with frank gore, to not fault of his own, but gase consistently played gore over young backs like laâ€™mical perine, ty johnson, and josh adams. nonetheless it was very cool to watch the ageless wonder frank gore get 16,000 rushing yards. gore is a legend, and will end up in canton when it's all said and done.",0,,

954512,"&gt; upon shedding the sheath of mortality, does a man remain man? or has he, perhaps, become something else?   â€”        	mr. marshall night jr.   -- daniel stared up at the bronze statue of the companyâ€™s founder, smiling pleasantly alongside the character of his creation: an astronaut with a jetpack on his back and raygun tucked in his waistband. moon-man held mr. nightâ€™s hand, and they both seemed to be stuck in a loping mid-stride, as if eternally captured partway through a long, strident walk toward some welcome future. the two giants occupied a spot at the top of the towering gate that would let them into the park-city.    â€œhey, you think the phoebus fall spans as far as it did back in the day? i think i read somewhere it went from a couple hundred meters past the entrance to the *exact middle* of the park! which is, like, 9 miles in. i can't freaking *wait!*â€  he wondered what terrible death had befallen the workers of night &amp; day park after their fortune had failed them so thoroughly. daniel was a bit of a historian (self-proclaimed, but highly knowledgeable), and had read almost every book written on the subject of day &amp; night co. in the last 30 years. as far as he could recall, the official investigators hadnâ€™t recovered a single body after the incident of â€™87â€¦ but every one of them remembered the screams, the pleas for less pain, the moans for mercy, â€œno more! no more!â€   â€œdan? yo! you alright?â€  it was a wonder heâ€™d come for the grand re-opening at all, having been immersed in the horror of thousands for so many years. though if pressed, of course, he would admit that this was an immutable part of his life. he would sooner be absent at the birth of his first-born child than miss a piece of day &amp; night history. some hobbyists collected space rocks, or retro laser weaponry, or fallen artifacts from the melody people; they built abyss-boats, and 4-d puzzles, and antique androids...   his hobby just happened to be obsessing over the mysterious workings of this galaxies-wide conglomeration and how itâ€™s been the target of violent and murderous protest since its inception, over five centuries ago. daniel collected almost anything related to day &amp; night, and its &amp; its enemiesâ€™ misdeeds: old holo-clippings regarding a death or two in some d&amp;n factory, outdated holo-boards with protests sparking on them, manifestos about the daily injustices brought about by d&amp;n and the inhumane treatment of d&amp;n's employees, interviews with starbound hitmen who'd been bought by d&amp;n officials to silence protestors or had been hired by d&amp;n rivals to assassinate d&amp;n officials.   casey pulled daniel forward, muttering, ""i don't care if you *did* just have stroke, we're not losing our place on line."" said line spanned forward for at least a half-mile, ending before great, building-tall gates wrought from some shining alloy. a huge rendition of the company's symbol clasped the gate: d&amp;n encapsulated by moon-man the cosmonaut's iconic helmet. back, behind them, the line curved and twisted, vanishing into a distant dot on the pale, flat horizon. one cold sun had peaked, and the other, which supplies aggro iv with heat and light, was just coming up.   really, his was a collection comprised mostly of in-depth documents regarding day &amp; night co, which all came together, in a way, to communicate a pretty clear message. and to think of himself as a â€œhobbyistâ€ was perhaps one of the biggest acts of self-delusion one could ever commit. if daniel was a hobbyist, then mr. night jr. himself was out there somewhere, alive alongside his helmeted buddy. by trade and study, he was a journalist â€“ now he was a â€œcolumnistâ€ for one of the biggest trash-heap clickbait organizations available on the web. for them he wrote gag-worthy fluff pieces about which celebrity was still breastfeeding her nine-year-old or which member of royalty was seen, semi-disguised, jerking off in the back of a fast-food joint. in his free time, he wrote and read and wrote and read, reconstructing one of the largest and most disturbing narratives that had ever existed â€“ this amounted to his *real* job; the clickbait gig was just a thing he did to get money to support his day &amp; night work.   â€œsorry, what?â€ daniel had heard what sheâ€™d said, her voice, but the words were masked by the haze of inattention and lacked any real meaning.   â€œnothing, danny, nothing.â€ casey patted his back, looked up and seemed to notice the length of the line again. she blew out a sigh, then opened her bag and began searching.   â€œyou have the tickets, right?â€ he asked, leaning forward to look inside.   she scoffed and said, â€œobviously. what iâ€™m looking for is theâ€¦ damnâ€¦ ah!â€ casey fished out a long, white, too-thin cigarette. daniel gaped at his sister.   â€œcase, there areâ€¦ kids here.â€  he looked around cautiously, speaking low. â€œand how the hell did you get that onto four? how did jee-ess-tee-ess *not* find it?â€   â€œrelax, baby-â€   â€œew.â€   she rolled her eyes. â€œi called you a baby cos youâ€™re a freaking *baby*. no one cares, danny. this shit is legal, like, everywhere. just because youâ€™re holed up in that incubation chamber of yours, twenty-four-seven, afraid of the whole god-damn universe, doesnâ€™t mean the â€˜bad thingsâ€™ arenâ€™t fun.â€   â€œbutâ€¦ okay, iâ€™ll admit iâ€™m, uh, naive when it comes to *certain* aspects of living. but i know that you shouldnâ€™t be letting kids inhale that stuff. messes with development and brain growth.â€   â€œa little wizard shrub would be the least of that kidâ€™s problem,â€ casey said, quietly, eyeing the closest child around. he was chubby and blonde-headed â€“ standing ahead by five or so meters, vibrating in place by a womanâ€™s side. the woman, presumably his mother, had a hand clamped on the boyâ€™s shoulder as she delivered a solemn, thin-lipped reprimand; and despite his excitement, he looked ready to cry. â€œthatâ€™s abuse, man,â€ she said, and produced a lighter, joint bobbing in her lips.   â€œso is exposing me to that shit,â€ he said, waving a hand in front of his nose. â€œiâ€™m not trying to see stars or the things beyond them.â€ the line began to move steadily forward, and danielâ€™s chest echoed hollowly with dread and anticipation: perhaps the beginning effects of dubya shrub. he gestured forward. â€œi need to be lucid for this, case. iâ€™ve worked long and hard hours to get here â€“ this is important.â€   wizard shrub was the result of a strange, experimental threesome, back when earth was the main-world: part-organic, part-scientific, part-mystic. the great-great-great-great-great-grandchild of marijuana and magic mushrooms and something else, it utilizes a dollop of thc, a decimal of psilocin, and an unknown quantity of some mysterious third element â€“ which has been thought to activate the pineal gland. (an organ long-believed to hold the secrets of awesome human potential.) reports of telekinesis, prescience, hallucinogenic visions, and visitations from spectral entities are not uncommon, and have been verified and recorded frequently. personally, daniel didnâ€™t trust anything that could alter his perception so radically. alcoholism ran in his family, as well as addictive personalities, and with his mind being his most precious commodity, heâ€™d never willingly delve into things that might endanger its integrity. (unless a sufficiently accurate case study had been done, which proved wizard shrub more or less harmless.)   â€œmmm,â€ she hummed, as smoke slid through her nostrils and cascaded down her face in a solid, slimy-looking fog. â€œspeaking of, you spent any â€˜long and hard hoursâ€™ with caroline recently?â€   â€œno, casey. sheâ€™s made it clear iâ€™m â€˜too muchâ€™ for her. can we drop it, and can *you* drop that?â€   â€œtwo hits is probably way more than enough, youâ€™re right.â€ she licked her thumb and, with a near-silent sizzle, put out the flame. daniel was smiling, until casey pulled from her bag a small silver case â€“ wherein lined up were several different cigarettes of varying shape, size, and color â€“ and placed the unlighted join within. â€œsave *that* for later.â€   daniel, disgusted, shook his head, withdrew his holopad, and began writing down various descriptions of the surrounding structures, staff, security, etc. he occasionally moved through windows on the pad, reading up on alerts about the park. currently the line was about seven miles long. lining the sometimes-roofed corridor were frequent shops and rest stops and food centers (each comprised of two or three of practically every chain-restaurant in existence); staff and security and administration buildings interspersed the empty spaces, and small staff huts â€“ occupied by ten or so employees â€“ often sat along the wide path. inward facing chairs made up the border on both sides of the path, but surprisingly few guests took advantage of them.   they moved forward again, and this time they didnâ€™t stop. daniel decided to just put his gadgets away and archive everything with his mind.   in 20 minutes, they were at the gate. thirty archways lined the bottom. the construction was beautiful up close. from afar, one was fooled into thinking the massive passage would swing open in quarter-mile arcs on each side â€“ but, standing beneath, daniel saw no crack or welded seal, just a smooth stretch of metal with a shallow ridge in the middle. it was a wall merely made to look like a gate, fitted with myriad, real, smaller gates along the ground.   their turn came. casey and daniel made their way to a turnstile. a smiling employing, bedecked in an moon-grey polo shirt and khakis, greeted them, scanned their tickets, and traded them for two badges. he handed them their badges, bid them a good time, and welcomed them into the city-sized park.   danielâ€™s face must have communicated a mixture of awe and acute fright, for casey looked at him and nodded, expressing similar feelings. she hooked her arm through his, for the first time since they were children, and pulled him forward.    **will add a part two, in a bit** -",1,0,

710392,"i'm a 20-something female in a competitive, male-dominated field (i'm in web dev and software), and i've had an eating disorder for ten years. at two points during this period (15 and 17), my condition has fit all of the diagnostic criteria of anorexia, including amenorrhea, and i was recommended for treatment. i have never in my life had a bmi above 21.5.  i feel that your comments are nothing more than thinly-veiled misogyny. i also find your claim of medical expertise dubious, as you've demonstrated complete ignorance of psychopathology. i don't know. maybe you're just a grossly underqualified rna.  allow me to address some of your egregious misconceptions:  &gt;that's why anorexics get worse under stress, not with increased 'thin people' images.  i agree that stress obliterates me, but far and away, one of my biggest sources of stress throughout the past decade has been 'thin people' images. the part of my brain that's capable of rational thought understands that i'm reassigning the source of the self-loathing, anguish and grief that's actually caused by a shitty, emotionally-unfulfilling and abusive childhood, but another part of me can't *help it*. that's why it's a mental illness.  when i was a teenager, i spent hours every day online staring at ""thinspiration"" photos. i had a secret livejournal account that i used to connect with other teenage girls and share photos of models. i kept a small collection of ""lady mags"" (the content of which i could never have taken seriously) under my bed, just for the photos. i was (and to a degree, still am) obsessed with looking at images of thinner women. if i'd never had access to media, or if the media's beauty ideal or pressure on women to conform to a standard wasn't so weight-oriented, i doubt that i would have ever developed an eating disorder.  if my anecdotes don't cut it for you, there is a [positive correlation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2533817/) between media exposure and body dissatisfaction and eating disorders amongst adolescent girls.  i've destroyed every relationship i've ever been in because i project the media's beauty ideals onto my partners, hyperanalysing every remark and glance, and constantly prodding for admissions that will hurt me, because that pain enables my eating disorder.  before you go arguing that i want this, that this is reasonably within my control, or that some conscious part of me strives to maintain this, let me set the record straight: no, i fucking don't want this. who would actively *want* this? no one. all i want in the entire world, even more than thinness, is to be able to be happy, and to be able to unreservedly reciprocate the love, trust and patience that my partner shows me, and that he deserves.  &gt;if we're going to bitch about anorexia being unhealthy, shouldn't you be bitching equally as much (if not more because of proportions) that the media is portraying being fat as ok  yes, obesity is unhealthy. but do you think obese women obsess over how to become *more obese*? that they lose hours and hours of their lives scheming to become fatter? no. obese women, like anorexic women, want to be thin. no fat person goes, ""oh woe is me, if only i could become more socially shunned and discriminated against! if only more people would look at me in disgust and perceive me as [lazy](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100420152839.htm) and [stupid](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2504562/four-year-olds-think-fat-people-are-stupid-and-ugly.html).""  the media's unattainable beauty standard can also be a compounding factor in compulsive eating and binge eating disorders, both of which contribute to obesity.  yes, many more people will die of obesity-related causes than anorexia this year, but obese people can also live happy, fulfilled lives, which is not the case with anorexia. obesity can be symptomatic of mental illness, but it is not a mental illness. it's apples to oranges.  additionally, where the fuck does the media portrays fatness as ok? particularly for women?   &gt;can anyone explain (particularly people who bitch and moan about 'media influence' on anorexia) why anorexia nervosa still existed back then?  because fasting was associated with piety, and people loved god a lot ""back then"". adjusted for food availability and population growth, do you think that the equivalent of [1,000 women](http://depts.washington.edu/thmedia/view.cgi?section=bodyimage&amp;page=fastfacts) died of anorexia in 1930?  let me provide you with an answer, you sack of shit: no, they did not. that's why the [""fasting girls""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fasting_girls) were a notable medical phenomenon.  &gt;maybe this is why women avoid or fail in competitive fields like business. glass ceiling my ass. stop playing the stereotype everyone expects you to. try not being a whiny pussy who can't function around the most minute amount of adversity because omg feelings!   in 2009, the largest percentage of [employed women in the united states](http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm) worked in managerial or professional occupations (read: business). the ratio of women to men taking business majors in 2008 was [.96](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/the-top-majors-by-gender_n_679175.html#s125313&amp;title=1_womenmen_business). also, does your stereotype of a girl with an eating disorder involve getting your ass handed to you on a plate? because i am currently doing this.  &gt;also, no one can make you feel bad about yourself but you. you and you alone are responsible for determining your own self worth  oh fuck off, ayn rand.  i spent my entire adolescence believing that i was failure, and that this was *my fault*. that only made everything worse, because there's absolutely no way to reconcile an untruth of that magnitude. i kept it entirely to myself for nearly a decade, and was nothing but a miserable, wilting heap of confusion, anxiety and self-hatred. as i've gotten older, i've come to understand that it's no one's fault, least of all my own. it's just an unfortunate genetic predisposition exacerbated by a media that thrives on insecurity-fueled consumerism. while i don't fully blame the media, i do think the media has implicit responsibility in the emotional well-being of girls and women, because i know the media had an implicit responsibility in my own inability to achieve well-being.  so in short, fuck you for calling me weak, dumb, or an embarrassment to my gender, and fuck you for talking about things you have not even the most basic knowledge of. good night.  **tl:dr** this roastbeefcharlie guy is a fucking *moron*",1,-1,1

909299,"first off, just getting this out of the way:  if the shtf...you're going to want more than just a handgun.  but, you asked about a handgun for edc, so i'll try to stay on that topic.  1.  **caliber**  * basically, anything 9mm or larger will be perfectly fine for a self-defense round. on that note, keep in mind the only reason you're carrying a firearm on your person daily is for self defense, so you might as well choose a caliber that will provide you some defense.  personally, .380 is obviously better than nothing, but for the very slight size increase, you can get into the 9mm that is going to pack a lot more punch than the .380.  so, having said that, i don't think going so small as to carrying a .380 for self defense makes sense.  * if it's your first pistol, i'd suggest you stick with either 9mm, .40, or .45, leaning more toward 9mm.  you should shoot all three of those calibers to see what feels best to you, as they all recoil a little differently.  but again, as a complete beginner, i'm going to say just stick with 9mm.  the recoil is manageable, you can carry more ammo, the ammo is the cheaper of those three (if you can find it right now), and the round is plenty adequate for self defense (with proper ammo).  2. **size**  * the smaller the hand-gun, the easier it is going to be to conceal, obviously.  but, keep this in mind:  the smaller the hand-gun, the more you will feel recoil, and the less accurate the gun is going to be.    * starting with the recoil, the less mass in the firearm (ie weight), the less the firearm itself is going to absorb the recoil and the more you're wrist is going to absorb the recoil.  this means the smaller the firearm is, the more ""snappy"" the recoil will become.  this makes it harder to get back on target for follow up shots.   * as for accuracy, the shorter the barrel the less time the bullet has to get stabilized and begin ""twisting"" as it's going down the barrel.  this means less accuracy.  also, with regard to size and accuracy correlation, the shorter the barrel becomes the shorter the sight radius becomes.  this results in less accuracy as well.  *  another thing to consider with length of the barrel is that the shorter the barrel, the less time the bullet has time for pressure to build up behind it.  in other words, less power behind the bullet.  *  your biggest thing to figure out here is what you can comfortably carry on your person and still be able to conceal it.  in other words, what is the biggest firearm you can comfortably conceal and also comfortably shoot and control?  you need to be very careful here!  it's very easy to just say, ""well i can easily put that little pistol in my pocket, and no one will ever notice.""  well that's all well and good, but if it's so small you can't hit the broad side of a barn at 5 yards, what good is it?  that's not to say you need a hand-canon either!  i'm just saying, if you can comfortably handle and conceal a larger pistol (like say a glock compact for example), then you should seriously consider that over the sub-compact.  3.  **trigger**  *  trigger pull is a big thing for me.  i prefer a pull weight that is around 6 lb or less.  this is something you have to personally feel for yourself and determine what you like or are comfortable with.  just go to a store and ask to dry fire specific models with different type triggers.  *  basically, and especially if you're a complete beginner, you may find that the heavier the trigger pull, the harder it is for you to pull back (obviously).  what that usually causes is for the shooter to have to either a) jerk/yank on the trigger to get it to fire or b) torque their wrist in a desperate effort to get the trigger pulled back.  both of these will cause the shooter to pull off their shots (ie miss where they're aiming).  4.  **safeties**  *  most modern semi-auto pistols are actually pretty safe.  but you have to personally figure out if you need the piece of mind of having a manual safety.  this can be a huge factor in choosing your handgun, because some don't even offer a manual safety (ie glock).  some (like the smith &amp; wesson m&amp;p) don't typically have manual safeties but do offer them as an ""option.""    *  personally, if a pistol has a manual safety, i want one that i can easily manipulate quickly and easily under stress (i like the thumb safeties on the m&amp;p line, but not so much the little safety on the m&amp;p shield).  *  the bottom line is, ultimately your finger and brain should be your ultimate safety.  don't put your booger picker on the bang hook unless you plan on firing the weapon.  and, if not, keep it covered in a holster....  5.  **holster**  *  you need a good holster for edc of a handgun.  it must provide some sort of retention (if all it is is friction) to hold the firearm in it.  it must also cover the trigger guard so that nothing can snag and accidentally pull the trigger.  *  any model you look at, consider if you can get a good holster for it.  if you can't find a good holster for it...personally, i'll pass on that pistol.  6.  **bore-axis**  *  bore-axis is basically the height of the center of the bore (barrel) above the (imaginary) line that extends out from your wrist going through the firearm when gripping it.  [look at this picture](http://i.imgur.com/mnsxwj1.jpg).  notice how much higher the pistol on the left sits over top of the hand when gripped than the pistol on the right does.  [here's another example of two different bore axis' from the side](http://www.gundigest.com/wp-content/uploads/comparison-300x223.jpg).  *  the higher the bore-axis of your handgun, the more likely it is to tend to flip up and back under recoil.  this results in it being harder for you to control and get back on target for follow up shots.   *  the lower the bore-axis of your handgun, the less it is going to flip up but instead will tend to push more straight back through the (imaginary) line running through your arm.  this results in the shooter being able to maintain control of the firearm with more ease and allows faster follow up shots.  *  in a perfect world, if the bore/slide could be in perfect alignment with your arm (in other words pointed straight up your forearm), the barrel would not flip up at all under recoil (assuming a proper grip was maintained).  but since that is not physically possible (the slide on a semi-auto must come backwards in order to function), we can only hope to keep it as low as possible.  7.  **actions/hammers/strikers**  *  there is what we call double action and single action firearms, and they are designed like this:  *  *double action* - when you pull the trigger back, you are essentially ""cocking"" the action.  in other words, you are pulling back the part that is going to drive the firing pin into the back of the cartridge to make it go bang.  after a certain ""breaking point"" it's going to release and fire off a round.  this type of action usually results in a heavier trigger, because you are essentially cocking and firing the pistol with your finger.  *  *single action* - when you pull the trigger back, you are simply releasing the ""precocked"" (after a certain ""breaking point"") part that drives the firing pin into the back of the cartridge to make it go bang.  this usually means a very light trigger pull, because really all you're doing is pulling the trigger back to a certain point to cause it to release an internal part from pressure.  *  most pistols with an exposed hammer can be either action.  in a semi-automatic, unless you precock the hammer back before your first shot, the first time you pull the trigger it's going to be really heavy and double action.  but after the slide cycles back and forward, the hammer will be left to the rear.  at that point, your trigger pull becomes single action.  *  those without an exposed hammer are usually called ""double action only.""  *  in general, most firearms with exposed hammers tend to have heavier triggers.  *  a hammer on the back of the firearm can potentially be snagged on clothing and pulled halfway back before being accidentally released.  *  striker fired pistols don't have a hammer at all.  they basically have a firing pin inside the slide attached to a spring.  when you pull the trigger back, you are pulling the spring back to a ""breaking point"" until it releases forward into the back of the cartridge. these tend to be the safest form of the modern pistol today, because there is no ""hammer"" behind the firing pin that can drive it forward (for example if dropped on the ground).  they also usually tend to be some of the lighter triggers because of the way they work.  *  if this is a pistol you intend to carry as an edc i'm going to go ahead and just say you should try to avoid a pistol with an exposed hammer, particularly if it's your first firearm anyway.  but, that's just my personal opinion.  there are still plenty of pistols out there with exposed hammers that are fantastic firearms and very safe and reliable.  i'm just not a fan of them on my edc.  8.  **firearm manufacturers (brands)**  *  i'll start by listing the ""big players"" in the firearms manufacturing industry.  basically, it is safe to assume that anything made by these companies are (in my personal opinion anyway) of a high quality.  now of course, every company can have some ""lemons"" slip through the cracks, and any firearm you intend to bet your life on should be ran at least several hundred rounds to ensure it's reliability.  nonetheless, here's a good list to get started, in no particular order:  *  **smith &amp; wesson** *(some people have complaints about their sigma line, but their m&amp;p line is top notch!)*  *  **glock** *(some people, myself included, don't like the grip angle on the glock handguns.  to me, it feels unnatural.  however, even though i don't personally like how they fit me, i'll still be the first to admit they make a rugged and reliable firearm!)*  *  **springfield armory**  *  **beretta**  *  **ruger** *(personally, i've never fired a ruger pistol of which i could stand the trigger, but some like them.  usually their triggers tend to be rather long and heavy.)*  *  **heckler &amp; koch** *(i'm personally not a fan of h&amp;k by any means, but they do make quality firearms.  i just think they are over-priced, and i really dislike their stance against not wanting to sell certain firearms of theirs to civilians.)*  *  **sig sauer**  *  **kimber**  * and honestly, any manufacturer not on that list i would just do some good research on.  there are some i left off that list that do make really good firearms, but i feel like may still be a little more ""hit-or-miss"" than the others (no pun intended).  i just intended this list above to be a pretty sure bet that you're buying from a very quality and reputable company.  likewise, i left off some of the ""premium"" custom builders, because i really don't think a complete beginner should be looking at custom $2k plus 1911s but rather something that is a little less needy in terms of maintenance.  9.  **specific models (that any beginner should consider)**  *  well, if you've got a better idea by now of what you may want, here is just a small list i put together that any beginner may want to consider.  again, this is in no particular order:  *  **smith &amp; wesson m&amp;p** *(full size and comes in various calibers)*  *  **smith &amp; wesson m&amp;p compact** *(small and compact and comes in various calibers)*  *  **smith &amp; wesson m&amp;p shield** *(this is a very slim-lined pistol that is specifically designed for concealed carry; it comes in .40 or 9mm)*  *  *basically anything you find in the smith &amp; wesson m&amp;p line that fits you and that you can handle/control is going to be a quality firearm.*  *  **glock 17** *(full size in 9mm)*  *  **glock 19** *(compact in 9mm)*  *  **glock 22** *(full size in .40)*  *  **glock 23** *(compact in .40)*  *  *basically anything you find from glock that fits you and that you can handle/control is going to be a quality firearm.*  *  **springfield xd** *(comes in full size and compact as well as sub-compact variants; comes in various calibers)*  *  **springfield xdm** *(comes in full size and compact variants with various calibers)*  *  **springfield xds** *(a very slim-lined pistol designed specifically for concealed carry and comes in .45 or 9mm)*  *  **beretta nano** *(a very slim-lined pistol designed specifically for concealed carry and comes in 9mm)*  *  **ruger lc9** *(a fairly small and slim-lined pistol designed for conceal carry and is a 9mm)*  *  **ruger sr9c** *(compact in 9mm)*  *  **sig sauer p250** *(comes in various sizes and calibers)*  *  **kahr cm9** *(compact 9mm)*  *  **kahr cm40** *(compact .40)*  *  **kahr cm45** *(compact .45)*  *  **walther pps** *(a very slim-lined pistol designed specifically for concealed carry and comes in .40 or 9mm)*  *  **kimber solo** *(a compact 9mm that borrows a lot of design features from the infamous 1911 platform)*  *  there are a number of other great pistols out there, but these above are just a good starting point of where you can get started in order to get a feel for what feels right in your hands.  10.  **what do i carry?**  *  i hope i didn't appear bias above, but i carry an m&amp;p full size every day chambered in 9mm.    *  i use a custom molded kydex holster inside my waist band.  *  i carry speer gold dot hollow-point ammo   edit:  not sure what happened in my formatting.  sorry.  :(  edit 2:  holy smokes.  reddit gold?  wow, thanks a lot!  i'm glad i could help someone.  if you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.  i know i didn't cover everything, but i figured the above should get you started in your search for a first handgun for edc.",0,,

539893,"i think you're misunderstanding what taubes, eades and naughton are saying. if you've read all the books and seen all the talks, then you should know that they don't dispute what i'm saying. let me quote taubes from ""why we get fat"" (the ""thermodynamics for dummies, part 1"" chapter):  &gt; oprah, for instance, canâ€™t become more massiveâ€”fatter and heavierâ€”without taking in more energy than she expends, because oprah fatter and heavier contains more energy than oprah leaner and lighter.* she has to consume more energy than she expends to accommodate her increasing mass. and she canâ€™t become leaner and lighter without expending more energy than she takes in. energy is conserved. thatâ€™s what this first law of thermodynamics tells us.  and just after that..  &gt; health experts think that the first law is relevant to why we get fat because they say to themselves and then to us, as the the new york times did, â€œthose who consume more calories than they expend in energy will gain weight.â€ this is true. it has to be. to get fatter and heavier, we have to overeat. we have to consume more calories than we expend. thatâ€™s a given. but thermodynamics tells us nothing about why this happens, why we consume more calories than we expend. it only says that if we do, we will get heavier, and if we get heavier, then we did.  taubes knows that calories matter, what he talks about is controlling insulin as refined carbs and sugars spike our insulin and make us fat. taubes is interested in the ""why"".  if you lose weight on 3000 kcal a day it's because:  * your body doesn't absorb 3000 kcal * your energy need is higher and you use more than 3000 kcal a day  there is no way around it. there's no magic void where all those calories go, if you take in 3000 kcal a day you either store it as fat or ""use"" it. if you gain weight on 1800 kcal it's because your body uses less than 1800 kcal a day (i.e reduced metabolism through thyroid problems, a genetic disorder, increased fasting insulin levels, etc.). all this applies to keto too, it's not special. countless studies have shown that keto or low carb isn't magic, the benefits are numerous and all related to food intake, satiety or metabolic rate.   looking at the dupont study you can see this too:  &gt; a treatment of obesity, alternate to that of caloric restriction, takes into account the metabolic defect in obesity, aims at a primary decrease in the excessive energy stores, and allows for weight reduction without any decline in the energy expenditure and without any enforcement of caloric restriction.  [""obesity: overnutrition or disease of metabolism?""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13080244), pennington aw, 1953.  zero magic, they just don't have to enforce the caloric restriction, as people do that themselves:  &gt; conclusion: in a small group of obese patients with type 2 diabetes, a low-carbohydrate diet followed for 2 weeks resulted in spontaneous reduction in energy intake to a level appropriate to their height; weight loss that was completely accounted for by reduced caloric intake  [""effect of a low-carbohydrate diet on appetite, blood glucose levels, and insulin resistance in obese patients with type 2 diabetes""](http://www.annals.org/content/142/6/403.abstract).  &gt; conclusions: an increase in dietary protein from 15% to 30% of energy at a constant carbohydrate intake produces a sustained decrease in ad libitum caloric intake that may be mediated by increased central nervous system leptin sensitivity and results in significant weight loss. this anorexic effect of protein may contribute to the weight loss produced by low-carbohydrate diets.

(the small size and precision fit come from the yin; the sharp edges and crisp tailoring come from the yang.) avoid: oversized, large, or long geometrics. unconstructed shapes. soft-edged, flowing, or rounded shapes. ornate, intricate, or delicate shapes.   line and silhouette: your outline should be sharp, straight, and staccato. the use of severe lines with sharp edges comes from the yang; the broken, staccato, animated outline comes from the yin. utilizing many short vertical lines and many short horizontal lines is also effective. an overabundance of detail adds to the precisely fitted silhouette that is crucial to your look. avoid: elongated lines. wide lines. curved lines. flowing lines. smooth lines. oversized or unconstructed silhouettes. symmetrical silhouettes. ornate silhouettes.   fabric: fabric must always be crisp, able to hold a defined shapes and be tailored easily. a flat surface or light texture is best. finely woven knits, especially when ribbed and skinny, are good choices. a matte finish is best, although hard-finished sheens can be very exciting (especially metallics). usually your fabric will be of moderate weight, though lighter weights that hug the body are excellent. avoid: oversized, rough textures. drapable fabrics. sheer, flowing fabrics. delicate fabrics.   detail: you can never wear too much detail! an abundance of it used everywhere in your look is one of the most effective tools you have for capturing your animated effervescence! detail should always be small, sharp, and call attention to itself (not blend into the lines of your garments). it should be very crisp, staccato, broken-up, and multicolored. lots of crisp trim. lots of outlining (collars, cuffs, waist-bands, lapels) with piping of contrasting colors or fabric, braiding, beads, etc. small, crisp pleats. sharp, angular necklines-also small (mandarin, nehru, band, small man-tailored styles, small vâ€™s, wing-tipped). small, tailored lapels or crisp lapel-less with piping. sharp shoulder pads. small crisp cuffs. sharp and narrow waist definition. avoid: minimal, clean detail. simplicity. oversized or unconstructed detail. elongated detail. ornate or frill detail.   separates: a use of well-coordinated separates with lots of animated and colorful detail can be very exciting to your look.   color: your use of color should be bold and sassy; break all the rules here! multicolored splashes are perfect. bright and shockingly colored accessories played against a dark or light background. high, sharp contrast and wild color combinations are all very chic on you. break your line with color! avoid: monochromatic color schemes (death to your personalityâ€“nothing is worse for you). neutrals, unless they are merely accessories or they are extremely dark or light.   prints: prints should be sharp, colorful, and animated. small geometrics and angular asymmetrics are excellent. most of your prints should be very contemporary in feeling (â€œpicasso-ishâ€) although humorous styles that are outlined and caricatured can be quite stunning on you as well. avoid: watercolor prints. ornate prints. intricate prints. symmetrical prints. oversized prints. realistic prints.   accessories all accessories should be small, crisp, geometric, and colorful. they should serve to further break the silhouette into a staccato outline and call attention to themselves as detail. contrast is being strived for with your use of accessories, as well as bringing out your wit and a sense of fun.   shoes: should be tailored and angular, in lightweight leather. unusual shapes in toes and heels are excellent (asymmetrics, toes and heels are excellent (asymmetrics, wedges, sharp points, etc) as are bold colors and printed fabric. flats of all kinds should always be funky and fun (patent leather, trimmed, etc.). avoid: plain pumps. overly delicate or strappy shoes.   bags: small, crisp geometrics (box, clutch, etc.). slim briefcase. avoid: oversized, unconstructed pouches. ornate bags. thick, heavy briefcases.   belts: stiff leather with geometric buckles. elasticized fabric styles. may be narrow to moderately wide. brightly colored belts are excellent aids in breaking your line. avoid: heavy belts. unconstructed styles. overly ornate styles. monochromatic styles. extremely oversized belts.   hats: small, crisply tailored hats. caps (spanish, beret, indian, cloche). avoid: oversized, unconstructed, and floppy styles. ornate styles.   hosiery: break your line by contrasting your stocking/hemline/shoe shades. you can use a two-color combination where the shoe and hemline match but the stocking is lighter; or a three-color contrast. brightly colored stockings; light, opaque stockings; and geometric textures (ribbed and herringbones) are equally good. flesh toned stockings are fine for daytime wear. dark stockings should be extremely sheer. avoid: one long line of solid color, especially if dark.   jewelry: should be small and sharp and in geometric, asymmetrical, or irregular shapes. brightly colored enamel, stone, or glass are best. very contemporary avant-garde pieces are excellent on you, as are trendy pieces that accentuate your wit. avoid: antique, ornate, intricate pieces (rococo and baroque). heavy, chunky pieces. oversized pieces. symmetrical classic pieces.",0,,

331040,"i am very sorry for the length of this. i'm sure you're expecting a single caliber thrown at you but this gun is far too confusing for those who have heard of it and if you haven't heard of it if you don't read the below you will discount it. i did for a good number of months before getting one. this is an amazing pistol and i hate that i already want a second but i do. what can i say.  you will possibly be very confused in about 3 seconds but here's the gun you should definitely get, especially now because they are prevalent. you want to get an h&amp;k p7. right now we are a few years into a large surplus of the guns because they are being traded in from germany to upgrade to a more modern design. you can get a grade b (which is just fine for your purposes. they even are in excellent condition) for 500 bucks. seriously amazing for what you get. now it'll probably come with only one mag and those are pricey right now (60 or so) but seriously seriously these are the best 9mm's ever made. i'm not even joking. they aren't your modern glocks though that can be neglected - they are 1980s vintage german craftsmanship that need to be a *little* babied.  a quick summary of the gun for you. it is single stack 8+1 capacity with a heel mag release (i have no problem using it even though you never see these anymore).   the gun is really really slim and very comfortable with a full grip. this gun does require a quality holster and belt though to be able to be retained. the front end is actually quite short for normal holsters to make it tricky. also it is all steel so it is much heavier than your standard lightweight polymers. but again - good holster and belt really makes this a non issue.  it uses a gas retarded system - not browning style. this requires special maintenance but with practice is no problem. the biggest difference is it is a squeeze cocker - this means that you squeeze the grip with about 14# and after it clicks it is now cocked and ready. to maintain readiness only requires around 2# so it's not a hand strain or anything.  when uncocked the gun is a paperweight. no internals are under spring tension at all. it doesn't match condition ideas. when cocked it immediately goes to condition 0 with about a 5# 1911 style trigger. if dropped the cocker releases and before it hits the ground the gun is now back to original uncocked setting. it's a very safe design for these reasons.  here is someone else's mega list for the pluses and minuses:  pro   1. squeeze cocking. imho the safest gun for daily carry. the gun goes from perfectly safe to perfectly deadly in a split second. if you drop it you may have a heart attack because it might get scratched but you can rest assured it won't go off. this gun is incredibly fast.   2. trigger pull. thanks to the squeeze cocking system the gun is safely equipped with an excellent single action trigger pull. i've had die-hard partisans of every type of gun praise my p7's trigger.   3. compact. although it has full-size controls (no pinky hang), the gun is sized like a compact approaching a subcompact. it is much thinner than almost any handgun.(1.1-1.2 inches).  4. full-size barrel. despite this gun's compact size it has a full 4-inch barrel.   5. fixed-barrel. this gun lacks the tilting barrel assembly of most other full-sized guns. this lends the gun exceptional accuracy. in combination with the aforementioned trigger, this barrel makes the p7 ultra-accurate.   6. low recoil. this is debatable. i have always felt that this has the least recoil of any 9mm. some disagree, most don't. this is likely result of the guns low bore/axis and gas system (although some say the gas system should have no effect).   7. tough! this gun is cnc milled from a solid steel forging. the gun is so solid it could be used as a nasty set of brass knuckles in a pinch. without picking one up it is hard to imagine how solid this little gun feels. when i had mine hardchromed the smith complained endlessly about how hard the p7 was to machine.   8. excellent sight radius. although the gun is short, hk maximized the sight radius by pushing the sights as far apart as practically possible.   9. oddball manual of arms confuses bad guys and know it all buddies. there are many accounts of cops loosing their p7's to bad guys who were, in turn, unable to figure out the squeeze cocker. on the lighter side, a know it all at a local gunshop had just explained to all of his bad experiences with the p7 when i handed it to him only to watch him fumble around unable to cock it! hilarious.   10. chamber fluting allows the gun to function even if the extractor is broken. this feature really makes you think when you are trying to determine which gun you want to bet you life on (no offense, but this a much more serious advantage than being able to freeze the gun in a bucket of ice or whatever).   11. easily childproofed. the p7's striker can be removed without tools (and without any other disassembly of the gun). the striker can be re-inserted into the gun in roughly 1 second. this could be a major consideration to those of us with small children and stupid friends.   12. ambidextrous. with the exception of the slide catch and take down buttons, every model of the p7 is completely ambidextrous.   13. redacted for different model lack of similarity.  14. ultra fast slide release. simply squeeze the handle and the slide will be released.  15. 110 degree grip angle gives the gun natural pointability. 110 degree grip angle makes the gun point just like you finger.  16. low profile slide. the p7's low profile slide means that there is very little recoiling mass relative to the frame. this, along with the above mentioned 110-degree grip angle makes reacquiring targets a breeze with the p7.    con   1. the gun gets uncomfortably hot after 60 (or so) rapid shots. more of a training problem than a ""real world"" consideration.   2. finish lacks durability. blued finish wears quickly and is very little protection against corrosion.   3. redacted for different model.   4. the gun's design is such that it gets dirty quickly when shot.   5. the gun malfunctions when not maintained properly. while this is true of all guns, the p7 seems to be more sensitive than most modern autos. the solution is to keep the gas cylinder clean.   6. the p7's cocking lever emits a click when released. this is more of an issue with seal wannabes than real people. the theory is that the noise will alert the bad guys to your presence. easily overcome with technique anyway (press in cocking latch at top of cocking lever while releasing your grip). with this technique the gun is almost silent and certainly quieter than any sig or usp with decocking lever.   7. low capacity. except in now unavailable m13 (leo only) and m10 (discontinued for ugliness), capacity is limited to 9 rounds (with one in chamber).   8. grip screws come loose too easily. use lock-tite.   9. can't use lead bullets (see cleanliness issues above).   10. slide lock button too small for some.   11. magazine release on m8/m13 too sensitive to careless holstering (accidental magazine ejection). psp model doesn't suffer from this (euro-magazine catch). the police trade ins are psp style models, fyi.  12. during an emergency a user might accidentally squeeze the trigger while squeezing the cocking lever. i personally think this isn't a problem. the p7 was designed with a fair amount of take-up in the trigger so the gun is tolerant of some sloppiness. the moral of the story is to keep you finger off the trigger until you are ready to kill something. it should also be noted that your trigger finger is relatively independent of your other fingers. i can't remember the physiological term, but the other three fingers usually act in unison while the index finger is only partially connected. still, in an emergency anything is possible--practice proper form with all firearms!   13. for some, seriously ham-fisted users, the gun might be accidentally disassembled if the take down button is inadvertently pressed while the slide is being racked. this is extremely unlikely, however, it can be done with practice.   14. disassembly not for mere mortals. a ""detail strip""  can involve a lot of head/heart ache. the gun has a fair number of parts but the real problem is the gun's unorthodox design [expert reassembly tip, use grease to hold in the mag release spring--otherwise you will go mad trying to hold everything together while attempting to drive in the assembly pin]. an armorer at hk told me that they regularly have to reassemble guns for owners who let curiosity get the better of them. fortunately, there is really no reason to strip it down beyond a ""field strip."" just spray in some gun oil and wipe.   15. possible difficulty depressing cocking lever with weak or injured hands. my father has weakness in his right hand related to a stroke he had a few years ago. for a while he was unable to cock my m8. on the other hand, once the lever is squeezed it only takes about a pound and a half to keep it cocked.   whew. if you want more info or do get it and now want info from that pm me and i can work you through cleaning and whatnot. you can't just wing it with this baby.",0,,

â€œfrigate-builtâ€ was a term used in the 17th century describing a warship that was built to be quick and maneuverable.  &gt;by the 18th century the term had been modified slightly to include ships that may be as long as a ship of the line but were still designed for speed and had lighter weaponry, making them useful for patrols and escorts.  &gt;modern frigates are generally used as escorts for other warships and convoys.  destroyers  &gt; historically, they were designed after the emergence of torpedo boats (quick, frigate-like ships which employed newly invented self-propelled torpedoes as their main arms) in the late 1800s.  &gt; destroyers were originally designed as, and named, torpedo boat destroyers, but at some point became referred to simply as destroyers when their roles expanded.  &gt;were essentially smaller cruisers designed with the sole purpose of hunting down and destroying torpedo boats, and had much more powerful weaponry as well as torpedoes to fulfill this purpose.  &gt;they were designed to have the long range and speed to keep up with their fleet, and over time this fact plus their multi-purpose capabilities meant that destroyers began seeing more use as advanced scouts for a fleet as well as direct fleet combatants, anti-submariners, and anti-submarine patrol.  &gt;by wwii destroyers began filling in a niche as (what iâ€™ll very simply call) anti-everything vessels,  cruisers  &gt;in the age of sail â€œcruiserâ€ was a term used to describe ships which underwent â€œcruising missions;â€ that is independent scouting, raiding, and commerce protection missions.  &gt;by the mid 1800s ships began being constructed that were specifically designed for this sort of work, and as such were called â€œcruisersâ€.  &gt;cruiser roles in the late 20th century included anti-air defense, shore bombing, and commerce raiding, depending on the navy.  bbs and bcs  &gt; battlecruisers (or battle cruisers) are the first vessels in this article to commonly be considered capital ships.  they are similar to battleships, having a similar armament and size, but were generally faster and not as heavily armored by comparison.  &gt;battlecruisers were designed to combat and destroyer slower, older armored cruisers through heavy gunfire.  &gt;as technology improved battlecruisers were designed with heavier armor.  at the same time, battleships began becoming faster.  these similarities would ultimately cause a blurring between the two types, and by 1922 the washington naval treaty considered battlecruisers and battleships functionally identical.  &gt;the term â€œbattleshipâ€ is a contraction of phrase â€œline-of-battle shipâ€ from the age of sails.  &gt;they were characterized by very heavy armor and large-caliber guns, making them key capital ships.  carriers are fairly straightforward - serves as a mobile landing pad for planes.  dreadnaught  &gt; strictly speaking, dreadnoughts are just particularly large and powerful battleships.  as such they carry the same characteristics of battleships; they are capital ships, represent naval power and influence, and would need a fleet to protect them from smaller vessels and weaponry.  you also have classifications like ""light"", ""heavy"", and ""super"" which actually have defined meanings.  light and heavy:  &gt; generally speaking, whether a particular vessel is light or heavy refers to the payload of its weapons.  sometimes the resilience of its armor may come into play (again; exceptions exist), but overall a vesselâ€™s status as light or heavy is dependent on its guns.  a light vessel has a lighter armament, while a heavy vessel, naturally, has a heavy armament.  super: &gt; a super vessel is, for lack of a better word, just a bigger version of whatever classification of vessel it is we are talking about.  armored:  &gt;an armored vessel is one with more resilient-than-normal armor than others of its type.  assault:  &gt;assault vessels, therefore, are designed for assaulting an enemy planet, installation, space station, etc.  they are usually designed to carry large numbers of troops, vehicles, drop ships, supporting aircraft, and the like",0,,

666955,"upyacht for the calm response. the guy does seem to have a chip on his shoulder, but his assumption isn't that far-fetched.  consider this - to not be losing fat when it's in the double digits one or more of the following is true:  * you are not doing enough cardio. five to ten hours (or more) a week are the norm for an endomorph/skinny-fat. * your daily glycemic load is too high. * your daily caloric intake is too high or one or more of your meals is way too big. * you are not getting enough sleep and/or have a hormonal dis-balance.  i think you are somewhat correct that abs can make your belly protrude more, but you have to be taking a lot of steroids and hgh for your abs to grow so much that they would visibly distend your stomach under the fat. what it is is probably mostly fat.   also, what you might consider cut muscle (or a lean physique), might very well be more muscle (or bulk if you prefer), which makes you look bigger, but it doesn't necessarily make you look more ""athelitic"".  i'm in the same boat you are. i've been building muscle, slowly but steadily, over the years, but my lack of discipline 50% of the year and the lack of cardio 80% of the year just makes me look ""soft"" for 90% of the year.  what you need to do is focus on your cardio and/or diet and be strict about it for at least 3 months. the result would be an _overall_ lower bf, which would help with the belly issue and on top of that will make you look much bigger, just because you look more ripped. you might have less muscle, smaller arms and legs and lift slightly less, but the overall effect of losing 10 pounds of fat is comparable (for me) to gaining 15 pounds of muscle.  to prove i'm not just beating gums, here are two pictures of the same person in a relatively similar pose. [picture 1](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/40/82666319_4cd463a85f_o.jpg) is from 5 years ago, bodyweight ~185 pounds, bodyfat ~13%, age 19. [picture 2](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4343087282_bafca577ed_b.jpg) is from 6 months ago, bodyweight ~220 pounds, bodyfat ~20%, age 24.   after some simple math, we find out that in picture 2 the subject has  15 pounds of extra lean muscle mass. also, his bench, squat and deadlift 1rm weights are considerably larger, due to increased muscle mass and increased neurological strength.   on paper, picture 2 should be a hands-down winner in ""athletic"" looks, considering the increased muscle mass which would protrude underneath the fat (which was a staplepoint of your hypothesis). however, the sad truth is that the 7% increase in bodyfat easily mask away all the extra muscle (look at the pectorals for example) and makes the subject look ""softer"" and weaker, albeit him being bigger and stronger.",1,-1,1

735641,"the headline made me think of a short story by [david sedaris](http://www.amazon.com/me-talk-pretty-one-day/dp/0316776963/). do yourself a favour and read the whole thing, it gets really good from the middle onward:  ""and what does one do on the fourteenth of july? does one celebrate bastille day?""  it was my second month of french class, and the teacher was leading us in an exercise designed to promote the use of one, our latest personal pronoun.  ""might one sing on bastille day?"" she asked. ""might one dance in the streets? somebody give me an answer.""  printed in our textbooks was a list of major holidays accompanied by a scattered arrangement of photographs depicting french people in the act of celebration. the object of the lesson was to match the holiday with the corresponding picture. it was simple enough but seemed an exercise better suited to the use of the pronoun they. i didn't know about the rest of the class but when bastille day eventually rolled around, i planned to stay home and clean my oven.  normally, when working from the book, it was my habit to tune out my fellow students and scout ahead, concentrating on the question i'd calculated might fall to me, but this afternoon we were veering from the usual format. questions were answered on a volunteer basis, and i was able to sit back and relax, confident that the same few students would do most of the talking. today's discussion was dominated by an italian nanny, two chatty poles, and a pouty, plump moroccan woman who had grown up speaking french and had enrolled in the class hoping to improve her spelling. she'd covered these lessons back in the third grade and took every opportunity to demonstrate her superiority. a question would be asked, and she'd race to give the answer, behaving as though this were a game show and, if quick enough, she might go home with a tropical vacation or a side-by-side refrigerator/freezer. a transfer student, by the end of the first day she'd raised her hand so many times that her shoulder had given out. now she just leaned back and shouted out the answers, her bronzed arms folded across her chest like some great grammar genie.  we'd finished discussing bastille day, and the teacher had moved on to easter, which was represented in our textbooks by a black-and-white photograph of a chocolate bell lying upon a bed of palm fronds.  ""and what does one do on easter? would anyone like to tell us?""  it was, for me, another of those holidays i'd just as soon avoid. as a rule, my family had always ignored the easter celebration by our non-orthodox friends and neighbors. while the others feasted on their cholocate figurines, my brother, sisters, and i had endured epic fasts, folding our bony fingers in prayer and begging for an end to the monotony that was the holy trinity church. as greeks, we had our own easter, which was usually observed anywhere from two to four weeks after what was known in our circle as ""the american version."" the reason has to do with the moon or the orthodox calendar -- something mysterious like that -- though our mother always suspected it was scheduled at a later date so that the greeks could buy their marshmellow chicks and plastic grass at drastically reduced sale prices. ""the cheap sons of bitches,"" she'd say. ""if they had their way, we'd be celebrating christmas in the middle of goddamn february.""  because our mother was raised a protestant, our easters were a hybrid of the greek and the american traditions. we recieved baskets of candy until we grew older and the easter bunny branched out. those who smoked would awaken to find a carton of cigarettes and an assortment of disposable lighters, while the others would receive an equivalent, each according to his or her vice. in the evening we had the traditional greek meal followed by a game in which we would toast one another with blood-colored eggs. the symbolism escapes me, but the holder of the table's one uncracked egg was supposedly rewarded with a year of good luck. i won only once. it was the year my mother died, my apartment got broken into, and i was taken to th emergency room suffering from what the attending physician diagnosed as ""house-wife's knee.""  the italian nanny was attempting to answer the teacher's latest question when the moroccan student interrupted, shouting, ""excuse me, but what's an easter?""  it would seem that despite having grown up in a muslim country, she would have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no. ""i mean it,"" she said. ""i have no idea what you people are talking about.""  the teacher called on the rest of us to explain.  the poles led the charge to the best of their ability. ""it is,"" said one, ""a party for the little boy of god who call his self jesus...oh shit."" she faltered and her fellow country-man came to her aid.  **""he call his self jesus and then he be die one day on two...morsels of...lumber.""**  the rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pope an aneurysm.  ""he die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father.""  ""he weared of himself the long hair and after he die, the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples.""  ""he nice, the jesus.""  ""he make the good things, and on the easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.""  part of the problem had to do with vocabulary. simple nouns such as cross and resurrection were beyond our grasp, let alone such a complicated refexive phrases as ""to give of yourself your only begotten son."" faced with the challenge of explaining the cornerstone of christianity, we did what any self-respecting group of people might do. we talked about food instead.  ""easter is a party for to eat of the lamb,"" the italian nanny explained. ""one too may eat of the chocolate.""  ""and who brings the chocolate?"" the teacher asked.  i knew the word, so i raised my hand, saying, ""the rabbit of easter. he bring of the chocolate.""  ""a rabbit?"" the teacher, assuming i'd used the wrong word, positioned her index fingers on top of her head, wriggling them as though they were ears. ""you mean one of these? a rabbit rabbit?""  ""well, sure,"" i said. ""he come in the night when one sleep on bed. with a hand he have a basket and foods.""  the teacher sighed and shook her head. as far as she was concerned, i had just explained everything wrong with my country. ""no, no,"" she said. ""here in france the chocolate is brought by a a big bell that flies in from rome.""  i called for a time-out. ""but how do the bell know where you live?""  ""well,"" she said, ""how does a rabbit?""  it was a decent point, but at least a rabbit has eyes. that's a start. rabbits move from place to place, while most bells can only go back and forth -- and they can't even do that on their own power. on top of that, the easter bunny has character. he's someone you'd like to meet and shake hands with. a bell has all the personality of a cast-iron skillet. it's like saying that come christmas, a magic dustpan flies in from the north pole, led by eight flying cinder blocks. who wants to stay up all night so they can see a bell? and why fly one in from rome when they've got more bells than they know what do to with here in paris? that's the most implausible aspect of the whole story, as there's no way the bells of france would allow a foreign worker to fly in and take their jobs. that roman bell would be lucky to get work cleaning up after a french bell's dog -- and even then he'd need papers. it just didn't add up.  nothing we said was of any help to the moroccan student. a dead man with long hair supposedly living with her father, a leg of lamb served with palm fronds and chocolate; equally confused and disgusted, she shrugged her massive shoulders and turned her attention to the comic book she kept hidden beneath her binder.  i wondered then if, without the language barrier, my classmates and i could have done a better job making sense of christianity, an idea that sounds pretty far-fetched to begin with.  in communicating any religious belief, the operative word is faith, a concept illustrated by our very presence in that classroom. why bother struggling with the grammar lessons of a six-year-old if each of us didn't believe that, against all reason, we might eventually improve? if i could hope to one day carry on a fluent conversation, it was a relatively short leap to believing that a rabbit might visit my home in the middle of the night, leaving behind a handful of chocolate kisses and a carton of menthol cigarettes. so why stop there? if i could believe in myself, why not give other improbabilties the benefit of the doubt? i told myself that despite her past behavior, my teacher was a kind and loving person who had only my best interests at heart. i accepted the idea that an omniscient god had cast me in his own image and that he watched over me and guided me from one place to the next. the virgin birth, the ressurrection, and countless miracles -- my heart expanded to encompass all the wonders and possibilities of the universe.  a bell, though -- that's fucked up.",1,0,

418603,"most people in developed nations are obese but they wear a perspective effect to make themselves and everyone else look significantly thinner, and rely on maintenance to dispose of their gratuitous body fat that prevents them from doing basic tasks like getting in and out of a standard-sized car.  sadly, the ones we call ""skinny"" are those that can keep their weight shave for a few days. they aren't truly a healthy weight at all.  on a personal level, my parents were the opposite. they restricted my food intake and projected their own fat issues onto me, although i was born underweight and remained malnourished for the rest of my life, to this day.   they kept all of the tender morsels, supercakes, ultra-pies and life-sized mega sundaes stashed away for themselves and my rotund, greedy younger sister, who also constantly called me fat growing up despite being several times my size.   they referred to me as chubby and thick, and i believed them because i was given a height engineer to make me short so my stupid dad wouldn't feel insecure, weight engineer that didn't make me look heavier but it increased the number on the scale, and a perspective engineer that made me look thick, and in contrast it made others look thin (although most people were heavy, if not shockingly obese after i found the engineer, removed it, and saw other people's true appearances for the first time). clothes that were given to me were also shrunken so i'd think i wore normal to large-ish sizes. it worked.  when i took off the weight engineer and the perspective, i was shocked at both my low weight, my physical appearance and my deluded parents' abusive hypocrisy. i thought my bare skeleton would at least weigh 20lbs on its own, but i was wrong. i weighed well under 20 and still had skin, hair and organs. i took off my height engineer and was way too tall to fit through the door frame, but still under 20lbs without having known it until the second that the chubby and stubby physical effects had come off.  if i told you how little i weighed back then and even how low my current weight still is, there's no way anybody would believe me, unless you saw me in person.   i had to lead a normal life on very few calories for so long, which sped up my metabolism like you wouldn't believe. starving and being deprived of food doesn't slow down the metabolism; the opposite is true.   nowadays, if i eat even slightly more than my body can tolerate, i throw up the entire meal within the half-hour(i've never purged and i'm not bulimic, though). although my bmi is well within the range for anorexia, i don't count calories, obsess over my size or consider myself to have an eating disorder. i am just an emaciated individual with a shady, spiteful family.  /tangent",1,-2,

884265,"going to copy my response from a similar thread, if that's okay:  i've been very, very fat my whole life. currently 36 yrs, female, 5'4"" and 470-ish lbs. my father was thin, my mother was, and still is, rather fat, but not huge.  mother was very loving and an incredible cook. she showed love by making huge delicious meals and dishing out way too much for me. i think she did that because it's how she was raised as well.  father was an abusive, controlling ass. at least to me. he seemed to genuinely love mom, but he acted like i was an inconvenience at best, and a burden at worst. he would beat me (and i do mean beat, not spank, i know the difference) on a weekly basis for the smallest/dumbest things (taking too long in bathroom, getting a c on report card, dropping my fork at dinner, etc.).  we had a rule in his house: at dinner, you clean your plate. no exceptions, no excuses. whatever you're given, you'd better eat. this isn't that unusual, but combined with mom's habit of overfeeding me, it meant i'd be stuffed to the gills at every meal. and that led me to putting on an awful lot of weight from a very young age.  of course, my stomach eventually adjusted to the large portions i was getting, so i'd be able to eat it all without complaining. then mom would increase my helpings, thinking i wasn't getting enough.  my father hated me for being fat. he'd berate me almost constantly, tell me how ugly i was, etc. strangely, he never said any of that about mom, or did anything to stop her from feeding me so much. the thought did cross my mind that he wanted me to be fat so he'd have more ammunition against me. looking back, i'm almost 100% sure that was true. anyway. as a way to cope, i turned to food. i associated food with comfort and love because of mom, so it felt like a natural way to escape. as you can imagine, this did nothing to solve my weight problem.  i was over 400 pounds at age 14. by 18, i was nearly 600 (i dont remember what exactly i was at my heaviest, but it was in the low 590s. enough that my doctor rounded it up and used 600 as a shortcut in her conversation with me afterwards).  now, i do believe it's possible to be fat and healthy, even if you're morbidly obese. if you eat good foods and get exercise, you can be in good shape even if you're overweight. but, let me tell you something about being almost 600 pounds. it hurts. a lot. i. was. so. fucking. heavy. all that extra weight on me was murder on my joints. my feet would hurt within a few seconds of standing up. my ankles and knees ached when standing or walking. my back ached 24/7, 365. i was almost always just a little out of breath, because my lungs couldn't provide for my huge body. i walked with a very slow, careful waddle, with my arms swaying awkwardly to keep myself balanced, because i knew if i moved the wrong way i would throw out my back, or trip and fall (i couldn't see where i was stepping because my belly was so big). i fell a few times and couldn't get back up. at my heaviest, it took 4 people to help me up off the floor. remember, this is an 18 year old girl we're talking about. i'd have to scuttle through doors sideways because of how wide i was, and even then, it was a squeeze. even getting into and out of bed was becoming a serious production.  now, you're probably asking why i let myself get so big. surely i could see what was happening, how debilitating my weight was. well, yes and no. i was fully aware that i was extremely overweight, and clearly unhealthy, but it's also something that happens over time. the fat doesn't just pile on all at once and make you go holy shit i gotta do something. it's a gradual process, fools you into thinking everything is normal. my back didn't just start hurting like hell one day. it started as mild discomfort, slowly morphing into a constant twinge, then a gnawing ache, then chronic pain. i didn't just lose my breath suddenly and never get it back. first i'd get winded going up stairs, then walking quickly, then walking at all, and finally, even when sitting i'd be taking deep breaths to keep up with my body's demands. i was the proverbial frog, being slowly boiled alive.  a lot of fat people get a sudden wake up call. that one thing that happens and makes you go, ""holy fuck, if i dont lose weight i'm going to die next year."" that didn't happen for me. what was my turning point? i moved out. that was it. i moved out of my parents house, got a job (office receptionist) and an apartment, and just lived on my own from that point. without my father's constant abuse and harassment, i all but stopped stress eating, and away from my mother's cooking, my portions decreased. i was still a very big eater (i do still love to eat, honestly), but nothing like i was at home. i made a few friends and would go to the gym with them, and the weight began to come off. eventually i stopped going to buffets and mcrestaraunts, and began eating healthier like them. i hated how hard it was to move and do things, so i started lifting weights too. (edit: forgot to mention that swimming really helped me, especially early on. the water supported my weight so i could actually get some full-body exercise done without massive pain.)  it's been about 18 years since i left home. i'm still very fat. i know this. i only lost about 125 pounds. that might seem like a lot, and it is, but it was only 1/5 of my highest weight. i'm not really making a focused effort to slim down. i'm just trying to be healthy, and it's happening on its own. i know i'll never be thin. i'm okay with that. i can do so much more now. i still waddle, but it doesn't hurt to move. i still get winded on stairs, but i'm not constantly struggling to catch my breath. my back still hurts on occasion, but i dont constantly feel like i'm being crushed by my own weight. and yes, i do still eat more than i really should, but i'm not going to bed feeling like my stomach is about to pop.  i'm still losing weight, though very slowly. if i can get to a bit over 400, or maybe even less, i think i'll be alright. my body knows what it wants to do. i try to make good choices in food, and in amounts that feel comfortable for me, but yes, i do love pie, and i'm going to have some every saturday. it's my special treat for myself. when my body gets to a weight its comfortable with, i'll probably stop losing. and when that happens, i'm sure i'll still be a great big fat woman.  but at least i'm not 600 fucking pounds anymore.",1,2,

(especially the mother/father conflict).   the small details that you give throughout the story (the mom squatting next to the tent where the nobelmen were speaking, the many rituals and that young boy dancing) were fantastic.   there were a few sentences with a strong impact in your story and the ending (along with the riddle theme) was gold.  i also particularily enjoyed the part where the father snapped. brilliant, just brilliant.  \*\*\*  **a few little comments:**  &amp;#x200b;  &gt;here is a riddle. *how might someone become the seventh in a family of six*? to aileen, the answer was plain. bonfires studded the evening darkness, and funeral-goers danced in the flickering light. they grieved the passage of her brotherâ€”the seventh, the lost one, the martyr.  the very beginning (until plain) is very intriguing. it is a challenge, and made me want to know the answer immediately.  when i expect when someone says (or writes) that the answer is plain is definitely not a poetic description. the switch from ""to aileen, the answer was plain"" to ""bonfires... etc"" was unfortunately not executed well. if you want me to detach from the toughts of aileen and observe the bonfire, you will need to lead me there.  eithere say: ""to aileen the answer was in plain sight. bonfires... etc"" and then i can follow smoothly. or you continue from aileen's pespective. ""she watches as bonfires... etc"".  \*\*  &gt; he said that it was given to mark a young girl getting into more trouble than was proper.     &gt;   &gt; father smiled, and said that it wasnâ€™t water.    it is strange to have a conversation in which you hear one of the people only half the time for no apparent reason. why aren't these sentences spoken as well? it was a bit strange, especially that the dialogues happen naturally later in the story.  \*\*  &gt;firelight lit the blocky relief of the man who sat down beside her. the shadow spoke.   so, was he lit or not? if you use the word shadow, i expect him to be entirely in darkness, which he isn't.   &gt; the fire threw up a great shimmer of sparks, lighting his pale freckled skin and orange hair.   here you already show that he was at the very least partially lit.  \*\*  &gt; he batted playfully at her.  here i understood that he batted ""in her general direction"" not that he tapped or batted her.   \*\*  &gt;among them were old women and old men who still clung to their faded pride and fearsome ideas, and young women and young men who clung instead to faded ideas and fearsome pride. they were a nation without country.  this is a beautiful sentence.   \*\*  &gt; later that night, aileen noticed mother squatting up against the outside wall of the cabin in which the lords gathered. snatches of conversation carried from inside, more serious than before. she quickened her pace, hoping to make it past unseen, but to no success.    here we need more context. whe do not know what aileen was doing when she noticed her mother. she could have been standing in what passed as their home, looking outside. but you say she quickened her pace, which means that i expect something like: ""later that night, while doing x, aileen noticed"" or something similar. so, aileen has chores to do at night?   \*\*  &gt;â€œitâ€™s just water,â€ he said, â€œbetter after a long night.â€   &gt;   &gt;â€œitâ€™s hard,â€ he broke the silence, â€œlearning the truth of the world. always hard. but now you see why this fight is worth so great a sacrifice. now you know the reason behind the riddle.â€  two of his dialogues after another... that's strange, because in my mind's eye, i had registered no silence. so maybe you need to insert it before breaking it?  \*\*  anyway, good job on this and good luck!",0,,
704327,"if you want to fix this yourself, you'll need to do a couple things.  1. if the dent is bent to the side (rather than just missing), you'll want to bend it back to more or less straight.  if it was me i'd just be careful (gentle taps) and use a hammer. 2. reshape the edge with a coarse diamond 'stone' -- it looks like you'll need to remove a fair bit of material, so that'll make it not take too long. 3. use progressively finer stones to turn that into a nice edge.  i'd personally probably go with a fine diamond followed by a white ceramic if available, otherwise the finest diamond you can find.  you'll need to pick an edge angle btw -- it's fairly important that you choose what angle you want this thing to make and be consistent.  if you don't you'll probably end up with a rounded edge that doesn't work very well.  the shallower it is the sharper you can get, but the more delicate it will be.  personally i do somewhere around 30 degrees for my nicer knives, and about 45 on the mediocre knife i save for guests that can't be careful with things.",0,,

155642,"&gt; look, energy doesn't come from nowhere.  i'm not suggesting it does. i'm merely suggesting that weight control isn't as simple manipulating an input and output, there is a very complex process that is going on and oversimplifying it is literally dangerous to people's health.  &gt; if you don't give your body fuel, it'll start to eat itself.  it does a lot more than that, and the whole process is a lot more complicated. as definitive proof of that, compare life expectancy for people who eat literally nothing indefinitely vs. those who consume as little as a few hundred calories a day. the latter can live for an extraordinarily long period of time (that is not just a linear projection based on the extra calories... indeed, if you packed in all those extra calories over one day or two and then starved from there on in, your mortality would be quite similar to the folks who didn't binge before starting their fast) with minimal health problems, while the former have a life expectancy in weeks.  &gt; kids are cruel, they also make fun of people with acne, glasses, or red hair, the clothes they wear, their accent, their skin colour, anything that makes them different.  yes. adults aren't any different, beyond their capacity to learn that they shouldn't, and their ability to rationalize why they are.  either way, i can't remember someone was called lazy or piggish because they were a red head.  &gt; tax dollars.  wha? maybe you live in some weird communist country, but where i live, fitness clubs, diet foods, books, exercise videos, gym equipment, nutritionists, fat farms, etc. get the vast majority of their money directly from consumers. these are the industries i'm talking about. doctor's are, as a whole, remarkably uninvolved in the whole for economy that has built up around obesity.  &gt; this includes help losing weight if you are morbidly obese.  i have found that the tax subsidized portion of my health care is 100% useless of losing weight. it'll come in handy once my obesity causes an immediately life threatening medical condition (and even then, it won't help with the obesity), but in the meantime it is completely useless.  &gt; again, maybe you don't read my responses, but in most civilized countries including my own, health care is given to all, this includes help losing weight if you are morbidly obese.  so then... in uncivilized countries, people shouldn't/won't treat obese people so abominably? i see no such correlation.  &gt; aha! so you must have some idea on how the math of calories works. so if you eat less calories than you burn, you'll lose weight.  actually even that isn't necessarily true, although it is terribly likely. the problem is eating less calories changes how you much burn, and maintaining a deficit between the two is not only increasingly difficult but causes a number of health issues. even more difficult is keeping it off, as our biology is rigged to try to recoup the losses, even if we started out overweight.  &gt; even if it takes a good period (a few weeks) for the body to realize that your not in a famine, your just eating regularly now.  this is essentially how most fad diets work. you will observe that after a fad diet people gain weight at a *much* faster rate than they were before they went on the diet. it can *almost* work if you are just dealing with 5 or 10 pounds here and there, but it doesn't take much for it to induce a nice little biological spiral process that rapidly becomes a huge problem. it totally doesn't work if you are trying to lose far more significant amounts of weight.  &gt; when we realized that obesity can become costly and is detrimental to health and quality of life, society establishes a norm of thinness. in this way, we develop social norms.  oh please. you live in a fantasy land. when it was *hard* to be fat, that was what people aspired to. when it became *hard* to be thin, that was what people aspired to.  hell, we know tanning and being as thin as models are generally not good for people, and yet that remains a social norm.  &gt; whether it's 'fair' that some people can eat a gallon of ice cream and not gain weight is irrelevant. life isn't fair.  hmm..., i'll have to try the ""life isn't fair"" argument the next time i'm defending someone accused of a hate crime. it'd be a masterful way to justify beating up someone who is gay^h^hobese.  i think my favourite line is this:  &gt; exactly, you can't fix the problem for people if they are the problem.  i think you severely underestimate the factors involved in both causing and correcting obesity that are much bigger than an individual. indeed, you'll find weight change is a common experience as people shift from one community to another.  &gt; how else do you explain obesity?  it is a very complex phenomena. talk to someone who studies the issue, and you'll quickly find that it is far from being as simple as eating and exercise. i mean, if you look throughout history, we've never seen such a dramatic change in the average weight of the population as we've seen in the last few decades. do you really think this is caused by a bunch of people independently deciding that they want to eat more, exercise less, enjoy a poorer quality of life and be ostracized by society?",1,2,0
340959,"oh good, a question i can answer. take a seat, this is going to take a while.  you say you understand the idea of a nuclear chain reaction, but i'm going to cover it here in case anyone doesn't.  some kinds of atoms are unstable, especially the heavier ones (though lighter atoms like technetium can be too). the atoms that we're interested in for this question are uranium atoms, specifically uranium-235. u^235 is fissile, which means that when it is hit by a neutron it splits into two smaller atoms, releasing a lot of energy and two more neutrons. these neutrons can then go on to two atoms, then four, then eight, and so on. the reaction grows faster and faster and produces an enormous amount of energy. the energy is released in the form of x-rays, gamma rays, light, heat, etc.  **note for slightly more advanced readers:**  the reason so much energy is released by a nuclear reaction is that the mass of the two daughter atoms + neutrons is slightly less than the mass of the original u^235 atom. explaining why this is the case gets into some really hairy quantum and particle physics that i'm not sure i understand well enough myself, so i'll leave it out. the salient point is that the missing mass (sometimes referred to as the mass defect) can be plugged into einstein's famous formula e=mc^2. the energy produced (e) is equal to the mass defect (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. the speed of light squared is a huge number, so even a small amount of mass defect comes to a fairly large amount of energy. those of you who remember high-school chemistry might be thinking this violates the law of conservation of mass, and you'd be right. that law only applies to chemical reactions, not nuclear ones. **end note**  the problem with this is that not every neutron produced by the reaction will hit a u^235 atom. this depends on the size of the piece of uranium, impurities (like non-fissile u^238) and on the shape of the uranium. a reaction in which, on average, less than one of the produced neutrons hits a u^235 atom is called sub-critical and will quickly run out of steam. if exactly one neutron per reaction hits u^235, the reaction is critical and will keep going on its own, not increasing or decreasing in power (by the way, hollywood's beloved ""it's going critical!"" is a stupid thing to say - critical is the normal operating status for a nuclear reactor). likewise, if more than one neutron hits a u^235 atom, the reaction is supercritical and is gaining power.  if we assume that our uranium has a certain percentage of u^235 it's possible to calculate the size of a sphere which will sustain a critical reaction. the mass of this sphere is thus known as the critical mass.  so, to build a nuclear bomb, you want to have multiple pieces of uranium which, separately, are far below the critical mass but which, when put together, form a super-critical mass. or, more accurately, you want to go from very sub-critical to very super-critical very quickly. if you don't do it quickly enough, the reaction will produce enough energy to blow the bomb apart but not enough energy to cause the sort of city-shattering explosion people associate with nuclear bombs. by the somewhat odd standards of people who design nukes, this is called a ""fizzle.""  the simplest way to do this is to have a big sphere of uranium, and a gun that fires a small plug of uranium into a specially shaped hole. these don't work all that well; the gun has to be very powerful because the reaction can start before the plug reaches the sphere, causing the bomb to fizzle. such a powerful gun is very large and heavy, making it difficult to use these bombs. also, the addition of the small plug typically doesn't make the bomb very supercritical, so this type of bomb is usually rather weak and dirty. the little boy bomb dropped on hiroshima was one of these.  the next way to do this is to use explosives to drive a set of uranium wedges or cones together. this is called an implosion-type bomb. this is very complicated to do, since explosives blast outwards rather than inwards. they got around this by inventing the explosive lens; basically a carefully shaped piece of a slow explosive covered in a fast explosive; the slower explosive bends the explosion into a compressing sphere the same way a glass lens bends light. these tend to be more powerful than gun-type bombs (and consequently cleaner) but they're very difficult to build since the slightest imperfection in the implosion will cause the bomb to spray uranium dust all over the place instead of explode. the fat man bomb dropped on nagasaki was one of these. the fat man used plutonium-239 rather than u^235, but the principle is the same.  now, it's really expensive to produce enough uranium (or plutonium) for one of these bombs. the bomb-designers realized that if they surrounded the core with a dense shell of u^238 (called a neutron reflector or tamper), they could reflect some of the escaping neutrons back in to have another go. this reduced the amount of uranium needed to make a bomb and, as a useful side effect, the inertia of the heavy u^238 holds the bomb together for an extra fraction of a second allowing the reaction to grow longer and produce more energy.  at this point we've basically reached the limit of what can be done with simple nuclear fission. these bombs are pretty powerful, but that wasn't good enough during the cold war. so, to get more bang, bomb designers started looking elsewhere.  what they came up with was the fusion-boosted bomb. they reasoned that if they put a container of tritium or deuterium (some designs also used various isotopes of helium) next to the bomb when it went off, the powerful x-rays produced by the fission reaction would cause the deuterium to fuse together to produce a heavier atom, releasing even more energy than fission (see note above for why) and even more neutrons. the neutrons then blasted back into the exploding remnants of the uranium core and caused them to fission some more. also, the normally non-fissile u^238 tamper can become fissile in such extreme circumstances, adding even more energy to the blast. most of the energy of a fusion-boosted bomb actually comes from the third-stage fission of the core debris and the tamper, not the fusion. this is how the arms race went from the 16 and 21 kiloton bombs dropped on japan to the 16 megaton castle bravo test device that unexpetedly blasted a mile-and-a-half crater out of bikini atoll in 1954 and the 50 megaton tsar bomba that russia test-detonated over novaya zemlya in 1961.  by now people kind of agreed that that was enough, that you reach a point where a single bomb can level an entire city and there's not a lot of point going bigger than that. so they started figuring out ways to nuke multiple cities with just one missile, but that's something for another day.  finally, a short explanation of how the bomb produces such destruction. the heat directly produced by the reaction is only a fairly small amount of the energy - most of it escapes in the form of x-rays, gamma rays, alpha and beta particles, stray neutrons, etc. all of this radiation shines out into the nearby air, instantly heating it to many thousands of degrees and causing it to expand rapidly, producing a powerful pressure wave.  tvtropes has a good page on the effects of a nuclear bomb [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/thedeadliestmushroom), if you're still interested after that wall o'text.",0,,

""any pdf forces in hab culaxes, respond."" his helmet's vox-link hissed with static, as his own distorted voice reverberated through his earpieces. there was no answer beyond the ever-repeating quarantine warning that had been the only communication from the planet these past three days.  a gurgling hiss behind him was all the warning he needed. leaping to the side with a speed that belied his armour's bulk, he drew his knife and drove it deep into the heart of the would-be ambusher. it appeared to be some form of mutated geneatealer, smaller and lither, with weaker claws. it writhed in agony as its life blood drained away, the noxious liquid hissing and bubbling as it melted the ground where it fell.  leaving the corroded and twisted blade in the xeno's chest, he drew his bolter and began to march towards the target site, a manufactorum located within the towering hab-block. it would take him almost two full minutes to make the three kilometer journey, if he kept to a sustainable pace.  as he drew near to the towering gates of the hive-city, a gruesome spectacle assailed him. a platoon of thirty pdf conscripts, slaughtered to a man. roughly half of the dead men's ribcages were twisted and shattered, gaping holes in their chests that seemed to come from inside.   a faint cracking of ribs was all the warning the astartes recieved. whirling, he fired a bolt at a seemingly dead guardsman just as a tiny xenos parasite leapt from the newly gnawed passage in the man's torso. the explosive round obliterated the parasite in a shower of black blood and pink flesh.  he retrieved the flamer from a dead soldier, and hurled it at the undamaged bodies, then squeezed the trigger on his boltgun, launching a .75 rocket directly into the promethium tank. the resulting explosion coated the fallen soldiers in flame, both a funeral pyre for the honoured dead and a purging inferno for the xenos desecrators.  from behind, a piercing screech. he turned to take in the monstrosity, a full twelve feet tall, with wicked talons and razor fangs, and a massive, elongated head. the creature leapt for him, one claw drawn back to strike.  he met the blow with an armoured fist, stopping the xenos attack dead in its tracks. as he brought the muzzle of his bolter towards the creature, it swung low with its tail, knocking his feet from under him. rolling to the left to avoid the creature's incisors, he lashed out and crushed a talon with a precisely aimed kick. as the monster howled in pain, he punched directly through its throat, then locked his fingers around the creature's spine and tore the chain of vertebrae from the beast.   it collapsed in a ragged mass in front of him. remembering the acidic blood of the first xeno, he used the stock of his bolter to crush the creature's skull with minimal bloodshed. removing his helmet, he knelt down and scooped out a globule of cerebral tissue. placing the brain matter gently inside his mouth, he began to chew the alien brain. as it rapidly dissolved in his acidic saliva, the beast's memories came flooding through him. it had been an ogryn, part of the pdf regiment guarding the manufactorum. there was a... hive, and a... queen. destroying those would prevent further growth.  he had his objective. it was time to cleanse this world.  *three hours later*  the phrase ""silent as the grave"" could not have been more appropriate. the shredded bodies of hundreds of xenos and guardsmen littered the manufactorum's entranceway.   ""this is brother calistarius of the blood angels. any surviving pdf or arbites forces, respond.""   a hiss of static filled his helm's vox-link and a faint and garbled voice filled his ears. ""*...quistor dayvan fer of the ord... apped in the central control chamb... reful of thier blood, it melts through soli..."" the vox link cut out. the faint clatter of a heavy-stubber could be faintly heard.  despite his massive size, the astartes made no discernible sound as he made his way towards the manufactorum's main construction bay. he could hear the skittering of the monsters through the air ducts above the hall. no doubt they thought themselves silent. had they been stalking a human, they would have been.  he fired a single bolt at the ventilation shaft, shattering the strengthened titanium as if it had been made of wood. a stream of ebony blood cascaded from the gaping rent in the passageway. a second bolt, and another dark waterfall began to corrode through the floor below. the skittering ceased. no doubt others would arrive soon, but he would be long past by then.   ""emperor's damnation!"" he swore to himself. tilting the boltgun to examine the magazine revealed that only three shots remained. a quick search of his tac-belt revealed only a single pistol magazine. this may not prove so easy after all.   ten minutes of walking later, he came across a burned out chimera. the small tank apeared to have suffered only cosmetic damage. a moment of minor exertion was all it took to tear the multilaser from the turret and patch the cords into his power armour's generator. he estimated that he would only be able to make a half dozen shots before his armour's machine spirit rejected the addition and deactivated the weapon. still, he reflected, heresy or not, it was better to be armed. he doubted the xenos would appreciate his pragmatism.  thus armed, he continued down the dimly lit passageway towards the heart of the manufactorum. towards the queen. towards the salvation of a world.  *fifteen minutes later*  the doors of the central construction chamber were four inches of solid plasteel. a single shot to the locking mechanism and a strike by his armoured fist were enough to send them careening inwards, twisted and battered. he stepped over the threshold, into the cavernous construction bay. the colossal body of a warhound battle titan towered over the comparatively small marine. its massive plasma gun lay on the concrete beside it, chains loosely draped around it and attached to a titanic crane. the defenders must have abandoned this project in a hurry, if they left such a valuable warmachine so near to completion.   it became immediately apperent why it had been abandoned. a dozen shadowy figures rose from behind a leman russ assembly line, and crawled warily forward. calistarius drew a flare from his belt and hurled it at the approaching group. the faint red glow cast a devilish illumination on the approaching xenos.   ""by the emperor's light, your sins are shown!"" a bolt of searing crimson light leapt from the muzzle of the multilaser, punching a four inch hole in the nearest beast and passing through to dissipate against the titan chassis' leg armour.   ""by his will, your blight shall be purged!"" a second shot vaporized the head of another, sending gouts of corrosive blood spraying from the creature's neck. the spray coated the nearest three. immune to their own venom, it still coated the unprotected eyes, blinding the beasts.   ""i am the instrument of his cleansing light!"" firing four shots in rapid succession, he discarded the multilaser and drew his bolt pistol.   the three remaining xenos leapt at him in a flurry of scything claws. he ducked under a blow and caught one by the tail. swinging the beast like a club from his left hand as he fired his pistol from his right. knocking one xeno aside with his unwilling bludgeon, his bolt round punched straight through, exploding inside the creature. the acidic spray ate away at his armour's red paint, and burned a few minor holes in the armoured undersuit. the xeno club, and the other battered creature lay broken on the concrete before him.   the acidic blood had shorted out his helmet's hud. he unsealed the bindings, and tore the useless helm from his head, letting it clatter to the floor.   from behind the titan, something stirred. a giant silhouette, just outside the flare's bright aura. it was at least twenty feet tall, lithe and thin. such a beast would be a match for even a dreadnought.   ""your filth ends here, beast. you will corrupt this world no longer. as the gargantuan creature charged towards him, he emptied his bolt pistol. the twelve explosives sailed past the creature, not a single one hit.  were it possible for such a creature to smile, it would have. the puny *thing* before it had used its last weapon and done no damage. it let out a scream of triumph.  ""i wasn't aiming for you,"" calistarius intoned softly, as the twelve hypersonic rounds impacted the titan's fallen plasma gun and detonated its core.  ""the emperor is my shield.""   as the expanding cloud of uncontrolled energy passed over him, calistarius' lips curled into a smile. it was admirable to die in the emperor's name.",0,,

630886,"hi there! i see you've already got some great advice below. here is my two cents. i'm your height (maybe half an inch shorter), but 18 years older than you and 10 pounds lighter than you. i am really happy at my current weight. in my early 20s, i was usually in the 127-128 region and never quite felt happy with my appearance (it didn't help that clothes shopping was very difficult, because i have a very small bust, but all my excess waist would accumulate on my hips, so i could never fit into clothes off the rack!).   first of all, no matter what, remember that you are more than your weight and measurements. i'm sure you're good at a bunch of different things, have various interests, and have a lot to offer to people around you. **always remember this.**  you're at a very vulnerable age - and i can see you have the maturity to recognize that this daily fat shaming can and will affect your self confidence and mental well being. i'm sorry to say that things will get a **lot** harder before they get easier. going into puberty and high school will be really difficult if you do not have high self esteem. as you get older, your mom will shame you even more aggressively. the only way to come out of this daily shaming is to have self confidence -- i know, it's easier said than done.   (as a side bar, there's no such thing as an asian nose! i'm sure yours is very cute, even if it's not the same as everyone else's. i'm also sure there's probably a girl you know with a huge nose, and she probably feels worse about her nose than you do yours!! grammar and spelling are things you can improve, and having a hot crush, well... that will be awkward and embarrassing for many more years to come. don't worry, everything will be fine in the end!!)   onto my next comment: you're already quite tall for your age. i suspect you will continue to grow. this is typically ""good"" in chinese parents' eyes, *until you get too tall*. from what i can tell (from my taller chinese friends), 'too tall' is about 5'8"". you'll have to start getting used to more verbal abuse about your appearance.   /u/hollyburn is totally right about genetics playing a huge part. have you seen pics of your mom from when she was your age, or before she had kids? what about your maternal grandmother and paternal grandmother?   **hot tip** - if your paternal grandmother was fat/big boned, blame your weight on your dad's side of the family. ime, most chinese women have bad relationships with their mother-in-laws, and are more than happy to assign blame on mil than themselves.   if all the women in your family tree (before having kids) were slimmer/slenderer than you, *and you do not have an un-diagnosed medical condition* (e.g., thyroid issues), then it's time to look at your weight objectively as possible and figure out if you are overweight or not.   i'll point you to this cdc bmi calculator **for children**. if you were an adult, i would emphatically state that you in the normal weight range for a healthy adult. however, you are 12.  take a look here: https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/calculator.aspx  from this calculator, you'll see that you are overweight - and not just by asian standards.   at this point, you can decide if you agree or disagree. there may be other factors where you are still at a healthy weight, but i don't know those details. honestly, the best person to opine on this is your pediatrician or family doctor.   in order to not develop an eating disorder, it's very important to become educated on what it means to be healthy. exercise is certainly very important (especially at your age), but in all honesty, is not the key to losing weight. losing weight is easiest to achieve with sensible diet and portion control. being active has tons of other benefits, but calorie intake is generally the biggest hurdle here.   **hot tips** - if your mom, like many asian moms, insist on overfeeding you and then blame you for gaining weight, you will need to maneuver around her to eat less. here are my personal tactics:    1. if you guys often have soup at dinner time, drink a second bowl of soup after your first (say ""this soup is really yummy, i'll have more"").  2. eat slowly. seriously, be the last person to finish.  3. ask to eat xifan/congee instead of steamed rice (bonus if your mom likes to make it with lots of weird whole grains) -- it is both healthier for you, and has about 10x the water than regular steamed rice  (so you will still eat a large volume to your mom's eyes, but most of it will be water).  4. concentrate on eating veggies. your mom will always want you to eat more veggies, so just honestly go to town and fill up on veggies.  5. for fatty foods, deep fried, other otherwise calorie heavy, take a piece or two into your bowl, but do not finish eating it. nibble at it in between the veggies. always look like you're eating more food by bringing more vegetables into your bowl. always bring the veggies into your bowl and then into your mouth (do not go straight from plate to mouth). slow things down.  6. the rest is up to you: cut out any drinks with calories (stick to plain water, or tea), do not eat tons of snacks or prepackaged / processed foods. drink lots of water (don't drink it from the tap if you don't want to be nagged at; boil it in a kettle, and drink it lukewarm)    i know this is a lot to take in, but please always remember that **you're not in this alone**. if you don't have anyone you can talk to in person about this, you can always rely on us girls here who can relate to your struggles. things can get really out of hand if you try to take it on all alone -- so make sure you reach out to people who care about you (friends, teachers, counselors) if it ever starts to feel like it's too much.   the most important thing is to be healthy and happy. our parents often only see measurable things (grades, weight) as indicators of a ""successful"" life, but many of us who have grown up know you need to take responsibility for your own health and happiness at a lot younger age than our non-asian counterparts. it can be stressful, but you can definitely do it! you are a strong person, never forget that.   i hope things get easier for you. please stick around!",1,0,
809258,"it's always exciting when you can fit into a smaller size. i've been through that a number of times, keeping my bigger pants around for when the waist and butt size went back up, which it did. i used to get excited about what the scale showed too. now i've learned it's not about getting light and small. that's really never what i wanted.  it's about getting lean! i want definition and firmness, and strength. bicycling is my thing so checking my times up hills and other segments is most important to me. the lightest i've been in my adult life was also one of the slowest and weakest periods of my life. i was starving myself. now i've found out how to get my fat down without starving myself while actually gaining lean strength. for me it is simply to go on a very low fat diet and be patient. for 16 months now this has resulted in slow but steady, relentless fat loss and increased strength and performance without me ever having to be meager with my portions. lots of calories!  plenty of food! as much as i want whenever i want! that's what makes this sustainable. i wouldn't call myself a hardbody yet but i'm the leanest and most defined i've ever been. and that's at 54 years old. never in my teens or 20s have i actually seen my abs, even when i was scary skinny and people were worried about my appearance. everybody is telling me i look healthy and strong now. yes, my waist size is down and my weight is down but it's a lot different when it's done with plenty of calories coming in. extra calories do not all turn in to fat! it depends on what you eat. the vast majority of fat on our body came in to our body as fat. turns out humans do not convert a lot of carbs and protein into fat. those get used for energy, moving around, feeling good, building and maintaining lean tissue. if someone can show evidence of humans turning large amounts of carbs and protein into fat i'd like to know. my experience suggests john mcdougall was right. the fat you eat is the fat you end up wearing. yes, nuts and seeds are good food, as colin campbell says, but they're not great when you're trying to get leaner. i plan to use them to put fat back on when i get too lean. i can hardly wait to have that problem!",1,0,
447339,"the best survival tool is your brain. exercise it by going camping and learning outdoor survival. since you live in a city, you can practice by urban camping. putting yourself in these situations is like a reality check--you can imagine what you might need and what it will be like but it is easy to have grandiose delusions of what the situation is supposed to be like. your survival kit sounds like it is inspired too much by fiction; if you have a shotgun other people are going to want it and it may not protect you. also, your survival kit seems to be focused too much on risks from other people and not the very deadly illnesses that we don't have to worry about in our civilized world (gangrene and infections). that kid from into the wild is an example of grandiose delusions meeting the fucked up reality that is the wilderness. he did a lot of things wrong (i blame thoreau).  here is how i would recommend remaking the pack. first, ditch the marmot frame pack--it is way to big. get something from the army surplus store. you want the total weight of the pack to be light enough you can run and scramble around with--maybe 25-35 lbs depending on how big you are. next, ditch the most of the food and replace it with one or two mres. that shit you have is way too heavy and you will be able to scavenge for food if it gets really bad. i would recommend keeping about three weeks worth of food in your cabinets (rice, flour, canned foods) and a few jugs of water in the closet. you would live off this for the first weeks of the disaster and perhaps order will be restored during this time or perhaps not.  if order has not been restored then you will have to assess your options. maybe you want to take to the streets and use your place as a shelter or maybe you don't want to sleep in the same place every night. it depends on where you live and how safe you feel.   also, since you already told your friends about your pack you should setup a disaster plan with them. they will be your next biggest asset to your brain. if in a disaster you can get together to back each other up, you will feel much safer and be much safer scavenging and moving from place to place. ok, let me sum this up with a list of my recommended pack based on your original list.  the pack and extra food is meant to serve in the event of many different kinds of disasters including a water line break, severe storm, natural disaster, riots, and utter apocalypse.   * army surplus pack -- it is much more durable. * kabar is a good knife, but you don't need a machete unless you live in florida. get a smaller model and maybe even one that folds...it would suck to stab yourself and get an infection. * leatherman micra -- this is probably okay. it is light, but it might break easier than the full size. * benelli m3 super 12gauge shotgun, 36 rounds of 00 buckshot, 36 slug rounds -- okay, that is a pretty decent shotgun as long as it is not the semi-auto (those jam to easily). make sure you know how to clean it.  i would recommend keeping it at home and if it gets really bad taking a small hand gun out with you that you can conceal. maybe a small 9mm beretta. * 2-3 mres -- there is no need to reinvent the wheel. ramen is good, cheap, quick meal and popular among college students, but does not contain that much energy. mres last forever and they are designed for high energy on-the-go situations. and the spam is too heavy (water) so leave it in the cupboards. kashi granola bars? okay, maybe a handful of energy bars, but leave these in the cupboards. if the shit really hits the fan, extra vitamins and fiber are going to be the least of your concerns. and leave the peanut butter in the cupboard--remember we are concerned about weight, you might have to run and climb with this pack on. peanut butter contains too much water. * 1-2 metal canteens -- these are versatile and have multiple uses. you can boil water in them and they are durable. ever tried to fix a leak in a camelbak? not possible. therefore, go with metal canteens. * head lamp and if you have the weight a smaller flashlight. * handheld radioshack radio -- is this fm and am? or is it a full scanner? the scanner would be good to keep at home programmed with your local police frequencies.  on the road you are going to want something light and something that lasts. that means fewer batteries so a hand-powered radio that also works for wx and maybe short-wave would be ideal. * m-15 gasmask with filter -- okay, the shit is getting real now. you need to make sure that this is legit and that the filter has not expired. this will only really be useful in the first days of a chemical or biological strike and the first weeks of a nuclear strike. if the disaster is not one of these then you probably can leave it at home unless you just want to be a bad ass. * waterproof matches and a flint and steel magnesium lighter -- if the striker breaks, the magnesium lighter works fantastic with kabar knives. keep the zippo at home, you need something that will last. you will probably only need to start a fire on your own if the disaster lasts a very long time and so you need something durable. * several maps including my state, the entire us, and a detailed urban map of my city and surrounding cities -- that's good. * mec light raincoat -- okay good, but what is mec? once again, the word is multi-use. the best raincoat would be a poncho that has buttons so you can convert it into a tarp to sleep under or on, depending on the situation.  * first aid kit (bandages, gauss pads, 2 syringes) - okay good, you need durable bandages. syringes? okay, i guess. * 2 bottles of aspirin, one bottle of amoxicillin -- more medicine. can't have enough of it. and take it out of the bottles, they add weight. also, some iodine. * 1 flask of jack daniels (for real) -- yeah, this is not a bad idea, as long as it is light-weight. * $300 us cash, 300euro cash -- cash is good. remember we are planning for multiple kinds of emergencies. just don't get robbed * in addition, i would recommend some clothing such as several pairs of socks and underwear. and an extra pair of pants (military surplus or carhart) and an extra shirt (long sleeve). and a hat.  * rope and string -- keep it lightweight * random items that you may need -- chemical glow stick (excellent for signaling with the string), condoms (multiuse), small mirror (signalling and multiuse).  main things to remember.   0. your knowledge and sense 1. lighweight pack 2. multiuse items 3. concealment (don't advertise yourself or what you have also you won't look insane if you grab the pack during a fire alarm or minor evacuation.) 4. oh and friends. they are especially useful when it comes to taking out zombies that you didn't see. and they make you feel safer. (seriously, good friends are important and not just for the apocalypse.)  damn that was a long answer.  also, you are not paranoid. this is a perfectly natural thought process that some people who are concerned about being prepared go through. and after all, most of us did see the twin towers go down at a very impressionable time. maybe the gas mask is a little paranoid but if you live in the city then who knows. (more than likely, if there is a chemical or biological attack you are going to be exposed before you realize it.) anyway, it may help with your more skeptical friends if you call the pack or kit a go-pack or go-kit and that it is for the possible event that you will have to evacuate or leave very quickly. (unless your go bag looks like this http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/b6fpt/does_anyone_else_have_an_apocalypse_kit_in_their/c0l6wfx, then you are being delusional. seriously, a sword!? kevlar!? i guess those night vision goggles will be really useful for the few hours the batteries last. that is called grandiosity.)   and remember, it is much more likely that you have a power outage next week or a water main break than a terrorist attack or atomic bomb and the point of the pack is to prepare for all of these things, especially the more likely scenarios.  another thing from a comment below:  further, its too easy for all of this talk about survival and shit to get overblown. perhaps you live near a place that you can hike and spend the night outsite? ... i recommend taking some friends and spending a few nights outside to learn what it is like and to just enjoy the outdoors. this should be a fun and social thing to do that helps learn a few basic skills. one can read about being outdoors in a book, but actually being there and being uncomfortable and enjoying it or not is something that can't be learned from a book.",0,,

769073,"i'm not trying to be a dick to you. i have always been a big guy. usually the biggest one out of the group. in fact, i have a very rare neuromuscular disease and one of the side effects are hypertrophic muscles. i literally have calves like an nfl player. like 0% fat massive fucking muscles. the rest of my body isn't nearly as toned, and i was the fat kid growing up.  i'm in my late 30's now and i weigh less than i did in highschool. for the first time in my life i am more in shape than most of the guys i know. you can see my abs and i'm no longer self conscious about being fat when i take my shirt off, i'm self conscious because i'm starting to look like a body builder.  i'm not *quite* there yet and i need to start working out more to get toned, but i'm starting to look good.  what i want you to understand is that... no diet ever worked for me. i had totally unrealistic expectations about losing weight. i wanted to be skinny. i'm 6'0' and i wanted to be like a skinny 160lb guy that wears something smaller than a 38 and xl shirts. and i wanted it to happen quick.  i started ""dieting"" (eating properly) about 10 years ago. i'm currently seeing the results of **10 years of dieting/work**. i didn't do this on purpose, either, i just started getting older and stopped wanting to eat as much. if i eat too much i feel nauseous and bloated, so i began naturally limiting my intake and over 10 years i've shed about 40-50 lbs.   i'm just a hair around 220 right now and at my age i realize now that if i dropped another 50lbs i'd look sickly. i wouldn't be healthy. i'm getting to the point now where i have to consciously make myself eat more sometimes because i know i haven't had enough calories. it isn't about weight loss anymore for me, it's about shaping what weight i have to make it look good. it freaks me out when i'm in bed and i can feel my ribs and see them. or when i stretch and i can see my hip bones.  i never had a realistic image in my head of what being healthy looked like. i fought nature for years and years trying to fit an image that was never ever possible for me due to genetics. my body simply put was not ""designed"" to be that weight. i'm too tall. my shoulders are too broad.   i can distinctly remember about 10-12 years ago i was really depressed about my weight and i went to a doctor and told him i wanted to be skinny. he asked me what i meant and the first thing i did was point to my calves. this might sound funny to you but if i wear shorts in public people on the street will sometimes make comments. i've had total strangers say shit like, ""holy fuck, god damn look at those calves, i hope you don't kick me."" when you're 60 lbs overweight with a gut that doesn't feel good.   so i point to my calves, which are literally perfect muscles with no fat. just solid pieces of rock. god knows how much they each weigh. i tell him i want to get rid of them and have a ""normal"" body. i'm really embarrassed and defeated.   you know what that guy did?  he started laughing. not at me. at how ridiculous the idea was. he proceeded to tell me that i could lose all the weight in the world, but that those calves aren't going anywhere. he said i'd be a tiny little stick figure before those ever went anywhere. the very last place i'd ever lose weight would be those calves. i wasn't hurt, i was honestly caught off guard. no one had ever talked like that before, and he proceeded to pull his pant leg up and show me his calves. he explained how my body is bigger than his, and how because of my muscular disease that there was just no way in hell it was ever going to happen. then he started pointing to other parts of my body and said, ""what if your stomach wasn't as big, and what if it was as tight as your calves? what about your biceps? what if your ass wasn't so soft? those are the places that you can do something with.""  totally blew my mind, brother. i never thought about my body like that. i'm just a big guy. i'm never going to be anything but a big guy. if i really wanted to i could absolutely tone and condition my body to like a body builder. that's just me. i'm a big fucking giant. if i ever fit into a pair of 34 or 32 pants i'm going to look emaciated.   so now 10 years later when my friends are getting fat, i'm walking around looking buff. it's really weird. i feel like i'm in some kind of new club with the comments that people make. it's really honestly awkward and embarrassing and i don't know how to handle it. i was at a pool party the other day and took my shirt off in front of a bunch of people i hadn't seen in years and there were just all kinds of hoots and hollers.   not trying to brag of write a wall of text about myself, but dude that took me over 10 years and i'm still not there yet. in a way i feel like the real work is about to begin when it comes to working out. i go to the gym twice a week but i want to start doing daily lifting, kind of slowly introducing this new part of my life. first time i've ever worked out with any regularity.   it was 100% a result of restructuring the way i lived. honestly it wasn't even work, it just kind of happened on its own, but now i can look back and point to that time and say, ""that's when it started, i stopped eating so much.""  it was about 2 years ago that i really started to notice the results. so 8 years of just maintaining a healthy diet and slowly losing a pound every other month or so. then in the last two years, and specifically in the last year i've started thinking, ""damn, i really need to eat something, i haven't had enough calories today. what do i want to eat? i can literally eat butter if i want to... anything i want...""  my point to you dudeman is that when you look at skinny people, or healthy people, or muscular people... you are looking at the product of an entire life of good decisions that incrementally add up. it isn't realistic to transition from being overweight to ""good looking"" or ""in shape"" in a year, or two years. you can do it if you work your ass off, or if you make very unhealthy decisions. there's that one guy who was morbidly obese who stopped eating for a year under doctor's supervision and only consuming supplements. at the end of the day though it's all about powering your body relative to how much you work.  got a buddy of mine who is super skinny. he came over to dinner yesterday for the holiday weekend and dinner was pushed back an hour and a half. he legitimately started getting light headed because he hadn't eaten all day. that isn't a problem i have. i can go an extra hour, two, three, or even skip a meal and i'm fine. he can't. he works outside with his hands, he weighs about 160lbs, and if he doesn't eat his body lets him know right away. he burns so many calories in his normal day that missing a meal is a huge deal for him. he literally got the point where he was bitching and i started getting annoyed until he told me rather seriously that he was getting shaky and needed to eat. he ended up eating a sandwich before dinner, and then ate more than i did at dinner. that's him. that's how his body works. not mine. i could literally pick him up under my arm and carry him like a sack of potatoes if i wanted to. it would take a really long time for me to starve to death by comparison. feel me?  &gt;not saying thereâ€™s a conspiracy here or anything, just saying the ama isnâ€™t necessarily right.  not disagreeing with you, but if you're intentionally deviating from their suggested dietary guidelines without solid reasons based on observable fact (i.e. peer reviewed study) then you are intentionally risking your health for no reason at all. you have already said you understand that your weight loss is a function of you being able to ""control your addiction"", so deep down you know the reason you're getting skinnier has nothing to do with keto, and everything to do with you making a change in the way you live. keep that shit up. life is a long game, not a short game. health isn't about how you look relative to other people. it's about how you live. it isn't healthy to cut carbs out of your diet. per the ama they should make up something like 30% of your diet... maybe more, i don't know, it's somewhere up there in one of the links.",1,-1,-1

977807,"**fireza lagarou -- cancer**  **bio**: fireza grew up in a lawless town where the strong survive and the weak do not. at a young age, she managed to befriend a gang who took pity on her, and kept her safe. in exchange, she kept them company, and in good spirits. in the end, it turned out the gang relied on her more than anyone thought, and they all died protecting her from a rival gang. tramautized, fireza decided she herself would be strong, and never have to rely on the strength of others. she spontaneously ""awoke"" as a nen user right then and there due to sheer trauma and nothing else. wiping out the entirety of the rival gang, she then ran away and lived in the forest and nearly lost her human intelligence, until she was found by the ophiuchus mercenaries. she took the spot of cancer amongst the 12, but is infamous amongst them and others as a lone wolf who refuses to take on a job as a team. the ophiuchus mercenaries are a mercenary group of 12, plus a couple dozen interns, dedicated to making the world a better place. they accept payment only in the form of food and supplies, and only when it can be easily given. they do everything, from combat, to evacuations and emergency repairs (broken barn that needs to be fixed before the winter? there's people who can help!).   **personality:** fireza is slow to trust others, except cute girls (she is very gay). even then, she hates it when other people endanger themselves for her, and just... generally does not like it when her friends are in any danger at all. she's pretty gruff and crude, and doesn't really care about what people say about her.  she's a bit flirty but respects boundaries. she laughs at stupid things but most jokes fly over her head, and the only thing that makes her happier than showing off how strong she is, is when she does so in front of someone she likes. her favorite food is pineapple, but she refuses to eat it on pizza. she's very honest about what she thinks about other people, and has absolutely zero tact. she collects fine china. fireza ""could"" revert to a normal human size, but she doesn't want to, even when it's incredibly inconvenient. if you're even remotely nice to fireza, she would probably be willing to die for you. fireza absolutely hates greedy or selfish people who don't value human life as much as their own profits, but she also does not consider ""bad"" people to be human, and to her their lives are forfeit.  **appearance**: fireza is massive. with messy red hair, an angular face, a crooked grin, and a mannish muscular frame, fireza does not look pretty. thanks to her nen abilities, she stands well over 9 feet tall. fireza dresses in loose fitting leather clothing with no sleeves or shoes, rumor has it she cleans up nicely, but these rumors have yet to be confirmed.  nen category: enhancer  age: 27   occupation: ophiuchus mercenary  physical stats (these would be her stats at a normal human size, without using overgrowth to enhance her physique at all.)   strength: 3  vitality: 3  dexterity: 5  perception: 2    aura control: 3  aura output: 3  equipment: a really big warhammer. relatively short handle compared to the massive head. she also has leather clothes, but she takes them off to use her camouflage hatsu, opting instead to use her own natural bone armor to cover up.  hatsus (all enhancer):  **overgrowth:** fireza is capable of using her nen to enhance her body's ability to produce tissue. in the long term, she can use this to become significantly larger, regenerate lost limbs, and more. but, in the short term, she can instead use it to significantly bulk up her muscles, and make her bones hyper dense. the limitation to this is she completely sacrifices her ability to use nen to enhance her strength and durability directly. her strength is her own, completely unenhanced by nen. overall, she is actually stronger than a normal enhancer, and still quite agile, but she is not only huge to the point where she's proportionately weaker, but also disproportionately heavy (from dense bones and muscles). she absolutely cannot rely on things like tree branches, and is unable to swim while overgrowth is active.  when fireza is in too deep, she can enhance her own metabolism, consuming her excess tissue to regain nen. using overgrowth, then undoing what she gained will lead to an overall decrease in nen, but means she can fight efficiently for longer. in addition, she can use this to reduce her weight even further, going from a dense bone structure to a hollow one. this makes her lightweight instead of heavy, with only a little less physical strength, and even greater agility, but much less durability. as she still cannot use nen for offense or defense, a bone shattering blow could prove dangerous, but the nen she gains from hollowing out her bones could be helpful.   **bone armor:** by growing extra bones, she can create spiked armor. being much denser than normal bone, it is incredibly effective, but also not flexible. it takes more time to retract the bone armor than it takes to produce it. as it's spiked, she can use this for offense, too.  **camouflage:** a stealth technique, fireza adapts her skin to be like that of a cuttlefish, allowing her to disguise with the scenery. this is ineffective while moving, and much more effective against any sort of textured background. she can use this no matter how bulked up she is.  **tactics/strategies**  fireza has two ""forms"" she uses. her ""juggernaut"" form, where she goes all-in with overgrowth. she is about 9 feet tall, with horns and bone spines running up her arms, and incredibly muscular. while noisy, huge, and somewhat clumsy, she can move surprisingly fast, with good durability and immense physical strength. she also has a ""ravager"" form where she reduces her musculature from overgrowth, and significantly reduces the weight of her bone structure. she gives herself bigger bone claws, and has a much thinner frame for running fast. she also has a default stance, somewhere in between, that she uses for day-to-day use.  fireza is a bit of a stealth juggernaut. she rarely approaches the fight head on, and instead likes to start off in her ravager form, using stealth to observe and strike at the opponent. if the opponent is a brutish hand-to-hand combatant, she may keep with her speed and continue using hit n run tactics. if her opponent is a lightning bruiser like she is, she'll weaken them up a bit then switch to her juggernaut form to finish the job. if her opponent is a fragile speedster, she may just lure them into ambush in either form. because her physique does not require nen to maintain, she can focus on using zetsu, in, and en.  out in the open, she will generally rely on her juggernaut form, even against ranged opponents, as she can pick up great speeds while running. she may destroy the ground to create jagged rocks, for changing direction easier, if her opponent can outmaneuver her in juggernaut form.",1,2,

426206,"seen flying from chryse planitia across syrtis major all the way to the coasts of isidis planitia, the cottonfly is quite a marvel to spot overhead. gÃ­gantasparaskÃ­nia represents a prominent group of scavenging butterflies on mars an id the largest animal to fly to date, 25 mi post establishment.    cottonflies primarily fill the niche as the vultures of mars. it is very difficult for large animals to pry apart the exoskeletons of dead arthropods to feed on, however the cottonfly has two advantages when it comes to out scavenging. with a body length of three meters for its nine meter wingspan, the cottonfly is by far the largest thing to fly in the martian skies to date. the cottonfly, along with its close relatives, use its large size to sore far and high to find carrion. this makes it impossible for terrestrial carnivores like arachnids to keep pace. their large size also make them more intimidating to go up against. beneath itâ€™s bowling ball sized head, its black and segmented proboscis can uncoil itself into a wrinkly two meter long opposable tube seven centimeters in diameter. the proboscis enters though weak spots in carrion exoskeleton such as through joints or the anus to suck up organs and decayed flesh lick a straw. with a short blade at the end of its proboscis, it cuts through tough tissue to help it navigate and dice up the body from the inside.   as massive as their wings are, relative to smaller insects, only thirty percent represents part of their exoskeleton. the skeletal part of the wing, localized at the front end, serves to support long hollow scales that act as analogue feathers. this allows the wings to be lighter to help the organism off the ground.   it is not uncommon for flying animals on mars to use countershading to better hide from predators, especially in the air, but the cottonfly does the exact opposite. it has soft snow white scales on its top side while it has black scales on its underside. one reason for this is that there are no strong enough pressures to camouflage, considering that counter shading is not very useful when the animal is too big to hide in the open air. this alone doesnâ€™t explain the pattern, but even though it canâ€™t hide this coloration does have a purpose.    like modern butterfly scales, these pseudo-feathers posses microscopic shapes that refract light in particular ways. in the cottonflieâ€™s case on its top side, it possesses cones arranged to form inverted three sided ninety degree angles which are capable of reflecting light back in the opposite direction. itâ€™s the same logic that makes safety reflectors so bright. this is extremely useful for blinding predators trying to attack from above. avian predators like the meter long wasps will often attempt to grab their prey and disembowel them through the joints to force their prey to fall and possibly get injured on impact with the ground. the cottonfly is able to defend against these assaults by using these white scales to induce snow blindness, making it extremely difficult for predators to focus in on a particular part of the body to attack. it then becomes a battle between the wasps trying to cast their shadow over their prey and the cottonfly avoiding it. even if a predator manages to land on it, it will then need to comb through the thick fluff and scales to reach into the joints.   attacking the cottonfly from below doesnâ€™t yield any better results either. in fact, itâ€™s even more dangerous to attack from below. in order to launch up into the air, cottonflies fold their wings back before using two pairs of their hind legs to push off the ground. while these legs help to make them airborne, they can also be used as a line of defense. if a predator flies underneath, it is at risk of being violently kicked and breaking a wing. with its legs being the exact same shade of black as the underside of their wings, it can be hard for anyone to see the legs in its shadow.    life cycle   cottonflies begin their lives hatching out from a clutch of about thirty eggs berried in the warm composting soils in the rainforests of chryse planitia. from the very start as twenty-four centimeter long caterpillars, they each hatch with six exoskeletal arms that collectively work as talons which they use to firmly grasp and climb with. they quickly move across the forest floor by flexing their abdomen to jump forwards.   as soon as they hatch, they will immediately begin foraging for food. they will need to grow fifty times their size on top of storing enough food for when they enter into their first chrysalis stage. this is why only their legs and head posses an exoskeleton when they hatch, to allow the rest of the body to freely grow unrestricted. due to their lack of an exoskeleton, their muscles across their body are supported by flexing against the skin in order to move quickly, like a stress toy. if this was in earthâ€™s heavy gravity, this would have been a highly inefficient use of energy to move around. in their first caterpillar stage, they will mainly feed on both plants and occasionally carrion.   after a few months, they will form a chrysalis and spend a week developing their second caterpillar form. unlike earth butterflies, many large unrelated butterfly species on mars go through two or more caterpillar stages that require their own chrysalis. these extra metamorphic stages occur as a result of a mutation that repeats the process. since these mutations helped allow the animals to grow bigger and forage for more food, it has resulted in their adult sizes growing even bigger. most flying predators in the past were not as big as they are no, which gave butterflies an advantage when it came to using their size for intimidation. wasps also grow very large and some even go through multiple larval stages, but since most wasps are predators they need stronger armor that consequently weighs them down. since it is is difficult for large sizes to be achieved for arthropods, this trait has resulted in butterflies to become some of the biggest animals on mars.    when the caterpillar remerges, it is naw seventy-six centimeters and posses a more active body plan of its previous stage along with its adult head partially formed. while it still feeds with mandibles, it naw possesses more developed compound eyes that help it to avoid predators and seek prey. it is much more of an aggressive hunter at this stage and will often hunt down small arthropods as well as its own kind to store up fat for its final transformation.    for their next chrysalis, they will either dig their own burrow, steal an already existing one from their siblings or other animals, or even take an abandoned one from an adult butterfly. they will line their den walls with secretions to reinforce it from outside intruders burrowing in. these spaces can be up to two hundred and forty gallons in volume as to give them a safe place to grow to develop into their final adult form as butterflies.   it is difficult for other arthropods to reach the size of the cottonfly because to do so involves being exposed to risks that butterflies donâ€™t encounter. most arthropods haft to shed their skin several times throughout their lifetime in order to grow. during these moments, they haft to spend hours to shed, harden their new armor, and rest after being completely exhausted from the event. this leaves them highly vulnerable and makes them completely incapable of eating or running for a few days. this is why most arthropods donâ€™t grow heavier then eleven pounds on mars, which is equivalent to about thirty pounds on earth. it is too risky to spend the energy to undergo these transformations only to get a heavy suit of armor that slows you down in return. however, because butterflies develop within a chrysalis, they bypass this whole process at once and are able to safely grow into the largest animal that can fly on mars.    even this is optimal for growing large sizes, it has its own drawbacks. while undergoing a massive physiological change, they are unable to do anything if their burrow is invaded. even if nothing is able to penetrate the thick walls of their underground chrysalis, they canâ€™t defend against something that is already inside its chamber with it.   the hobgoblin is an apex species of spider that can grow up to two meters in length. relevant to the cottonfly, their juvinile stage only needs to be 12 centimeters long to be a problem. hobgoblins will often sneak into the burrows of unsuspecting caterpillars, optimally the kind belonging to cottonflies, and hide as the caterpillar seals up the chambers to begin metamorphosing. during this time, the hobgoblin will feed off the juices of the vulnerable caterpillar as an easy source of food and safely shed multiple times without the threat of predators. it will keep the caterpillar alive for months to keep it fresh before finally killing it when itâ€™s time to re-emerge.   but if all goes well, the caterpillar it will come out as a fully grown adult. after emerging, itâ€™s body will still be damp and soft, so it will crawl up a tree wait for its skin and wings harden. the cottonfly also emerges with soft and puffy brawn felt over its scales, clay red or blue coloration to camouflage to its environment. when itâ€™s wings finally harden, it will lose the camo coat over time as it flies, revealing its pure white scales to the world.",0,,

dot making its way south, into the forest. the path that z had mapped out for them. or perhaps for *him*. on the porch, the idea sounded plausible enough, and fresh from arguing with sarah, james was happy to have an excuse to get out of the inn. out here though, at night, marching his way through the narrow forest path in the chilly night air, it seems more likely that he was on a wild goose chase. and worse, he left sarah back at the inn, alone, with an ex boyfriend. and she stayed. in fact, insisted that she stay. might they not be cuddled up on the couch, right at that moment? or worse, under the covers in zâ€™s room. the thought made him angry and sick and depressed and stubborn.  if thatâ€™s really what she wanted, she could have it. at least then heâ€™d be through all the bullshit. he wouldnâ€™t have to watch them dancing around each other, shooting covert glances, or deal with any more of zâ€™s posturing. his innocent little demonstrations that he was so much better at solving riddles than james. his pretentious grins when he said something clever.  if thatâ€™s what she wanted, she could have it. the whole idea that they could work together so closely was frankly insulting. sarah had assured him that she was with him. that the problems of their past were behind them. that his mistakes were forgiven. and he believed her. that she could forgive him. maybe it was true. maybe it would've been fine if z and laina never showed up in the metro tunnels of /r/washingtondc.   he casts about with the phone again, and detects a minor disturbance in the dirt. he kneels, squinting, to get a better look, but it's difficult to make out much in the dark. torn grass, and dry, foot-sized disturbed dirt. it mightâ€™ve been helpful if he could tell which direction it was moving in, but james wasnâ€™t a tracker. perhaps there was something to it after all.  that was one thing that he could say for z. the asshole seemed to be earnest enough in his desire to find the ultrapost. if only that was the only thing he desired out here.  he stoops, listening to the night. an owl hooted somewhere in the distance. the muted trickle of the stream somewhere ahead.   what he would like to do would be to return with some clear evidence of what happened to ben clay. even if z was wrong about it. *especially* if z was wrong about it, truth be told. he snaps a picture of the foot mark and keeps going. another 45 minutes, and if he found nothing, heâ€™d turn back. heâ€™d find sarah. maybe he would apologize.  .  in 10 minutes, he finds the cabin in the woods, windows dark, sitting by the creek. not dilapidated, but clearly not built to any sort of code either. split wood lay by a chopping block. a tree stand 20 feet up is decorated with old, torn branches -- more likely a permanent fixture than one recently placed. crushed beer cans rose in piles next to the firepit, and a deer was strung up from a nearby tree.  at the creek, there are no stepping stones, but a fallen log spanned the 7 or 8 feet of water, and james holds his arms out for balance like a tight-rope walker, grinning.   a hunting cabin. this was something that z hadnâ€™t considered. so, ben clay splits off from his girlfriend in the dead of night with a hunting shotgun, it shouldâ€™ve been clear what he was doing. it was unlikely that heâ€™d take it for protection. all things considered, /r/nosleep was a pretty safe place as long as you didnâ€™t mind being fake murdered.   the bonfire isnâ€™t lit, and there are no lit embers, but there is enough fluffy ash to tell that someone had lit a fire recently. and no hunter would leave a deer behind, anyway.  what would sarah and z say when they discovered that in fact, ben clayâ€™s disappearance was nothing more than a couple overnights in a hunting cabin in the woods?  he pauses, listening. there is no noise coming from within the cabin. either ben clay was asleep already, or heâ€™d gone back to lynn porter. perhaps he was planning to return for his deer the next day? butchers hung animals to bleed them. he knew that much. how long did that usually take?  he flips on the phoneâ€™s external light, bathing the scene in a soft, pale glow. the cabin door isnâ€™t closed, as heâ€™d expected, but wide open, as if ben clay had left in some sort of hurry.  â€œhello?â€ he called.   no one answers. the cabin isnâ€™t big. it would be just one room. probably enough for a cot of some sort, maybe a wood stove for winter weather. he climbs the steps to the cabin door and hesitates just outside of it. it wouldnâ€™t do to be shot by some spooked, half-asleep hill billy in the middle of nowhere. even with his karma buff, there was no reason to be foolish.  â€œhello? anyone there? mr. clay?â€  again, no one answers. he stepps past the threshold and casts the light around. there is a small table also littered with crushed cans of coors light, woodpanelled walls that look cheap and thin, exposed rafters and yes, a tiny little wood stove. he steps inside, and aims the light into the near corner of the room. he sees the face of ben clay holding a shotgun and staring back at him.  â€œoh jesus.â€ james hops back and falls against the open door and threw an arm out to catch himself. â€œdonâ€™t shoot!â€  he is lying in the cot with an open sleeping bag lying across him. james waits for the pale face to move, or the wide eyes to blink, but they keep reflecting the bright light of his phone back at him. ben clayâ€™s skin is a stoney grey in the bleached light. something about his posture is terribly wrong, the angle of his hips and torso too bent and askew to be natural. the tongue lolls out of its mouth like the deer outside, and even beneath the blanket james can tell that the manâ€™s back is horribly twisted, the shotgun clutched to his chest in a rigor mortis embrace.   â€œwhat the hell. what the hell,â€ he said, scrambling to his feet and feeling his stomach churn and rumble and threaten to come up, adrenaline dumping into his bloodstream and tuning his heart into a snare drum.  he tries to catch his breath and refocuses the light, and sees that in fact, ben clay hadnâ€™t only been holding his weapon. an empty shell lay on the floor next to the bed, and a spray of dark red decorated the wall behind him.   there were no open wounds on ben clay. that blood belonged to someone else. someone that crushed him to death there in bed.  jamesâ€™s stomach lurches and he runs outside, covering his mouth and sprinting until he trips, coming down on his hands and knees and dry heaving, his phone skipping across the dirt and coming to rest against a fallen limb, casting a light on the ground as he coughs up a mouthful of bile.  he looks all around him, but aside from the stream just ahead, there is only silence. some more rational part of his brain insists that he could not possibly have seen what he thought heâ€™d seen, and that it was okay. that he is probably in no immediate danger. that ben clay had to have been there for some time already, to be that sickly gray color.   he needs to get back to the inn and tell z and sarah what he found. tell nails.  he wipes his mouth on his sleeve and reaches for the phone and just in front of him, leading away from the cabin and back toward the fallen log, and the trail he himself had just walked, was a clear and distinct print of a small, bare foot in the mud.  .  .  .  **z**  sarahâ€™s body writhes against mine in the dark. her kiss is wet and salty with tears. her tongue reaches out past her lips, against mine, pushing past my teeth and into my mouth as i grasp the back of her head and pull her tight against me. her hands clutch so hard against my back that her nails scratch my skin and i grunt in surprise. she seems to take it for ascent though, and grinds her hips against me even harder.  her tongue is thick, almost swollen against mine, and i canâ€™t believe how warm her body feels as i reach down to cup her ass and roll her onto her back.  â€œplease,â€ she squeaks again, her forehead against mine.  both of us are breathing raggedly now. her hands are all over my body, pulling me to her. i slip an arm behind her head and kiss her again. hers is insistent, licking over my lip in clumsy, hurried necessity.  i guide my hand up her belly. sheâ€™s thinner than i remember her, leaner like all of us now, with the lack of food, but she has the same desperate energy she always had.  i cup one breast and settle my weight between her legs and she gasps into my mouth.   i raise my hand up to her clavicle, to the chain dangling between her breasts. sheâ€™s still wearing it, years after iâ€™d given it to her. a heart-shaped locket made of sterling silver, that iâ€™d bought for her before she left for grad school. the one with a matching key i still kept on a chain, that iâ€™d carried around with me in simonâ€™s back pack for months. the one i promised to myself years ago, that iâ€™d return one day in the hazy future before me.  outside the door somewhere, the old wooden floor squeaks out in the kitchen. probably just bill up for a midnight snack. it doesnâ€™t deter sarah in the slightest, and she laces both hands into my hair and pulls my face to hers.  and then, muted by the walls but still audible, a sad placid voice sings,  *secrets i have held in my heart*  *are harder to hide than i thought*  *maybe i just wanna be yours*  *i wanna be yours, i wanna be yours* ^2  it was sarahâ€™s voice, outside, in the kitchen.  the thick tongue attempts to prod past my teeth and the thin, cloying arms continue to tug me closer. the arm behind her head feels odd somehow, as if thereâ€™s a large bump, something attached to her neck besides the necklace. the warm, too-large face nuzzles into me even as i gasp and draw away, scrambling for the light with my free hand.  â€œpleeeeeaaaaassssseeeee.â€ now there is no denying the flat, pinched whiny voice does not belong to sarah.  â€œwhat the fuck!â€ i yelp loud, my hand finally finding the switch to my bedside lamp and clicking it on.  the face before me is large, swollen, and red, so unlike the wasted body below it. the dark, greasy hair no longer obscures her face. the white nightgown is stained and filthy, and clings to her starved body. the lolling tongue peeks out past the blistered, swollen lips. her eyes bulge out from the skull, straining like theyâ€™re trying to escape, bloodshot, the sclera a dark burgundy of popped blood vessels. the chain around her neck does not hold the tiny heart-shaped locket, but instead the small cross she was wearing in her yearbook photo. the flesh bulges at her throat, straining past a thick, fraying rope that is bound tight, as if her body had grown around it. tears are streaming down her swollen, red cheeks and her expression is one of undeniable heartbreak and longing. only the wide-set eyes and jewellry intimate that this creature is in fact patty boleslav.   â€œmichael,â€ she squeaks, her voice thin and reedy out of her strangled throat, out of that clumsy, swollen tongue. â€œplease.â€ she wraps her arms around me again and pulls me to her with shocking strength, wrapping her arms tight.   jolts of pain shoot up my spine. â€œahh!â€  she pushes her face to mine planting kisses on my cheek.  â€œhelp!â€ i yell as patty boleslav squeezes the remaining air from my lungs, and my back pops in a very non-chiropractic way.  footsteps clap down the hall outside, and the door doesnâ€™t creak open, but slams back off its hinges in splinters as laina and doles force their way inside, weapons in hand.  patty gives a blubbering shriek and releases me as they approach, scrabbling on her hands and knees. laina blocks her path as i lay on my side and draw in a wheezing breath.  â€œwho the hell are you!?â€ says laina, brandishing the machete.  patty boleslav rushes for the door, and laina moves to intercept her. one desperate swing from patty sends laina across the room and through the first sheet of drywall.  doles brings his machete down in an overhead chop. patty raises an arm. a swing like that from a guy with as much karma as doles shouldâ€™ve taken her arm off at the elbow, but only a narrow scratch appears.  patty shrieks again, springing, sobbing, straight through my bedroom window and out into the night...

622218,"i'm quite late to the discussion, but i have lost serious amounts of weight over the years (approx. 6 st / 84 lbs / 38 kg in about 3-4 yrs) and have learnt a thing or two that may help.  first: **to lose weight is not just a thing you do, only to return to your normal routine. if you want to lose weight, you must change your lifestyle to match and maintain this... it needs life-long commitment.**  so, basically, it comes down to will-power and/or bloody-mindedness! depending on your personality, you may or may not want others to know and help/support/encourage you... the rest is pretty straightforward: eat less and do more! it's just basic thermodynamics ;)  * **diet** try to avoid foods with a lot of empty calories. this includes pretty much all junk food, but also staples like bread, pasta, rice and potatoes. all those carbohydrates are going to just turn into fat unless you burn them off in a marathon! instead, eat foods that are nutritionally rich (in terms of vitamins, minerals and macronutrients); but keep a balanced diet (you still need carbs, but get them from fruit and low gi sources, etc.) the same goes for fats: you need fat, but try to lay-off the saturated fats (although you need these to a certain extent too) and concentrate on essential fats (omega 3 and 6). protein is important for building muscle -- more on this later... get into the habit of reading the nutrition labels on foods and keep a mental tally of what you're eating. * **do not starve yourself** your body is remarkably good at keeping itself alive; you will not be able to cheat this evolutionary masterpiece! depending on build, etc. you need approximately 1,600 kcal/day to stay alive; if you go under this, your body will not only start using fat reserves but, importantly, will reduce your metabolism. this has the effect of reducing the amount of energy required to keep you running, but also reduces your capacity to do *anything* (you will be sluggish, tired and generally zombie-like)... instead, work-out how many calories you need to live (your ""resting metabolic rate"") and then add the amount you expend in exercise; then consume somewhere between those two points (closer to the maximum to start with). note that your resting rate is a moving target, so keep an eye-out for signs of slowed metabolism (heart rate and fatigue are a good start). * **weight-loss** aim to lose no more than 4lbs a week; anything more and your body won't like it. you may think that 4lbs a week is quite a big ask; however, once you get going, it's not too hard. (note that initially you may lose a lot of weight through losses in retained water; ultimately you'll put this back on, but nonetheless it's a good idea to keep well hydrated.) what's great, by way of motivation, is to see this steady drop week-after-week; if you don't have a buddy along for the ride, this will keep you going :) * **exercise** what to do here is a bit of a tricky subject. most would recommend cardiovascular workouts, whereas a few would say go with resistance training. the argument is that cv work increases stress within the body, which releases a substance known as cortisol -- the problem with cortisol is that it hinders the metabolisation of fat -- conversely, the benefits of cv is that it makes your overall system much stronger. resistance work (e.g. weights) will make your muscles bigger (hence the need for protein), which increases your metabolism, which in turn burns more fat (i.e. your resting rate will increase with more muscle mass)... the key is to strike a balance that is right for you. personally, i lost most of my weight through cycling, to the point that my cv system was top-notch; but it was only after i was told about the effects of heavier resistance work that i saw improved benefits. the cycling i was doing was stressing-out my body to the point that i had plateaued in fat loss (which was very irritating as by this time i had become a serious cyclist and the extra baggage was holding me back); after doing some weight training, my performance began to increase again... you may want to try a gym, but if you do -- personally i don't like them -- try to find one that has some cv equipment but is mainly focused on weights and resistance machines, etc. alternatively, something that combines the two (e.g. gymnastics, swimming, martial arts or dancing) is a good bet and, as they're more social forays, can be a lot more fun too. deriving enjoyment from the process (and this goes for all the other points too) is *very* important; don't do anything that makes it seem like a chore. * **volume vs. weight** are you trying to lose weight or are you trying to lose volume; specifically, body fat? the reason i ask is that muscle is approximately 5 times denser than fat: if you do a lot of working out, you will actually get heavier; however, you will still decrease in volume (particularly once your new body starts eating the old fat to fuel itself)... my point here is not to get demotivated if the scales start showing an increase. when you get to this point, it's probably best to rely on several measurements: weight and body fat percentage; and maybe waist/chest/arm/etc. measurements. (although note that checking yourself out in a mirror is often the best measurement to take!) anyway keep a log of these to track your progress and motivate yourself. * **genetics** don't be discouraged by how you grow: short of surgery, there is nothing you can do to get around this. fat cells are distributed in your body based largely on your heredity and once you are an adult, you are stuck with the amount you acquired during growing-up. ones ""fatness"" is determined by how engorged said cells are, which is a function of how much you put away!... anyway, as you lose fat, you'll find that certain areas diminish better than others and some might not even go at all. (note that body fat is also stored internally -- visceral fat -- as well as at a more visible level -- subcutaneous fat. you *may* not see any immediate subcutaneous reduction; however, don't worry as it is far more important to reduce fat around your vital organs!) anyway, to give you an example of my point, i seem to have inherited a lot of ""junk in the trunk"": which, whilst i understand puts me at a reduced risk of diabetes, i've found almost impossible [and infuriating] to reduce! in my darkest moments -- and you will feel low occasionally, as it can get incredibly frustrating -- i've even felt that, if i had abundant excesses of money, i would almost consider some kind of surgical lipolysis... anyway, while this is easier said than done, my advice is to try not to worry about/focus on it. remember that michaelangelo's david or botticelli's venus are unmaintainable ideals! do something to take your mind off it and you will eventually come to accept this. (as you may be able to tell, this is still a bit of a sore-point for me!) * **cravings** as your fat cells empty of, well, fat, they will start screaming at you to replace themselves! to this end, you will begin to get quite weird cravings for certain foods: try to resist these as much as possible or, if you do indulge, only do so in very small portions (i.e. that will get-over the voice in your head that really wants the taste of ice cream/bacon/whatever but without doing too much damage). if you can, try to fill the gap with something that is high in protein and/or fibre: protein is hard to digest, so raises your metabolism; fibre fills you up without incurring any calorie penalty... if you do over-indulge, don't worry too much -- all those calories will really psych-up your metabolism and give you lots of energy: put this to good use -- *just don't make a habit of it!* remember, you cannot put more weight on than what you consume (i.e. conservation of mass); also -- at the risk of sounding gross -- poop has a calorific value, meaning not all the calories you consume will be digested by your body and will instead just be excreted. * **well-being** if you have the propensity to catch colds or have an otherwise weakened immune system (for illness, the season, etc.) then it is more important to concentrate on getting better than getting slim! calorie restriction and exercise will only exacerbate a weakened condition and it will take you longer to achieve anything; and may even do you more harm than good in the long-run!  phew! ok, that's all that comes to mind immediately. there's probably some other stuff i've forgotten; but that should give you a pretty good start... good luck :)  edit: added sections on inheritance and illness. also, see [the comments in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6lvn0/300_calorie_food_picture_gallery/c047z94) that i made some time ago about matching macronutrients to activity to maximise fat reduction.  edit 2: added ""cravings""; probably a bit late now, but just for completeness :)",1,0,
804354,"&gt;when the timber-fog cleared, he found himself staring at the brown hide of a gargantuan beast. it was impossibly large, bigger even than the thunderhawk that had delivered them from orbit. its chest and underbelly were armoured with slabs of bone. â€˜sanguinius feast on your heart!â€™ melechk had just enough time to spit a curse before the beastâ€™s tail whipped round and slammed into him. the blow shattered the heavy bolter, smashed melechkâ€™s breastplate and hurled him thirty metres backwards through a tree. â€˜fall back!â€™ asmodel unhooked a clutch of grenades and tossed them at the beast. the explosives detonated in front of its face, drawing a roar as its skin blistered. â€˜go, now!â€™ the blast had disorientated the beast but cassiel knew the flesh wounds would do little to slow it. breaking into a run, he tried to raise the wounded scout on the vox.  random fauna is hypersonic?    &gt;three metres tall, the warrior organism was all rippling armour plates and glistening organs, layered beneath a bony exo-skeleton coated with an encrusted layer of fatty tissue. its jaw opened, letting loose a terrifying screech as its scythe-taloned arms raised to strike. a drooling bio-weapon spat a phlegmy wad of slime. uriel dived aside, the sparkling slime blasting a huge chunk of ice from the wall behind him. he sprang to his feet as the monster smashed its way through the snow berm, standing at the lip of the trench. he fired his last remaining bolts at the huge creature, blowing off chunks of its chitinous armour, but failing to stop its murderous progress. pasanius bathed the creature in fire, the insulating fat on its bones sizzling and filling the trench with a disgusting odour. dozens of hormagaunts followed in its steps. uriel leapt to meet the monster, swinging his power sword at its thorax. a bladed limb swept down, blocking the blow as another slammed into his breastplate, cracking the ceramite and knocking him from his feet. he rolled with the blow and dove around the side of the beast, hacking his blade through its legs just above its giant hooves. the beast howled in pain, crashing to its knees and toppling forwards into the trench where it lay thrashing its clawed arms impotently. pasanius fought the hormagaunts back as yet more poured through the gap their larger sibling had battered.   hypersonic tyranid warrior confirmed.  &gt;karras barely had time to register the sheer size of balthazog bludwrekkâ€™s twin bodyguards, before their blistering assault began. they were easily the largest orks he had ever seen, even larger than the door guards he and rauth had slain, and they wielded their massive two-handed warhammers as if they weighed nothing at all. under normal circumstances, orks of this size and strength would have become mighty warbosses, but these two were nothing of the kind. they were slaves to a far greater power than mere muscle or aggression. the two space marines opened fire at the same time, eager to drop the bodyguards and engage the real target quickly. their bolters chattered, spitting their deadly hail, but somehow each round detonated harmlessly in the air. â€˜heâ€™s shielding them!â€™ karras called out. â€˜draw your blade!â€™ he dropped the cryo-case from his shoulder, pulled arquemann from its scabbard and let the power of the immaterium flow through him, focusing it into the ancient crystalline matrix that lay embedded in the blade. â€˜to me, xenos scum!â€™ he roared at the hulking beast in front of him. the bodyguardâ€™s massive hammer whistled up into the air, then changed direction with a speed that seemed impossible. karras barely managed to step aside. sparks flew as the weapon clipped his left pauldron, sending a painful shock along his arm. the thick steel floor fared worse. the hammer left a hole in it the size of a human head. the ork bodyguard, on the other hand, did not miss its chance. it caught karras squarely on the right pauldron with the head of its hammer, shattering the deathwatch insignia there, and knocking him sideways, straight off his feet. the impact hurled karras directly into rauthâ€™s opponent, and the two tumbled to the metal floor. karrasâ€™ helmet was torn from his head, and rolled away.  considering that those space marines can barely see this orks in action, they are obviously very beyond hypersonic. mach 10+ orks confirmed.    &gt;heâ€™d just rounded a corner when the orks attacked. he was caught totally unaware: heâ€™d been so fixated on avoiding notice from the mechanicus that he hadnâ€™t considered the possibility that the orks could have infiltrated so far into the node already. besides which, gavrak daelin knew orks as bellowing slabs of muscle and belligerence, powerful and crude. you heard them before you saw them, and there was a fair chance of smelling them before that, too. these flowed out of the darkness like murderous shadows, their clothes patterned in imitation of imperial camouflage and their blades blackened to minimise the chance of them glinting in the light and giving away their ownersâ€™ positions. there were seven of them, each a deadly foe in its own right, but even when taken by surprise, daelin was not about to easily fall victim to this xenos filth. he drew his bolt pistol and stitched a row of shots up the first orkâ€™s chest, culminating in a final shell between the alienâ€™s deep-set red eyes that blew its skull apart. then its fellows were on him. daelin lashed out with fists and feet and his mechatendrils, his every thought now focused on combat and survival. he shattered an orkâ€™s ribcage with a punch, lopped off an axe-wielding hand with his powerblade, grabbed a green-skinned wrist and pointed it at another ork even as the first one pulled the trigger of its firearm. he jerked his head backwards to avoid snapping, fang-strewn jaws, and ducked a decapitating swing, but there were too many blows to avoid altogether. he felt a shell carom off his left pauldron, and two strong hands seized one of his mechatendrils and hauled him sideways, directly into the path of a huge axe. the weapon, razor-edged and powered by the orkâ€™s brute strength, sheared through daelinâ€™s ceramite breastplate and buried itself into his torso. daelin roared in pain and anger: anger at the greenskinâ€™s temerity, and anger at his own fleshâ€™s weakness in registering the wound. his powerblade buried itself in the skull of the ork who had hold of his mechatendril and it dropped like a stone. he lashed out sideways with a boot, ignoring the screaming agony in his chest as he did so, and sent another ork crashing into the one whose ribs heâ€™d broken, even while seizing the throat of the axe-wielder in front of him. the ork snarled in anger and released its weapon to grab at his wrist, looking to prise it loose. daelin brought his bolt pistol up to put a shell through its head, but the ork let go of his left wrist with one hand and grabbed at the bolt pistol as well. they struggled for a moment, xenos muscle against warp-infused, genetically engineered might, before one of daelinâ€™s mechatendrils snaked up to pluck the bolt pistol from his hand and fire it before the ork could react. it fell backwards, now missing half of its head. daelinâ€™s backplate shivered as it turned a blow from another ork blade, but one of his mechatendrils extended a foot-long steel spike and rammed it into the orkâ€™s eye socket. daelin wrenched the axe out of his chest, releasing a gout of black blood as he did so. iron within, iron without. the weaponâ€™s edge had been dulled by his bloodâ€™s corrosive properties, but it was still keen enough to sever at the elbow the other arm of the ork from whom heâ€™d already taken a hand. the ork howled in pain and rage, and flung itself at him bodily: daelin swatted it aside, and into one of its fellows. it was the ork whose ribs heâ€™d broken, and the xenos showed almost admirable fortitude in rolling the handless ork off itself and staggering up to continue the fight, but it was alone and injured. daelin emptied the rest of his bolt pistolâ€™s clip into it to put it down, then advanced on the last member of the infiltrating party, which was trying to struggle up while leaking blood from two stump-ended limbs. â€˜i can use you,â€™ daelin told it viciously, as his mechatendrils wrapped around its thick neck and began to squeeze.  another case for hypersonic orks.    &gt;cortez would have enjoyed watching his friendâ€™s martial prowess in action, but two snarling orks, marginally smaller and lighter-skinned than the monster cortez had just slain, lunged at him from both sides. cortez slid backwards a single step, and the aliensâ€™ crude blades cut empty air. he did not give them time to recover. every blow they missed was an opening he was conditioned to exploit. lunging to the right, he rammed his combat blade deep into the belly of one, so deep he felt its point catch on the inner surface of the beastâ€™s vertebrae. instantly, he yanked back on the knifeâ€™s grip. the serrations on the back of the blade caught on the creatureâ€™s innards, and ripped them out through the gaping hole in its skin. for an instant, the creature stood looking down at its own looped intestines, a look of dumb curiosity on its idiot face. cortez had already turned to the other, kicking at its leading knee, hard enough to smash the kneecap to pieces. the ork went down on its other knee with a roar of anger and pain.   notice how cortez has to actually focus on the fight here and the fight lasted long enough for the orks to trade ""blows"" with him? instead of ""hypersonic reflexes lol"" and an easy speed blitz, since the orks would literally be standing still to someone with hypersonic reflexes, where every single twitch of the orks would be in slow motion. ever watched days of future past? yeah, that scene comes to mind. this applies anytime where space marines are fighting orks or nids or tau and don't view them as statues",0,,

401329,"send petition to singapore government too as its hypocritcal stand should also be condemned. it is providing the life line to the burmese military leaders and big-time drug lords while hanging the small time drug runners. it has blood on its hands. http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/web-of-cash-power-and-cronies/2007/09/28/1190486569946.html?page=fullpage web of cash, power and cronies eric ellis september 29, 2007 singapore isn't just skilled at mandatory executions of drug traffickers, running an excellent airport and selling cameras on orchard road. it also does a useful trade keeping burma's military rulers and their cronies afloat. much attention is placed on china and its coming hosting of the olympic games as a diplomatic pressure point on the rampant burmese junta. but there is a group of government businessmen-technocrats in singapore who will also be closely monitoring the brutality in rangoon. and, were they so inclined, their influence could go a long way to limiting the misery being inflicted on burma's 54 million people. collectively known as ""singapore inc"", they gather around the $a150 billion state-owned investment house temasek holdings, controlled by a member of the ruling lee family. with an estimated $a3 billion staked in the country (and a more than $20 billion stake in australia), singapore inc companies have been some of the biggest investors in and supporters of burma's military junta â€” this while its government, on the rare times it is asked, suggests a softly-softly diplomatic approach towards the junta. when it comes to burma, singapore pockets the high morals it likes to wave at the west elsewhere. singapore's one-time head of foreign trade once said as his country was building links with burma in the mid-1990s: ""while the other countries are ignoring it, it's a good time for us to go in â€¦ you get better deals, and you're more appreciated â€¦ singapore's position is not to judge them and take a judgemental moral high ground."" but by providing burma's pariah junta with the crucial equipment mostly denied by western sanctions, singapore has helped keep the junta and its cronies afloat for 20 years, since the last time the generals killed the citizens they are supposed to protect. withdraw that financial support and burma's junta would be substantially weakened, perhaps even fail. but after two decades of profitable business with the trigger-happy generals and their cronies, that's about the last thing singapore is likely to do. there's too much money to be made. hotels, airlines, military materiel and training, crowd control equipment and sophisticated telecoms-monitoring devices for its secret police â€” singapore is manager and supplier to the junta, and the ""cronified"" economy it controls. it's impossible to spend any time in burma and not make the junta richer, thanks to singapore suppliers' contracts with the tourism industry. singapore's hospitals also keep burma's leaders alive â€” 74-year-old junta leader than shwe has been getting his intestinal cancer treated in a singapore government hospital, protected by singapore security. singapore's boutiques keep junta wives and families cloaked in armani, and its banks help launder their money and that of burma's crony drug lords. much of singapore's activity in burma has been documented by an analyst working in prime minister john howard's direct chain of command, in the office of national assessments. andrew selth is recognised as an authority on the burmese military. now a research fellow at queensland's griffith university, mr selth has written extensively on how close singapore is to the junta. often writing as ""william ashton"" in the authoritative jane's intelligence review, mr selth has described in various articles how singapore has sent the junta guns, rockets, armoured personnel carriers and grenade launchers, some of it trans-shipped from stocks seized by israel from palestinians in southern lebanon. singaporean companies have provided computers and networking equipment for burma's defence ministry and army, while upgrading the bunkered junta's ability to network with regional commanders â€” so crucial as protesting monks take to the streets of 20 burmese cities, causing major logistical headaches for the tatmadaw, the burmese military. ""singapore cares little about human rights, in particular the plight of the ethnic and religious minorities in burma,"" mr selth writes. ""having developed one of the region's most advanced armed forces and defence industrial support bases, singapore is in a good position to offer burma a number of inducements which other asean (association of south-east asian nations) countries would find hard to match."" singapore's foreign minister, george yeo, is the current chairman of asean. mr selth says singapore also provided the equipment for a ""cyber war centre"" to monitor dissident activity while training burma's secret police, whose sole job seems to be ensuring pro-democracy groups are crushed. monitoring dissidents is an area where singapore has particular expertise. after almost five decades in power, the lee family-controlled people's action party ranks behind only the communists of china, cuba and north korea in leadership longevity, skilled in neutralising opposition. ""this centre is reported to be closely involved in the monitoring and recording of foreign and domestic telecommunications, including the satellite telephone conversations of burmese opposition groups,"" mr selth writes. singapore government companies, such as leading arms supplier singapore technologies, dominate the communications and military sector in singapore. ""it is highly unlikely,"" mr selth writes, ""that any of these arms shipments to burma could have been made without the knowledge and support of the singapore government."" he notes that singapore's ambassadors to burma have included a former senior singapore armed forces officer, and a past director of singapore's defence-oriented joint intelligence directorate, people with a military background rather than professional diplomats. he writes that after the 1988 crackdown, when the junta killed 3000 protesters, ""the first country to come to the regime's rescue was in fact singapore"". when i interviewed singapore technologies chief executive peter seah at his office in singapore, i asked about the scale model of an armoured personnel carrier made by his company on his office table. he said st sold the vehicles ""only to allies"". does that include burma, i asked, given that singapore controversially helped sponsor the military regime into asean? mr seah was non-specific: ""we only sell to allies and we make sure they are responsible."" he didn't say how. st and temasek don't respond to questions about their activities in burma. singapore is so close to burma that one of its diplomats there wrote a handbook for its business people there. matthew sim's myanmar on my mind is full of useful tips for singaporean business people in burma. ""a little money goes a long way in greasing the wheels of productivity,"" he writes. a chapter headed ""committing manslaughter when driving"" describes the appropriate action if a singaporean businessman accidentally kills a burmese pedestrian. ""firstly, the international businessman could give the family of the deceased some money as compensation and dissuade them from pressing charges. secondly, he could pay a myanmar citizen to take the blame by declaring that he was the driver in the fatal accident. an international businessman should not make the mistake of trying to argue his case in a court of law when it comes to a fatal accident, even if he is in the right."" mr sim says many successful myanmar businessmen have opened shell companies in singapore ""with little or no staff, used to keep funds overseas"". the companies are used to keep business deals outside the control of burma's central bank, enabling singaporeans and others to transact with burma in singapore. he may be referring to junta cronies such as tay za and the drug lord lo hsing han. lo is an ethnic chinese, from burma's traditionally chinese-populated and opium-rich kokang region in the country's east, bordering china. he controls a massive heroin empire, and one of burma's biggest companies, asia world, which the us drug enforcement agency describes as a front for his drug-trafficking. asia world controls toll roads, industrial parks and trading companies. singapore is the lo family's crucial window to the world, as it controls a number of companies there. his son steven, who has been denied a visa to the us because of his links to the drug trade, married a singaporean, cecilia ng, and the two reportedly control singapore-based trading house kokang singapore. a former assistant secretary of state for the us bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, robert gelbard, has said that half singapore's investment in burma has ""been tied to the family of narco-trafficker lo hsing han"". eric ellis is an australian journalist and correspondent in south-east asia. ============================================ "" ...'the videos and photographs of what is happening on the streets of yangon and other cities in myanmar have evoked the revulsion of the people throughout south-east asia and all over the world,' (singapore prime minister lee) said, noting that the junta's actions had implications not just for the country, but also asean and the region."" singapore daily, straits times, 1 oct 2007 link: http://www.straitstimes.com/free/story/stistory_162941.html",0,,

868296,"ornithologist/herpetologist here, typing over breakfast, so please forgive typos etc.  dinosaur scales, just like modern-day reptile scales, bird feathers, and bird and crocodile scutes (those tough scaley bits on bird legs, those big smooth bits on crocodile backs) are made from beta-keratin. scientists have found that when you inhibit certain aspects of scute production in birds/reptiles within the egg, those hard, smooth scutes will ""unravel"" to some degree and form fluffy strings of beta-keratin with a central supporting structure-- down feathers.  okay, so: zoom back in time to the mid-jurassic, where some small therapods are doing their thing. therapods are the fast predatory dinosaurs-- velociraptors, tyrannosaurus, etc. some of them were quite small, down to the size of chickens.  due to surface:volume ratios, smaller animals lose heat a lot faster than larger ones. this means that if you grow smaller, you have to find new ways to keep yourself warm enough to function. mammals did this by developing the ability to generate their own heat, amphibians and most fish dealt with it by adapting the ability to operate at low temperatures, and eventually some small therapods were messed up in the egg and were born with those unravelled scales.  feathers, even those early simple ones, are very good at keeping warmth in, as anyone who's ever snuggled down under a goosedown quilt can attest to. their fluffliness traps pockets of warm air, while their larger combined surface area can soak up heat from the sun. any small therapod with this adaptation had an edge over his non-fluffy compatriots.  so already we can see an advantage in feathers, even when not related to flight. those small therapods mostly ate (frightningly) large insects, running on their hind legs and grasping their prey with their dexterous clawed hands (which were now on the end of feathered arms). once they could stay warmer for larger, these little dudes could get a little more energetic.   there are two hypotheses relating to what they did with those feathered arms:  * the cursorial theory puts that these zippy little therapods ran after their prey as it flew just above the ground, chasing it down and grabbing it. as they spread their feathered arms, they were able to make leaps at their prey, their new feathers giving them a boost in the air for a short but useful moment. think of pigeons flapping their wings as they jump up to a stair; not actually flying, but giving a boost to their jumping.  * the arboreal theory puts that these therapods spent a lot of time climbing trees, and having feathered arms both a) helped them make jumping lunges at insects by letting them glide for short distances, much in the manner of the marsupial gliders today, and b) helped them survive falls when falling/leaping out of trees to avoid sudden predators.  currently, the arboreal theory is most prominent, and there aren't too many supporters of the cursorial theory around.  okay, so where we are at the moment: small running dinosaurs split their scales into fluffy feathers, got warmer, and were able to be more energetic and succeed more during hunting and escaping predators. how did these feathery dinosaurs turn into birds as we know them?  as their leaps became bigger and better, these proto-birds found themselves able to take advantage of a whole new range of flying insects, and the pressure was on them to fly even better and eat even more. they could do this by adapting in two important ways, which all birds today have been shaped by: these proto-birds had to both *reduce* their weight and *centralise* it. when it comes to flight, it's not good being lightweight if you're not streamlined, and it's not good being streamlined if you're heavy.  these adaptiations include:   * loss of external hands (except in one very special bird-- points if you know it); their clawed dinosaur hands were fused together into a lightweight hand-bone, and as their flight got better and they could snap prey from the air without their hands, those hands eventually lost all functionality together, becoming little more than a support strut for the primary (flying) feathers  * replacing jaws and teeth, both of which require hefty bone, with the lightweight structure that is the beak  * replacing the tail, a structure both  heavy and non-centralised, with the *pygostyle*, that bump on their butts to which all the tail feathers attach (if you've ever roasted a chicken, you'll know it)  * reducing the weight of their skeletons by replacing dense, solid bones with honeycombed ones, and by fusing other bones together (such as the *uncinate processes*)  * gaining streamlined feathers, the sort that zip together and allow air to flow over them neatly.  * evolving certain adaptations for strong flight, such as the *furcula* (wishbone) and keel bone, and the resulting muscles (the *supracoracoideus/pectoralis* muscle team is a wonderful feat of engineering)  (there is some debate over whether other functional adaptations to flight (air sacs, being warm-blooded) were actually present in other dinosaurs prior to the evolution of feathered flight, so i won't cover them.)  basically after a lot of selection for the lightest, most centralised flying dinosaurs, we had something that was pretty much a bird*. from there they were able to take advantage of the k/t extinction and radiate into the many different forms that we see today.  i think that covers it? if you have any other questions/requests for clarification, i'd be happy to answer them. birds are neat!  *note that this happened a lot of times-- there were several independent lineages of ""birds"" that all died out along with the dinosaurs, leaving the one sole lineage that we're familiar with.",0,,
235170,"i'd first like to say that im glad a skinny person is concerned enough to ask. thanks. secondly, this is a topic id love to see/hear but i wish there werent so many damn comments, lol.  thirdly, a info about myself; im 26, 5""10 and somewhere between 295 and 300lbs.  ive recently been working out and have lost ~30lbs(and 2 pant sizes)onward!  &gt;-how often on a daily basis do you notice that you're obese? any emotion come with it?  eh..i'd have to say a few.  i dont sit and wollow in self-pity but im also not blind to the fact that im fat.  &gt;-have you tried to lose weight? how did it go? is it like quitting smoking where you feel urges to over-consume, or does it just feel like you're starving to death so you go back to eating as much?  yes. so far, so good. in all honesty, my diet hasnt changed *that* much.  im eating more healthier foods/less ""bad"" foods, but i still enjoy a burger every now and then.  i never overconsumed to begin with.  i became fat as a child because i was never informed how unhealthy it was and i was allowed to eat what i wanted.  not blaming my parents, but they never told me; a) ""no"" and b) that being fat was bad for my health.  &gt;-is pooping any harder when you're obese?  not really.  not for me anyway.  i dont know what it's like to poop and be skinny, so i have no comparison.  it's not a struggle though, if that's what you're asking.  &gt;-when you shower, do you actually lift layers of yourself to scrub in between?  this one is a sensitive one because it's true, but only for one area, my stomach.  it's not layers upon layers, but it does hang over, so, i do have to move it to clean.   &gt;-when you go out to bars or whatnot to look for women/men, do you intentionally look for other fat people? do you actually find other obese people attractive?  i never was one for clubs/bars but when i do go out or look for a mate, i dont intentionally look for other fat people.  i know what it's like to be fat and how hard it is to get out and mingle and take that step so when i see a chick that is anything but skinny, i like that and im interested in talking to her. i know it's hypocrytical of me but i, too, have standards.  i dont mind a chick who's a little chubby but i dont go after chicks who are overly fat, if that makes sense.  i dont know how to explain it. it's a case-by-case situation.   &gt;-if you were ever average weight, what did you think of obese people then? now?  having grown up overweight, i, again, dont know what it's like to not be fat.  but, as a child, i never laughed or made fun or thought they were, or should be treated, different.  &gt;-do you think people judge you on a daily basis for your weight? like people on the street, bus drivers, store owners, etc.  yes. definitely.  it doesnt bother me or make me a shut-in, but i know ""the look"".  i either dont get it or dont notice it as much as i used to.  do they judge me? i dont know but i do get the occassional look.  &gt;-are you concerned about the health risks associated with obesity? if so, what's keeping you obese?  yes. same as galphanore, losing weight properly takes time.  i do see myself as being overweight but now that im on my way to losing it and im making an effort to lose it, i dont see myself as ""obese"".  to me, an dobese person is someone who either doesnt now theyre fat, doesnt care or doesnt want to change.  &gt;-what's your monthly grocery bill? or daily caloric intake?  monthly *grocery*...probably between $100 and $150.  i eat out probably 2-3 a month. daily caloric intake...definitely under 2000. probably between 1200 and 1500.  &gt;-what sort of stuff do i not even think about because i'm average weight that you have to deal with because of your obesity? how do you handle it?  my saddest day, as a fat person, and probably the first day i decided it was time for a change was when i was at a local theme park. i never had issues before but this one time, i tried to get on a ride i liked and i was too big.  it was sad **and** embarassing.  the things i worry about most are ""am i gonna fit?"" and ""is this gonna hold my weight?"" ladders, rickety things that sway or bow, made of wood or thin material. i recently took a trip on an airplane and i was frightened.  i knew belt-extenders existed but i didnt know if id need one or if they'd be offered on that particualr plane/flight.  i even went so far as to look up how big most of them were.  i was *just* small enough that i didnt need one.   it's not easy.  it's not society's fault but it still isnt easy.  having to worry about ""will i fit?"" ""will this hold my weight?"" ""is that belt going to fit around me?"" ""are they laughing at **me**?""   im surprised alot of people stay fat.  the worry, ridicule and constant struggle with it is enough to make anyone want to lose it. it does for me anyway.  honestly, im glad more americans are becomign fat.  it's humbling in way. because mroe people are getting fat or there are more people with fat friends/family so they cant say much to me.  **tl:dr**: being fat sucks and is no fun. i dont enjoy it nor do i want to be this way so, yes, im doing something about it. yay me! :d",1,-1,1

391667,"jumping on the train late because i don't want to do homework.  john: leaner build, a bit gawky, paler skin but biracial, half-pacific islander, half-caucasian. puberty spike makes him grow about 4 or so inches.  jade: tall and gawky pre-timeskip. she has tan skin and lots of freckles, leaning towards that pacific islander appearance more so than john when they're 13. fills out during the timeskip but doesn't have much curvature to speak of. doesn't actually grow in height over the timeskip. she was the tallest of the bunch before the timeskip.  rose: when she's 13 has a super round face, a bit stocky and very short. over the timeskip her face becomes leaner and becomes more heart-shaped in appearance, accentuated by her haircut and making her look older than her 16 years. she fills out somewhat, hourglass figure appears but only grows about 2 inches. however, she is still somewhat stocky. very pale in appearance but her hair is a little bit darker than cornsilk but her skin has a pinkish undertone. obviously didn't get much sun growing up in the northeast.  could be described as petite. shortest one of the bunch by far.  dave: ever since my friend pointed it out to me, dave is albino in my head. he is rather tan from living in texas, but his hair is the color of cornsilk. was super skinny as a kid, all bones, and continues to be so post-timeskip, just a little bit taller. during the timeskip the gawkiness is replaced somewhat with muscles, but not completely everywhere so he still is pretty damn skinny. he is able to hold himself better however, so he looks a little less awkward and more fluid. moves in a very cat-like way. he's the tallest of the bunch post-timeskip.  jane: she is super duper pale, accentuated by her dark as all hell hair. however, her facial features are more round and her actual facial appearance leans more towards the asian side of her roots (or lack of roots but this is my headcanon, goddamit). very pear-shaped in build so slim up top but has really wide hips and thighs. she really isn't that chubby, she's just naturally wider than most. she gives john and jade their facial structure and appearance. shortest of the bunch, but not by much.  jake: jake is super lean, very muscle-y and a thin face. he, like jade, looks more like a pacific-islander with more caucasian facial features, but he is super tan from being in the sun most of the time. not super freckle-y. he is where john and jade get their body type. tallest of the bunch, but not by much.  roxy: roxy is darker than rose, but is still pretty pale. her hair is rather pale and her face a bit more tan from her being in the sun surrounded by water her entire life. she has ocular albinism, so her eyes take a pinkish tone and that's where dave gets his albinism. she is a lot more lanky than rose is even though she's pretty short. she is skinny but she also has an hourglass figure.  dirk: his hair is a really yellow blonde and has a very heart-shaped face. he is super lean but not as tall as dave is. he is also rather muscle-y and his face has many freckles. he slouches a bit, and this affects his posture and also his height.   karkat: lean and small, his face is seriously round and only thins somewhat as he ages. he is shorter than terezi before the timeskip and grows so that he's only a few inches shorter than dave afterwards. however, he's still short and is only a little shorter than kanaya.  terezi: she is short and stocky, has curves and is pretty small pre-timeskip. aftewards, she has filled out a lot and looks more like a woman. she isn't fat, but still retains a stocky appearance and isn't that curvy. her face is round and continues to stay round post-timeskip but her chin makes her face look almost heart-shaped, especially when she smiles. her face is accentuated by all the freckles underneath her eyes.  kanaya: kanaya wasn't the tallest female troll when she was younger but was still pretty tall. she remains long and lanky, her figure only accentuated by a little bit of curvature that doesn't change much over the timeskip. she grows a little bit over the timeskip but mostly remains the same height. shorter than dave, but just taller than karkat by a hair. her face starts round but a heart shape visible, and when she matures her face becomes lean.  gamzee: long, lean, lanky, awkward. he fills out somewhat as he grows up still stays pretty lean. his face is long, just like the rest of his body. hunched over somewhat, but when he becomes sober he straightens up and looks more intimidating.   aradia: looks very flighty, she is similar to kanaya in that she's thin with a bit of curve to her but her face is most definitely heart-shaped. her eyes are large and full of expression. she isn't the tallest, about average, the same height as john.  sollux: a tad bit shorter than aradia and a tad bit taller than karkat. long, thin, lanky. thin face. if he was human he'd most definitely be described as asian.  vriska: tallest of the females pre-timeskip. she matured the quickest in terms of her body out of all the females. she is lean but has some serious body structure, has a mixture between a swimmer's and a runner's body. her face is round.  equuis: his face is kind of square and so is his body. he's large and all lean muscle. very wide shoulders. almost as tall as gamzee. arms=*damn*.   nepeta: shortest of the bunch. very petite. round face.  feferi: on the shorter end but taller than nepeta. she is very very lean, barely anything by way of curvature.   eridan: pretty much imagine him same way i imagine harry potter. lean but not the tallest. taller than kanaya and vriska but not by much. his face is lean as well.   tavros: he is just shorter than kanaya, has a stocky appearance and a baby's face.   damn. i should probably do my homework now.",1,0,0

478360,"my name is ellie and my dad is an important scientist. he says we need to stay here â€˜for the benefit of mankindâ€™, whatever that means exactly. we live in a big building in the middle of nowhere and itâ€™s supposed to be a big secret, so iâ€™m not allowed to leave. sometimes itâ€™s boring, but thereâ€™s lots of stuff here iâ€™m not supposed to play with that makes it fun.  i tugged on my dadâ€™s lab coat, â€œiâ€™m bored.â€ i wore a lab coat, too, but iâ€™m not a scientist like him.  he only glanced down at me for a moment and then he looked back to his fancy screen and flashy buttons. sometimes i forget what his eyes look like, heâ€™s always wearing his dark goggles.  â€œtake your robot to the play facility, dear,â€ he said.  i groaned. i hated the playroom, itâ€™s boring. thereâ€™s only baby toys to play with. â€œfine,â€ i said, stomping a boot.   â€œdonâ€™t forget the rules,â€ he said as i walked off.  â€œyeah, yeah, donâ€™t touch anything,â€ i said. i whistled. â€œcâ€™mon, doot-doot!â€   doot-doot rolled along beside me. heâ€™s my little robot and he tries to keep me out of trouble. heâ€™s also my best friend. he can take other shapes, but he seems to like being a ball the best.  â€œdonâ€™t you get dizzy rolling around like that?â€  he beeped at me and i laughed. he doesnâ€™t say much, he mostly just makes little beepy noises and lights up, but iâ€™m sure he can understand me. and i can understand him, too.  when we reached the playroom, i continued down the hallway, but he stayed by the door. â€œcâ€™mon, doot-doot, the playroom is boring, weâ€™re gonna have some fun today!â€  he beeped quietly and rolled back and forth. he looked unsure. â€œthe rules are lame, doot, letâ€™s go play somewhere else,â€ i said. he rolled after me, flashing red. he didnâ€™t like it, but that wasnâ€™t going to stop me.  we walked for a while and went through a lot of doors i wasnâ€™t supposed to go through, but i had one of my dadâ€™s cards. itâ€™s like a key, the card, you wave it at a door and it opens. we finally found what i was looking for.  this hallway had many doors where my dad kept what he called â€˜research subjectsâ€™ locked away. some of them were a lot of fun to play with, some were dangerous, but it was always an adventure. i heard pounding on one of the doors. doot-doot got scared and rolled into the wall, but i knew who it was, it was right on the door, rs-102. this was a dangerous one.  â€œellie, let me out,â€ said a deep voice from behind the door.  â€œsorry, 102, canâ€™t do that.â€  â€œi wonâ€™t try to eat you this time, i promise.â€  â€œhmm, what do you think, doot?â€ doot-doot urgently flashed red and i laughed. â€œno, sorry, not this time, 102.â€  â€œcurse you, child!â€ it banged on the door some more as i continued on.   doot-doot beeped for a full minute, he seemed pretty cross with me. â€œokay, i wonâ€™t tease them, but he did try to eat me, so he deserved it this time,â€ i told him.  rs-210, occupied. this one was new. i remembered it being empty the last time we came over here. the door looked different from most, like a different material. all the doors had little screens that could be turned on to look at the room inside. on the screen there was a boy about my age, he looked like he was crying. i pushed the â€˜talkâ€™ button.  â€œhey, iâ€™m ellie. whatâ€™s your name?â€  â€œturner,â€ he sniffled. â€œcan i go home now?â€  â€œsorry, turner, weâ€™re not allowed to leave, my dad says. but i can let you out to play if youâ€™re nice.â€  he wiped his nose and crawled to the door. â€œiâ€™m nice. please let me out.â€  â€œdoot-doot, what do you think?â€ he shook back and forth, a clear â€˜noâ€™ from him. â€œyouâ€™re  no fun. heâ€™s just a kid, i bet he wants to play. and i never played with a real kid before!â€  i opened the door, but it took more effort than most i had used. it was very heavy. turner shuffled out slowly. â€œis it really okay to be out?â€ he asked.  â€œsure is!â€ i put my hand out but turner backed away. â€œitâ€™s okay, you can shake it. itâ€™s nice to meet you,â€ i said. we shook.  â€œsame,â€ he said with a smile.  â€œthis here is my friend doot-doot!â€ doot-doot flashed green and beeped. â€œthat means he likes you.â€  â€œnice to meet you,â€ turner said with another smile. â€œi like him, too.â€  every room was different for each subject, so i peeked in to get a better view than the grainy image that the door-screen showed. it was larger than most and looked like an apartment. the ceiling was tall and the walls were padded. there were a bunch of little clean-up bots sweeping up pieces of a broken chair.   i was distracted then by a tall robot with a blonde wig standing in the kitchen. â€œare you hungry?â€ it asked me. it didnâ€™t look human at all and the blonde wig it wore didnâ€™t look right on its metallic head. i shivered.  â€œuh, no thank you,â€ i said, closing the door.  turner was mostly quiet as we walked through the building and i showed him the sights, but he finally got excited when i showed him the enclosed biomes. he would put his face to the glass windows and laugh while he peered at a jungle, a desert, a forest, and many more. â€œcan we go inside them?â€ he asked with bright eyes.  â€œsure! itâ€™s the closest thing to being outside we can get,â€ i said.   my dadâ€™s card let us into a forest biome. turner ran and laughed. he hugged a tree and i laughed, too. i was happy to watch turner having so much fun. we climbed trees and watches birds. we even saw a few deer! we played hide and seek, too. but then doot-doot began to ring.  i sighed. â€œitâ€™s getting late,â€ i told turner. â€œwe have to go back soon.â€  â€œback?â€ he voice cracked. â€œno, i canâ€™t go back, iâ€™m free now.â€  â€œi can come another day,â€ i told him. this was going to be harder than i thought.   â€œiâ€™m not going.â€ his face turned red then. â€œiâ€™m getting mad, ellie,â€ he said. his body began to change then. he grew bigger and his face meaner. i backed away slowly.   doot-doot rolled in front of me then. â€œwhat happens when you get mad? why were you in that room?â€ i asked turner.   â€œi get big. i break things. iâ€™ll break anything that tries to put me back,â€ his fist grew large and he hit a tree, his eyes never leaving mine. the tree splintered. his body was growing, he had muscles now, and was as tall as the ceiling of his room heâ€™d left hours before. he was red and huge and angry.  i tried to stay calm as i backed away. â€œthereâ€™s a superhero like that. he gets real big when he gets mad.â€ iâ€™m used to seeing amazing things every day, but i was still shaking.  turner shook his head. â€œiâ€™m not a superhero, ellie.â€ he put his massive arms around a tree and snapped it at the trunk like a twig. â€œand iâ€™m not. going. back!â€ he threw the tree at me.  â€œdoot-doot!â€ i called, but he was already moving. steam exploded from his ball body as he opened up. pieces of him grabbed a hold of my body, and i was now wearing him as armor. iâ€™ve always been mostly fearless when it came to the strangeness and dangerousness of my dadâ€™s research, because iâ€™ve always had doot-doot to protect me all along.  i jumped into the air, the tree just missing me, and disappeared into the forest. turner was blocking the exit. i could feel small tremors from where i hid as he slammed his fists into the ground and roared in a rage.  doot-doot beeped inside my helmet. â€œyeah, yeah, i know. you were right,â€ i told him, rolling my eyes. â€œi can see that.â€   â€œwhere are you, ellie? you wonâ€™t put me back there!â€   i grabbed a rock and threw it away from me and into the trees. i kept as still as i could as turner took notice and ran to the noise.  â€œi got you now! i got you, ellie!â€ he roared.  i watched him run, his back to me. the exit was wide open, but i couldnâ€™t leave yet. if i did there would be nothing stopping turner from leaving here and destroying the entire building. he could smash open any of the weaker doors, i was sure, letting out all kinds of danger all at once. i could handle one at a time, but all at the same time? no way.  â€œyou donâ€™t have to go back! i donâ€™t want you to!â€ i yelled.  turner stomped his way toward me as doot-doot beeped wildly. â€œyou said i have to go back!â€ he grabbed me and lifted me up, i fit inside his fist easily. he squeezed but my doot-armor held for now.  â€œi promise you donâ€™t have to! you can stay here! you can live outside, look around! donâ€™t you want to stay outside?â€  his grip relaxed. â€œi can stay?â€  i nodded. â€œyou can stay. i wonâ€™t tell. itâ€™ll be our secret.â€  he began to cry then as he dropped me. he fell to his knees and grew smaller. he looked like a kid again. doot-doot fell from my body and took his ball shape again. i put a hand on his shoulder. â€œitâ€™s okay,â€ i said.  â€œiâ€™m sorry,â€ he cried.  i backed away while doot-doot beeped at me. i nodded at him. a rod shot from his body and struck turner. it shocked him until he fell over unconscious. â€œiâ€™m sorry i lied,â€ i told his sleeping body.  i dragged him back to his room and told myself i would come back to apologize later for lying properly. i sat down for a moment to catch my breath. i patted doot-doot. â€œyou saves me back there, thank you.â€ i have him a big hug while he flashed green.   i was worn out from todayâ€™s adventure and went straight to bed. doot-doot was at the foot of my bed and beeped at me one last time for the night.  â€œgoodnight, doot,â€ i told him. â€œyou did good today.â€  the intercom chirped. â€œgoodnight, ellie.â€  â€œgoodnight, dad.â€ i was worried he might have caught me this time, but it looked like i got away scot-free.   *ellieâ€™s father observed the security footage that caught the events of her adventure that day. he made several notes to be logged for his report on the matter. he spoke into a

403670,"i agree mostly, but i don't think the variation in women's bodies is different from men's, but rather than men's clothes are designed to accomodate and women's are designed to assimilate. in men's clothing, they're not inherently sexualized in most clothes, so a fat man is mostly equal to a skinny one, a broad-chested man is equal to a thin-chested one, a guy with a big tush is equal to a guy with a small one (this less so, unfortuntaely). women's clothing is universally designed to tailor to relatively large hips at small waist sizes and relatively small ones at large hips. it's universally designed for chest sizes that really don't make sense, either. a real problem, too, is that women's clothes seem to be designed for women with small bone frames. at one point, i was skinny enough that you could see two of my ribs, but i had 40"" hips (and weighed 140 pounds), so clothing shopping is hell for me; it's so much worse now that i'm 20 pounds heavier because the only pants that now fit my huge hips fall off my waist. shirts are even worse; i have big boobs and even bigger shoulders, so i have to check my shoulders carefully every time i try on a blouse. if shirts were designed to accomodate more shoulder diversity, i'd be fine, but the only size differences clothiers seem to care about are bust and waist.   online shopping is even worse because most online vendors' ideas of xl or 2x are more like a normal small or medium. at one online vendor i go to, i'm only a happy customer because i only get the men's shirts, and even their men's larges are a little too tight on my shoulders. heck, i was doing the math, and the largest size they offered in women's was about a size smaller than my chest could fit in, and that's not even thinking about my shoulders.   i actually get most of my clothes at a dollar store chain and department sore chain that have a lot of plus sizes. they seem to be designed to accomodate women who are diverse as well as big, at the expense of lower versatility and slightly out of season designs. not like i care anyway--nothing was ever in style about a black ankle length skirt and black slashdot tee.",1,0,0

636224,"this is the weirdest story of my life:  in late december, 1998 , i was in my sophomore year at the university of massachusetts in amherst.  school had been out for a while for intersession break.  the campus was dead.  i don't think anyone was supposed to be in the dorms at that point, but no one told us we couldn't be- so, having no place else to go, i stayed.  i was sitting in my dorm room, in the late afternoon.  it was already starting to get dark out.  my dad had just called me, so we were shooting the shit.  he and mom were out enjoying tropical paradise on maui (hawaii's most gorgeous island, apparently).  they were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary over there- otherwise i suppose i would have been hanging out with them at our home near boston.  i said goodbye to my dad after about 5 minutes of pleasant chit-chat, and i walked over to put the phone in the receiver (i didn't start carrying a cell phone on me for another couple years or so).  as i set the phone down in its cradle, something caught my eye through the cracks in the venetian blinds.  i separated the slats of the blinds, somehow cutting my finger in the process.  i peered out into the darkening quad and saw an what looked like a wiggling train of fireflies.  i turned off my dorm room light, and looked outside again.  now, without the glare on my windows, i could see clearly a procession of what looked like three dozen people, all walking single file, and all carrying lit candles.  my first thought was that this must be a vigil or something for a student that died. it had the look and feel of a memorial.  but then on second glance i decided that those weren't students at all.  they were walking slowly and they didn't have the gait of young people.  they were skinny, terribly skinny.  each of them wore a black robe with hoods pulled up over their heads, and each robe flowed all the way to the ground, trailing several feet behind them.  the sun was down behind the hills, and i was having trouble making out any details at all beyond the black robes and flickering candles.  it this point i was really getting curious.  it was also at this point that i noticed that my finger had been sliced open on the blinds, and was oozing a surprising amount of blood.    i stepped out of my room- once again sensing just how empty and eerie the hallways were.  strange how the mind plays tricks on us- i could have sworn i saw a shadow going around the corner just as i step into the hall.  i stood still, but heard no footsteps.  i shook my head and laughed at my paranoia.  being careful not to let the door close behind me, i walked to the communal restroom and rinsed my finger under the tap.  i soaped up my hands and felt the sting of it on the cut.  i grabbed a paper towel, but thought that it might not be the most sanitary thing to put on a wound, so i went back into my room, looking for a bandage.  i saw that i had some sort of ace bandage that looked like it was made for wrapping up sprained joints- but i figured it would do the job.  i hastily wrapped my finger and did my best to tie off the bandage.  for a relatively small wound, the bandage was comically big.  with my minor emergency out of the way, i pondered what to do with myself.  if i was smart, i could get a jump on the calculus textbook before next semester- but the idea held no appeal.  i decided to have a little adventure instead.  i would go and catch up to the candle-bearers and figure out what was going on.  grabbing a stylish-but-much-too-light-for-the-weather coat from where i had casually flung it on my bed, i rushed out of my dorm room.  hearing the lock snap in place behind me, my blood went cold for a moment.  i'd been so careful before not to let the latch shut!  was i locked out?  i quickly patted the outside of my coat, trying to see if i could feel the keys in my pocket.  ahhh... there, left coat pocket.  i didn't even have reach in to to confirm, i heard the keys jingle as i patted them.  i clomped quickly down the stairs and out the dorm's front door.  3 paces out, dashed back, wedging a rock into the door frame.  if my student id badge wasn't going to let me in over the holidays, i certainly didn't want to find out tonight.  it was bitter cold.  about an inch of clean snow had accumulated on the ground, and though i saw no more of the robed parade, i easily found their footprints- or rather the long snake-like pattern that was carved out by their dragging robes.  i jogged along the snaky path until it disappeared into the woods.  i paused.    the woods were dark, abut the snow on the ground, and the moonlight above made it possible to see quite a bit better than i'd been expecting.  i stepped cautiously into the woods, and after about 10 steps, got spooked and turned around.   i walked towards the break in the trees, when behind me in the woods i heard a the distinctive sound of dozens of hand clapping once in unison- and there was a chanted word spoken simultaneously, but i couldn't make it out.  the held the word, in a song-like fashion.  then another group clap, then silence.  realizing how close i was, now, to finding the answer to this mystery, i trudged back into the woods.   as i followed the path over a small mound of earth, i saw the unmistakable glow of a bonfire not too far ahead.  i approached slowly.  when i got near the fire, i saw the robed figures- large men, all of them... and fat... all of them fat... they didn't make sense, i was sure when i'd seen them earlier they'd been noticeably thin!  i stayed out of sight, not wanting to interrupt the ... ritual- yes, they were performing some sort of a ritual!  they were standing, all of them, in a circle around the bonfire.  the were all linking their hands with one another- no... no... there hands were bound together with leather straps!  in unison, the would approach the fire, and raise their hands, the step back and lower their hands, all as one- like... like some sort of pulsating sea organism.  after they had repeated this cycle for a few minutes they all stopped-  i wondered how they all knew to stop at once- i hadn't heard or seen anything to organize them to act in concert.  they shook their arms until the leather straps that bound them all together slid to the snowy forest floor.  then they all clapped in unison- just as they had before.   the chanted the word again.  i still couldn't make it out, it sounded like- well... no it couldn't be... but it sounded like they were all saying ""sssssssaaaaaaaaa"" - (satan?) but they were sort of chanting/singing it in an odd and unpleasant chorus.  but what i saw next, chilled me to bones...  as they chanted, their bodies vibrated...  slowly at firsts, then violently.... and they were.... *swelling*.... just becoming bigger and bigger... no not taller... just fatter.  their black robes stretch and their disgusting distended bellies contorted and pushed against the fabric. it was almost as if something was growing inside them- and trying get out.  i inhaled sharply at the shock of it... and became acutely aware of what a stupid thing that was to do... i didn't know what was going on here, but i knew i didn't want to be seen by these... *people*??  they stopped their chanting and vibrating, and re-bound their arms to one another.  the processes was starting again.   the started swaying in and out from the fire- except now i could see that the fire was growing higher and higher each time they moved inwards.  i wanted to run then, but as they moved in and out from the fire, they were so quiet... they would surely hear me, and i didn't want to think about what that meant.  i felt something warm and wet on my arm... blood from my cut finger was saturating the bandage and flowing down my arm.  somehow i knew it was because of the ritual.  they stopped their pulsating dance, and let the leather straps fall once more.  the clapped, and again chanted their word....  ""saaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......""  they started again to vibrate.... ""..aaaaaaaaa..."" ... and grow.... ""..aaaaaaaaaa...""  ... and now at last, their robes could no longer stand the strain... the seams ripped, exposing bloody red underneath... ""...aaaaaaa...""  ... the chanting chorus grew and reverberated- now all the robes were bursting off the engorged bellies .... """"...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ...""  and then i finally understood... the robes, now only tattered ribbons of fabric sank to the ground.  underneath, they all stood.  black boots.  red pants.  black belts.  white gloves.  red coats with white trim.  they finished their chant ""...aaaaanta!""  they clapped in unison.  dozens of santas, chubby and red.  my jaw dropped.  the all looked at each other- the transformation complete.  they let out deep belly-laughs... the ""ho! ho! ho!"" we've all come to love.  then, one of them raised his arms in a sharp gesture.  they all stopped laughing, and stood perfectly still.    the santa that had stopped it all threw his head back and started sniffing the air deeply.  he kept this up for about 30 seconds before he stopped and said, ""blood.""  he turned and looked directly at me- his eyes were as cold as death.     ""blood,"" they all said in unison.  they just *said* it... coldly... calmly.  they all turned to face me now.  and i ran.  i ran like i've never run in my life.  i didn't know where i was going except *away*... away from the fire, away from the echoing laughter i heard in the distance... --- tl;dr: i inhaled sharply at the shock of it... and became acutely aware of what a stupid thing that was to do... i didn't know what was going on here, but i knew i didn't want to be seen by these... *people*??",1,-2,-1
704218,"since you're going to be new at both living alone and cooking, i would suggest keeping things *very* simple. also, if you're cooking for just 1-2 people, your needs are very different than if you were cooking for a whole family.  **cookware**  1. one large skillet (14"" minimum, at least 2"" deep) with a tight-fitting lid. this will be your basic cookpot for about 75% of the stuff you cook. don't skimp on this, get the best one you can afford. you can save money on the other stuff.  2. one smaller frying pan (10"" diameter, can be shallower, should also have a lid) for making omelettes, cooking/warming small quantities.  3. one large pot with lid for making soups, cooking pasta, etc.  4. one smaller pot with lid.  5. at least one oven-proof casserole dish with lid.  6. one roasting/grilling tray for the oven/grill. pick a larger one than you think you need.  7. about 2-3 mixing bowls, preferably in a range of sizes from medium to large. can be thin walled and light, they are not for cooking.  8. cutting board, 2-3 knives (usually one large serrated, a couple of non-serrated smaller knives). spatula. meat thermometer (specially if you cook pork). a measuring cup (pyrex, with a scale marked in both imperial/metric scale and cups), measuring spoons. one wire whisk. a couple of long handled wooden spoons. one ladle or large serving spoon. one peeling knife for peeling potatoes. optional: cheese grater, colander/sieve, pizza cutter.  oven mitts. paper towels. dishrag. cleaning supplies.  that's it. you can cook almost anything you care to cook with this stuff only. most other cookware is a convenience, not a necessity. i would start with these basics, and then buy more only if-and-when needed, as determined by your own cooking practices.  remember to get aluminum foil and oven-proof parchment paper. they make cleaning stuff easy, just line pans with the appropriate material and discard when done. get a basic rubbermaid or tupperware set for leftovers. also get cling wrap and disposable refrigerator/freezer ziplock bags.  **materials**  stainless steel or hard anodized aluminum, for stuff you will use a lot (like the skillet).  my personal preference is stainless steel. it leaves no aftertaste in the food, it's very easy to clean. it is extremely strong, and well able to handle the normal use/abuse that cookware is supposed to withstand.  i would pick heavy duty stainless steel with a *thick* base to spread the heat and make sure food doesn't burn and stick to the bottom. the better kinds will have 2-3 different metals in sandwich-like layers at the bottom. usually it's stainless steel with a layer of aluminum or copper at the bottom for extra heat conduction. go with whatever you can afford, so long as it feels heavy.  most cookware, regardless of material, comes in regular or non-stick finish. there is no question that non-stick helps to make foods stick less, so it's easier to use and clean. however, i only have non-stick for my smaller frying pan, which is mostly used for omelettes. everything else has a regular metallic finish. there are two reasons for avoiding non-stick for other cookware:  1. any kind of heavy-handed spatula action inside a pan, such as when stirring, turning over foods, etc. will eventually damage the non-stick finish. such damage is inevitable, it's just a matter of time. when there is damage, food sticks to the pan worse than if there had been no non-stick finish to begin with. this makes it less than ideal for pans intended for heavy-duty use.  2. food sticking to the bottom isn't always a bad thing, if it's controlled. when you're browning meats for example, the stuff at the bottom of the pan will make a delicious sauce if you know what you're doing and don't let it burn. for browning meats, non-stick is inherently inferior to a regular pan with a metallic surface.  so i would pick a plain metallic finish for all the cookware, and perhaps get just one medium sized frying pan with a non-stick finish for omelettes and lighter cooking.  i am assuming that your apartment comes with the usual appliances, at least a cooking range (with 4 burners, oven and grill) plus a refrigerator. in addition to these, you definitely need a microwave oven, and possibly a toaster oven. the toaster oven is handy for cooking small amounts, which is very common when you're cooking for just 1 person. make sure you get one with a removable drip tray that can be easily cleaned.  **where to buy**  i would suggest prioritizing, if cash is a concern. spend the bulk of your money on 2-3 items that will be used a lot, and don't worry too much about getting the best quality for the rest of the stuff. the single most important thing in the list above is the skillet. you can upgrade the rest of the stuff later.  if i were you, i would not buy the important stuff at wal-mart or similar superstore. the usual brands you get there (revere, t-fal, etc. aren't that great). good cookware costs a lot. you can easily spend $500 for a single good skillet from mauviel or all-clad. assuming that you don't want to spend that much, i would recommend second-tier brands like calphalon, anolon, kitchen-aid, etc. i have a lot of calphalon cookware, and it's pretty good.  i am lucky to have an outlet mall with stores that carry these brands for deeply discounted prices near my area. you may have to look around a bit, depending on where you live. don't forget to check online, starting with amazon. look for discounts and special offers, they are fairly common. remember, a good skillet will last you 20 years and be a pleasure to cook with for the duration. a cheap one will burn food, the base will become warped and unstable, the non-stick coating will peel off, and you'll find yourself disgusted with it and replacing it in a year.",0,,

726576,"every time someone asks how to replace the lcd everyone just tells them to pay some affiliated buddy to do it and rarely someone actually gives some hints what to look out for when attempting this repair.  &amp;#x200b;  the lcd is a cheap 7.50$ aliexpress replacement screen (search ""audi 8n fis lcd""). there are some better ones where its said that the contrast might be stronger or with a trimmer but i was not able to get one in time and this one works perfectly fine.  many electronics hobbyist are more than capable enough to successfully repair this themselves with some basic soldering equipment (hot air station, flux, temperature controlled soldering iron).  but be aware that if you break the board in some way this instrument contains all the programming and immobilizer so this would turn into a much bigger issue then.    the risk is pretty low if you are confident with smd soldering and if you are careful not to break any traces while unclipping the motors.  &amp;#x200b;  the hardest part of this repair is to actually get to the lcd without breaking off the clips holding in the motors and the dash panel.removing the instrument is something you would have to do anyways if you were to send it to a repair shop so half the work already done there.  you should probably mark which motor went on what side. i assembled it exactly how it was before and had no issues once the needles were aligned.",0,,
477743,"first off, i want to say, thank you for your response! i found it to be very insightful and well-written, even though i disagree with a few parts (i'll get to that below). you certainly did an amazing job of typing out such a great reply on your phone!  &gt; and i'm not saying that rowling said what she wanted to in the most eloquent of fashions, but she seems to just want her daughters to be less of pansy and more of a hermione-- less of a bully who throws around the word thin as a way to describe to someone else that they have met her particular expectations for beauty and that's the only thing that makes her useful and more of a smart, caring, friendly person.   that's the thing, though. i've read all of the harry potter books multiple times myself, and seen all of the movies multiple times as well...but as far as i can recall, pansy never calls hermione ""fat"", or even references hermione's weight at all. instead, hermione is made fun of for her ""bird's nest"" (bushy) hair and ""buck teeth"". even then, since the books are from harry's perceptive, we don't see much of pansy at all - which is why i mentioned my issue with rowling writing pansy as a ""one-dimensional"" bully character. compared to pansy, hermione was far more developed as a character, and clearly depicted as one of the most competent (and ""good"") characters of the series. i say that as a big hermione fan myself; hermione is my favorite character in the books. in fact, one might argue that pansy might even be overweight herself, being described as ""puggish"" by rowling herself; meaning she ""has the features of a pug"", including stout/squatness and a ""pug-like"" face. i find it hypocritical that rowling is making negative comments about ""skinny"" people in her blog post, when she also infers that *pansy* (a character she hates) *also* would be just the kind of person to make those remarks.  &gt; and even then, hermione had bad qualities and pansy has good ones, but most people with a passing knowledge of harry potter consider hermione a ""good guy"" and pansy a ""bad guy"". so i don't think she's calling hermione thin and pansy fat, (or vice versa),  i agree with you here. as i posted in another one of my replies, my problem with j. k. rowling's ""pansy portrayal"" [in comparison to hermione] has little to do with weight, but her lack of developing the character as a well-rounded character [whereas hermione *is* a well-rounded character]. as i mentioned above, i find it hypocritical of rowling to make a ""better a hermione than a pansy parkinson"" comment, when she's making comments that pansy herself would likely make [concerning ""skinny"" people]. meaning rowling herself is contradicting what she's saying.  &gt; i think she's saying that the traits in hermione are more in line with her wants for her daughters than the traits in pansy.  i'd agree here as well.  &gt; besides that, rowling's response to the woman who said she lost weight is reasonable. the fact is that rowling had a baby and her response that she lost weight because she had a baby is absolutely normal.  i disagree here that it was ""reasonable""; i think it was insensitive of rowling to just assume the woman was *trying* to be rude to her, and took the woman's comment the wrong way. [there's even a daily mail article that was released that listed ""you've lost weight!"" as the #1 compliment made to women [or, supposedly].](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2129314/have-lost-weight-womens-favourite-compliment-mention-slim-figure-never-tell-looks-like-mum.html)   also think it was entirely unprofessional and inappropriate of rowling to create a blog post about a woman - not mentioning her directly - but still basically ""shaming"" or ""calling her out"" for what rowling assumed was a slight against her. imagine if you met a high-profile, famous author, messed up in complimenting her badly, and offended her enough that she wrote a blog post based on your *one* comment. you'd feel really bad about yourself, no? i think that rowling was right to ultimately delete her blog post due to that, because - while it may do some good, by empowering some - it also can do *bad*. in today's world, people would take it upon themselves to also shame the woman who gave rowling the ""weight"" comment, even going so far as to doxx anyone they assumed *was* the unnamed woman in question.  &gt; in fact, the way i read your counterargument makes me think that you might find being thin more attractive and that the way you justify said like is to talk about the health risks of obesity. that might not be what you meant, but your response to rowling's post is actually kind of emotional, even hurt, as though you were personally hurt by this post. that's just how i'm reading and like i said might not be what you meant, but think about it. you think she's being sexist when she's calling harry slim and attractive and denounce her for making thin women cruel... but thin people can be cruel (in real life, and not just in respect to fat people) and harry is actually slim and attractive, most people agree with this and i don't see why rowling has cause to disagree (because he's a character she created in a book that she wrote). i think it's reaching to infer those things about her because umbridge exists, and i'm pretty sure she's overweight in the books. and she has plenty of non-slim male characters to pick from. crabbe and goyle are fat male bad guys... neville is a fat male good guy. there are fat good women, like mrs weasley, and thin good women, like hermione or luna.  i'm not sure what you meant by this part of your post. i'm not overweight or fat myself, but most of my family is. for most of my childhood, they also tried to ""get me to eat more"", which is considered child abuse by some the way they were doing it. additionally, most of my family *is* fat: my grandfather is the size of a small planet; my grandmother is overweight, but steadily losing after 4 heart attacks; my mother is very overweight, with hbp, high cholesterol, and heart strain; and my father is also very overweight, and eats a *lot* of junk food as part of his diet. thanks to drinking coke (*not* diet coke, regular coke), and other sugary drinks, day in and day out, he was also rushed to the er to have emergency gallbladder surgery (the organ was removed). my mom does, too, including a *lot* of five guy's, ice cream, and pizza. so you can imagine what growing up with them must have been like for me. my brother was also overweight, until he decided to eat healthier and exercise more in high school. (surprise, surprise, he dropped the weight and now looks very healthy.)  thankfully, i myself never got any more than slightly overweight at my worst. for a time, i was anorexic, but ultimately recovered from that, and i now am a healthy weight. i am ""curvy"", but not ""overweight""; some have described me as ""average"", and others, ""slim"".  however, on the opposite end of the spectrum, at least two of my cousins could be considered ""model thin"". while their father (my mother's brother) is also overweight, and has numerous health issues due to it, they inherited a model-thin body frame from their mother. people would often make insensitive comments about both of them due to their weights, asking them if they were ""anorexic"", or telling them ""you need to eat more"". however, no matter how much they ate, they simply *would not* put on weight. from what i've heard, many professional models also have the same body type and metabolism.  so, hopefully that explained a bit of background, and maybe could provide a little insight as to why maybe my tone sounded that way.   as for overweight or 'fat' villains or antagonists in the harry potter series, yes, there *are* quite a few. however, in the second blog post/article i linked (original post), rowling herself linked to a mugglenet article that tried to point out ""there are more fat good characters than fat evil characters"".  as for neville, i never saw him as 'fat'. maybe a bit 'pudgy', yes, but never 'fat'. dudley, i would consider 'fat'. umbridge, again, i would consider 'fat'. however, neville himself was never seemingly described, on weight-par terms, as matching either dudley's or umbridge's weight. then again, i could be wrong; i never paid much attention to characters' weights in the books, up until i saw rowling's comment. when i read the books, it's really not something i look for, or single out in particular.  &gt; rowling is just saying what many women before her have said, ""i don't want to be judged on how i look, i want to be judged on what i say and do."" the standard of beauty she used this time was thinness. but really, she could've said ""you don't have to be blonde"" or ""you don't have to be a size 8 shoe"" or ""you don't have to know english"", so long as she was talking about something that most people agree is a beautiful trait.  i agree, but i think she could have worded her response better. that's just my opinion. i also think she could have revised her content to better clarify that she *meant* that vanity was her target - such as mentioning gilderoy lockhart, by far *the* vainest character in the hp series - and removing her comments about ""skinny"" people.",1,0,0

programs focus on the use of heavy compound lifts. compound lifts are lifts that require the use of multiple muscles to complete. all of the big four fall into this group. all three programs also focus on keeping things in a moderately low rep range (5 reps per set). this is done with the goal of gaining strength without being severely taxing so that the programs can be repeated within a day or two. all of the programs also focus on increasing the weight used as often as possible. that's the basics of all of them. give me a minute and i'll edit this with further information on the benefits of one over the other.  **edit 1, benefits:**      edit 1.1: starting strength  starting strength has the benefit of having ridiculously detailed books written about it. it was originally a program/book designed to be used by shitty coaches who didn't comprehend how to train people using the barbell lifts. it evolved into a massive community/franchise that is still growing. the upside of this is that the routine is extremely popular and information about it is easy to find. starting strength starts you off with a program of a (squat/press/deadlift) and b (squat/bench/deadlift) alternated on three nonconsecutive days a week. at the beginning of the program you work up from the bar, adding weight for sets of five until you can no longer perform all five reps explosively. when this decrease in bar speed occurs, you stop adding weight and do another two sets of five. this is the first workout. from this point on, for the first 2-3 weeks, you add 10lbs to the squat each workout, 20-30lbs to the deadlift and 5-10lbs to the bench press and overhead press. after 2 to three weeks, everything slows down considerably. the squat switches to 5lbs jumps, the deadlift to 10-15lbs jumps and the presses switch to 5lbs or less jumps. also, now that the deadlift is set well ahead of the squat from increasing so much the first few weeks, you'd add power cleans to day b, making it squat/bench/power clean. power cleans are useful in that they're a pull from the floor that uses an explosive hip extension to get the weight from deadlift lockout height to the shoulders. this will have carry over to the deadlift and athletic pursuits such as jumping  as well as allowing you to essentially have a lighter day for pulling. when first started, the power clean can be increased in the same manner as the pressing exercises. at first, it should be close to equal with your bench press weight, but will eventually slow down and end up closer to your overhead press weight. starting strength is the most aggressive of the three workouts, adding much more weight much quicker along with diet recommendations such as eating 3500+ calories a day to drive recovery. you will most likely get the strongest the fastest with starting strength.       edit 1.2:  stronglifts 5x5  stronglifts 5x5 is similar to starting strength if you replaced power cleans with barbell rows from the floor (typically referred to as pendlay rows). stronglifts 5x5 also uses a rotating a (squat/bench/row) and b (squat/press/deadlift) set up for three nonconsecutive days each week. stronglifts 5x5 starts the squat, press and bench press with just the bar. barbell rows are started at 65lbs and deadlifts at 95. this is to allow one to get into a more proper set up for the bottom of the pulls, which the empty bar would not allow. the benefit of this is that you start light as hell, allowing you to focus on form for a great while before anything starts to become remotely heavy. the increased volume of 5x5 compared to 3x5 means more total work. theoretically, this would mean increased strength and increased mass in comparison to the lesser volume. while this isn't always true, the fact that you still have more chances to focus on making sure your form is correct does stay true. eventually, 5x5 will decrease from 5x5 to 3x5 and then to 1x5. this gives the advantage of decreased volume while allowing you to increase intensity. this should allow you to further increase your 5 rep max before having to switch over to more intermediate programming. stronglifts 5x5 also supports a large forum and website as well as having its own book. the creator's nutrition advice is fairly decent since it only involves ""eat meat, fruits and vegetables"".      edit 1.3:  greyskull lp  greyskull lp comes from john sheaffer (known on the internet as johnny pain). john used to work with starting strength's rippetoe and be one of the ""starting strength coaches"". he even had his own q&amp;a on the starting strength forums. he and rippetoe had a disagreement over programming and parted ways. sheaffer took his programming ideas and combined them with starting strength to produce greyskull lp (essentially). unlike the other two, greyskull lp does not rotate out with an a/b scheme. the squats and deadlifts follow a set pattern while the two pressing exercises rotate each day. the base program of greyskull lp is monday:  press/bench press (alternating) + squat; wednesday:  alternating presses+deadlift; friday:  alternating presses+squat. greyskull lp also uses 3x5 except with the final set being an as many as possible set. as long as you get 5 or more on the final set (or the only set, since the deadlift is just one amap set), you increase the weight. squats and deadlifts go up 5 while the pressing exercises go up 2.5. the idea behind that was that in starting strength, you'd eventually have to switch down to those lower progressions anyway, so instead of using a higher progression and driving your dick into the dirt with the lifts until you stall out and have to deload, greyskull lp starts with those slower progressions. the big bonus of greyskull lp is that it is encouraged to add optional ""layers"" to the program. the most common ones are weighted chin ups on pressing days, curls on bench days, neck harness work, body weight ""frequency"" chins everyday, and conditioning in the form of fasted walking or heavy conditioning like sprinting and burpees. greyskull lp also boasts multiple books (two editions of greyskull lp, 3 conditioning books, a book on eating to build mass, a book on steroid usage and a few more). johnny pain is also not a huge dick in that he doesn't get pissy and try to insist on his way is the only way to get results and that his program shouldn't be altered. he encourages people adjust the program however they desire as long as the base layer remains, which probably keeps motivation much higher. greyskull lp seems much more like a beginner's ""power building"" program than a beginner strength program, but it also seems to work better with the majority of people who want to go to the gym just to look better naked. this way, they have a strength routine that they can add their curls for the girls without 80 million people on the internet flipping shit over them altering the program.      edit 1.4:  i forgot to mention that unlike starting strength, where deloads are something to dread and avoid, they're encouraged in greyskull lp. the amap set allows one to gauge strength increases when when using a lighter weight. you're fighting with your old rep max and curb stomping it. this is very motivational and lets you see that even though you stalled, you've still gotten stronger. also, the exercise order is reversed, putting the presses before the lower body lift. this usually helps with keeping those lifts progressing in comparison to squatting beforehand.  **edit 2, negatives:**      edit 2.1:  starting strength  rippetoe is a dick. anyone that denies this is either insane or has never been to the starting strength forums. he (along with tons of people on the internet who believe they are enlightened simply from reading his book) insists that his way is the only effective way for a novice to get stronger and bigger, and if you don't use his method or you change his routine in anyway, you're pussy. his diet recommendations are awful. if you're fat, eat 3500 calories of a paleo-like diet with minimal carbs and dairy. i don't give a shit how much green shit and grass-fed beef you eat, unless you're over 300, you aren't losing weight eating 3500 calories a day. also, while drinking a gallon of milk a day is definitely going to help you add tons of calories to your diet, at some point you need to be an adult and learn how to count calories and accept that sometimes you have to eat more even when you're full. there is nothing inherently wrong with the program starting strength. it is a great program for what it is designed, however, do not believe that you'll be able to drag it out the whole 3-8 months rippetoe recommends while still adding  to everything each time you lift. shit is going to slow down, stall out and need to be microloaded to continue progressing. if this weren't the case, starting strength would have everyone squatting 405x5 after six months even if they only started with just the bar, which rarely happens. the biggest issue with starting strength are the cult-like followers who will destroy some poor kid on the internet for not wanting to do gomad and wanting to add curls to the program to do something about his  arms. despite the amazing book having a plethora of useful assistance exercises, you will get shit on if you use any of them.  **continued below**",0,,

670912,"how can you look at a person and know their body shape must be due to overeating &amp; lack of exercise?     how well the body stores food as fat is dependent on so many things:  medications the person is on (eg steroids or some psych meds), endocrine function (insulin resistance, thyroid), genetics, stress levels (eg. cortisol), co-morbilities (limitations having nothing to do with body fat that make exercise difficult), fluid shift (eg. kidney failure), etc.    the only thing you can know by looking at a fat person is that they're fat.  you are also working on the grossly distorted notion that body fat must equal poor health.    there are some problems with this.    - for one, the studies that supposedly back up this theory are almost always based on bmi values to compare 'overweight' and 'obese' people with particular medical conditions.     but bmi was never intended to be a test to see if an *individual* person is overweight or obese.  bmi does not take into account muscle vs fat, nor is it reliable for individuals who are very short/tall or very stocky.   [bmi is bullshit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glxxog98urc). if we can't agree objectively who is or isn't ""fat"", how can we do any sort of quality study on the correlation between fatness and anything else?  - like any statistical study, correlation does not imply causation.   they can survey a group and find that let's say heart attack risk seems to be linked to bmi.     they're trying to say a causes b.   but we don't really know if it's a coincidence, if b actually causes a, if another variable (lifestyle? genetics?) predisposes some people to both conditions.   a statistical study is supposed to follow up with research that seeks to find the actual mechanism that proves the one variable causes the other -- and the data just isn't there yet to prove the presence of extra adipose cells is the primary cause of heart attack or whatever.  - when people report *lifestyle changes* and their fitness improves, the weight loss is more likely just a side effect.  it was the increase in activity level and improvement in quality of food that is makes more sense in explaining their new fitness level.    - fat does not equal instant death.  there are studies that show [overweight people do live just as long.  ](http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/02/being-overweight-is-linked-to-lower-risk-of-mortality/) .   but that goes back to my earlier statements about studies based on bmi not being reliable either way.      - skinny people get sick too.   and in some cases, it's the illness that causes them to be skinny, so being really thing isn't the best indicator of good health.   bulimia/anorexia, drug or alcohol addiction, cancer, some gi problems are just a few illnesses that can keep a person looking thin.    there are plenty of not-fat people who get type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, arthritis, and cancer; none of those diseases are ""fat people"" diseases specifically.  raising your girl to become bulimic *will* kill her; i lost one of my own friends this way.   i know of two other women who enjoyed compliments on their thinness for years; both are active alcoholics and one is going into liver failure.   - do keep in mind there is a big financial motive to tell people we must  keep losing weight.  in the us, weight loss is a $20 billion dollar business.   everyone from surgeons (bariatric) to pharmaceutical companies to supplement resellers to diet sellers all want us to believe. who is funding all these studies and press releases about the supposed ""obesity epidemic""?   are they basing their claims on unbiased evidence-based science or simply echoing ""everyone knows""?      for a second, let's say you can provide that obesity is the primary cause of a bunch of major health problems.    let's call it a disease and try to treat it -- the most common treatment being calorie restricted diet.   a treatment can be considered effective long-term if at the 5 year mark, almost all people had the desired result, right?   but if we look at all the research on long-term diet effectiveness, we find that [95% of diets failed long-term](http://danceswithfat.wordpress.com/2011/06/28/do-95-of-dieters-really-fail/).    how can you call a treatment effective if it long-term it may only work for a mere 5%?    and of the 95% who fail, some not only gain their old weight back, but they may rebound with additional weight.     so until you find a more reliable ""cure"" for obesity, it makes no sense to try to beat up on people who are obese.    why not put all your energy into funding research to study the body more? imagine the good america could do by putting that $20 billion dollars annually not into weight loss (which we know rarely works) and instead put it into health research?  you assume that by stigmatizing the people whose lifestyle you don't agree with, you can force them to change.  is it possible the changes in smoking didnt have so much to do with smoking as it did with massive taxes in cigarettes, education, free smoking cessation programs, higher health insurance premiums, prohibitions on smoking in most public areas &amp; restaurants, etc.    it's just too costly to do and it's not legal to do in most places, therefore, the % of people smoking is dropping.  do you really think a stranger quit smoking because they worried they might run into you one day and you'd ridicule them for it?  i don't.  on mobility scooters:   unless you are that person's doctor, you have no idea why they're in a scooter.   you can't glance at a chubby person using a scooter and know they must be fat because they have a scooter.  there are so many diseases (ms, lymes, fibro myalgia, rhematoid arthritis, als) that make it hard for a person to walk, and none of them are caused by obesity.  the only thing you can know by looking at a fat person is they're fat.   looking down on disabled people isnt kind, compassionate, or helpful.    there is also this big misconception that obese people in general are not active, and that's just plain wrong.    overweight people do walk, do go to the gym, do exercise, do sometimes even compete in athletic endeavors.    the sad thing is that due to attitudes such as yours, some gyms run overweight people out.  they don't like to ""look at fatties"".   it's extremely hard to find workout clothing if a person is bigger than a large or xl.   gyms &amp; retailers aren't selling equipment sized to meet the heavier person's needs.   society wants to make fun of big people but at the same time it's so much harder to get clothes, equipment, or gyms that fit a big person?!  i believe that when you make negative generalizations about a group of people based on their appearance, that's what the dictionary called ""bigoted"".     what right do you have to decide for others their lifestyle?    if you object to people who do activities that cause them to die early, are you equally enraged by people who do extreme sports?   how about the people with really bad driving records, since motor vehicle at a top cause of death in america?   maybe those parents shouldn't be allowed to have kids?     how about the people who eat a diet high in red meat?   or processed foods?  should parents who feed their kids many meals of processed foods &amp; too much meat also be stigmatized?   there are ways that all of us do things that may be detrimental to our health.  do you want others to decide for you how to live your life?  or shouldn't that be *your* decision, made with the advice of your doctor?",1,1,

773614,"&gt;your dismissal of the time element in a discussion of interest indicates you don't understand how interest works, or how the present differs from the future.  come on.  that's a bit harsh.  i fully understand how interest works and firmly understand the difference between present and future.  what i think you fail to grasp is that for the bulk of human history, interest didn't exist or was actually illegal.  as such, it is optional and, like any other tool, can be put where it works and supplanted by alternatives where it doesn't.  we've been raised in a monetary system where everything runs on interest and so have difficulty imagining how life could work without it, but most of our ancestors did just that.    who do you think controlled the money supply in the pacific islands where money was often shells?  want cash?  go dive and get yourself some.  the ""value"" was due to rarity of certain shells, not because some central body like the fed artificially controlled supply.  take that principle and apply it to diamonds, gold, or any other resource that has been deemed as wealth by humanity - if you could find it, you became wealthy and the ""interest"" you paid was the labour to dredge it out of the ground.  the point is that you and i are actually saying the same thing ... but i think you miss that.  would access to low interest capital have helped guernsey?  sure it would have and i fundamentally agree that this would have been a solution to their problem.  in fact, that is precisely what happened! the local government offered a 0% loan in guernsey dollars, certain islanders took it, and it accomplished exactly what a low percentage loan in pounds would have - commerce flourished.  the only difference is that the bank of london didn't get any interest on the deal, realized their mistake, and nipped the whole experiment in the bud with their one-time poison pill.   i know why the fed exists.  yes, you can print money any time you want and if you can convince enough people to use it for trading, then it will become a viable currency like the guernsey dollar did.  the problem results when you have unscrupulous folks who don't control how much money they create because there is a fine line between too much and too little.  the fed controls the flow with interest rates, raising or lowering as they need to in order to keep the economy at its peak.  sure, you couldn't go completely interest free because of that, but you can definitely supplant the interest system with a lot of interest free money in areas where interest alone isn't enough of an incentive to invest.  and that is where alternative currencies are already fitting the bill.  city centers, places like guernsey, people who are deemed credit risks by the banks ...  i purchased a computer using edmonton dollars that i earned over time by doing it work for other edmonton dollar workers.  paid for my bus fare to pick it up with edmonton dollars, too.  a large portion of my transactions each day don't involve cad or any interest, in fact.",0,,

502107,"this is a keroro gunso kit.  the main character (keroro) is a frog-like alien that ends up stranded on earth and takes an interest in, among other things, building gunpla.  the tiny zaku ii is one of several accessories included with this kit, along with a buildable rx-78-2 of the same size.  itâ€™s a claimed 1/100 scale according to the tiny instruction manual but itâ€™s actually closer to \~1:600.  anyhow, this was more hand brush practice and the zaku ii was a challenge due to its size.  modifications to the zaku ii before painting:  * removed handle post on rear skirt / butt and added a magnet * added magnets to feet and butt for handle post attachment * added backpack vernier thrusters with spare runner, then hollowed them out with a pin-vise * mostly removed the main seam line (the model is split into a front and back half) * rescribed a few details due to size  things i skipped, but probably should have done:  * sharpen the shoulder spikes more to a point * scribe in details for the various power cables * sand, fix, and reprime the rear skirt after inspection as my clean-up of the handle post wasnâ€™t the greatest  painting followed a basic miniature process -- primer, base coats, wash for shadows, some edge highlighting and dry brushing for more contrast.  i did end up eventually applying a gloss coat to aid some panel lining and placement of a single decal: a zeon logo on the shield.  i managed to find something reasonably sized from the delpi decal sheet for the hgto zaku ii type-c/c-5 (the unfinished model pictured in the size comparison).  the top coat used was a satin finish on everything but the mono eye region.  the biggest mess-up was my use of nuln oil.  i had haphazardly laid that all over the model and didnâ€™t like the resulting look-- too matte, grungy, and â€œdirty.â€  it reminded me of the oil-based â€œgunk washâ€ technique, which i donâ€™t prefer.  however, since it dried, i spent some time removing much of it from the broader surfaces with a brush mildly damped in thinner, leaving some as mild weathering and shading.  thankfully it never adhered well in the first place and the base coat was fully cured and resistant to thinner use.  i would have preferred a cleaner look, but this would do.  chibi kero had some mixed results.  i removed the many mold lines and some ejector marks but didnâ€™t try to clean up part seams as the model has a peculiar eye swap gimmick and some strange gaps that, if filled, would ruin articulation.  i really liked how the main green turned out with a green-blue undercoat and a vibrant, transparent green on top.  it has a warmth and depth that is not present if left with just the original plastic colour.  the hat yellow came out very smoothly too, which is a huge surprise considering itâ€™s a mecha color paint.  the white application is pretty awful; iâ€™ll chalk it up to a learning experience.   a matte finish helped hide some brush strokes and unevenness.  i also tried and failed at blending on various surfaces.   the pupils are derpily painted.  my brush-on matte varnish coat also lifted some wash onto the white.  ah well, keroro is still pretty cute when all the accessories are around.  final notes:  * some natural bristle brushes come with a long guide hair that doesnâ€™t work well with acrylic paints-- some research suggests this is meant for watercolor. acrylic paint tends to dry there and causes interference.  a trim of the hair solved this. * larger flat brushes save time and reduce brush strokes over broad surfaces for many aspects (priming, base coats, clear coats). * vallejo model color sky grey and dark sea green contain a tan pigment that separates when water is added. i suspect that one pigment is lighter than water and thus floats to the surface.  while you can stir it back in as long as the amount of water added was low, the way to thin these paints without this behaviour is to use thinner medium.  zaku ii paints:  * primer: vallejo mecha primer grey + game ink black * main armour green: vallejo mecha color green blue * darker torso armour green (i.e. skirt, sides of chest): vallejo mecha color dark green * darkest chest armour and details: vallejo mecha color dark grey green + game ink black * rifle, other mid/dark grey details: vallejo mecha color dark grey green * mono eye: a dot of vallejo model color white, metal medium, model color fluorescent magenta * shadow washes: citadel nuln oil, vallejo mecha color oiled earth and black washes * detail shadows: vallejo model color german grey * highlights, dry brushing: vallejo model color sky grey * clear coats: vallejo mecha gloss, satin varnishes  chibi kero paints:  * primer: vallejo mecha primer sand * main green: vallejo mecha color green blue (undercoat), daler-rowney acrylic ink light green + matte medium (main) * hat: vallejo mecha color sand yellow, model color orange brown (underside) * white on pupils, face, body, tail: all sorts of experiments with vallejo model color sky grey, stencil, white, liquitex heavy body titanium white * belly star: vallejo model color flat yellow * mouth, cheeks details: vallejo model color red + white * pupils: vallejo model color black grey * helmet star: vallejo model color red * nippers: citadel runefang steel, vallejo model color flat blue * pin washes: vallejo mecha light grey, oiled earth, black washes * stand: vallejo model color dark sea green, sky grey (dry brush) * clear coats: vallejo mecha gloss (eyes, stand), satin, matte (white) varnishes",0,,

620508,"well that's not true. it's been known to happen... people have said that fph woke them up and made them realize that they need to take control of their own lives and lose the weight. people have also used it as a source of negative reinforcement. turns out, some people really do work harder to fix their problems when people are honest and actually tell them that they do indeed have a problem that needs fixed. i'd post links to these success stories but... banned  also, because i can. i'm entitled to my opinion. i shouldn't need any other explanation besides that. free speech, freedom of expression, whatever... reddit is not a site that is known for condoning censorship, and yet... here we are. the fact that so many redditors would support censorship is probably one of the bigger, saddest, side effects of this whole debacle.  but hey, if you want a personal reason... it's a combination of things. for instance, i'm tired of people telling me to ""eat a hamburger"", overweight coworkers constantly ragging on me because i ""never eat"", and people using descriptive terms like ""emaciated"" when my name comes up in print. by the way, i'm 5'9 and 125lbs. i also go to they gym. i bench 185 and have a six pack... so it's not like i really am emaciated. no, i'm just not obese and society has reached a point where there are so many fat people, that actual thin human beings are viewed as some sort of sick spectacle... like we're all starving to death or suffering from anorexia. why? because i don't eat an entire pound of beef, with cheese, and two slices of bacon to go with my extra large fries and a jumbo diet soda from a fast food restaurant that has been publicly outed for serving it's customers ""pink ooz""? but apparently it's perfectly fine for people to call me ""stick"" or ""twig"" all day... but fuck me sideways if i return the favor and call you ""fat"" right?  and that's really what gets me. i don't care that you call me a stick, i care that i can't call you a blimp. unlike you, i really am proud of my body so those words don't hurt my feelings. i wear ""stick"" like a badge of honor... thanks fatty, i worked hard at the gym to have this stick body. no, what pisses me off is that if i treat you like you treat me, i'm the monster... and since obesity is such a huge problem, there's far more hamplanets then there are twigs in the world so i can never defend myself. fph was the one fucking place where people understood my frustration.  but wait, there's more! how about the fact that this is a legitimate health issue. obesitiy is the second rated cause of preventable death in the nation, second only to tobacco. being fat is every bit as dangerous as smoking. but if you want to smoke, smoke... if you want to be fat, be fat... but when you try to convince the world that it's ok to be fat, i have a problem with that. it's not ok to be fat, it's dangerous, it's unhealthy. ""big is beautiful"" is propaganda... dangerous propaganda that sends a message to the uneducated that it's perfectly fine to be fat... when what we should be saying is, ""being fat will kill you"". plus size models on the cover of magazines... bragging about how great it is to finally be accepted. for what? what did you do that you think you belong on the cover of a magazine for? did you sit around and be a lazy slob while you stuffed your face full of 4000 caolories of junk food? yeah awesome... real glad we kicked the hard working athlete off the cover to show your disgusting lazy ass... all so you could sell the masses on a dangerous lie that there is nothing wrong with being obese in order to sell a few extra tabloids. what a crock of shit.  how about the hypocracy that ""big is beautiful"" -- but then no big person actually likes to be called ""big""? i thought it was beautiful, what's the problem? i mean... if fat is as wonderful as all the fat people claim it is, why do they care so much when people call them fat?   it's because fat isn't wonderful, and fat people know it too. but instead of facing their shame and fixing their problem, they just blame everybody else and want to the world to just never point out their flaws... because if they accepted responsability for their 'condition', they would be responsible for fixing it.  unlike being black or white, tall or short, male or female... fat is a choice. unless you can break the laws of physics, the only person you have to blame for being fat, is yourself.   maybe i'm tired of being squished in my seat on the bus because i'm jammed between two hambeasts. maybe i'm tired of squeezing past a family of fatties in the grocery store. maybe i'm tired of you fat bastards waddling down the side walk at like zero mils an hour.   maybe i think it's gross. you sweat a lot and you smell bad because of it. your skin is all flabby and fucked up from stretching, your folds are disgusting... your fingers are pudgy and your knuckles and elbows actually implode under the weight of all the access fat hanging off your body. i think over eating is gluttonous and rude and i think being obese is a sign of generally being a lazy, selfish, gluttonous piece of shit.  some people really do have medial conditions... but the vast majority of them do not. some are old or frail and can't work out... i get that... but a lot of you are just fucking lazy. you think i want to go to they gym tonight? fuck no... it sucks. it smells weird in there and it's exhausting. but i go... because unlike you, i'm not lazy. i'm proud i go, i'm proud of my work, i'm proud of my body... and if i did it, you can too, you just choose not to. and now you want me to feel bad for that? ha, good luck with that fatty.",1,-2,2

326641,"thanks for the time you took on this (and away from gaming, even!) and for the upvote. i agree with most of your points, actually, with some differing nuances for sure.   after reading what you've said, have you checked on who your actual candidate is? it doesn't look like it's obama, but i get the feeling that it might be one of the independents, rather than romney. if you haven't yet, someone around here (i mean /r/politics) suggested taking [this quiz](http://www.isidewith.com/presidential-election-quiz) a while back. some folks were pretty surprised. my boyfriend, who thought he was for obama, found out he was more compatible with jill stein. how he votes in the end, only he will know for sure, but whatever.   fyi, you made me look up the dream act. i never knew too much about it. in fact, a lot of what i know in several issues are not incredibly deep, but certainly much more than a simple statement or talking point here and there, and more than the average voter is willing to look up (repeatedly, if necessary, because i forget things). this is the most i've kept up with politics ever and really, i don't want to because i do not enjoy the circus acts, which have only increased in volume. it's exhausting.   anyway, let's see what we've got:  **immigration:** i've only read the [wikipedia article,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dream_act) so take what you will. i like what the dream act proposes, but i also get the idea that it's still not fully baked. i see what you mean about it being used as a political tool and don't doubt that, but at the same time, it's an election year in a country so entrenched in the absurd that any issue could be perceived as being used for political gain even when it's just day-to-day operations.   you're also right. this shouldn't have to be a presidential mandate. however, we have a congress that seems absolutely intent on accomplishing nothing so i don't think that's quite all that viable. the republicans in office are intent on obstruction, first and foremost, so the likelihood of even a *good* version passing is slim. if romney was president and we have the same people in congress, that likelihood jumps up, but i'm afraid that they will do so *too* eagerly and something half-baked will go through. the republican congress has really soured me against the party because of their practices and i am hoping against hope that the ones pushing so hard against doing anything productive get thrown out on their asses this election.  i'm a legal immigrant myself and have long been a citizen. i understand the criticisms and concerns. i, myself, am concerned on how we can treat the children of illegals strictly but fairly, while not screwing over the legals and should-have-been-legals-in-the-first-place. i don't know what romney would do here, either, but i'll get to more of that later.  **entitlement spending:** i totally agree with your view of the purpose of social welfare programs. i kind of do-- but don't quite -- understand what you mean about elements of the government vying for control of the common man's money. i also don't really see how romney would rein  in the spending to more reasonable levels (or what reasonable levels are, really). if his treatment of this resembles how he ran bain, then i think that your concerns about people paying themselves better will apply to the folks at the highest levels (congress, particularly) while the people who should be getting the assistance in the first place would be all but shut out of it. opportunities for upward mobility are hard enough, especially now, when recipients are willing to use the programs as intended -- to help them get a boost over that wall. such opportunities are much harder to look for and find when the recipient's primary concern is simply surviving.   **foreign policy:** i can see that obama won simply because we were tired of gwb. the bush years gave us a lot of trouble and everyone's been paying for it, not just in the u.s., but worldwide -- hard to avoid with how small the world has become. jon stewart said it a while back. he is very disappointed in obama, and frankly, so am i, not simply because he hasnâ€™t come through on his campaign promises, but more so because heâ€™s been too eager to accommodate. iâ€™m more than happy to work with opposition and figure out a middle ground. iâ€™m cool with the appeasing and taking the high road, to an extent. regarding the benghazi statement, i think it was an okay initial response. conservative, even. the way i see it, he did it more to address the death of americans in a foreign country more than anything else. that he didnâ€™t condemn libyans right off the bat turned out well, considering that we found out later that ten of them died to protect our guys. on the other hand, egyptâ€™s attacks on the embassy that same day should have been a bit more heavy-handed. ditto on a response regarding the movie that started it.   i also agree with you on how heâ€™s handled our pakistani doctor. all sorts of wrong there. this guy has risked everything to help our mission out and obama and whoever else is involved left him out to dry. \  at this point, though, i am *very* much concerned about romneyâ€™s ability to do anything regarding foreign policy. he might be buddies with israel, but they are not the only country we are allies with, and his behavior during his recent overseas tour has firmly put him in the â€œnopeâ€ category for me on this point. the man has enough trouble identifying with the different cultures within his own country. i donâ€™t want to let the man loose on the world again. as someone else pointed out in this thread, much of the subs in /r/politics hating on romney are libs or non-americans. non-americans donâ€™t even like the guy. his own peers are disappointed in him and many are voting for him simply because heâ€™s not obama (poor reason, imo. there are plenty of not obamas running) or they only vote along party lines (also a poor reason).   **business regulation:** ditto for everything you said, except the likelihood of creating good environments for small business happening under romney. both big party candidates are in the pocket of the banking and finance industry. i hate that, personally. iâ€™m quite upset that the bank bailouts went out half-assed and didnâ€™t have stipulations on what those monies could be spent on. just based on the candidatesâ€™ biggest contributors, though, romney has [the bigger share of the finance industryâ€™s support,]( http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=n00000286) where [obama has other  entities]( http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=n00009638) behind him. fickle as he is, i donâ€™t think romney would bite that hand by suddenly putting rules and restrictions on them. he may have lived in massachussetts, but heâ€™s no kennedy (disclaimer: yes, i know the mafia-kennedy connection is rumor-conspiracy theory).  **energy (or just science! in general):** indeed, more spending on this end. iâ€™ve never understood the fear of research and discovery trumpeted by the far right. we owe a lot of  advances we have today on government-funded research. space flight? public money. gps? government money. more recently, advanced prosthetics â€“ [funded by darpa.]( http://www.darpa.mil/our_work/dso/programs/revolutionizing_prosthetics.aspx)   the last one is somewhat near-and-dear because iâ€™m a veteran and iâ€™ve done some research on this due to my own interest in cybernetics. in any case, darpa has brought together various organizations, both private and public, to come up with a better prosthetic arm. these companies would not have done so on their own. government intervention has advanced arm prostheses more in the last 6 years than in the decades since the first world war. if i recall correctly, the whole deal cost $50 million (?). a pittance compared to how much we spend in afghanistan each week.   but yes, alternative energy, please. and no, the president doesnâ€™t have control over opec, so he/she/it is highly unlikely to have influence over current gas prices anyway, even if foreign relations were so good. people really need to stop putting all the blame on gas prices on the president's shoulders. besides, we only have so much oil.    regarding my comment about not knowing what romney would do on immigration: this illustrates the bulk of my problem with romney. the man hasnâ€™t even built his campaign on promises heâ€™ll break. he hasnâ€™t made much of a stance on *anything.* he hasnâ€™t articulated a solid plan beyond â€œiâ€™ll take care of it if you elect me.â€ iâ€™d much rather he take a strong stance against everything i believe in and be convicted in those stances than for him to present me an amorphous blob of the next four years of my life in this country under his watch. the man is also incredibly unlikeable, and like it or not, charm and social awareness is very important in the kind of position he is seeking. the position is a diplomat of diplomats and i have high doubts about his ability to perform in that capacity. my slippery slope assessment is that i donâ€™t want to lose our allies (read: europe and australia, for the moment) because the man is unable to identify with anyone who isnâ€™t exactly like him. we still hold a large portion of the global economy and if he screws that up, we'll have even larger unemployment numbers.  holy crap. fyi, 4 pages on ms word.

358824,"there are quite a lot of things that might affect it, you could have a lower metabolism than average people (the 10% factor in the frankenfield, 2003 study). it could also be that the rate of metabolic slowdown due to caloric restriction is higher than for other people. in the minnesota starvation experiment the slowdown varied from 10% up to 40% ([average was 25% after six months](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9734736)), this is in people who were already decently thin and they probably exceeded the 22 kcal/lb/day calories-from-fat-limit so their body slowed down the metabolism significantly.  non-rmr energy expenditure among people also varies, you have non-exercise activity thermogenesis (neat) that represent the energy your body expends doing wasteful movements, things like fidgeting and restlessness. when you restrict calories your body can adapt and reduce the amount of neat to preserve energy. somewhat mitigating the caloric restriction, good for survival when starving, not good when trying to lose weight.  you also have diet-induced thermogenesis (dit), the amount of energy your body expends processing food. protein has a higher dit (around 20%) while fat has a very low dit (a few percent), unprocessed food also has a higher dit (around 10%). so the type of food you eat modifies how much energy your body needs to expend to process it, with unprocessed food even temporarily lowering your metabolism:  &gt; average energy expenditure for the wf meal (137+/-14.1 kcal, 19.9% of meal energy) was significantly larger than for the pf meal (73.1+/-10.2 kcal, 10.7% of meal energy).  *barr sb, wright jc.* [""postprandial energy expenditure in whole-food and processed-food meals: implications for daily energy expenditure""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20613890) *food nutr res. 2010 jul 2;54. doi: 10.3402/fnr.v54i0.5144.*  so if you can handle the hunger you could try and stick to mostly unprocessed vegetables and meat for your calories (some people get hungrier when they cut their fat), make sure you get 35% protein or higher.  you also have the inaccuracy of measurement, unless you're using a food scale, and volume tools for liquids, you're probably underestimating your food intake. bbc has an interesting documentary called [""how to be slim""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssm1dwjmgem&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=pld8405be1865b93f4) where they measure the food intake/expenditure in two women, one says she eats a ton and still stay slim, the other says she eats nothing and still get fat. they measure the metabolic rate and food intake with dlw and it's shown that the reverse is true, it's a matter of how people percieve their intake. the obesity version of the [dunning-kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dunning-kruger), people suck at estimating their own intake:  &gt; some obese subjects repeatedly fail to lose weight even though they report restricting their caloric intake to less than 1200 kcal per day.  ...  &gt; group 1 consisted of nine women and one man with a history of diet resistance in whom we evaluated total energy expenditure and its main thermogenic components and actual energy intake for 14 days by indirect calorimetry and analysis of body composition.  ...  &gt; total energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate in the subjects with diet resistance (group 1) were within 5 percent of the predicted values for body composition  ...  &gt; in contrast, the subjects in group 1 underreported their actual food intake by an average (+/- sd) of 47 +/- 16 percent and overreported their physical activity by 51 +/- 75 percent. although the subjects in group 1 had no distinct psychopathologic characteristics, they perceived a genetic cause for their obesity, used thyroid medication at a high frequency, and described their eating behavior as relatively normal (all p &lt;

201875,"you don't start a revolution.  the revolution has already started.  you realize that the revolution is here and you join it by adding your own distinct strength and talents.    the last thing you should do is to expect most other people to follow.  a hallmark of a weak philosophy is that it requires normative consensus of the many to attain legitimacy.  if something is right, you don't need to proselytize to make it more right.  you don't need your friends and family to believe to assuage insecurities and bolster self-worth.  understand that the majority is always left trailing far in the wake of good progressive movements.  suffrage is universally accepted only when mlk lies dying outside a hotel.  you can't save the majority, especially if they're old, and you don't need to bring them into the light.  suffering and injustice will always be part of humanity.  sometimes things can't be the way they're not.   but you can always make the future a better place by planning far ahead.  we will lose many, many, battles. but forward thinkers will always triumph over those concerned only with short term gain.  any unsustainable way of living will collapse eventually.  be ready for the collapse.  if you hate materialism, you can fight it by not spending money.  if you cut up your plastic, debit and credit cards, you'll be amazed at how much you spend on crap.  if you start a week with a hundred bucks, you'll have a visceral feel for how quickly that money disappears in day-to-day life.    if you crave nature, get out there and experience it.  massive global climatic change is coming and few ecosystems will survive unscathed.  in centuries, maybe we'll be able to clone extinct plants and animals.  but appreciate the grandeur and beauty of nature now.  take many pictures.  when you're old, tell the youngsters stories of how beautiful our world was.  our exile from eden didn't happen way back when, it's happening now.  and if there was ever a time for noah's arc, it's now.  kevin bacon and the six degrees of separation hold the clue to our salvation.  think of how much you communicate, with how many people (internets included), and in how many different ways.  think of how much those people communicate with others.  think of how few interpersonal connections separate you from anyone else.  but with the huge number of people you know, interact with, and even pass on the street, think of how little a linear person-to-person message means.  especially when compared to the seething mass of thought and humanity that we all meet every day.    strengthen your connections with good people, and don't lose their lt e-mail addresses.  something is already afoot, and it's far bigger than any one brain can perceive.  any one brain has 300 trillion dendrites that hold information in their structure and store and reveal it with the flow of current.  all of our senses, sight, sound and touch especially, serve a much more important role than hunting and gathering.  the highest role of our senses is to allow our ""individual"" neural networks to interface with many others.  if you see someone dancing on the street, they're actually dancing in a rain of current within your own brain.  this is how a dance is not just a dance and a song is not just a song, art is not just art, and a book is not just a book.  this is how all of these distinct neural networks become a dynamically connected neural network of 1800*10^21 dendrites.   we're not individuals anymore.  if any one of us is put in solitary confinement for a month, we'll hallucinate and go crazy.  this is because the human mind hasn't evolved to function on it's own.  unfortunately, it has evolved to function in a closely-knit tribe that strengthens neural connections through constant social reinforcement.  tribes are making their last stand against the bulwark of the larger collective of brains.  chiefly, tribes decry corrupting outside influences, and affirm the importance of adhering to tribal thoughts and values to maintain purity.  tribes try to isolate themselves in some way from the rest of humanity to form a neural bubble within the larger human noosphere.  communicate with the different tribes freely, liberally, and honestly.  but understand that no tribe is an alpha in modern society.  we're all already here, and **it's on.**  take cues from those around you to learn how you can best contribute to the formation of a distant, better, future.",0,,

269101,"hi, me again... i try to do  my best here. feedback are welcomed     vivian looked like a matchstick with that thin, slender, tall body with dark hair and pale skin. holding that huge backpack on the shore.Â    knock, knock.... she was concerned about the interdimensional exchange project. just imagine yourself going to a world with a strange moon and populated by a creature that looks like something straight out of an rpg game.Â    ""h-hi... i'm vivian from the land school of agronomy... ""err"" she shut up as she noticed the large female figure with blond hair and curved horns adorned with cow ears. she was 6.4 feet tall, wide, thick, and, oh, so big and round. ""very thin... sits on the table,"" the figure spoke.Â    she dragged vivian along like a rag doll. the human girl fell onto the big table. she was surrounded by the other girls. all were huge, some more chubby, some more muscular and lean, but all with big, huge breasts, bigger than her head.Â    ""drink,"" a pink-haired one said, placing a large glass, almost the size of a small bucket, in front of vivian. she, with a nervous smile, sniffed... it was milk... it tasted so sweet and she felt her whole body heat up.   dear dan, i say if i don't know if i'll survive here... jokes. i mean, everything is so weird. the girls here are welcoming. although liana, the eldest, is a little too direct. still, it's interesting to live with cowgirls... the first day on the job almost broke me. she wrote and sent the letter.   vivian wiped the sweat off after another day of work. in the first week, her body was used to working, but there was always something to do when she sat down.Â    ""moo... vivian...do you have a boyfriend?"" asked the pink-haired cowgirl. helen was the fattest but the most milk-producing of the girls.Â    ""um...yes... yes, it's dan,"" she explained. ""and he's happy about it?"" helen asked, pointing to vivian's flat chest, which made her blush. ""hurr... er...very clear,"" she said back. he'd always liked her, but he'd never mentioned that this was his favorite part.Â    the cowgirl pulled her head in a brotherly hug... ""moo..."" oh thanks helen, you're a friend, but what?"" she asked, confused as she noticed the pink-haired girl with her breast out. the cowgirl pulled her head to her breasts, forcing vivian to milk her mouth almost like a calf.   well, dan i don't know if i'll really survive. girls are a little...er...well...clingy... i think it's their instinct. anyway, i keep studying and working hard... and now the work has gotten even harder with the ""milking."" anyway, i've been here for a month now and i need new clothes. i think the humid weather is shrinking mine. vivian wrote and laid down.Â    it was a fact that those clothes were shrinking and getting tighter, even tighter around her chest. anyway, tomorrow was shopping day.Â    vivian and the cowgirls got out of the pickup. she had never imagined such a large mall filled with strange creatures.succubus underwear stores, which made her blush. elven dresses and necklaces made by lamias. liana accompanied her, carrying the heavy groceries as if they were nothing.Â    ""helen said she had a boyfriend... uh... did she ever have kids with him?"" the huge cowgirl asked, making her blush. liana and i had become close friends, but she was still straight as an arrow.Â    ""err... i don't know, we're too young...to think about it...but i already wanted to have a family,"" vivian says, almost cringing. it was true that she rarely thought about such matters, but now living with the cowgirls, it didn't seem so strange. in that culture, it was common to have as many children as possible and to see it as a sign of honor. sometimes she wondered if she would make a good mother.Â    vivian felt her little body being pulled by liana's strong hand that threw her against the wall. ""l-liana..."" she protested, but the gigantic blonde had extracted her breasts in vain.""mama,"" she ordered, making vivian want to hide her face and look around. despite that, no one in the mall wants to take a second look and make it look like a normal scene.Â    with nothing to do, vivian obeyed. biting and pulling the nipples hard until you feel your mouth fill with milk and leak out the corner. her body warmed and she felt strong and comfortable in liana's arms.Â    with nothing to do, vivian obeyed. biting and pulling the nipples hard until you feel your mouth fill with milk and leak out the corner. her body warmed and she felt strong and comfortable in liana's arms.   well, dan, it's been so long. i can't wait to see you again. i'm even afraid you won't recognize me. i mean, almost two years here with them and i can say that i'm part of the family. hehe... i can even talk now.except for the horns, tail, and ears. i'm one of them. work is as usual, but everyone insists that i eat six times a day. i think i gained a few pounds. my bra broke a few days ago and apparently no one here wears these... so please bring some! vivian wrote.   dan got off the bus. and he stood looking at the strange beings walking down the street. this was more like an anime or rpg game. he's been distracted by bumping into some lamias and succubus.Â    ""s-sorry,"" he said, even stopping and looking at the big cowgirl in front of him. ""b-big... s-sorry,""   Â ""dan?"" she asked as he nodded and simply felt the steel grip tug at his arm. he tried to struggle but soon felt her body being thrown over her shoulder as he was carried like a sack of flour.Â    ""vivian told me to bring you here,"" the blonde cowgirl said as she placed him on the floor and turned around.   dammit vivian. is that what you had to raise? i hope she's okay. he picked up the suitcase that had fallen open while he picked up the pieces of clothing. he picked up the bra he'd brought for vivian and said, ""well, i hope size d will fit.""Â    she said she had gained a few extra pounds. well, he didn't have a problem with a fleshy girl. dan felt an almost steely grip on his shoulder...that cow.Â    ""look here..."" (er..gulp...) ""vivian?"" he spoke in a weak voice.Â    t-wasn't that possible, vivian? the long, black-haired figure was her sister, vivian. ""who else would be silly?"" she says she gave him a tight hug that almost made dan feel his bones were broken. she said she'd gained a few pounds, but not all of them. that body... the lean biceps. he could feel her hard stomach under the coveralls she wore.Â    she didn't joke when she said she was almost a cowgirl. she was already tall, but now her field of vision was straight to huge, round and full... her breasts. they almost jumped out, being squeezed by the straps of the jumpsuit she was wearing.Â    ""let's go...i want to introduce you to the farm,"" she said, pulling him with ease. they walked through fields, stables, and so on. the working cowgirls said hello, but he couldn't take his eyes off of that once scrawny, slender figure, now a complete hourglass of flesh, fat, muscle, and sexyness.Â    and this is where i milk."" she explained   Â ""the...milking manually?"" he asked, still staring at her breasts. his hand went to the bag, and i removed the bra and held it in front of vivian, who laughed... of course that wouldn't fit her. but still she smiles and lowers the straps, revealing her huge pale pink nipples, and prepares to put on her bra...Â    ""oops,"" she says with a naughty smile.",1,2,-1

207704,"i bought online, some spall-blocker coated  (prevent spalling/riccochets from the plates causing injury) level iii rifle resistant steel plates (rated for several hits of intermediate and full-power rifle calibers before failure, but *not* rated against specifically armor-piercing .308 or larger calibers with penetrator cores/tips, which would require level iv protection, nor rated for a small handful of very fast and light but less common 5.56 loadings at close ranges such as the m-193 5.56 that was standard issue in vietnam) and a cheap low-profile plate carrier to put them in. i bought each of the plates and the carrier separately as i saved the money for each component, and in total i think it cost me about $200, $60 for the plate carrier and $70 for each of the plates. i tried buying from surplus stores rather than online (since i'd have preferred to pay cash) but none of them in my area had any armor components in stock.   as far as armor is concerned, there's a few major factors. the lightest weight armor (soft kevlar) is the most flexible and comfortable to wear, but typically will not offer protection from rifles, or if it does it will only protect from weaker/slower calibers. while getting shot even in hard armor still feels like getting clubbed with a baseball bat, the blunt force damage while wearing soft armor will be worse as the kevlar catches the bullet but doesn't do as much to disperse blunt force trauma, so you can expect broken ribs or even minor internal bleeding if you get hit with something near the limit of what your soft armor is rated for. kevlar also degrades as it ages, so buying used will mean a weaker vest. it can get pretty expensive to go new though, and a used vest is better than nothing, especially if you mainly want protection from pistol rounds. soft armor also tends to cover a larger portion of your torso because it is more flexible and doesn't have to be reduced in size to allow for mobility.   armored steel plates (mild steel will not work, so if you make these yourself or something make sure it's ar500 steel or some other high-strength highly abrasion-resistant rated steel) in a carrier as i have is probably your best bang for the buck, but it comes with disadvantages. steel has the highest risk of spalling/fragmenting/riccocheting bullets causing injury, so having them wrapped in kevlar sheets or coated with a spallblocker (basically a heavy paint similar to bedliner for trucks) is a must. steel is also the heaviest option by far, with 10""x12"" level iii plates weighing about 8 pounds each, so your armor will at minimum weigh 16 pounds without even including the weight of the plate carrier itself or any side panels in addition to front/back. for me as a physically fit and very large-statured person that's not a huge issue, but i definitely feel it and would be slowed down by it when running or doing anything active. that is where more modern ceramic-kevlar composite armor shines, in that it is about half the weight of steel armor that gives the same level of protection.   ceramic plates are the modern standard, and what the us military and other western armed forces use. however, while lighter and therefore more comfortable than steel, and also less likely to cause fragmenting/riccochet than steel, there are some major disadvantages. first, they are thicker and bulkier, which can be undesireable in some circumstances. secondly, they are not as durable as steel, usually only rated for 1-4 hits before they lose some or all of their protective capability. further, the edges of the plates are somewhat fragile, and significant blunt impact to the edge of a ceramic plate can cause damage that makes it less effective. the biggest downside is cost, with even the cheapest ones being $150-200 per plate and many being double those prices, which isn't ideal for a product that has less durability and may need to be replaced more often than steel armor.   there is of course the new up and coming option of polymer plates that are somewhere between level iii and level iiia rated (can stop multiple hits of most common rifle calibers, not rated for all 5.56 but will stop many of the more common bullet types so long as there is no  steel core such as the m-855, so a little weaker than my level iii steel plates) and have the advantage of little to no splatter/riccochet potential, as well as both lighter and more durable than ceramic plates, but they cost $350-$400 per plate and are a little sensitive to extreme temperatures.   one last note: be careful where you wear armor, and what you do while you're wearing it. armor is prohibited to civilians in some locations so research all relevant federal and more importantly state and local laws (since the local laws vary a lot more) and remember that wearing armor during the commission of a felony (not that i endorse or suggest you commit a felony, this is just something worth knowing) is an additional felony, so be sure to keep your nose clean when armored.",0,,

he was terrible with the bears as an ot.  so far, he's been solid inside.    rt was supposed to be 3rd year player menelik watson, but on [this play](http://gfycat.com/lawfularidbagworm) he ruptured his achilles and is done for the season.  in comes one of the major fa acquistions from 2014 : austin howard.  he's played poorly last year at rg and now he's plugged in as the starter... maybe.  this game may be most important among the starters for howard.  he still has to show he can be the starter.  in the wings are (theoretically) worse options like khalif barnes and matt mccants.    ---  **some gfy sets**  a few gfy sets of cooper, mack, and mario from the cardinals game.   **amari cooper isos**  * [gfy](http://gfycat.com/unitedmixedferret) * [gfy](http://gfycat.com/frankgrizzleditaliangreyhound) * [gfy](http://gfycat.com/excitableklutzyhypacrosaurus) * [gfy](http://gfycat.com/plumpapprehensivecollardlizard) * [gfy](http://gfycat.com/needymajesticclingfish) * [gfy](http://gfycat.com/waterloggedraggedicelandicsheepdog)  ---  **khalil mack preseason week 3 highlight reel**  **pass rush**  | # |  tv | replay | replay 2 | | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | | 1 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/jauntyactivecoqui) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/tautshabbyirrawaddydolphin) |  | | 2 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/cheerfultiredkilldeer) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/smugmadeupdegus) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/untriedrashchrysomelid) | | 3 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/conventionalachingconure) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/elegantforkedimago) |  | | 4 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/relievedchubbyduckbillplatypus) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/equatorialgiganticjaguarundi) |  | | 5 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/ultimateallamericanblackvulture) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/soggydiligentiberianmidwifetoad) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/deadlyshallowboar) | | 6 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/splendidliquidamericanlobster) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/longelegantantelopegroundsquirrel) |  | | 7 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/scalyflatchihuahua) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/sandyremoteasianlion) |  | | 8 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/jampackedfarduck) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/hauntingdimpledbear) |  | | 9 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/anothermarvelousanteater) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/oddballfasthatchetfish) |  |   **run defense**  | # |  tv | replay | replay 2 | | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | | 1 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/lastingweakbluejay) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/obedientnaturalcentipede) |  | | 2 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/gloriousmiserlyenglishsetter) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/secondsoulfularrowana) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/nastyflawlesscanadagoose) | | 3 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/thinshowyeelelephant) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/kindalarmedanemonecrab) |  | | 4 |  [gfy](http://gfycat.com/sizzlinggreedyirishredandwhitesetter) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/frenchsparklingaustraliancurlew) | [gfy](http://gfycat.com/formalbriefiraniangroundjay) |  ---  **mario edwards jr**  * [sack v dj humphries](http://gfycat.com/pastellegitimatecatfish) * [replay](http://gfycat.com/givingcarelessgavial) * [power v veldheer](http://gfycat.com/heavyearlyadamsstaghornedbeetle) * [a little dip move v veldheer](http://gfycat.com/sanewhirlwindhen) * [a club counter for the sack v veldheer](http://gfycat.com/unacceptablejollygelding)",0,,

563779,"the girl with the flower tied to her back was called **amber.**  she rode a speckled grey mare through the forests of grain, the flower's white petals lapping at her shoulder with every stride. dirt furrows rose and fell like foothills, and the forest of grain never changed-  until amber's head was nearly lopped off by a scythe.   her horse loosed a whinny, and reared up. together they toppled down a furrow, sledding through the dry dirt. when the cloud of dust cleared, amber looked up to see her mother staring down at her.  ""i'm sorry, little one. i did not see you,"" mother's voice was deep and smooth, like the howling of the wind, only filled with warmth, ""where did you come from?""  the first thing amber did, after she got to her feet, was touch her back to see if the flower was still there. the body-length stem still dragged between her legs, and the soft, white petals - each as tall as her leg - still drooped over her shoulder, and tapping against her chest.  amber sighed, and thought about how much happier she would be if she were older, and taller, just like her mother.  ""i was foraging in the old garden mother. for *him*.""  ""you should not go there, little one,"" mother clucked, almost absent-mindedly. she was looking over the trees of grain. amber could only imagine what the top of the forest looked like.  ""oh,"" her mother said, recognition and revelation crinkling her eyebrows and turning her expression stern, ""you should not see *him,* little one. he is far too dangerous.""  ""it's important, mother.""  ""you met him once, was that not enough?"" but before the question had left her mouth, amber's mother knew the answer.  her lips pinched together, and she sighed through her nose. with the scythe resting on her shoulder, she looked down at amber, ""i saw him walk into the mountains, a time ago.""  as the horse hooves beat against the dirt, pulling her away from the forest of grain, amber heard the hissing *swish* of her mother's scythe descend again. and again. until it faded with the wind.   in the foothills, she drank from a well. she watered her horse, too, and tied a pouch of grain around his snout to eat. amber looked up to the mountains, soaring, a bruised violet rising to a cone of glistening white. she was weak from the ride, and the flower weighed heavy across her back. the ropes were beginning to dig into her stomach and ribs.  when the ground began to shake, she did not hide. an uncle, a head taller than her mother, trundled up the foothills, water sloshing from his boots. there were puddles the size of ponds in his wake. he had a net behind him, bursting with fish - some large enough to swallow amber whole, and still be hungry.  ""amber? is that you?"" her uncle leaned down at the waist, his massive head blotting out the sun. his voice beat the air around her until she felt as if she were standing inside of a drum.  amber cupped her hands to her mouth, and shouted, ""i'm here, uncle.""  ""would you be so kind as to pour your old uncle a drop? these old bones are not as spry as they once were...""  amber hoisted the largest bucket down the well. when she tried to pull it up, she had to enlist her uncle's help. he pinched the rope between two fingers, and together they pulled. she carried the bucket between her arms, teetering and splashing it all over herself.   ""thank you,"" her uncle boomed, before downing the whole bucket in two gulps.  as a gift, he gave her a fish from his net - a small one.   when he walked away, reeking of dead fish, he left more ponds in his footsteps. in one of these ponds, amber saw a glimmering object. a shell must have dropped from his bag, one so large she would have to hold it in two hands. it was a long spiraling shell, with a hole on either end, and it was perfect for her needs.  she fastened the shell to her horse's bridle, and after she ate, they began to climb.   the mountains lifted her, step by tedious step, above the world, and amber wondered if this was what it felt like to be old. snow patched the ground, like a forgotten quilt eaten by age and generations of moths.  she found a place to stop, a place where she could reach out and grab a fistful of wispy cloud. she waited, chewing on fish bones, until the mountains began to shudder.  ***goom - ooom - ooom...***  echoing footstep carved through the ravines, and a reckless energy coursed through the clouds. she could feel it lifting the tiny hairs on her arms and neck.   ***goom - ooom - ooom - ooom....***  he was close now.   she saw the backs of his hands first. the house she lived in was twice as long as mother's bed, and amber had no trouble believing those hands could pick up her house, and fling it over the mountains.  amber took out her shell. she pressed the smaller end to her lips, and directed the wider end at him. and she blew.  *fweeeeee-* it was a pathetic sound, reedy and slender as a stalk of grain.   but it did the trick.  ""is... someone... there?"" a voice, cynical with years of age and crushed expectations, shook down from the clouds.   amber sucked in all the air she could, and blew again - *fweeee!*  a great, shaggy, wizened head, with wrinkles as deep as valleys, and strands of grey hair as long as rivers, sunk below the clouds. the old man put his hands on his legs, and began his long descent into a crouch.   once more, amber blew, and this time he spotted her.  he smiled, ancient stone monuments rising from his gums, stained yellow by silt.   ""amber..."" he breathed, and the wind whipped back her hair.  ""grandfather!"" she shrieked, and his smile only widened.  ""but you were only... a microscopic thing... when i last saw you. now... you are as big... as a bug! it's been... so long... since i have seen you...""  his lips drooped, and a mist spread across his eyes, glazing them with an emotion she could not quite understand.  ""...so long... since i have seen... *anyone.*""  ""i brought you something grandfather!"" her voice was a squeak in the wind.  grandfather frowned, ""what's... that?""  he put a hand on the mountain, to steady himself, the quakes nearly bringing amber to her knees. he kneeled, an ear-splitting groan rushing out of him like wind from the bellows. his bones creaked, each *crack* sending out a shock wave of sound.  his ear pressed against the side of the mountain, and in it, she could see a whole different world. hairs as tall as the grain forest, pores large enough to swallow her hole, and a black, winding cavern so large, she could build a small town in it.   ""grandfather,"" amber shouted, ""i brought you something from the old garden. they said these were the flowers your mother planted, when you were still small.""  grandfather's great, shaggy head dislodged from the side of the mountain, sending an avalanche of stones to pour down below her.   amber unlashed the flower from her back, and planted it's stem firmly in the ground. she held it up by hugging the stem with both arms.  as slow and gentle as the tide, he lifted his hand, and plucked the flower from her embrace.  ""i just wanted you to know that you aren't forgotten. happy birthday, grandfather.""  ""it's... just as small... as i remember...""  his smile could have bridged the ocean.   ""forgive me... a moment... i must do..."" grandfather's knees sounded like dynamite when he stood up. his head lifted above the clouds, and at first she thought she was hearing thunder.  peels of laughter rumbled the mountain side, and it began to rain.  ***  *edit: thank you /u/232c for the fastest gilding i've ever had!*",0,,

262809,"sorry that this response is going to be long.  i have some general thoughts, some personal experience, and some speculation.  *general thoughts:*  \- this is an age where a lot of people gain weight.  the freshman 15 isn't something that happens to everyone, but it has a name because it is quite common (and weight gain for people who don't go to college happens too).  a mix of the adolescent metabolism slowing down, changing routines as you leave high school making it easy to end up in a more gaining lifestyle, and being out of the hot-house of social pressure of high school all play a roll  \- a lot of people also gain some weight with relationships.  society has taught us all that thinner is better and that if you want a boyfriend/girlfriend you should be as thin as you can.  also when we spend most of our time with same sex peer groups who have that same focus, it can make keeping your weight down seem really important.  then you get in a relationship and first of all, you are in a relationship so that pressure is off a bit, but also you spend more time with your partner and enjoying life together becomes more important and not being a larger size than your friend seems less important  \- the last two years of pandemic lock down has seen a lot of people gain weight.  the number of quite plump young adults i see out and about, wearing cute and stylish clothes, is higher than ever before.  between leaving high school farther behind (so shifting to a more adult context, where more people are heavier anyway) and the changes of the last couple of years, her reference group is probably significantly chubbier than it was when you first met, or even when you first had this conversation (and it can take time for that change in reference group to seep through into what you think of as normal)  \- have you had any influence on her weight gain?  almost certainly.  because you like related things (like eating together), and because you probably don't push contrary activities as much (at a guess you are less likely to want to go on a grueling weekend long mountain hike), and because she knows it is ok with you if she gains some so she's more apt to go along with this lifestyle and not to push herself to do whatever it takes to stay thin.  but that doesn't mean she is doing it because of your kink, more that knowing about your kink gives her some permission, and the sorts of things that interest you influence your collective activities.    *personal experience.*  i started dating my wife when she was 19.  she wasn't as tiny as your gf was, but at 5'6.6"" and 145 pounds i could see her ribs and her hip bones stuck out (she was, and is, all hip and thigh).  i didn't even really fully understand what i liked back then, but i did let her know that i had no particular attraction to thin, that the visible bones were not really my preference, and that i didn't have any particular upper limit on size so long as she was active and healthy.  she gained slowly and steadily from there for a number of years.  we got married four years later and she was around 210-215 pounds.  and what was amazing was that other than the occasional ass making a comment, and that (at that time) her size had pushed her into plus size stores, she really didn't feel much different.  she didn't feel fat, she knew she looked good, she knew i was crazy about her.  she hadn't gained deliberately, she just hadn't worried as much about it, and getting older, changes in lifestyle and enjoying life with me did their thing.  the next year she hit 225, and that was the point where she began to feel fat and like she'd gotten bigger than she was comfortable with, but it took another year and another 10-15 pounds before she got serious about doing something about it, and at that she didn't make it quite back to her marriage weight.  she's bounced around that post marriage weight range for most of the years since (there was a brief period of really high stress over a decade later where she did get back close to 200, but even she knew it wasn't a good weight loss).  and in that weight range she regularly walks and cycles (yesterday she cycled over an hour to get to work and the same back home again, and she does that a couple of times a week in good weather).    just one illustration of how the stereotypes of being fat and the lived reality can be very different.  *speculation*  i wouldn't make too big a deal of it, but when she makes those ""babe, i'm getting fat"" comments i think she would like confirmation that you have noticed and that you love it.  basically to me this sounds like her admission that it is happening, that she is letting it happen, and btw you'd better be loving it.  i wouldn't go full fetish on her, but just something like ""compared to how skinny you were when we met, yah you are, and in all the right places, thank you, and yes i'm loving it!  but i don't think anyone would think you are fat in society in general.  i'm pretty sure you below the average for women, no matter how big you feel compared to what was normal for the younger you.""  basically confirm that you appreciate what she has let happen, that she is in no way 'fat', but that you know it has been a big change for her and could be rough.  (i called this section speculation because i'm speculating that this is what she needs to hear).  i'd guess that she is discovering that although she's a size that she would have thought of as fat a couple of years ago, that she doesn't feel all that different, and that she even enjoys the fuller curves.  accepting that can be a gradual process, but what you said about the larger meals and her comments really suggests to me that she's in the process of accepting that this change has been ok, that she doesn't have to panic and lose it, and that she doesn't even need to stop it.  but, she might start feeling out of control, or fatter than she is comfortable with, if she gains too quickly.  so hot as it would be to see her start gaining faster and faster and abandoning all control, in reality i'll guess that might backfire.  feeling out of control and out of touch with your body is scary stuff!  so while she may still be gaining and seems happy to eat more, i'd suggest not pushing it too hard.    in fact, for the summer maybe make an effort to suggest some extra outdoor activities that are not so food related, and at most ask if she wants a snack after.  like go play mini-golf, or throw a frisbee in the park, or go dancing at a club, or whatever.  helping her move more helps her get used to her newer body and normalize it as her new baseline, it is also a great way to spend time together, and it shows that you are not always going to obsess about food (also thicker curves in motion are just \*heart eyes\* !)  then come autumn, sit back a bit more and see what happens with her appetite and stuff, maybe enabling it a bit more again.  and finally, yah i'd guess that you also gaining has made her more comfortable with her own gain.  she doesn't feel like the 'fat one' in the couple, and if she likes the extra weight on you it is harder to complain about it on herself too.  but again i wouldn't push it too fast, if you start getting bigger than her current comfort zone for you it may also start making her feel fatter and you could get the dreaded ""we should go on a diet"" talk!",1,2,
920373,"well, if you look at the formula for bmi it is really just a density calculation. so muscle mass, which weighs quite a bit more than fat, is factored in. as is bone and other bits. it's just that the calculations assume a ""typical"" distribution of each. so the higher the number goes then, obviously, most of that extra mass has to be fat!    um, right. okay, first off look at the variations in body shapes. bean pole narrow people and people who are built like a tank. there is more to the differences in their body weight than just how muscular or fat they are. some people really do have a thicker set of bones and some people have genetic quirks to carry denser muscles here and there. so, if you spend just a few seconds thinking about it, there are enough body shape variations that a bmi calculation assuming they are ""average"" is going to give some weird results. even if they are overweight, there are different types of overweight. people who carry all their extra weight around the stomach (apple shape) generally experience more health problems associated with weight than people who carry it more evenly distributed. so not all ""overweight"" is equal nor does it carry similar health risks for everyone. in fact, in some cases being mildly overweight seems to carry some health benefits in some instances. still, that's ignoring your point. sorry, went off on a tangent.  you're right in that very muscular people (or people with a mix of muscle and fat) can have screwed up bmis because, hey! muscle is a lot heavier than fat. like 20% heavier if i remember correctly. also a lot of elderly women who are actually overweight can have perfectly normal bmi. why? the reverse. a lot of post menopausal women start to develop osteoporosis. their bones are losing mass and as their body loses muscle the heavier bits get shaved off.   so bmi can really lead to some really, really misleading impressions. why does it stick around? two reasons. one, it's not designed for individuals. every time a doctor or anyone else calculates your individual bmi he or she is, technically speaking, using the tool incorrectly. it's a statistical tool. it's meant to calculate the weight distribution of a population. as a statistical tool it's not that bad because all its little flaws start to cancel out fairly quickly, as more and more people are added the more that ""typical"" body type becomes the norm. for individuals? it's hard to tell if you are a ""typical"" type or one of the many variations. so the numbers may run a little high or a little low for you. depending. it may get you in the general area of which group you belong to, but may not lock you in perfectly. the second reason? because it's easy to calculate.  as you can guess, the second is the biggie.  if all that wasn't bad enough, some people are starting to question if ethnicity matters in bmi.   when people came up with bmi calculations they did so using populations that were predominantly white. it actually took awhile for people to start looking at the data and again and to notice that a lot of people who are from asia have a different distribution of fat in their bodies. remember, it's a density calculation. if fat isn't all packing in like you expect then it throws the numbers off. how much so?  well, while a bmi of 25 or below is consider ""normal"" for white people, for many asian ethnic groups it's been suggested the number should be 22.   so, when people are reporting ""healthier"" bmis from different countries they may actually be using a metric that isn't appropriate. so people from china, korea, vietnam, or japan, for example, might have a larger obesity problem than people realize because their bmi distribution would naturally follow a different pattern than countries with a larger european population.  the point is that how they obtain the numbers for the statistics and what considerations they make can vastly alter the numbers. assumptions can also be factored in that can really distort the data. how so?  i was reading this study by a man called dr. phil edwards where he linked obesity to climate change. really. [here](http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/5457/) is the publication. if you read through it, though, he makes some rather curious assumptions.  first of all, he assumes that people who are obese drive large cars like suvs and get a lot of their food from the drive thru while thinner people drive fuel efficient vehicles and avoid the drive thru. weirder still, he seems to be pointedly ignoring places like china which have a lower average bmi but a high rate of pollution and focuses more on comparing less industrialized countries to places like the usa and saying ""see? more green house gases and more obesity.""  well, yeah. if the population isn't starving and has access to food they are going to have more heavy people. it's almost like he's pointedly ignoring the fact he is comparing how industrialized a society is to their green house gases.  anyway, he seemed to really be trying to link the fact that the usa has a higher bmi to vietnam and higher greenhouse emissions to the fact that the usa is a bunch of fatties sitting idling in their suvs at the drive thru at mcdonalds rather than thinking ""maybe the fact that they are caucasian, have more industry, larger cities, a more developed infrastructure, and are quite a bit larger in land area to begin with might have something to do with it.""  nah. it's obesity.",1,-1,

(soon youâ€™ll be tossing out the clothes that are too big for you.) plain is best for your waistline. when it comes to chips, ice cream, frozen desserts or yogurt and pretty much all foods, the more plain the flavor, the lower the calories. stick with original or plain as much as you can to shave significant calories. eat your fruit fresh, not dried. snack on 10 grapes instead of a mini box of raisins and youâ€™ll save yourself 100 calories. when you eat, eat. donâ€™t read, watch tv or do anything else. being mindful of what youâ€™re eating and how full you fill will help teach you better hunger management skills. find a healthy social network. if your friends, colleagues or family sabotage your weight loss efforts, seek out healthy communities online like this website and our facebook page. look for social media outlets where you can connect with dietitians who specialize in weight loss. find your â€œthinspiration.â€ iâ€™m always motivated by sports and athletic goals and i keep â€œboardsâ€ on pinterest with fit, healthy womenâ€™s bodies that provide me the inspiration i need to kick my butt in the gym most days of the week. reflect on why you want to lose excess body fat and the payoffs youâ€™ll get from the process of making healthier choices over unhealthy options. do you have a significant anniversary coming up, a major birthday? whatever it is, find something to help kick-start your healthier habits. be a dogâ€™s best friend. youâ€™ll burn about 6.5 calories per minute of walking your dog. thatâ€™s 100 calories for a 15-minute walk. if you donâ€™t have one, walk with a friend or on  your own. add a salad before lunch.  new research shows that a large salad before a meal saves 125 calories for that meal.  add a salad to every lunch and lose 12 pounds in a year! eat, then go food shopping. think of todayâ€™s supermarkets and specialty markets as goodie factories with samples galore. eat before shopping so you can avoid the temptation of tasting the samples.  it will also help you from bringing home indulgent items. donâ€™t drown your salad in dressing.  swap your regular bottled dressing for fat-free and save over 100 calories per two-tablespoon serving. or, make your own dressing with less olive oil an more vinegar an spices.  spritz it onto your salad to cut calories further. go for baked or popped snack chips instead of fried.  each 2-ounce nosh will save you 100 calories. skip the dip or lighten it up.  instead of having guacamole with your favorite chips try salsa.  youâ€™ll save over 100 calories per 1/4 cup. order a virgin (mixed drink, that is).   a virgin cocktail will save you about 100 calories since the distilled spirits pack in 100 calories per  1 1/2-ounce shot of distilled spirits. substitute two bottles of low-carb or light beers for regular and youâ€™ll save 100 calories. skip the cheese on your sandwich or next burger.  an ounce of cheese packs in 100 calories. have a whole wheat english muffin or 2 slices of whole wheat toast instead of a bagel for breakfast. youâ€™ll save over 150 calories. try skinnier adult beverages. having wine, champagne, beer or spirits with non-calorie beverages can save over 100 calories compared to fancy mixed drinks like margaritas or mojitos. choose the best licks.  skip super-premium ice cream and have a frozen fruit juice bar. during the day, make sure you get up and move. have a little face-time with a colleague instead of constantly emailing  take a walk at lunch or mid-afternoon to blow off some steam and reboot. replenish your glass of regular soda with diet soda, water or seltzer and youâ€™ll save 100 calories for eight ounces. nuts are nutritious, but high in calories.  eat about 15 fewer mixed nuts than normal to shave off 100 calories. eliminate the bread basket when eating out.  youâ€™ll save over 100 calories per roll. eat protein-rich snacks. research shows that they help fill us up so weâ€™re less likely to overeat later.  keep snacks to about 150 calories. nix post-dinner noshes.  physiologically, the body doesnâ€™t need additional energy after your evening meal to go to bed. order half a deli sandwich instead of a whole one. most deli sandwiches pack in over 500 calories, which is too much for lunch.  eat half the sandwich and a piece of fruit instead of the other half and save yourself 200 calories. enjoy a lettuce â€œpocketâ€ sandwich.  have a sandwich wrapped in bibb or leaf lettuce instead of pita to save over 150 calories. broth bests cream-based soups any day.  make the swap and youâ€™ll shave more than 100 calories a cup. swap one serving of vegetables (1 cup raw or 1/2 cup cooked) for just one serving of carbs (such as 1/2 cup of cooked pasta or rice or the handful of pretzels) twice daily,  youâ€™ll save over 100 calories per day. replicate the myplate guidelines when eating by making sure 1/2 your plate coming from fruits and veggies, 1/4 from lean protein and 1/4 from quality grains (like whole grains). keep all treats like chocolates, chips or hard candy tucked far away in hard-to-reach places. research shows that when treats are kept further away and you canâ€™t see them, you wonâ€™t eat as much of them.    â€“julie upton, ms, rd, cssd",1,-1,

195067,"tl;dr: fatty got skinny fat, got the freshman 45, lost it and then started lifting. relatives are celestial bodies and this sub helps me cope.  ex-chubster. my story is a bit interesting because i went from a very skinny toddler/infant, to chubs, to skinny fat, to fatter chubs, to fitty.   so, i used to be one of those little kids that didn't like eating and were overactive. from age 6 onwards, i started to gain weight. my obese father bought me food as an excuse to buy even more for himself, or ate treats my thin mother got for me/for herself. i have never disliked veggies or fruit, and i had a strong preference for lean meats and whatnot. but i also loved sweets and junk foods too much and i had some seriously distorted views on food. i ballooned up to a bmi of 25 and stood there. doctors told me to just maintain my weight and that i would slim down with puberty but all that happened is that my fat redistributed to more womanly proportions. during these years, i engaged in diverse athletic activities and enjoyed it, but i kept eating like a lardass so nothing really changed.   when i was 16 years old i started ballooning up again. really quickly. these jeans that used to be a full size or more too big on me (probably the biggest or second biggest piece of clothing i own) were now tight. i must have gained about 15 lbs in less than a month. that freaked me out real bad and i decided i was tired of being fat. through calorie counting, ""healthy"" eating (way too much carbs, too little fat and protein, but okay-ish), barbie weights and too much cardio 2x/week i slimmed down to 108-110 lbs @ 5'3''. i have a medium frame and i'm also pear-shaped, so it was pretty skinny on me. the skinniest i have ever been was 105, during two different occassions in which i ate almost nothing for a week (one during vacations, the other because of the worst stomach bug ever.) that didn't look good on me.  eventually i started to balloon up again. i was having stressful times and instead of identifying the sources of my overeating, i just did more cardio. i didn't go to the gym more often, i just started doing two hours of cardio every time then hit the barbie weights. eventually i quitted the gym to exercise at home and save money. college started and the freshmen 45 hit me like a bag of bricks. i got lazy and gained all of it back.... and some more considering i had liss-obliterated my way through my muscle mass. *duh.* hindsight is 20/20, folks.   fast forward 3 years. that's how much it took me to get in the mindset of getting my shit together. in another 6-7 months, i lost the weight and got down to 114. i was exercising more and doing less cardio, but otherwise i did it pretty much the same way i did it the first time around. however, when i got to my goal weight, i saw the light of the iron path, ditched my cardio obsession, dropped the barbie weights and started pumping some real fuckin' metal (also figuratively because i'm a metalhead tee^hee^^heeeee). i mostly maintained my weight through 2013, or rather i went down to 112-113 and got in the best shape of my life. i only sometimes do cardio but i lift like my life counted on it. i still have huge issues with emotional overeating, and i fight them every day the best way i can. but i kid you not, lifting saved my life. it taught me discipline, it gives me a sense of purpose - i eat and sleep well because when i do not, i feel it in my squats, bench and especially my deads and i hate mediocre workouts. i stopped caring about the minute imperfections of my body and started enjoying the muscle gains i've seen (and the compliments they get me! :d). i look a lot better now than i did one year ago and i'm way leaner and better proportioned at 112-114 than i was at 105-108. many times i think about quitting or getting lazy and eating junk and i just need to remember the joy of lifting to put down the icecream cake. i take the time to plan my meals, nothing too fancy (fit or not, i'm still lazy, guys) but it does the job and i feel awesome.  why do i come here? well, it helps me identify my own fatlogic and battle with it every single day because i do not want to ever, ever, lose myself to complacency again. i will strive to be the best version of myself, mind, body and soul - fitness is just the foundation. also, i am very much against oppressed speshul snowflake syndrome and the way it leads to so many people to never assume responsibility for the actions - i do not want to be this way. i've got issues and i'll fix them, i don't need society to cater to my ~~fat~~ fit ass. and finally, because my parents and family are very much fatlogicians of the first caliber, so i can vent and rant about the added challenges i face thanks to them. i have told many mini-stories about my father in comments, some here might remember them....",1,-1,

588483,"so... i just discovered there's a character limit when i exceeded it by 5000+. i'm going to save the long version and just post the abbreviated version for now.  in my sf setting there are 14 indigenes*. the term 'indigene' is used in place of 'alien' because almost every case it's humans who are showing up at their planet rather than the other way around. the fourteen indigenes are, in order of their gaining access to space flight:  **humans**: [fermi's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fermi_paradox) resolved.  **vrrild**: the superficially, the vrrild resemble [brittle stars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:ophiurehaeckel_ophiothrix_fragilis.jpg), though they have seven arms rather than five. their skin is covered in simple eyes. they reproduce asexually, but intraspecies [horizontal gene transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horizontal_gene_transfer) is also common.  **crend hwaata**: xenoarthropods. they have six major body segments (generically called head, neck, torso, abdomen, hips, tail) which alternate between a hard exoskeleton and a more pliable exoskeleton. their torso and hip segments have two pairs of segmented limbs. they have three natural castes, each divided into two subcastes, and one artificial caste. the three natural castes are breeders (female queens and male kings), laborers (female workers and male warriors), and the foragers (female gatherers and male hunters, though there's little sexual dimorphism between these two, unlike the other two castes). from largest to smallest they are the queens, the warriors, the workers, the hunters, the gatherers, the kings.   the last caste, the ambassadors, were genetically engineered to have a human-like body plan. they stand upright and one set of torso-limbs is greatly reduced. they were made in hopes that a less alien-looking representative would facilitate peace between the two space-faring civilizations. it took humanity a while to get over the whole uncanny valley aspect of the ambassadors before they were really able to do their job.  **vielk**: the vielk are a mystery. the only ones ever encountered are completely synthetic, resembling robotic squid with their 3-meter tall torpedo-shaped bodies and ring of tentacles around the base. some have suggested that they are not an indigene that shed its biological body for a robotic one, but actually a race of sapient von neuman machines sent out ahead of the human colonization front.  **srad**: one of the chief allies of the vielk, the srad come in two forms. the sapient srad is a gigantic calcified sphere, up to three hundred meters in diameter. within is housed a massive brain, a few essential supporting organs, and little else. the bulk of the space is used to house lesser, non-sapient srad, which float through the atmosphere like jellies in the ocean. these the sapient srad produces and commands with chemical signals, to serve has its senses and its hands in the world.  **calcora**: the other indigene ally of the vielk, the calcora resemble an ancient near-avian dinosaur. however, while they have an axial endoskeleton, they have an appendicular exoskeleton. their head, while bird-like in profile, lacks a true jaw but bears spider-like fangs to inject digestive fluids into their food which are siphoned up later. their five eyes are clustered on a bulb in the center of their heads. their long tails are actually part of their respiratory system. they walk on two segmented legs and have numerous small segmented arms. their vast wings more closely resemble that of a pterosaur than either an insect's or a bird's.  **""pickans""**: humans and 'pickans' have only had indirect contact, as 'pickans' live on the other side of vielk-control space. they are known to be xenovertebrates, though their forelimbs are bifurcrated and their tails are part of their digestive system. they put on in mind of reptilian antelope, with their lithe  quadrupedal bodies and prominent horns. but their heads are otherwise massive and elephantine, possessing two beaked probosces. their eight eyes are arranged into two diamond-shaped clusters.  **qabayol**: the qabayol are also xenovertebrates and, in fact, have many feature that have evolved in convergence with earth's mammals. physically, their body plan resembles the mythical centaur as they are hexapods which walk on four legs. their heads are long, with fringed nostrils, six eyes, and a single large ear at the back of the skull. all qabayol begin life as females, but in the absence of a male, older females will metamorphosize into males.  **huulsh**: the huulsh are another xenoarthropod, having segmented bodies and segmented limbs. at birth, the nymphs have five body segments: head, thorax, and three abdomen segments. only the upper part of the head is covered by the exoskeleton. the lower part is fleshy, more like a slug than the millipede-like creature one might expect. indeed they have slug-like eye stalks, and rather than have mandibles they grind their food against their hard palette with an equally tough tongue. each segment there after possesses three limbs; with those of the thorax being substantially longer than the others. as the huulsh grows, more segments are added to the abdomen, and in time, it has enough to balance itself while holding its thorax  in a more upright position, freeing the first set of limbs to serve as arms; this marks the huulsh's entrance into adulthood. the huulsh are exceptionally long lived and grow throughout their lives. eventually they become so massive they cannot hold themselves upright. these venerable elders are generally held in high regard, even as they crawl like infants. the huulsh are true hermaphrodites, and generally both partners will lay eggs after sex. however, elders often have more fixed gender roles and in huulsh societies where emulation of elders is paramount, younger huulsh are also encouraged to adopt pick a sexual identity early in their lives.  **idadev**: the idadevs have low-slung, limbless bodies. their triangular heads point forwards, with a mass of tendrils at the front and two large black eyes on either side. their necks are short and bodies plump. they cling to seaside cliffs with innumerable ventral tendrils, and use these to slowly crawl to their destination. their long tails end in a great hoop lined with a net-like array of digestive tissue. when the winds are right, they unfurl great wings and glide over the seas, using their net-tails to scoop up the fish analogues that swim below. when discovered by humans, they also used primitive stone tools to pry shellfish-like creatures from the rocks and break them open, as well as to make war about their fellow idadev.  **the blight**: humans had known about the blight for thousands of years before they realized it was sapient. on its homeworld, the blight is a xenofungal organism that infects a wide diversity of native life, usually attaching itself to its host's nervous system. in time, a mutation allowed the blight to jump to earth-based life, causing hallucinations, paranoia, and out-of-body experiences for its new hosts--quite unlike the benign symbiote that lived within the native life. it was soon determined that the blight was the 'brain' behind an ecosystem-wide sapience and the symptoms of the infection were its first awkward attempts to communicate with humanity. strains of the blight that would better integrate with earth-based life were developed, as well as for other indigene groups upon request. this proved to be a great benefit to the idadev. the blight can command the creatures that it infects and gains knowledge from their senses, but with sapient creatures it can only do so with their consent unless they are unusually suggestible.   **barometz**: the barometz come in two forms. the form familiar to most people resemble gibbons--if gibbons had wetsuit-like skin and squids for heads. when discovered by humans, they inhabited the canopy of their well-forested homeworld and had just begun to experiment with basic metallurgy. these are the haploid barometz. the diploid form of the barometz is a gigantic tree-like organism. when two haploid barometz mate, the female produces a seed which grows into a diploid tree-barometz. the tree-barometz asexually produces haploid gibbon-barometz in womb-like 'fruit.' such is the lifecycle of all land-based life on their homeworld.  **komori**: like the qabayol, the komori are hexapodal xenovertebrates. visually, they put one in mind of bone-thin dragons, flying on immense bat-like wings. their heads resemble the skulls of the extinct [protoceratops](http://eesc.columbia.edu/courses/v1001/images/protocera_skull.gif), except that they have no eyes. the bony frill is analogous to an external ear and funnels sounds so that the komori might better find its prey in its near lightless world. the komori homeworld is tidally locked around a cool red dwarf. a thick atmosphere and dense clouds spread heat around the world relatively evenly, but block most light.   as for the fourteenth indigene, they're 'newly discovered'--in other words, i haven't really pinned down the details of them. i'm leaning toward a parasite like stargate's goa'uld.  *when capitalized, indigene refers to sapient indigenes. otherwise, 'indigene' sort of acts like a taxanomic level above domain, referring to all life originating from a single planet's evolutionary heritage. so humans are the indigene from earth, but earth's indigene includes all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, including those species that have evolved off earth once humans started spreading the earth indigene around the galaxy.",0,,

165806,"**review: #332-341**  these were tasted side-by-side because thatâ€™s how i like to drink.  i did this review in four separate tastings. 1st round consisted of 3 separate, random groupings all tasted semi-blind. the second round consisted of the top performers from the first three groups taste semi-blind against each other.   thanks to /u/crackandwhistle /u/shooterflatch  and /u/rev_lijah for the samples.   i tossed in a 2016 orvw and a 7-year age-stated version from 2010 for kicks. before each 1st round tasting i warmed up with a pour of owa from a normal 2016 bottle and kept that handy to revisit against the others. i rate the standard 2016 a **83/84** straddling the line between â€œprice dependant quality pourâ€ and â€œless interested due to some minor detracting characteristics.â€  ---  **group #1**  **#1**  **nose:** noticeable upgrade in richness from the standard. caramel apples and baking spice. soft oak.   **palate:** creamy vanilla. drying oak and a nice spice blend on the back.  **finish:** good combo of sweet, wood and spicy for a medium finish.  **strengths:** tastes richer, more complex and older than standard.   **rough spots:** while more complex than the standard itâ€™s still a pretty straight forward pour without any exceptional notes.  **score: 86**/100  **reveal:** [chuckâ€™s](/spoiler)  **#2**  **nose:** richest of the group. chocolate. big oak up front. complex spice â€“ more a grilling spice than baking spice. light, red fruit â€“ which is similar to the candied cherry notes i get in various bt products. winner.  **palate:** wow. thick. complex. very rewarding. fruit up front, apples and berries. caramel. nice oak and spice. flavors are very defined and complimentary.   **finish:** medium with some drying oak and lingering spice. resets the palate nicely.  **strengths:** flavors really pop and itâ€™s chewy and complex.  **rough spots:** no complaints.  **score: 90**/100  **reveal:** [big red 9yr. ncf](/spoiler)  **#3**  **nose:** weaker. less rich. oak. spice. caramel. on par with standard.   **palate:** thin. red fruit. baking spice. vanilla frosting. (this tastes more like my memory of owa than the standard pour iâ€™m using as a control)  **finish:** sweet and adds some nutty notes.   **strengths:** better than the standard and hits all the standard notes, but does it better.  **rough spots:** if i wasnâ€™t drinking it next to the standard, iâ€™d probably say itâ€™s about the same, even though sbs itâ€™s definitely a step up.  **score: 85**/100  **reveal:** [z   &amp;  z](/spoiler) 	 **#4**  **nose:** smells the youngest and weakest of the bunch. mostly crisp red fruit notes. less interesting than the standard.   **palate:** creamy. salted caramel. more of a dessert pour. palate lifts a little with apples and spice. some younger notes emerge on the backend.  **finish:** boldest and spiciest finish. stays the right side of hot.  **strengths:** palate was better than the standard. finish was too.  **rough spots:** nose was a miss. finish was ok. tastes the youngest.  **score: 85**/100  **reveal:** [in fine spirits](/spoiler)  ---  **group 2**  **#5**  **nose:** very rich. woody. spicy. less fruit and sweets.  **palate:** quick red fruits. complex spice and strong oak.   **finish:** shorter, spicy and a little earthy.  **strengths:** rich. well aged pour. nice, complex spice. unique profile.  **rough spots:** finish is a little light. itâ€™s definitely a wood and spice bomb missing some of the sweeter and fruit notes that usually balance these out, but i like whatâ€™s here.  **score: 87**/100  **reveal:** [wlv #078](/spoiler)  **#6**  **nose:** slightly less rich than #5. but more complexity. apples. baking spice. biggest oak note of the three. what i wish the standard was. the oak is really nice in place of some grainy, young notes on the backend of the standard.   **palate:** this is really nice. vanilla frosting. baking spice. spiced cherries. pleasant oak in background.  **finish:** chocolate. spice. oak. long and warm. the spiced cherry note resurfaces and lingers. top notch.

**finish:** more of the same. short, sweet and fruity. some rougher young notes surface  **strengths:** caramel/fruit bomb thatâ€™s crushable. a step up from standard.  **rough spots:** least complex so far and some young notes.   **score: 85**/100  **reveal:** [liquor barn #26](/spoiler)  ---  **group #3**  **#8**  **nose:** apples. caramel. baking spice. much richer than standard and smells older, big oak. great.  **palate:** a little thinner than some but still good clarity on flavors. burt sugars. apples. oak. leans oak heavy.  **finish:** thin and a touch astringent.   **strengths:** tastes older than the standard. nice nose and some rich, clear notes.  **rough spots:** thinness and bitter wood on the backend knocked it down a point or two. it also sacrifices some complexity for the oak notes.  **score: 86**/100  **reveal:** [fountainhead 10 yr.](/spoiler)  **#9**  **nose:** faint dusty notes. almost malty and buttery. earthy, vegetal note reminiscent of some pre-fire heaven

spicy.  **strengths:** deep. complex. satisfying. bingo.  **rough spots:** i could nitpick that the profile is slightly muddled with flavors over lapping at times rather than progressing or evolving (which i sometimes get with older profiles). but it really doesnâ€™t matter. the overall effect is still fantastic.  **score: 91**/100  **reveal:** [owa 7 yr. 2010](/spoiler)  **#10**  **nose:** big oak and spice. chocolate. deep and rich. nice.  **palate:** here the notes are very defined and complex. vanilla frosting. baking spice. spiced cherries. big, round oak. this is the profile i look for with these cranked up a couple notches.   **finish:** caramel and earthy spice for a long, even well executed finish.  **strengths:** in terms of â€œon profileâ€ store picks this one does everything i expect, but better. oak is prominent, but better integrated than #8.  **rough spots:** no real complaints.  **score: 88**/100  **reveal:** [abc  florida](/spoiler)  ---  **winnersâ€™ circle round-up and final thoughts**  i did another semi-blind round with the top 4 scoring pours from the first three rounds. the 2010 owa 7 yr. may as well have not been semi-blind cuz it was a totally different profile, easy to pick out, and my favorite pour again in the **90-91** range. itâ€™s just a profile you canâ€™t find in current releases (owa or otherwise) and i happen to like that profile. havenâ€™t had any other owa from the age-stated era so i donâ€™t have anything to compare it to, but i liked this. the big red was a close runner-up with a **90**. the richness and complexity was a step above anything else. next up was the 2016 orvw staying at an **89**. it was really good, just a hair behind the big red in terms of mouthfeel, richness and complexity. big red bested it in all 3 categories. but the orvw bested all the other store picks in all three categories. the abc ended a point lower than last time at **87**. tough competition here. still really like it, and it checked all the boxes for what i expect from the standard profile, but wasnâ€™t quite up to the level of the others in the last round.  at the end of the day, the average owa store pick is a decent buy at $30, but canâ€™t compete with some of my other favorite store picks/sibs â€“ four roses private selections, saos bourbon, russellâ€™s reserve sib, and 11+ yr. knob creek sib.   **scoring**   **100-90:** truly memorable for all the right reasons   (~10% of total reviews)  **89-87:** hits all the right notes with one or two exceptional ones   (~15%)  **86-84:** quality standard pour if priced accordingly

894986,"i disagree with almost everything in the article; i don't even know where to start.  the first thing that really jumped out at me is the way he talks about fat actors.  &gt;in comedy, fat guys from chris farley to kevin james haven't been venerated in spite of their huskiness -- their humor has been seen as more valuable because of their size  no, it hasn't, being fat doesn't add any inherent value. they are funny because they use their size to their advantage. we laugh **at** them as often as we laugh with them. it's called physical comedy! not every fat person/comic is funny. some people don't know how to use it, and some people are just gross -- farley wore his weight well. kind of like roseanne barr. oh yeah, forgot about her, huh? a successful, fat, female comedian.  &gt;same thing in the drama genre: from john goodman to james gandolfini, male girth is seen as either innocuous or beneficial.  again, it's about how they use their weight. gandolfini plays a stereotype, and goodman usually plays droopy, doofy, slow and/or pitiful guys. goodman, however, has the benefit of height, allowing him to branch out a bit more. he doesn't look morbidly obese, he just looks like a fridge.  that's another problem i have with the article; conflating being overweight with obesity. if you're not over 25% body fat, you're not obese.  &gt;similarly, in big-time sports, our male superheroes are often super-fat. harvard university, for instance, found that 55 percent of major league baseball players are overweight  yep, here it is, just what i was waiting for. overweight means you weigh more than you should for your height.  quoth the cdc:  &gt;it is important to remember that although bmi correlates with the amount of body fat, bmi does not directly measure body fat. as a result, some people, such as athletes, may have a bmi that identifies them as overweight even though they do not have excess body fat  http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/defining.html  here's a bit about that harvard study about mlb players  &gt;using the body mass index formula, the study found 32% of players were overweight before 1880, and that the number jumped to 46.5% for 1940-50. for 2000-06, the figure escalated to more than 55%. the study also found that power hitters were more than twice as likely as other players to be overweight.  http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/03/halftime-baseball-has-never-been-fatter/1  so, ignoring the idea that the study is basically meaningless for using bmi, take note of the fact that the power hitters are the ones more likely to be overweight.  &gt;the university of north carolina found that 56 percent of national football league players are obese.  in other words, linemen. there is a correlation here: their weight makes them more effective at their sport. they're not being admired for their weight but for their performance. the sentiment behind this article is fallacious.  &gt;in fact, so powerful is this double standard that america barely flinched when the morbidly obese limbaugh  limbaugh is not morbidly obese, he has a bmi (as far as i've found) of &lt;35. that's just regular obese (though barely). he also recently (well, in 2009) began dieting. oh, he's also a radio host, and his career is primarily about people listening to him and not looking at him.  so then, one might wonder why weight watchers is only now introducing advertising marketed towards men. the answer, however, is not a conspiracy, the answer is there was no money in it. obesity is not celebrated, it's largely shunned, except in special circumstances. targeting advertising to men is a response to the fact that the market is expanding (har), as more and more people are meeting the criteria.  to be fair, despite the exaggerations and made up factoids, the author is hitting on something. it is more acceptable for a man to be fat than for a woman; it's just that no one is praising fatness.  society has been patriarchal for a long time, and men were almost always the powerful people; being fat was a sign of power and wealth, and to a certain degree a sign of health. however, obesity has almost always been looked down on, as a sign of greed, gluttony, and unattractiveness. on the other hand, being skinny used to be an insult as well; there were tons of products designed for weight gain, for example http://i.imgur.com/jomcv.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/0y4da.jpg . the truth is that up until recently, the standards for beauty have always been in similar ranges for both men and women.  if you take a close look you'll see where women suddenly began to diverge from men in terms of what people aspire to: the rise of the supermodel. fashion was always about clothing, never about the models. the models were supposed to be tall and extremely skinny, in essence, they were supposed to be walking coat hangars. in the real world, these people were considered ugly and awkward, but in modeling they were invisible, there only to allow the clothes to drape over them so they could be properly displayed. then, in attempt to bring the fashion industry more into the mainstream, supermodels were created in order to make things more relatable. when you combine the concept of a fashion model with an art model, toss in millions of dollars, and add in massive promotion, you end up with a celebrity worshiped by society.  here is where it gets interesting though. you see, the primary audience of supermodels is women. the celebrity status of supermodels transformed what was basically an advertising spokesperson into a role model. women adopted this standard of beauty, and the media rolled with it. however, throughout all this, what men considered as beauty remained largely unchanged. men still preferred women with ""curves"", and tall skinny girls who would make perfect models still were made fun of for their appearance. fat people, male and female alike, still get looked down on and made fun of. it is only the rare exception that is able to escape from that stigma and shine.  as obesity rates rise, however, you will probably be seeing more fat celebrities, due in large part to something else that the author failed to take into account: people like celebrities they can relate to. it makes a person feel like they could be famous too, or that the celebrity shares a kind of kinship with them. since men are often more comfortable with being heavy, fat male celebrities are more relatable on the whole. fat women, however, are less likely to be comfortable with their weight, and as such do not like fat female celebrities as much.  the media plays a large role in our social outlook, but in the end it is nothing more than a means to make money. they respond to what people want, and if women have a particular look in their heads, it's what will be fed to them. when you take all of the history and all of the data and look at them objectively, you can clearly see that the biggest issue stems itself from the overall desires of female culture as a whole.  and the good news is that, hey, this has already been recognized. people, and especially women, are beginning to rebel against the unnaturally skinny, airbrushed images of 'perfection' they've been gobbling up all these years. buying products that forgo airbrushing and use more normal looking models, and refusing to participate in the established culture of sterile manufactured ""beauty"" is how things will change. attacking and trying to remove the imaginary privilege of fat men will accomplish nothing.",1,-1,

837024,"an exchange i had on tumblr yesterday that i wanted to share here and get some thoughts on. i've marked everyone with a consistent letter, but keep in mind that reblogs exist independently, effectively on different chains, but all share the same replies. will edit for commentary later if i have the time  ---- op i see people on the internet get lectured absolutely all the time about how being overweight shortens your life expectancy but never, ever by how much, which is only thought to be an average of a year or two, and i especially never, ever see anyone get the same lecture for being underweight, which shortens lifespan by an average of three years. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/3/e000940 both are negligible considering all the other things in someone's day to day life that affect lifespan but if you care so much about one extreme you should at least pretend to care about the other or you look pretty stupid.  reply a: ""they know what theyâ€™re doing, [op], it was never about the health factor itself. just an excuse""  me: @a  por que ne los dos  me: @op that sample size seems to be relying on japanese people, who do not often reach the levels of obesity that americans suffer from. and mentions higher medical expenditure due to more issues! far from ideal. also, one of these things is also a much bigger problem that too many people are resigned to or in denial of, trying to pretend itâ€™s solely cosmetic and that youâ€™re awful if you find obesity unattractive or decry its negative effects  reblog b: @op thatâ€™s cause they donâ€™t actually care about fat peopleâ€™s health, they just want an excuse to be shitty to people that they deem beneath them. it was 100 percent never about health.  reblog c: @b 100% never about health. i went from fat to skinny via a serious struggle with anorexia and depression.  lots of unprompted compliments. most of who also asked me how did you lose so much weight?! and i always flatly replied with some answer about how i was too poor to eat and didnâ€™t deserve it anyways. no one ever once cared that iâ€™d admitted to starving myself 40lbs lighter. because hey.. now i was thin and thatâ€™s better than being alive i guess  reblog b: @c sorry you had to go through that. my aunt lost a ton of weight once and one of her idiot friends at a party told her, â€œwelcome to the land of the living!â€ as if she were dead before. a fucking un-person. it was devastating for her to hear that, to know that thatâ€™s what her friend thought of her when she was fat. she was the same person, only thinner, but now all of a sudden she was deemed worthy of being treated with dignity. that kind of shit fucks people up. sheâ€™s since (surprise surprise!) gained most of the weight back. people like the idiot in the notes like to stomp their little feet and cry about how bad and horrible being fat is while never addressing how incredibly difficult to nearly impossible it is to lose weight permanently. why the fuck should we spend our whole lives hating ourselves if, for most of us, weâ€™re gonna be fat the whole time? why doesnâ€™t the medical system focus on keeping us as healthy as possible even if we canâ€™t lose weight? is it because they find us disgusting and sad and want to punish us for our perceived transgressions? cause it sure fucking feels like it.  reply b: @me please donâ€™t pretend that you give a shit about our health lmfao  me: @b if i didnâ€™t, the facts are still true. it doesnâ€™t matter. if someone wanted me to eat my vegetables because they believed i was inherently sinful and evil and it would purge me, i would still eat my vegetables. because itâ€™s still good for me.  b: @me genuine question why the fuck do thin people assume we donâ€™t know weâ€™re fat or that we want to hear health advice from them  a: @b iâ€™d just ignore them, they had like a vitriolic meltdown upon first seeing this post and kept deleting replies till they had made one that sounded the most â€œconcernedâ€ lmao  me: @b â€œgenuine questionâ€ tends to proceed rhetorical ones made in bad faith. but here, iâ€™ll give a genuine answer. because people like you keep denying itâ€™s a problem, or trying to make it out to be a social justice issue, attack people for not thinking youâ€™re attractive, or outright understate the negative effects. plus americans tend to underestimate how overweight they are. this is something that really upsets me so donâ€™t come at me with thinking you know me.  me: @a itâ€™s called â€˜not being able to edit your comments and thinking of more things to say, or fixing a typoâ€™ like yeah, iâ€™m upset, this is something iâ€™m sensitive to, but fuck off.  b: @me fat people donâ€™t care that you donâ€™t want to fuck us, youâ€™re not that important sweetie  b: @me lmfao go cry about it bitch  me: (a replaced comment that seems to have appeared seconds after the last reply, messing up the chronology a tad) @b good, then? is that supposed to be an indictment? iâ€™d love it if you were telling the truth. iâ€™m done here, it seems as if you are trying to upset me further, given how you donâ€™t have any real rebuttals, and i am not interested in hearing them. iâ€™m gonna go touch grass again.  b: @me literally getting your feelings hurt when iâ€™m the one who lives in a fat body and has had to deal with condescending thin people my whole adult life who assume iâ€™m an idiot that doesnâ€™t know iâ€™m fat or that being fat can cause health problems, literally go get hit by a bus.  b: @a skinny people venmo me 50 bucks challenge  reply d: @me i would recommend listening to episode of maintence phase â€œis being fat bad for you?â€ because they discuss a study with much larger, broader sample that finds pretty the same findings. also, if you think there arenâ€™t *enough* people who think being fat is unhealthy for them then you have a pretty narrow perspective. â€œyour gonna die if you get fat!â€ has been international health policy for several decades and it hasnâ€™t resulted in any countryâ€™s getting thinner. if some one is fat, itâ€™s not because they had a lack of pressure to lose weight.  me: @d interesting, a real response from someone who isnâ€™t a bully. maybe iâ€™ll listen to that sometime, but no promises. point is the counterculture, attacks, and supression really gets on my nerves, as demonstrated here.  a: @me i mean, my apologies if that is all it was, my friend,but given your other comments it was really easy to interpret it in bad faith. iâ€™d really suggest reading the stories in the retweets and reevaluating why you think this way about other human beings rather than to argue against others own lived experiences.  b: @me my god you just donâ€™t fucking listen do you  me: @a retweets? what? we must be looking at different reblogs. i dislike how tumblr shows you the same replies on all reblogs. anyway, just uh, assume good faith instead? we could really do with more.  reply f: @op in my experience, people are a lot more likely to criticize you for being underweight in private irl. it usually amounts to them assuming youre on a diet or have an eating disorder and when i was at my thinnest i got told to stop eating so many salads by a teacher while i was eating a cup noodle in front of her lol  reply g @op my childhood next door neighborâ€™s granddaughter just died at 38, possibly from a heart attack, while at home. sometimes being overweight can, indeed, cause issues. but of course being underweight can also lead to dying very young. thereâ€™s sad stories about famous people dying from starving themselves. i just donâ€™t know anyone irl on that particular extreme. i do know several people who are overweight and have serious health issues. â€¦underweight might be scarier, though  reply h: @me lol i love how [me] deleted all of their comments but can just tell by the comments address to them they are a huge pos and wrong.  d: @g the thing about weight and health is that while there are correlations with higher mortality at the very upper end of fatness, we donâ€™t have a causal relationship established. we also know that theyâ€™re more likely to put off seeing a doctor and theyâ€™re more likely to try a risky weight loss plan. all fat people are different and there are a lot of reasons a fat person could suffer an early heart attack that are not a direct result of their weight.  me: @h no? you probably just have me blocked, which makes sense given the judgemental behavior you are displaying with only one side of the story. i may delete here and there because i thought of a better way to say something, but like, itâ€™s all still there.   reblog e: @op if you wanna know about more and life expectancy in general or other things that correlate more strongly to mortality than weight may i recommend this episode of maintenence phase. their whole schtick is debunking junk health science and looking at what the stats actually mean.  reblog f: @op  the great norton juster on his 90th birthday. clearly a man who enjoyed a nosh. he died the next year at 91â€“ how much longer does one of these life-expectancy advocates think would he have lived if he had been thinner? 20 more years? 30? could we one day crack the code for a body weight percentage that, if carefully maintained, will let you live forever?",1,-1,

(natural skinniness looks great imo, i'm just not built that way and i felt it was the only standard i was held to, which seemed unfair when i was young. now i know better and would have appreciated what i had and would have told them all to suck it, but alas, hindsight is 20/20).",1,0,-1

677299,"let's look at these one at a time, shall we?  &gt; the love of curves on women is undeniably widespread.  no it's not. different people like different stuff. but even people who like *curves* like just that, *curves*. this is to be distinguished from *curve*, which is what obese people have.  &gt; only with intense brainwashing have people managed to make themselves believe *this article*  ftfy  * softness  &gt; one of the things people most dislike about the skinny figure is the bony figure. it's hard and fragile at the same time ... curves soft, touchable ... muscles can make up for some of this but they're not really a substitute to those who love that beautiful tender flesh that only curves gives you.  what bothers me about this is that there are only two options given. and for the record, i think the woman in the picture is pretty cute, and if that's what they mean by curves, i agree. but to assume the only alternative is anorexic-level thinness is just an epic straw man. i don't like twigs either. but, and correct me if i'm wrong, people who are against fat logic aren't looking at the difference between thin and fat. they're looking at the difference between healthy and unhealthy. the author mostly sticks to fat vs. ultra thin because health is not an area in which they can hope to win. healthy would be a woman with muscle and a little fat, who can get off the couch without winding herself and leaving a sweat imprint behind. a healthy woman who is thinner overall but has more muscle and a little fat is still soft and curvy in all the right places, so this point is irrelevant.   * contrasts  &gt; things that attract you to somebody are often features you don't have yourself. men are rarely curvy the way women are  yes, unless they continue to exhibit no will-power for long enough to enter the obese category. at this point curves --&gt; curve and the natural differences between the sexes start to disappear.  &gt; the particular way that women's bodies gain weight will come across as a sign of femininity  no, the more weight involved, the less true this statement is.  * there's more of her  &gt; it's naturally good to have more of somebody you love  it's naturally good to want somebody you love to be *healthy* and both weight extremes are unhealthy, whether super thin or obese. if you love somebody, you probably prioritize their health over the supposed potential of more grabbable curves.  &gt; you can squeeze her passionately and not worry about breaking her ribs  seriously, continuing to build this straw man of epic proportions. it's not like fat women are fat because they've gained bone density. come on, now.  * eating out is actually fun  &gt; dining is great pleasure ... food in abundance ... pleasure to watch women enjoying her food  this is funny because there's basically a rule in hollywood that you don't show people actually eating things because watching people eat is *not* pleasurable. watching an obese person enjoy food is doubly sad because you know the weight gained from that meal will last much longer than the pleasure of eating it.  &gt; ...shadow of guilt, obsessive calorie counting, ruthless dieting regimes ... far below their normal body weight...  this is the same haes shit that we see all day. and honestly, no amount of arguing about it will convince anyone. if we really want to be helpful in our community, what we need to do is get in shape. all of us. and help others get in shape. and tell our stories. that's really the only way. we can say until we're blue in the face that losing weight isn't impossible but we'll accomplish much more with individual success stories. so let's not argue this one. let's just prove it wrong in our own lives, every day.  * biology  &gt; curves are a sign of health while extreme underweight is a sign of bad health.  this is true. *curves* (not *curve*) is definitely a sign of healthy weight, and extreme underweight is usually a sign of bad health.   &gt; we have it in our genes to seek out partners who are likely able to raise our offspring successfully  this is assuming it isn't crushed in utero by surrounding fat until it either dies or decides ""fuck this, i'll take my chances on the outside"" and comes out premature, which happens all too often in the case of pregnant obese mothers.  * maturity  &gt; obsession with slimness is connected to the obsession with youth. youth is clearly attractive but not when they start looking like they've not even hit puberty... curves...  i don't even.   &gt; timeless aesthetic beauty of the curvy physique  i guess my main problem with this is that the *curvy physique* this article is talking about isn't going to be attained by anyone who thinks this is a good article. if that picture in the beginning is the type of woman the article is referring to, then i must agree that those types of curves are attractive  but if you buy into the defeatist attitude this article promotes, there's no way you're going to look like that.   as an aside, someone skilled with photoshop needs to take the d in that ""diverse hearts"" logo and add in a fat woman with the right curve of the d matching up with her belly.",1,-1,
953452,"my retic gets 2-3x the food my boas do.  when i was raising her up, she was getting meals anywhere from 15-30% of her weight, and weekly.  it was *of her own accord* that she started taking smaller meals, and i didn't start her on a 2 week schedule until she was eating 1 lb rats and rabbits.  the 1 lb rabbits leave a large lumpy bulge in her that doesn't dissipate for 4-5 days, so i really don't think she needs to be eating anything bigger for awhile.  i recently moved out of a house with such bad air quality it had to be condemned, and i feel that may have contributed to her recent fall in growth rate, i expected her to be at least 11' by now, based on her historic growth rate up to that point.  during the time i lived there, she was having trouble shedding, losing weight, and not growing.  all her fecals came up negative for parasites.  now that she's been out of there for a couple months, she's having whole sheds, gained weight after just 2 meals, all her damaged scales are gone, and her stomach is no longer weirdly gurgling.  hell, even the cats and dog look 100 times better now that they're out of there.  i'm hoping to get her on 1.5-2 lb rabbits here soon, when she gets back up to her normal girth.  [this was her](https://imgur.com/a/be9rt) at 7.5'-8', before she started losing weight.  no sign of any ribs or backbone anywhere, though she isn't as girthy as some retics.  [here's a thread](http://www.ssnakess.com/forums/giant-python-discussion/110672-update-xena-3.html) with someone ""starving"" their retics, like you seem to think, her largest adult was fed monthly.  she died of cancer at i think 6-8 years old, she got her at 1 year old and 3' being fed even less than my retic was at twice the age.  she reached 15' before died, despite ""being stunted"" as you seem to think is the case.  she feeds larger meals than i do, but less often.  i feed smaller ones more often.  you said ""doesn't believe in evolution and that vaccines really do cause autism.""  that is called bad sentence structure.  aside from the fact that ""doesn't"" is grammatically incorrect here, that sentence is basically saying ""do not (or don't) believe in evolution and don't believe that vaccines really do cause autism.""  a sentence like ""50% of the us don't believe in evolution and still believe that vaccines cause autism"" would more correctly reflect what you claim you're trying to say.  if you don't specifically change the context, the negative applies to both parts of the sentence.  i do know what the &gt; means, and that isn't the issue i had with your sentence.  as far as my weight i really have no clue what picture i could have posted that made me look overweight as i'm borderline underweight, and normally look like a skeleton about to collapse on itself with the strength to match.  not that my weight has anything to do with it, because snake and human metabolism are much different, and you don't need snacks to get overweight.  as far as your other comment, i'm not sure how going from a fuzzy every 2 weeks, to a rat pup or weaned rat is deciding to keep her a runt.  those rats were easily 14-30% of her weight (she was 150 grams when i got her).  she got them every 2 weeks the first couple of feeds just because i didn't want to shock her system: i've seen people take stunted snakes, power feed them, and then those snakes get severely kinked spines from too rapid of growth.  but after that, she got similarly-sized meals weekly up until she was..2?  2.5 years?  which is when i first tried offering her 1 lb rabbits that were roughly 20-25% of her weight.  she took the first one just fine, then the next one, that i offered a week later, took several minutes of bouncing on her back before she just gently grabbed it, and didn't even coil until i violently shook it.  the following rabbit she completely refused, so i put her back on 1/2 lb rats until she grew another foot or so.  now she takes 1 lb rabbits just fine.  she's never been a pusher, and has a very low feeding response.  won't strike until the food is actually in front of her face.  i do think another thing that contributed to a drop in growth rate was that i had someone snake-sitting her when we all moved out of that house.  they promised to feed her while i waited to move to a bigger place (we had to move out of that house very quickly and i didn't have many options), and they didn't.  she went almost 4 months without food, and even then she never pushed, and her feeding response hasn't increased.  needless to say, i took my snakes back after i learned how irresponsible they were being, and a friend out of state is taking care of the ones i can't fit at my new place.  she hasn't really put on any length for almost a year, but she normally goes 7-9 months without growing before just rapidly growing a few feet all at once, so now that she's eating again i suspect she'll hit a growth spurt again very soon.  i'm not sure how you think i'm cycling her to hit high and low points, when i was feeding exactly the way people suggested me to (15-20%), and only just recently started slowing down her food when it seemed to be too much for her.  i've never fed the ridiculous 4-5 days because that isn't even enough time to digest their meals, but i have fed plenty large enough meals plenty often enough.  actually, from what i've heard from other keepers is that it's rare to have a retic, female or not, reach or exceed 15'.  i have been told that 11'-13' is perfectly acceptable for an adult female, and no other retic keeper has shown issue with her growth rate except for you.  i said their female was barely over 10', anywhere from 10'-12', but it's been several years so i don't remember exactly.  oh, i'm not saying they're making their retics fat on *accident*, no not in the slightest.  you don't accidentally make a snake fat by feeding it multiple fatty foods with 40-50% fat content *per prey item*, and do it weekly, and just *accidentally* make them fat.  no, it's all on purpose, because an obese retic looks a lot more intimidating than a lean, fit one does.  my boas get meals 6-8% every 10-21 days for juveniles, and 2-6% of their weight every 4-6 weeks for adults.  yet i'm feeding my retic, who got 15-30% of her weight weekly as a juvenile, and now 10-12% of her weight every other week...the same..as my boas?  ok.",0,,
828489,"a lot of stuff?  not quite, but i'm not going to nitpick with you over things they have yet to deliver.     see there is a difference in hating and becoming a skeptic.  the same question could be asked why you love the project so much considering it hasn't even met one ounce of industry standard.  why love something and defend it so much when it's failed to stick to any standards in the industry.  being different doesn't make it special, it makes it stand out with a lot of red flags.  they don't even follow proper alpha standards which is why they stopped calling it alpha.     they're making it up as they go along.  i'd become less of a skeptic if they communicated or stayed accountable to their backers like chris promised years ago that he would only to make many changes that became very anti-consumer.  the problem with this game right now is there are more red flags then there is progress.     there is far too much focus on big events and sales then making the game.  imho fuck citcon and get to work.  i have no doubt the developers of star citizen are working as best they can but if chris's history says anything, he's not easy to work for or with and he's an asshole.  i'd bet money if devs weren't behind an nda they'd say the ceo is hard to work for/with and he needs to stop with the bull shit.  i genuinely feel sorry for many of the poor devs behind this project.  he fell in to his old trap again which sucks.  he absolves himself though remember?",0,,

997064,"hmm, personally, what i notice most about fns is this lithe yet sturdy frame, long and elongated yet strong/robust. to me, no matter the size or weight, fns have a, (for lack of a better term) ""kinetic"" grace, meaning, they give off an impression of encompassing openness, ease in dynamic bodily movement, comfortability in taking up space, and effortless mastery of the human body; to me, naturals give off a sense of being ""in tune"" with their physicality and space, hence why ""earthy"" sensuality is associated with them i think. when i think fn,  i think grounded presence with ""fresh""/energetic/adventurous vivacity, disarming warm vitality, amicable magnetic easygoing charm, ""cool"" /laid back charisma, effortless authority/confidence, relaxed sophistication, raw earthy sensuality, and free-spirited/creative/adventurous/unapologetic/""wild' independent self- assured energy. they can give off rustic and/or practical vibes too, and they can also be spunky, playful, and/or ""cute""/unassuming too like any other ids, but it's distinctly their own brand of spunky, playful, and/or cute that's different from other types i can't fully describe without repeating myself.  to me, there's something uninhibited, unencumbered, powerful, ""raw"", energetic/dynamic yet grounded, carefree, and vivacious about fns. it's probably why the boho, the hippie, the beach babe, the surfer, the supermodel, the rockstar, the athlete/dancer, the cheerleader, the girl next door, the nomad, the amazonian, the warrior goddess, the valkyrie, the folk woman, the nymph, the noble equestrian, the jetsetter, the lady boss/""woman in a man's world"", etc are some tropes/imageries i've seen associated with fn, because these seem to fit with the essence.  they either have something about their frame that is more open/expansive taking up more visual space compared to the rest of their own proportions i.e chest/ribcage/upper back/shoulders, or they're ""big-boned"" overall, and/or have firm/toned/sinewy/more sculpted-looking flesh and straighter lines on their bodies and faces. flesh, curves (conventional non-kibbe) , and body lines that are long and smooth; can be kind of big/meaty/""thick""/fleshy yet in a way that is firm/lean at the same time, ""trim"" but not ""dry""/fragile/waif-like/gaunt nor gangly. angular, but not acutely narrow/ intensely sharply ""cut"" in angles, shapes, and form.  they can have curves just like every other type, but their curves and flesh are somewhat firmer-looking and can be muscular; ""trim""-looking flesh firmly smoothed over/wrapped around visibly prominent long beveled bones with either their upper back/ribcage/bust/shoulders proportionally taking up more horizontal visual space and encompassing their curves, hence why their ""curves are contained inside the frame"". to me, fns give a subtly sculpted statuesque/svelte look overall no matter the weight/size.  fns remind me of classics in a sense, both are proportional and softly sculpted-looking with the highs and lows of their contours and dimensions not having much contrast. like if i liken their bodily and facial contours/dimensions to landscape i could walk on, the apexes and depths of their lands are smoother to look at and easier to traverse on/more ""flowing"" with expansive flat planes.. less steep drops or jagged/sharp edges than ds/sds. hence, the less contrast. fns have more wide ""rugged"" terrains than the d landscapes, but less rolling big lush hills than the sd landscapes. though i see similarities in the natural and the classic family, fns are bigger, more large scale and elongated with more prominent/defined bones and some parts/features more irregular and exaggerated in both shape, scale, and visual space while classics are more ""compact""/refined. fns can have sharpness in some places but overall, the bone structure is strong/prominent with smoothed/ softened slightly square/ squoval (square-oval) beveled obtuse-angled edges/corners and contours.    i don't know if you get me, but i tried to describe/see fns in the simplest way i could. this is how i see this image id as someone that likes to draw and engage in various forms of art involving the study of bodies and faces. i have an older post regarding this topic. i will link it here, if you'd like to read it.",1,0,0

572253,"the single greatest tip i can proffer is to really focus on making progress each and every time you perform exercise (unless you're expressly going easy that day, but don't do this more than once every few months). by this i mean if you're lifting weights keep track and try your hardest do one more rep than you did before, or go for the same quantity reps but with 5 extra lbs, etc. if you're running always try beat your previous records, if you're swimming swim faster than you ever swam before, etc. for some pursuits it's a little harder to quantify (like boxing), but never give less than your all and try try try to be a better athlete than you were a week ago. 5 lbs a week on a big lift might not seem like much, but that's 260 lbs a year if you can keep it up, which is pretty goddamn massive. 5 seconds off your mile might be very little, but it adds up as you go on.  of course you'll fail plenty. but never drop this as a goal. and know the difference between ""ow this hurts because i'm sore"" and ""ow this hurts because i've pulled a muscle"". be very careful with injury.  oh, and your bmr will go up a bit as you put on muscle (or fat), but not by very much. http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/84/3/475 ""every 10-kg difference in lean mass translates to a difference in energy expenditure of 100 kcal/d, assuming a constant rate of protein turnover."" of course in practice this'll be a bit more pronounced, as we don't tend to spend our days completely immobile, and so any extra weight we gain will have to be lugged around doing basic non-exercise things, like walking around.  if you want to get big and muscular and strong lift heavy and eat a few hundred cal over maintenance. note: this takes a ton of time (as in months -- you needn't spend more than 3 hours a week lifting), so don't be afraid of ""lifting once and turning into mr. olympia"". it doesn't work like that. and girls, your distinct lack of testicles means you put on muscle even slower, so there're no worries there. it matters fairly little what you eat, so long as you get all your micros in, which in itself is fairly easy if you maintain a veggie/fruit rich diet, with some meats and dairy and whatever else. variety is good. 50-100 g protein/day is enough for beginners, but you won't hurt yourself eating more. count your kcals so you know how much you need, and make sure your weight is going up or down as expected (otherwise, adjust). maybe avoid the high gi carbs. related: http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/ajcn.2009.27725v1  if you want to lose weight, look into cyclic ketogenic at a few 100 kcal below maintenance and keep lifting heavy (ketosis + leptin/ghrelin control + deficit + high intensity resistance training = maximum natural fat loss coupled with minimum muscle loss). do not do low intensity aerobic exercise (like jogging) as your primary physical activity if you're trying to lose fat -- the body preferentially burns muscle (type 2) if that's all you're doing while running a deficit, as the muscle's not being used (only type 1 myofibrils are being recruited) and is a much less efficient a form of energy storage than fat, so it'll rid itself of the less useful dead weight first and save the good stuff for later. you can still make strength gains on a cut (through neuromuscular and connective tissue development, along with better leverages on some lifts, but i'm iffy on the details) but it's a bit harder to build muscle when losing weight unless you're morbidly obese. by heavy lifting i mean ~70%+ of your one rep max unto failure -- i forget where if anyone can link, but one study i read concluded that 70% was the minimum most people needed to recruit all their 2bs, but there was individual variation (some got by at 40%, lol). rippetoe's and madcow's are good programs, but it's not so important if you're focusing on low rep compound movements (squats, cleans, deads, pullups, etc). don't bother isolating if you're just starting out.  if you're a really scrawny, lean beginner or an ecto, consider going on a larger surplus to turbocharge your gains -- 1000 kcal a day, gomad, and so forth. you'll gain a lot of fat but it's almost assured you'll progress much faster in your lifts than someone closer to maintenance (though admittedly i've not seen any hard science to back this up, if anyone could provide some that'd be great, but conventional wisdom + plenty of credible coaches + my own experiences/observations confirm it).   oh, and stretch before doing any exercise. maybe try yoga if you're inflexible. getting your heart rate up and your lungs a puffing is a good standard for successful aerobic exercise and better cv health.",1,0,

(again, you need look no further than this thread.)  &amp;nbsp;   honestly, your attitude's probably the most unattractive thing about you, and though it's likely understandable due to your experiences, it's a terrible way to treat people - not everybody's out to get you. sure, you may have bigger problems than others, but that doesn't mean that their problems aren't real or serious.  edit: formatting",1,,-1

146974,"late to the party but here goes.  i was not a fat child, nor was my sister. my dad was pretty big and had a big appetite, but we always had pretty well balanced meals and rarely had sweets and junk food. i was also pretty active as a kid, playing outside from the time my homework was done until dinnertime. riding my bike, roller skating, climbing trees, etc.  then i hit puberty early. none of the other girls my age had hips or boobs, and i was way taller than everyone else. i got my period when i was 9 years old. and it was irregular. i would sometimes bleed for weeks at a time, and it would be really heavy so i'd have to wear these bulky pads that made crinkly noises when i moved.  i look at old pics now and i looked like a normal, healthy, slim 13 year old with curves, but i was only 9, and compared to the stick-thin girls in my class i felt like a big fat freak. i stopped being active. i was scared of other kids hearing my pad, or of getting a leak from moving around. instead of playing outside i started reading a lot.  my parents weren't prepared for having such a young daughter having to deal with this stuff and they were uncomfortable talking about it. my mom gave me pads and showed me how to use them and that was about it.   at school, the pe teacher and recess supervisors actually encouraged my inactivity. they told me i was too big to play with the other kids because they thought i would hurt them accidentally. so i had to either sit out, or just run laps while everyone else got to play sports. i chose to bring a book and sit out.  i gradually got bigger and bigger, but i actually wasn't obese or severely overweight. i *thought* i was though. when you're a 5'4"" high school girl at 140 pounds, that's not all that overweight, but when all the other girls are 120 pounds or less, you feel like a whale. so i have felt and thought of myself as a fat person since i was 9 years old basically, regardless of how much i actually weighed.  i tried *so* many diets. slim-fast, diet pills, etc. i would lose some weight, then gain it back and more. in the regaining phase i would always be so hungry i would binge. dieting really screwed up my eating. i tried exercising too, with different tapes at home, but it never seemed to bring any results so i'd quit.  in college i got up to 200 pounds. afterwards i was still living at home and i got a part time job working for the ymca so i decided now that i can workout for free, it's time to lose the weight.   i was doing different cardio classes and activities every weekday morning. aerobics, swimming, pilates, spinning, dance fit. i was weight training every afternoon, upper body and lower body on alternate days, with the help of a trainer. i did yoga on saturday mornings and took sundays off.   i started low-carb kind of by accident. i noticed that when i ate salad with grilled chicken for lunch, i had more energy for my workouts than when i ate pasta and veggies. so i researched it and found out about low-carb dieting. i didn't follow a specific plan, just cut out starchy things and replaced them with veggies.   i lost about 50 pounds in a year. but i didn't enjoy it. see, even though fatness is a spectrum, in my mind it was binary. i'm either fat or not fat. and at 150 pounds, now 5'5"" i was still in the overweight category of the bmi charts. my boobs still failed the pencil test. my thighs still touched. i still had cellulite. i still didn't look anything like a swimsuit model or the actresses i admired. and my weight-loss had stalled. i still thought i was disgusting, and no amount of compliments from friends or relatives ever changed my mind. in fact, when a cute guy asked me out, i seriously thought he was playing a joke on me and told him to fuck off. poor cute guy, i'm sorry. :(  i started tracking my calories too instead of just carbs, and limited myself first to 1200 for a few weeks, then 1000, then eventually down to 800. i lost another 5 pounds, yay! but i was still fat. and my weight loss stalled again. after a month of increasing my intensity in my workouts and keeping my diet under 800 calories, i just couldn't take it anymore. i broke. i figured there was nothing i could do, i was just going to be fat forever, and i was making myself miserable for nothing. so i quit. i quit working out, i started eating whatever i wanted, fell into depression, and now 8 years later i'm up to 260 pounds.   so, for me, it pretty much boils down to my thinking being screwed up. this is the problem with our culture's messages to women: you're never good enough unless you're perfect. you can't be healthy or attractive if you're even a little bit fat. the only reason to eat well and exercise is to be thin and sexy. when you internalize those messages, and then eating well and exercising *doesn't* make you look like a supermodel for whatever reasons (even if it *is* making you healthier), it's really discouraging. you don't see that there are benefits of eating well and exercising other than weight loss, because we're so obsessed with being thin at all costs.  now i have learned some things. every woman in my family has cellulite, even the skinny ones. even at my thinnest i still had big boobs, and big boobs often fail the pencil test. thighs touching does not mean i'm disgusting. bmi isn't everything, and being in the category of ""overweight"" actually is quite different than being ""morbidly obese"" where i am now. healthy habits will make me feel better even if they won't make me skinny.   i still have some things working against my ever being thin. hypothyroidism. chronic joint pain. financial stress. fear of falling back into obsessive habits and developing an eating disorder. but i *can* stop eating fast food. i *can* make sure i eat vegetables at every meal and have fruit for snacks instead of potato chips. i *can* drink more water every day. i *can* do yoga every day and moderate body weight exercises to strengthen my muscles and help relieve some of the pain. and only a couple of weeks into these changes in my lifestyle, i can already feel benefits. less pain, better sleep, more energy.   will i lose weight? i don't know, and i don't care. if i have to be this weight forever i am ok with that if i can just *feel* better. so for the first time in my life, changing my habits is actually about my health, not about my appearance. and i'm doing it because i love myself and want to be kind to myself, not out of hating myself like before.   thank you to anyone who reads my story, and to any fat-haters out there, try to have some compassion. life can be challenging for everyone, and you don't ever really know what someone else is going through.",1,2,0

603230,"**airport tips**  * get to the airport early. just parking and getting to the terminal can take 30 minutes or more from when you arrive there. frequent flyers often know how close they can cut it at particular airports, but you don't.  * if you are parking your car at the airport, google ""best airport parking (your airport)"" and spend ten minutes looking for advice. very often the best parking deals are off-airport. they are not only cheaper, but often just as quick and easy (or quicker and easier)-- often their shuttles are cleaner, run more frequently, take you right from your car to the terminal, and they may even wash your car or change your oil while you're away. the in-airport parking often has massive lots that you have to carry your bags across to the shuttle bus stop, shuttles that run only every half-hour, etc. good offsite parking is often better in every respect, especially at bigger airports.  * use the automated self-check-in, if they have it. it's easy and the lines are much shorter.  * when going through security, obviously look for the shortest lines, but even more, look for lines that have the most experienced-looking travelers. if you get in line behind 50 people in suits with rolling carry-ons, you will get through security *much* quicker than getting behind 20 people with kids and shopping bags and flip-flops.   * don't freak out if you get selected for a bomb-swab, pat-down, or luggage search. it happens randomly, they're not singling you out. just thank them for their work and be polite and they'll zip you right through. they're looking for terrorists, not for people with traces of marijuana smoke on their cuffs or pirated movies on their laptop.  * if you smoke, or if you're hungry, find out whether there are any smoking lounges or food past security *before you go through*. truthfully, once you're through security, in most airports it's maybe ten minutes at most to get to the gate where you board the plane. and once you're in, it's a pita to change your mind. so once you've parked and got your boarding pass, you don't necessarily need to rush through security just to sit there for an hour. ask the information agents if you're not sure how long it will take. * when you're at the self check-in and selecting seats, it will often ask if you want to upgrade to ""economy plus"" or some such. if you hold off and don't select a seat, you will often get bumped up to ""economy plus"" at the gate for free, since everyone else is selecting seats in regular coach.  * if you *do*select a seat, window is usually better than aisle unless you plan on using the bathroom or fiddling with your overhead bags. you can look out the window, and it gives you something to slouch against, making things a little more comfortable.  * best coach seats are always emergency-exit rows, if you can get them, because they have way more legroom (seats are further apart so people can escape in an emergency). most airlines are now charging extra for these, though. once again, simply not selecting your seat will often get you seated in better seats, because everybody else is picking the cheap ones.   **packing tips** packing depends largely on where you're going and what you plan to be doing there, but i have found that i can travel almost anywhere, for almost anything, with one rolling 22"" carry-on. unless it's a fishing or skiing trip or something weird like that, a very small selection of clothes and a willingness to drop off laundry every three days or so (the hotel can tell you where) will keep you going indefinitely in almost any civilized part of the world, or even on a months-long round-the-world trip.  for starters, take out your suitcase/backpack/whatever...  * first start with your ziplock baggie. pack a folding toothbrush, razor, travel-size toothpaste, travel-sized deodorant. those are mandatory. don't bother with shampoo or conditioner-- they will almost certainly be provided wherever you are going, and you have limited space. optional items are trial-size shaving cream, mouthwash, sunscreen, cosmetics, medications, perfumes, etc. if you regularly use hand-lotion, or q-tips, or cold cream, or chap stick, or something else other than soap and shampoo, bring it-- it won't always be there. i also recommend putting a few earplugs in with your toiletries... they can be lifesaver if the place you are sleeping turns out to be unexpectedly noisy or sonically unfamiliar (don't worry-- you'll still hear the alarm clock). set the ziplock baggie aside, it's going to go on the very outside of your suitcase/backpack/whatever.  * if you can fit your cellphone charger in the plastic baggie, do so, otherwise set it next to the baggie.  * entertainment: bring a paperback that you know you will like or a kindle or a nintendo ds or whatever. do not bring all of the above. travel light. you're just bringing a time-killer for when you're stuck somewhere. you're going to be travelling in a new part of the world and you should not be spending much time with this stuff. * laptop: consider leaving it, if you're not going to be working while away, or if there will be computers there. especially if you can email from your phone. you're visiting a new part of the world-- the internet and videogames will all still be here when you get back. how much computing do you really need to do? now that you have considered it and decided to bring your computer anyway (being a redditor), place it and the charger next to your bag, along with a mouse if you need one. like the baggie, it's going on the outside where it's easy to reach, and it should fit in an outside pocket.   ** clothes** it's different for girls. i'm a man, so man-rules apply. but the principles are sound...  wear a suit on the plane, if you have one, with a wrinkle-free or no-iron dress shirt, and a versatile pair of shoes such as loafers or ""fashion"" sneakers. this will provide you with one pair of relatively unwrinkled dress pants, a convenient and sharp-looking jacket if it gets chilly, and the ability to look sharp if you need to at your destination. you can wear the jacket with jeans or the pants with a t-shirt and not look stuffy, but you have the backup if you need it.   when packing clothes *roll*, don't fold. it's more space efficient, and it prevents wrinkles better.   in the bag goes:  * up to three pairs of boxers (less if you are staying fewer than three nights) * up to three pairs of socks (how to balance the dress/gym/low-cut will be decided based on shorts/shoes combinations described later) * two t-shirts that are respectable enough to wear as either undershirts or casual shirts * one additional wrinkle-free dress shirt * a tie (you may as well bring one since you're bringing a suit-- it doesn't take up much space. and one suit, two ties, plus two dress shirts will get you through four days of business meetings without looking the same twice.) * swim trunks, or much better yet, lightweight gym shorts suitable for swimming in (even if you go somewhere cold, the hotel is apt to have a pool, and these will double as pajamas with a t-shirt). * two of the following: jeans, lightweight cargo pants or linen slacks, cargo shorts, extra pair of dress pants. (remember that you will be wearing a pair of long pants with the suit on the plane, so err on the side of shorts or lightweight linen/cargo pants, weather-depending).  pack all that stuff in the carry-on bag. you should have enough room left over for two or three of the following, which will depend where you're going and what you plan to be doing:  * sandals  * sweater or sweatshirt (this plus a t-shirt, dress, shirt, and the suit-jacket above will prepare you for moderate exposure to all but the worst winter climates).  * scrunched-up duffel bag (important if you plan to do shopping or otherwise take back more than you're bringing).  * hostess gifts * running shoes * gloves and hat or scarf (if going someplace cold in winter) * other small weird stuff you have to have.   if you're a frequent traveler, or if you're planning a long trip, i strongly encourage looking for versatile and lightweight clothes. especially cargo pants or no-iron linen slacks, a light suit, lightweight merino wool, cashmere, or synthetic sweaters, gym shorts that are suitable for swimming or sleeping in, and most especially, versatile shoes. there is a whole sub-genre of shoes out there that can be worn with anything from a suit to shorts without looking like a complete moron.   a man with a suit, a couple of dress shirts, a couple of respectable t-shirts, a pair of sandals, a pair of cargo shorts, a pair of jeans or cargo pants, a sweater, and a pair of versatile shoes and sandals can travel the inhabited world for a year while looking good throughout, simply dropping off the laundry once or twice a week for $5 a wash.   women may need to bring more articles to remain suitably fashionable, but not too many more, and their clothes are apt to be smaller and less bulky and structured than men's are.   now, things that make for very bad travelling companions include:   * umbrellas and rain gear-- the hotel or people hosting will have an umbrella for you. if they don't, drop $5 at a drugstore for one, and leave it for the next guest.  * heavy topcoats, trenchcoats, furs, etc. next time you sail across the atlantic in a luxury ocean-liner, feel free to fill up your steamer trunk... * boots and chunky shoes. this is slightly tougher for women than for men, but if you plan to travel, look for the most versatile and lightweight shoes you can find.  * junk and accouterments. you're travelling. hotels have tvs. the people you're staying with have stuff. you don't need to bring a laptop and an ipad and 2 books and three magazines and a psp with 10 games... plan to get out and see the world. plan to have fun.",0,,
169311,"meanwhile, deep inside francis' left ear canal...  having absolutely no suitable tools or abilities on hand that would give him any sort of way to break the eardrum barrier and reach francis' middle and inner ears without being detected, and already having spent a rather undesirable amount of time fruitlessly attempting to cut a hole through the tympanic membrane with his claws, burgerpants finally lost his mind and snapped like a twig!  ""francis, please; for the love of mettaton, please tell me you're still somewhere in there, please! i'm freaking begging you for christ's sake!"" burgerpants kneeled down on both of his knees yet again and screamed and yelled and cried at the top of his lungs, pounding and pounding and pounding away at francis' precious little eardrum with his fists and ripping large portions of his own earwax-speckled fur out in frustration while francis doubled over onto his knees, clutched his head with both hands and began loudly screaming and crying in unbearably agonizing pain; meanwhile, whoever was currently controlling francis' brain at the moment suddenly heard conspicuously large amounts of obnoxious noise and vibrations being filtered and channeled in through the poor weeaboo lizard's aching auditory nerves and made him publicly dig all the way into his left ear with the corresponding index finger in an attempt to fish the (equally) unwelcome intruder right out in a nice big glob of wax and eat him!  ""warning: structural integrity of left eardrum at approximately twenty percent!"" francis' brain warned its new controller as burgerpants left a multitude of ruptured, bleeding cracks across the surprisingly soft and fleshy surface of said eardrum, causing the poor guy to squirm and writhe and gently weep on the floor in absolutely unbelievable pain and agony.  ""here, fishy fishy!"" francis (his controller not paying proper attention to the computer's advice at all, luckily) laughed teasingly as he forcefully shoved his long, spindly and freakishly bony index finger all the way down his ear canal, in hopes of finally catching burgerpants with it!  ""holy sh%# nuggets!"" burgerpants screamed in terror as francis' finger poked him right in the surprisingly resilient chest, pushing him backward into francis' already severely fractured and damaged eardrum at extreme velocity and causing the poor lizard weeb to shriek at the tops of his mucus-congested lungs in an almost humanly unimaginable amount of pain as copious amounts of blood (not to mention bits and pieces of his completely ruptured and shattered eardrum) began pouring out through his ear, causing his controller to actually genuinely feel extremely bad for him and therefore take a brief coffee break to reflect on what he had just done; meanwhile, francis just stood perfectly still and remained right where he was, with his finger still in his ear and everything, since his current predicament had literally made him too afraid to even move a muscle. luckily, this (intentionally) gave burgerpants the perfect opportunity to break free of francis' sticky, waxy-coated finger and make his way into the poor scaly bastard's brain from there to ""surgically"" remove whatever foul beast was currently possessing it.  ""oh boy, looks like i'm gonna have to make like mr. fanservice and go completely shirtless now!"" burgerpants chuckled as he hastily unbuttoned his mtt uniform shirt and slipped right out of it, narcissistically admiring and kissing his own handsomely lean and muscular chest as he crawled into the extremely complex and delicate inner workings of francis' ear and making his way right through his cochlea and semicircular canals with shockingly immense ease!  ""i'm a little noodle-cup, short and stout!"" francis dizzily stumbled back and forth and sang absentmindedly as burgerpants finally reached the thing that he had really been wanting (and needing) to see all this time: francis' incredibly easily-manipulated brain!  ""alright, so let's see here...where should i start?"" burgerpants thought to himself intriguedly as he gazed in awe upon francis' incredibly massive (yet also insanely f%#&amp;ing stupid and dull-witted) brain and eagerly climbed his way up the stem and cerebral cortex until he finally reached the very top of the big old knowledge-sponge, admiring the wonderful anatomical view all around him and immediately letting loose a good solid chuckle upon noticing the fact that even francis' freaking eyesockets were somehow literally shaped like a pair of nerdy eyeglasses!  meanwhile on the inside of francis' brain, the totally-not-completely-obvious mystery person who just so happened to be controlling it at the moment shrugged his shoulders, crossed his arms over his chest, crossed his bony legs atop the dashboard of francis' central control supercomputer and was just about to finally fall asleep...  when all of a sudden outside, almost completely out of nowhere, mettaton finally arrived onstage (in his freaking box form of all things) and reluctantly stood right next to his new weeaboo lizard guest star alphys...er, i mean, francis, shocked at what he saw remaining of alphys' and francis' former dinner table as his typical insanely loving and rabidly loyal swarm of fans came pouring excitedly into the room, blissfully unaware of what was really going on inside francis' body at the moment.  one minute later...  ""my, my, look at you, you irresistibly handsome and delightful beauty, you!"" mettaton laughed sarcastically at francis' expense (after all, francis was now disturbingly wearing diamond and pearl earrings and bracelets, gold and silver finger and toe rings with ruby, sapphire and emerald jewels embedded into them, red and blue lipstick, black and white fingernail and toenail polish, a blondish-yellow women's wig, and a platinum-crystal glitter dress) as the two of them hastily stumbled back out onto the stage while endogeny was busy licking alphys' naked body with head to toe to boobs to butt to pussy with his dripping, slimy tongue.  ""indeed, i am the great crossdressed assholio! i need oreos for my mouth-hole!"" francis announced furiously to everyone in the room as he pulled the back of his dress collar over his head, bent his arms at right angles and put his hands up on either side of his head with the palms facing out in an incredibly stupid pose, causing the entire audience to almost roll on the floor laughing their ever-loving asses off while memoryhead lovingly raped alphys with his tentacles.  ""and on that amazingly hilarious note, without further ado, let's finally get this delightful show on the road, shall we?"" mettaton chuckled, taking francis by the hand and eagerly waiting for the wildly cheering crowd to finally settle down so that he could begin his show in peace.  ""readers, i apologize dearly in advance for you having to see this, but sometimes a man's just gotta do what a man's gotta do, you know what i'm saying?!"" burgerpants awoke from his slumber atop francis' massively soft and spongy brain and blushed humiliatedly as he eagerly threw his pants/underwear right off and reluctantly inserted his rapidly hardening and stiffening cat penis into the vast network of folds and wrinkles in the poor lizard's central nervous tissue.  ""oh, my wonderful darling...sir, do you mind if i call you alphys?"" mettaton asked francis teasingly, grabbing him by the tail and ankles and fervently, erotically licking the soft, scaly soles of his feet while the obligatory sexy tango music began blaring loudly in the background.  ""oh, not even in the slightest, madam!"" francis giggled and blushed as he twirled around playfully and handsomely with mettaton, bent him over backwards and french-kissed him wetly, drippingly and lovingly.  ""well, then...alphys, i must say, you are the absolute ugliest yet simultaneously hottest freaking thing that i think i've ever seen! boy, you'd better believe that this isn't a family show anymore; it's an all-you-can-eat smut show!"" mettaton laughed excitedly as he wrapped his arms lovingly around francis' big chubby body and gave him an even sloppier french kiss.  ""oh, mettaton, you just make my tail curl with pleasure!"" francis moaned with arousal, drooling at the mouth rabidly and excitedly as he threw his dress right off while mettaton seductively pulled his high-heeled boots off, rendering both of them completely naked as the audience cheered loudly and nosebled in unanimous approval, bewilderment and amazement.  ""damnit, this was supposed to be a dance show, but you just turned it into...whatever the hell this is supposed to be! you cheeky freaking boy, you!"" mettaton giggled and blushed embarrassedly as he and francis sat down across from each other and began giving each other simultaneous footjobs while lovingly stroking each other's hair with their fingers.  ""well, it's still at least better than nothing, am i right? especially since i'm finally, at long last, getting to f%#&amp; a freaking autobot!"" francis moaned and blu ^((trimmed due to comment size limit)^)",0,,

836033,"i've noticed there's a happy medium for women in terms of size and hotness for consistently best sex.  ideally you want a girl who's an 8, who works out about 2-3 days a week which will include some weight training, hopefully a lot of squats and stair-stepping.  this produces luscious booty while maintaining a trim waistline.  she will want to ride your penis off into the sunset like a western hero, and she'll be able to do it because she's in shape.  all manner of sexual positions are on the table, because she works out and has some flexibility, and she's not so fat that her stomach prevents you putting her feet by her head when you assume the jackhammer position.  what you don't want is a 9 or 10, even if they're athletic. most of the time, they'll expect you, the man, to do most or all of the work... they may grind on you for awhile, but it won't be a half-hour / hour long session designed to break your cock right off your body and grind your balls into a paste like the 8-gym girl will.  now, going onto the bigger girls.  girls with a little chub are okay, but they'll tire out quickly when it comes to riding you.  if you get 15 minutes out of it, i'll be shocked.  so will they.  they will mostly expect you to do a lot of the work, because their stamina is generally low.  this is just a side effect of carrying around extra weight and not hitting the gym as often as necessary.  note that these girls can be anywhere from a 4 to an 8... if you're going after 3s and less, that's a whole other ballgame that i don't have experience with.  onto the chunky monkeys.  these are the girls that need to lose about 25 - 50 lbs.  a man usually runs into one of these when he himself is obese and has limited options, or he's being a bro and taking one for the team so his buddy can go home with her hotter friend.  they usually have a lot of padding around their pussy, which ends up being a double-edged sword.  you'll lose about an inch of your penis length due to the additional padding, so if you're below the average penis length of 5.5 inches, just be aware that doggy style might be on the horizon for you.  you'll get better entry into her vagina.  the plus side is these girls usually have a pretty tight pussy since it doesn't see as much action as thinner / prettier girls.  anal sex is often on the table with these girls as well... get some spit on that thumb, or just spit right onto her butthole and start rubbing the pad of your thumb against her anus and you'll be cruising the hershey highway at top speed that evening.  bonus points if you have the foresight to keep lubricant around.  i always have a small 50 ml travel bottle of maximus for potential anal encounters in my truck console.  it always finds its way into my pocket, no matter what girl i'm going home with, because, hell, its anal, and why the fuck not?  its been my experience these girls are down for anything.  spanking?  check.  cum on their face?  check.  cum in their mouth?  check.  cum in their ass?  check.  **warning!!** avoid cumming in her vagina at all costs... unwanted pregnancies are a serious setback to any young person.  tie her to the bed?  check.  titty fuck her?  check.  just about any sexual act you've considered, these girls will be up for it.  again, expect to do most of the work, because she'll get winded much faster than girls who are only slightly overweight, and they get winded doubleplus quick than girls actively hitting the gym.  any girl who's tipping the scales at 50+ lbs of excess body fat, i honestly do not have any experience with that.  you're getting into seriously unhealthy obesity there, and i want no part of that.  furthermore, its just incredibly challenging for an obese woman to actually look sexy while naked.  i have never seen it.  maybe it happens, i don't know.  going back to 9s and 10s for a minute, i have noticed that my penis is almost always at its thickest, longest, and hardest with these girls.  it makes sense.  they're the most visually appealing.  that said, my previous ex-girlfriend was an athletic 8, and she also gave me raging boners, but we had an emotional as well as physical connection established over many months.  be wary of ""skinny"" 9s and 10s.  i mean girls that are thin but don't do shit to maintain that thinness.  if a girl is a 9 or 10 and doesn't hit the gym, she's gonna be a rather boring lay.  she'll expect you to do all the work, for two reasons.  one, because of her beauty, she's used to not having to do much to get what she wants.  secondly, because of her diet / metabolism / anorexia / bulemia / whatever, she'll also expect you to do everything.  they're pretty to look at, but can be mediocre in the bedroom.  **special warning** avoid strippers, most redheads (especially redheads that aren't super skinny / fat... redhead girls who have been good-looking all their lives are more dangerous than a fucking **king cobra**), and hairdressers.  let's recap:  * best consistent sex: athletic gym-attending 8 * best most intense sex: 9s and 10s that are athletic. * best freak-a-deky sex:  chubsters (10-25 lbs overweight) that are 6.5 - 8.  potential hazards:  * 9 / 10s that don't hit the gym / are super skinny. * 4s and below that are 20-50 lbs overweight.  you'll just be disgusted with yourself unless you're also a lardass.  proceed with caution:  * strippers * most redheads * hairdressers.  abandon hope, all ye who enter the vagina:  a redheaded stripper who is thin.  i made this mistake once.  only once.  she keyed my truck.  she burned all my clothes at her place.  she broke my lawn gnome (seriously, who the fuck breaks a man's david the gnome?  go to hell, bitch...).  you have been warned.",1,-2,2

304978,"straight up: there are guys who like the large lovely ladies. i'm one of them. while physical appearance is not a make-or-break issue for me (if your personality wins me over, i don't care if you look like an amputee crackwhore granny, lets date), i have found that invariably, the women i am initially attracted to are definitely plus size, and tend towards the larger of that - i honestly think anything under 200 pounds is ""getting pretty skinny"" and will say that out loud. on a more personal level, your scars are not a drawback... for me they're more of a positive. i find things like scars and stretch marks to be incredibly fascinating and highly attractive. i fully admit to being a serious minority on this (but not as small of a minority as you might think). i hate to say all that as an internet stranger, but it's true. from what you've shared, you sound very appealing as a friend, and possibly more. take that for what you will.  more to the point, there are a lot of guys who like fat girls. there was a study recently about what kind of porn guys go looking for. they compared the results for all searches on porn sites using a size/body keyword like ""skinny"" ""slender"" ""lean"" ""fat"" and ""bbw"". they found that ""fat"" related searches (fat, plump, bbw, ssbbw, chubby, etc) were over 4 times as popular as the next most common, which was ""slender"" (but not outright skinny). so obviously the audience is out there.  at your age, the biggest problem you're facing is not lack of interest, but social pressure and stigma on the guys. some guy ma find you perfectly attractive... but still reject or ignore you because if he became known as the guy who dated a fat girl, he would get a lot of hazing and grief from his ""bros"". as much as society likes to pick on fat people... they're just as hard on guys who voluntarily go for a fat girl.  this might be hard to handle, but that issue mostly goes away with age. by 25, most guys won't care about what their bros think and are much more likely to do what they want. by 30, they just don't care at all, and who you are is more important than what anyone else thinks.  also remember that some 65% of us women are overweight, half of those obese... but something like 85% of everyone is in a relationship. so that's a large chunk of ""fat girls"" who are still able to date.  how do i feel brave enough to ask someone out? honest truth? i don't. i'm a chickenshit coward. i'm absolutely terrified every time. but i do it anyways because it needs doing, and that's that. i don't have to like something to do it.  how do i tell if someone's interested in fat partners? simple... i ask them. usually disguised as the above ""asking out because it needs doing"". if they turn me down... it doesn't matter if it's because i'm fat, i'm already turned down and they're not gonna change their mind. if they say yes, then they're obviously interested in fat.  there is no other way to ask, nor should there be. the only other way to tell is to see if they already have a fat gf/wife and aren't embarrassed to be seen with them. on the downside, they're obviously not single then...  it's not hopeless. it's easier to find guys into big girls online, but that just means that offline... stop worrying about what they might like, and just go for it.",1,2,

""simple and complex carbohydrates can prevent weight loss. the body stores approximately three days worth of carbohydrates, therefore, our protocol restricts sugars (simple and complex) until 100% of your weight loss goal is achievedâ€¦why? because, as long as sugar is being consumed, your body may not be burning fat."" aka keto with a fancy name and md attached. except keto where you have to replace multiple meals with no carb low fat protein shakes to ""charge your metabolism""-not their words, but same gross useless gimmick.  the cracks started appearing when i was dating my first girlfriend after my first year at college-there was more than a decade between us, and she was morbidly obese, but she lifted weights on occasion and had gone running once, so it's not like she was lazy or unathletic.   she and i would talk about how hard it is to be butch, how hard it is to be in a body we felt uncomfortable in, how hard it is to be fat. we were in an open relationship, and while i was there someone on okcupid had a high match with me-but in her profile, she explicitly stated that she didn't believe in fat acceptance, and that weight loss is possible for everybody-no excuses. this totally freaked me out. how could someone say that out loud? i had heard of racists stating that they only wanted to date white people, but for someone to openly flaunt their fatphobia? i was nauseated and horrified. my girlfriend told me that sometimes fat people lose weight and become the worst type of person-an ""ex fat"". ex fats think they can fix everybody by having them lose weight. ex fats think that just because they lost weight, everybody can lose weight. ex fats are unsympathetic bigots who seek to undermine body positivity and fat acceptance. i blocked the woman on okcupid.   but over a year, i realized that while she said that she never ate because she was always feeling ill, she seemed to eat a lot-just not normal meals-lots of snacks. we ate takeout two or three times every time we saw each other, and occasionally pasta with butter or popcorn. she had real health issues that i don't want to talk about here, but i didn't understand why she didn't try and change her diet and see if it made her feel better. think ""eats dairy and is lactose intolerant"" or ""has celiacs and eats gluten anyway"". shit where there is a really physical issue, but not eating certain foods was simply out of the question. and while she often talked about the gym, she had a really hard time getting there-which i can sympathize with immensely, but she was hardly the jock she thought of herself as.   after we broke up, i visited a friend for a week. this friend broke her spine several years ago, is in constant pain to some degree, is one of the best wheelchair athletes in her sport/division/ability class, runs her own farm, cooks for herself on a semi regular basis, and maintains a healthy weight.   and sure, we had microwave nachos for lunch a few times, and we went out to eat, and we baked cake and we ate ice cream and we went to waffle house several times and a local cafeteria where they serve sweet tea by the half gallon sized glass, but in visiting her i noticed that she ate a lot less than my ex. also, i rode her horses, and she filmed me so i could see what i was doing, and good god did i look huge on her horses-on the tiny pony and on her huge horse. nothing like skintight pants and a tucked-in polo shirt to emphasize your shitty posture and rotund shape.   the next fall, i was back in school, commuting, and eating on the meal plan during the day. i still wasn't counting calories, but i knew at this point that i was bigger than i'd ever been, and the thought of losing weight seemed impossible-but i figured that i should figure it out before i moved onto campus. all at the same time i started counting calories, found this sub, and the weight flew off. at christmastime. i lost the first few pounds during december, and haven't stopped losing since.   i think i was ready. i was sick of being told by fat women that you can't stop being fat, and i was sick of thin women saying that they didn't do anything special-they ate whatever they want and they were thin anyway, so obviously you'll never be thin if you're not like them.   i knew that bodybuilders could control their weight, and weightlifters too-and not just by spitting into water bottles and running in sweatsuits. i saw that calorie counting worked for these people, and i was sick and tired of growing out of clothes, growing out of bras, growing into sweatpants that should have been huge and baggy. i was sick of having huge breasts and thighs and hips. i wanted to be slim. i wanted to be able to go braless, to be skinny and androgynous, not fat and androgynous. so i just... gave calorie counting a go.   and it worked.   and it will never stop working.   thanks for gold kind stranger!",1,-1,0

233024,"oh wow- here we go i guess. i have been hesitant to share- as i didn't want to trigger anyone, however i am glad we are finally able to share our stories and uplift one another. i have suffered from major bdd since i was in my early teens- and it is something that is still pervasive as i head into my 30s.  &amp;#x200b;  if i think about it- i have had body image issues since about the 7th grade. i remember my mother telling me that i was a large baby and i proceeded to be larger than most while growing up. i wasn't chubby necessarily- but i was sturdy (i wore husky sizes, if that is even still a thing lol!), and always on the taller end. by about 5th grade i was definitely chubby as i didn't play sports and i didn't get a lot of physical exercise.  &amp;#x200b;  7th grade was when i started to slim down, but i was made extremely insecure by the boys around. they called me ""bitch tits"" when changing for p.e. and made me extremely uncomfortable with how my body looked. it was made even worse when i went to a doctor's appointment and he stressed about just how obese i was- even though i was only on the heavier end of acceptable weight for my age and height. this destroyed my confidence as everywhere i turned- i felt that i was made to feel that my body was not acceptable as it was.  &amp;#x200b;  i continued to slim down going into 8th grade- but i began to develop an unhealthy relationship with exercise. i would exercise for 2+ hours after school as i no longer wanted to be the chubby boy that everyone at school used to harass. i was disgusted when i looked at myself in clothing and couldn't even stand to see myself without clothing. i saw someone who was morbidly obese despite the fact that i was a perfectly **normal** and **healthy**! and this persisted through most of high school even though i was even slimmer. i still saw an exaggerated version of myself at my heaviest.  &amp;#x200b;  high school saw me having an openly critical relationship with my body- commenting on how gross i looked in skinny jeans and dressing myself in the baggiest tops i could find. i eventually took up distance running, and would run a minimum of three miles even if it 90+ degrees fahrenheit outside and i felt that i would pass out. by my senior year- i had finally achieved a figure that i found acceptable! i was very thin. no muscle definition, just extremely thin (there is nothing wrong with being thin, but at this point i was not healthy and was not at a sustainable weight for myself).  &amp;#x200b;  i entered college with confidence but like most- i gained the freshman 15, and i went back to a state of self-loathing. i subscribed to thinspo and had a tumblr full of pictures with thigh gaps. i tortured myself- trying to achieve ""the ideal body"" that i wasn't blessed with having naturally. it was miserable and it was a subject of concern for my friends and romantic partners. i reached my lowest points in 2018. i developed an addiction to calorie counting in addition to my excessive exercising habits. i made sure to always end my day in a caloric deficit and eventually i reached a point of looking emaciated. what i saw was someone who looked like he should be on a high-fashion runway. what others saw? they saw someone who had bones protruding prominently from his frame. men's clothing didn't fit at all and i was on my way to sizing out of the smallest women's sizes available. i was thrilled by this and that is terrifying to think about because no matter how thin i was- i just couldn't see it!  &amp;#x200b;  eventually it became too much to sustain- and i eventually returned to an ideal weight for my frame and i went back to my period of self-loathing. i saw the same 14 year-old who was harassed for being chubby. then i discovered kibbe... at the end of 2019. what a difference that made for me.  &amp;#x200b;  i learned that all bodies were beautiful and you could wear specific clothing to enhance your body. this was revolutionary for me as while i was always fashion conscious and trendy- i thought the key to being fashionable was to be as thin as possible- then everything would be flattering. wrong. i was wearing pieces that were extremely unflattering as they were so big- they made me look shapeless or they were so clingy they made me look larger and more angular. but kibbe was a permission to work with my body as it is- and to learn how to best dress for my body. and i have been committed ever since.  &amp;#x200b;  i feel much more confident overall- as finding kibbe and utilizing those practices helped me to find balance in other aspects of my life. my wardrobe has been overhauled- as it now contains garments in fabrics and cuts that are harmonious with me as i naturally am. even more is that i learned to put a head-to-toe outfit together so that i always look put together. i can't say that i don't have days where i resent my body- but those days are so infrequent now that i don't have to worry about them. i realize now that i was never really large- i allowed others to convince me that i was.     i have really found this system to be a love-letter in self-acceptance and for that i am so appreciative of that. and i hope to others here- that they can use the system to help them in their journey of self-love. sorry for the novel- i just had a lot to say! lolol  &amp;#x200b;  in closing i just want to give notice to people that words have so much power, and throwaway comments have the possibility of sticking with a person for life. we should be mindful of our words and how that may impact someone. it's something i always try to keep in mind as a person who has been battling this for close to 15 years.",1,1,-1
503675,"there are some things you can do which are pretty accessible to anyone to help your appearance. you still might have issues, but the only thing you can do is balance out your flaws by drawing towards your ""above average"" features.  &gt; i believe that my physical apperance is why everyone hates me.   it is unfortunate that physical appearance is directly related to trustworthiness. but, it is something that will never truly change, so working around it is the only reliable way to improve the situation.  &gt; i'm short (5'6.5""), overweight by about 50 pounds (180lbs)  your height is very average. the amount you are overweight depends on your muscle composition. if you're going to be stuck with a ""masculine"" face, you might as well own it and strive for a more toned/muscular body with an androgynous look. i've seen some black women who have the masculine features but try to cover it up with silky extensions and layers of makeup and it might fool some guys, but really, you have to cater your look to your natural features.  &gt; my hair is long, dark, and curly  have you work your hair in a short afro? you might benefit from a hairstyle that distracts from your larger forehead, or at least compliments it (and adds perceived height).  &gt; and i have face, chest, and back acne.   i had acne problems when i was very fat in my early 20's. i lost 115 lbs about 5 years ago and that dealt with most of it. you might be able to solve a lot of your acne issues with a simple diet change. i will describe it below.  &gt; i have a high forehead, a jawline/chin that is too defined, and high cheekbones.   see my comment about owning a more masculine look.  &gt; my eyes are small and brown, my lips are not plump, and i have an ugly, fat, shapeless nose with flat/flared nostrils.   this sucks the most as it is something you can't change. you should use youtube/pinterest/instagram etc to find a basic routine to help bring out your lips and accentuate your eyes. slimming up your face through weight loss and clearing up your skin through diet should help with the proportion of your face a bit.  &gt; my cheeks are also fat, and i have dimples on my chin and cheeks when i smile.   see my note on fasting below.  &gt; oh, i also have no shape to my body, meaning that no matter how much weight i lose or how many squats i do, i will never have a nice figure.  this is wear fasting will come in to help you immensely. head over to subreddits like /r/fasting or /r/omad and do some reading. i used to have a handful of very angry red zits appear on my face/neck and i was really self conscious about it. i started low carb and fasting about 2 years ago and nothing has done better for my skin than fasting. 3 days into a fast, my skin is crystal clear. i am not saying that you should just stop eating for days at a time, as it is very tough unless you are a seasoned faster (i have been throwing in 24-48 hour fasts for over 2 years now).   focus on a fasting window, such as eating all of your daily calories from 4pm to 8pm. eat a small calorie deficit (500 or so) and only consume coffee/tea/water outside of the window. you can find out what your tdee is from the sidebar of those subreddits. supplement the diet with vitamins, biotin, and fish oil. they will all help with your hair and skin quality. you should be able to get rid of your excess weight is quick and healthful order.  &gt; i'll always just be a long limbed, short and fat torsoed freak with a giraffe neck.   you need to find clothing styles and workout routines that lengthen your small features and shrink the ones which are too large. below are some examples:  1) long legs can be counterbalanced with larger thighs and butt (not fat!), especially in conjunction with a small waistline. if you are naturally ""flat"" then you especially need to focus on lower body fat. women who store fat in their hips/thighs/ass can pull off a higher body fat percentage, but you don't sound like you're in that camp. you would benefit from reducing your body fat significantly, then focusing on heavy sets of leg exercises like squat, leg extension, leg curl, hip ad/abductor and lunges.   2) long arms/neck can be offset with larger shoulders. as you reduce body fat, be sure to add shoulder workouts such as dumbell fly, shrugs, overhead press, etc. working on getting bigger traps/delts will really help proportioning your neck! (the top of your natural shoulders will be closer to your head and the top of your arms will be wider, making the length of your arms less apparent).   &gt; to make matters worse, i am a black woman who is about the same complexion as drake. men hate black women and think they're ugly, so i've often thought about not bothering with dating.  you have to own your dark skin. don't try to lighten your skin, wear pounds of foundation, blonde wigs/crazy hair colors. work on improving your skin quality and evening your skin tone, reducing body fat, and building muscle/reducing body fat to proportion your body.   i really hope this helps. if you have any specific question about part of my advice, let me know. i had to resolve several unattractive features of mine in recent years so i can point you in the right direction if you need more info.",1,-2,1

does the following describe you?   -narrow shoulders -long limbs -naturally ""soft"" with not much muscle tone -you gain fat easily in the stomach and chest -small joints -wide waist -definitely not ""naturally athletic"" or strong   skinny-fat ectomorphs are their own category of body type. if you are this person, you are not just ""skinny"" but you also gain bodyfat easily.   skinny-fats actually have a medical term-metabolically obese normal weight person   skinny-fat men have become something of an epidemic. you see this bodytype constantly. it's like the ""dad bod"" except these guys are only in their teens and 20s.  why is this happening? why was this not occurrence 20-30 years ago?   one major reason   testosterone decline-testosterone levels have been declining for four decades, due to a combination of environmental estrogens, increased incidence of overweight men and women, unhealthy diet, and social-cultural trends away from masculine virtues and standards of ethics and conduct.   your testosterone levels as an adult male are highly highly influenced by your genetics and environment.   now, i cannot help how you grew up or who your parents were, but you can change your physiology to a significant degree by how you live, train, and feed yourself.   -and to be fair, testosterone decline is not just in men. women have also seen lowered test levels, higher bodyfat levels, and are very hormonally unhealthy. this applies to women as well.   situation made aware, what do you do if this is you?   here the 12 strategies you need to implement (and things to avoid)   1. fix your hormones-the food you eat affects your hormonal health. for skinny fats, eating a high sugar, high carb, processed food diet, and especially drinking lots of alcohol, this is going to wreck your health.  high amounts of sugar negatively impacts testosterone, high carbs reduces insulin sensitivity and makes you more prone for fat gain. drinking lots of beer and dark alcohol also lowers test and increases estrogen.   for skinny fats, a ""clean"" diet is a must. further, you are likely a candidate for benefitting from supplements. vitamin d, magnesium, zinc, and fish oil can all improve your test levels, lower total systemic inflammation, help you get better sleep (which also supports your testosterone levels) and make you healthier overall  2. recognize you can't get away with an unhealthy lifestyle-in light of your hormonal profile and overall bodytype, be honest with yourself and realize you need to be discplined and take control of your health. you do not have the genetics to get away with being lax and not caring about these things.  3. carb cycle-in light of fixing your diet, skinny fats benefit immensely from an insulin controlled lifestyle. what does that mean? it means you limit your bodies release of insulin through carefully controllling your carb intake. carb cycling=adjusting your carb intake based on your activity levels each day a moderate to lower carb diet of clean carbs from rice, grains, starches, fruit is what you need to be doing.   on training days, have carbs before and during training. only if you have gotten leaner do you have carbs after training. front load your carbs  on non-training days, keep them to a minimum. meat and veggies diet for you  if you do not train at all, your diet should consist largely of protein and veggies each and every day.   4. get leaner, but dont obsess about getting ripped-if you are skinny fat, you have no muscle to be ripped in the first place your first priority is to start building some muscle and and get your bodyfat down to a healthier level.   until you have built your body up, divorce the idea that you are going to ""cutdown"" and suddenly reveal muscle defintion. you dont have any  5. do not ""bulk and cut""-plain speaking, you dont have the genetics to pull this off. skinny fats gain fat when they try to bulk, and lose muscle when they try to cut. you need to be ""living lean, training mean, eating clean"" year around.   6. calorie cycle-calorie cycle means you change the amount of calories you eat each day based on your activity levels. there are a few ways to do this  if you are not too fat  -eat in a calorie deficit on days you don't lift, and you eat at caloric maintenance (or in a slight surplus) on days you do lift.   if you've got a fair amount of fat to lose -eat in a slight deficit 5 days out of the week, eat at maintenance on the weekends  if you are very fat -eat in a deficit for as long as it takes to lose the fat. have an occasional refeed day for psychological relieif and to keep energy levels up   7. dont try to be a powerlifter-guess what, you have small joints, are skinny, and are not naturally strong. trying to powerlift with ""starting strength"" and doing set of 5 is never going to work for you. this approach is going to get you injured, fat, and you wont even look like you lift.   8. bodybuilding-skinny fats need moderate to high volume and lots of sets and reps. to change your physiology, your body needs a lot of of constant and sustained stimulus  9. dont worry about your 1rm-youre never going to set records, and your 1rm is never going to go up unless you build muscle first. focus on your 10rm for your main exercises, and test your 1rm sparingly only a few times a year on your main lifts  10. don't overtrain-skinny fat people tend to have lousy recovery capacity. while i recommend lots of volume, overall training intensity needs to be moderate. don't go into the gym trying to bury yourself every time you train. keep your workouts at 45-60 minutes, and leave feeling energized, not destroyed  11. bodyweight work-skinny fats tend to have fragile joints. because of this, and because your relative strength is probably lousy, bodyweight work (dips, chins, squats, lunges, inverted rows, pushups) should comprise a significant part of your training, especially if you are a relative beginner.   12. sprinting-slow cardio is helpful, but sprints/intervals can really change your physique. doing hill sprints, incline treadmill sprints, farmers walks, sled pushes, hitting a heavy bag, rowing, spin bike or airdyne bike, these forms of cardio are intense, can build muscle, and will elevate your metabolism far more than just walking/running.   incorporate sprinting 2-3 days a week. sprints do not mean high intensity interval workouts (hiit). hiit is a highly bastardized form of training thats usually done wrong.  sprints are done as intervals with appropriate rest in between a sprint workout is 5-10 sets of 10-30 second sprints, and shouldnt take more than 20 minutes to complete  add your sprints at the end of your training sessions, on the days you dont train legs.   so maybe more than 12 strategies   13. supportive gear-wrist wraps, elbow wraps, a belt, and knee sleeves are all things skinny-fats should take advantage of, regardless of training level. supportive gear will help keep your joints health, reduce joint stress, and allow you to get stronger/bigger over time  14. train high frequency-3-4 days a week probably wont cut it for you. to change your physique, training high frequency 5-6 days a week is the strategy to try. moderate, 45 minute workouts, training the whole body twice a week, that will change your body much faster than only 3-4 days.   15. shoulders, upper chest, traps, biceps, triceps, lats-these are the muscles you need to prioritize. when you have a wide waist and narrow shoulders, even a slight amount of abdominal fat can make you look sloppy. train shoulders and arms twice a week, make all your chest work incline work, and work the lats on every upper body day. wider lats will help make your waist look smaller and your upper body bigger  16. belief-you must have the mentality that you control the destiny of your health and your body. do not resign yourself to ""this just how i am"". no, you can change, you have the tools to change, and use them",1,-1,1

252963,"&gt; how much did it cost to build?   i wish i had an accurate number. the cost of the major components:  * 15"" mirror from nova optics: $800 (cheap because it's 2"" thick and heavy!) * 3.1"" secondary from ostahowski optics: $250 * lightweight feathertouch focuser: $600 * 60mm stellarvue raci finder: $190  the real issue was that i designed parts in such a way that i needed specialized hardware, which had to be ordered from places like mcmaster carr. this meant having to buy 5 of something i only needed 1 of, and pay shipping. so hardware got expensive real fast.  i also wanted some aesthetic style to it, so i splurged for expensive brass knobs from mcmaster carr (the 2"" brass collimation knobs i used were $25 each!). i couldn't find black anodized aluminum tubing, so i bought some heavy duty large heatshrink tubing to shrink around satin anodized aluminum tubes. this gave them a nice matte finish and a comfortable grip.   also spent extra money buying different kinds of flocking material to see which one was superior.   overall a very cost-inefficient project.  i would say that all-in, i spent about $3,800 on it (which is still half the cost of a custom premium dob!). if i wanted to do it cheaply, i could have done it for less than half that.  &gt; was it difficult to build?  yes. very. but i had specific performance requirements for it. features that were non-negotiable:  ## 1. minimal backlash at high power (1,000x).   this meant a very stiff structure and careful consideration of the truss design. the truss is a compound truss, meaning it's not just 8 poles sticking straight out, but it actually has an inward lean of 3 degrees so that all 8 poles are always in some combination of tension and compression. this keeps the structure rigid.   ## 2. no ladder needed  eyepiece height had to be such that i didn't need a ladder or stool to look through the scope. this meant the lowest possible rocker box. it also meant balancing the focal plane distance such that it fully illuminated the fields of my widest eyepieces, provided enough focuser travel, and allowed for the shortest possible truss poles given those other two requirements. even adding 1/2"" of length to the truss poles and moving the focal plane distance inward could have meant zenith viewing wouldn't work, so i made sure to plane for a focuser height of exactly 63.5"" off the ground.   ## 3. no counterweights  this scope was mathematically balanced on paper. i measured the weight of ***everything*** i could, and calculated what i couldn't. i didn't want this scope to be weighed down with 20 pounds of counterweights. its balance had to account for my lightest eyepieces, and heaviest eyepieces, and binoviewer. this meant calculating the right force of friction that would keep the scope in place when switching that gear, which meant calculating the diameter of the bearings, where the center of mass was, how far apart the altitude pads were etc.   the center of mass relative to an arbitrary point on the back of the scope was calculated for literally everything. every screw, washer, piece of wood, eyepiece -- *everything*. literally every single gram of weight was factored in. i measured the mass of a known dimensional piece of wood and then computed the rest to determine the center of mass of the mirror box before i even built it.   the result? spot on balance. the only thing that was a question mark was the coefficient of friction of teflon against formica 909-42 laminate. i did my best to measure it myself, but i don't have equipment accurate enough to know exactly what it was. it also depends on the temperature of the materials, so even with all of that math, there's still some guess work and margin for error.   if anything i would say there's more friction than i actually needed to keep the scope in place when switching equipment, but not much. i can adjust this by bringing the altitude pads closer together anyway.   ## 4. must weigh less than my 12"" lightbridge  my 12"" lightbridge clocks in at a whopping 136 pounds in total. but this 15"" build has a heavy 2"" thick mirror to deal with. while i haven't quite completed the rockerbox for it (still using the prototype), so far it's 8 pounds lighter than my 12"". that's a pretty good feat considering this scope has a proportionally heavier mirror, and lots of ""extras"" that aren't necessary (brass knobs, heat shrink wrap on the poles)  ## 5. must have excellent contrast  i flocked the shit out of this thing. the entire rocker box is flocked, including the face of it that is facing the secondary. there is flocking opposite the focuser in the upper cage, and the feathertouch focuser i'm using has baffles in it. the one deficiency is i think i made the uta too shallow. if you put your eye at the focuser, you can see the ground outside of the uta. this means stray light can get in. however, the baffling of the focuser controls most of it.  i also made the spider vanes ultra thin. they are just 0.008"" thick aluminum flashing in an offset spider configuration. despite being so thin, the configuration makes them *extremely* rigid. you can't budge the secondary no matter how much you try  ## 6. must have thermal management  a 2"" thick mirror takes *ages* to thermally acclimate, and in the fall when days are warm and nights are cool, a 2"" thick mirror will effectively never acclimate on its own. too much thermal mass. so i made sure it has lots of cooling fans to assist in the cooling. there is a large rear 140mm high speed fan, and 4 smaller 60mm fans in the upper corners of the rockerbox that blow on the surface of the mirror. this lets me cool both the front and back of the mirror (not quite evenly, since the big high speed fan is more powerful than the 4 front fans, but it's better than not having them at all).   ## 7. must have a secondary dew heater  in the winter, frost and fog was a big problem with my 12"" secondary and it cut many observing nights short. i didn't want that problem, so i designed and built a custom secondary dew heater out of nichrome wire. i have yet to need it, but it's there if i do.   the secondary mirror was particularly challenging because i didn't want to use a heavy astrosystems secondary holder and take the extra light path intrusion. so i opted to adhere the secondary to a plate of carbon fiber using silicon blobs. the carbon fiber has a similar thermal coefficient as the glass of the mirror, and the silicon blobs help absorb any difference such that the stress is not induced into the secondary, and it remains flat. the cf itself was also screwed to the maple secondary stalk using o-rings as stress relievers so that moisture changes with the maple dowel wouldn't induce stress into the cf plate either. basically, the secondary mirror is as decoupled from sources of stress as possible.  so far there is no hint of astigmatism from a stressed secondary even at 1150x magnification, so the clarity of the view is excellent. but we'll see what winter time is like though, as all of this was assembled at room temperature.  ## 8. must support my binoviewer  i bought a nice binoviewer for my 12"" and have never had good views through it. the reason being the moonlight focuser on the 12"" simply cannot handle the weight of the binoviewer + 2x powermate + eyepeices. it sags by quite a bit, and as such, breaks collimation, resulting in soft views.   to ensure this wouldn't happen in this scope, i made the focuser board extra thick. it's actually 1.06"" thick whereas most focuser boards are 1/2"" or less. i created a test rig where i put my laser collimator in a makeshift ""focuser"" attached to different focuser boards, and placed twice the moment arm on this focuser that the normal focuser would endur. i then placed the rig at some arbitrary distance from a wall, and measured the deflection of the laser under load to calculate the angle it would be off by. a 1"" thick board was the only one that limited deflection enough. and that was worst case scenario of a fully horizontal focuser. in reality, the focuser would be at an angle and carry a smaller moment arm, so the deflection is essentially zero. the focuser itself sags more under the weight of the binoviewer than the board does!  while i probably over-engineered and over-thought lots of this scope, i can say it has at least paid off. i've had the best views of the planets i've ever had, hands down. the scope thermally acclimates, collimates precisely, has great contrast, and is easy to track objects with at magnifications exceeding 1,000x. it's not perfect by any means, and i'll be making some improvements to it (as well as learning some lessons for a larger build in the future), but this is hands down the best scope i've ever owned (both optically and mechanically). was well worth the extra planning.  if you want to see some pictures of the build process, check out my gallery of it on cloudy nights: https://www.cloudynights.com/gallery/album/11062-15-dob-build/",0,,
427712,"â€œdonâ€™t you think itâ€™s kind of odd?â€  â€œwell, yeah. but itâ€™s probably just a coincidence.â€  ryan didnâ€™t think that it was, but jason seemed convinced. he looked down at the pair of little jade statues that he and jason had purchased in the shopping arcade out of the shrine they had visited. it was the last day of their vacation to tokyo, and while they werenâ€™t in the market for the â€œpiece of japanâ€ souvenirs for sale, something about the statues was undeniably intriguing.  both statues were of cartoonishly rotund sumo wrestlers in full sporting attire. every part of their body seemed absurdly thick and curvy, from their thick necks to bulging loincloths. one had his leg up in the air, ready to stomp down hard on the ground. the other was crouched on the ground, waiting for the match to begin. both had determined looks on their faces, brows creased and mouths ready to shout. they were cute, though, and the man selling them had offered them at a steal of a price, but what was so unusual about them was their faces. ryan was convinced that he saw jasonâ€™s face in the crouching wrestler, while jason was equally sure that he saw ryanâ€™s face in the other.  â€œweâ€™ll have to find somewhere in the apartment to put them,â€ jason said. â€œmaybe in that shelf between the kitchen area and the bedroom.â€Â   â€œsure,â€ ryan said. â€œare you sure thatâ€™s not bad feng shui or something?â€  â€œhell if i know,â€ jason said. â€œi just want to get rid of the old, half-burned down candles we have there.â€  â€œfair enoughâ€ ryan said with with a slight laugh.Â   jason and ryan had been inseparable ever since they met in college. best friends, roommates, brothers from another mother. they had moved into a warehouse apartment a few months back, and ryan had to admit that neither of them was necessarily good at decorating. but he agreed with jason that the statues would add a bit of color and life to the place.  as soon as the two men retuned home, jason cleared off the shelf and placed the statues there, facing each other. once they were there, both of them agreed that the statues fit perfectly, as if the self was designed just for them. neither of them thought too much about it, but both agreed that they gave the place a bit of an energetic refresh.  that night, however, both men admitted to the other that they had had dreams that could generously be called â€œunusual.â€ dreams of conflict, of ancient landscapes, of towers of jade. they shook it off as the effect of extreme fatigue and jet lag, but something about it stuck in the back of their minds. the next morning, they woke up ravenously hungry, and as ryan devoured a double-sized breakfast, he swore that he saw the statues smiling at him.Â   two months laterâ€¦  â€œwhat the hell happened to these pants?â€ jason complained, grunting as he tried to get his jeans on. â€œi canâ€™t get these damn things past my thighs!â€  â€œthose are skinny jeans, jason,â€ ryan said. â€œyouâ€™re not skinny.â€  â€œfuck you,â€ jason said, half meaning it. it was true. ryan wasnâ€™t skinny, not anymore. while the two had certainly never missed a day in the gym, they had decided to ditch their cardio and focus exclusively on lifting heavy and lifting hard. they had begun eating heavier, too, as if in a constant bulking cycle.Â   â€œwhatever,â€ ryan said. â€œi think you like it. i see the way you eat your pancakes.â€ he slipped on a pair of sweatpants that despite being new and a size larger than he thought he needed, seemed to stretch tightly over the large bubble butt heâ€™d developed over the past few weeks.  â€œlet a man eat his pancakes,â€ jason said. â€œno matter how many he wants.â€ jason threw the jeans to the side and began looking for his own new sweats.  â€œyou mean the stack of twelve you eat as an appetizer?â€ ryan asked as jason slipped the sweats on. jason turned around and took heavy strides toward ryan.  â€œhey, youâ€™re just as bad,â€ jason said. â€œyouâ€™d run a waffle house out of business.â€ for emphasis, he patted ryanâ€™s belly, something neither of them had had for nearly their whole lives. â€œyou fat little pig.â€Â   ryan knew jason was just teasing. heâ€™d been doing a lot of that lately, bordering on flirting. but ryan gave just as good as he got. he straightened up his back, puffed out his meaty chest, and hit a double bi pose, his muscles still prominent and large but lacking definition.  â€œwho you calling a pig, you little oinker?â€ ryan asked with a smirk. jason responded with a smile and jumped on ryan, nearly pinning him to the ground. ryan fought back, rolling jason over and landing hard on top of him, their beefy bodies pressed together. as jason playfully struggled underneath him, his thickness jiggling ever so slightly, ryan began to feelâ€¦aroused. and that was also something that had never happened before.  â€œdude, are you getting hard?â€ jason asked. ryan almost responded when jason took the opportunity to roll over, pinning ryan for just a second. as the two rolled around, laughing as they wrestled, they heard a rattling sound near the shelf the statues were on. maybe it was just a result of their roughhousing shaking things up, but they swear that the statues looked liked theyâ€™d moved closer together.Â   another two months laterâ€¦  ryan and jason were in the second hour of their nightly meal. they had stopped going out to the gym, opting instead to work out on a heavy-duty home gym system. it made it easier to get a quick post-workout bulking meal in, and anyway, none of their exercise gear fit anymore. as it was, the two men attended their massive dinner wearing a pair of bathrobes. no matter how big they bought their clothes, they seemed to outgrow them in no time.  meals almost entirely consisted of a mix of rice, chicken, fish, and vegetables served in mass quantities. the two would cook the mix in enormous batches, daily stockpiling tubs of the stuff only to empty them all by the end of the day. ryan joked that it was an â€œextreme clean bulkâ€ cycle that never seemed to end.  after the meal, the men lay back, belching contentedly and rubbing their large ball bellies. jason always loved this part most, as he found great amusement in seeing how large he could make his stomach expand with every meal. his ripped set of abs seemed a distant memory, and even the days when he had only a slight paunch seemed forever ago.  â€œthat was the best meal ever,â€ jason said, punctuating his statement with a loud belch.  â€œyou say that every night,â€ ryan said.Â   â€œlike you donâ€™t enjoy it,â€ jason said. â€œyou eat more than i do.â€  â€œat least when i eat, my hair doesnâ€™t come loose,â€ ryan said, pointing to jasonâ€™s head. jason raised his hand to where ryan was pointing.  â€œawww, man,â€ ryan said. â€œyouâ€™ll have to redo the knot. waddle that fat ass over here.â€  ryan slowly got up off of his reinforced chair, waddling over to jasonâ€™s side of the table. jason took a moment to take ryan in: his powerful thunder thighs, his huge belly, his beefy pecs, his thick shoulders and arms. he had to admit ryan was wonderfully fat, a concept that only a few months ago would have seemed impossible. in fact, it seemed like the bigger he got, the most beautiful he became.  â€œhold still, big guy,â€ ryan said, grabbing the stray hair. along with their increasing appetites and expanding bodies, both men were surprised to find that the hair on their head was growing at an absurdly fast rate. they had at first started wearing it in ponytails, but that was impractical. there was too much danger of the hair getting caught in the weight machine. so thanks to google and youtube, they had learned how to tie hair in a topknot, even if neither was an expert at it yet.  â€œon second thought,â€ jason said. â€œdonâ€™t fix it. i have a feeling itâ€™s going to come loose anyway.â€ jason stood up and turned to ryan, placing his hand on ryanâ€™s chubby face. ryan took his hand and shoved him closer, sending the two falling and rolling onto one of the two piles of mattresses on the floor. they had given up their bed frames, as the creaking of the base boards under their weight kept them from sleeping well.Â   jason landed on top of ryan with a thud. ryan looked up with a smile, playfully shaking his body, causing every ounce of fat to jiggle. he grabbed jasonâ€™s ample butt with both hands, smacking the huge fleshy mounds hard. jason smirked and pinned ryanâ€™s hands to the mattress.  â€œwhat are you going to do, sumo boy?â€ ryan said. jason responded by hungrily kissing his best friend, almost like a reflex. ryan immediately kissed back, his tongue wrestling with jasonâ€™s. hands explored plump tits and full bellies while two pairs of thick thighs rubbed together. one of them sighed while the other one moaned in pleasure.  on the shelf behind them, the statues moved closer together, almost touching.",1,2,

""well, which is it?"" the 'genie' asked.  ""what?"" the boy asked, brilliantly.  ""are ya dreamin'? or is this just a fantasssssyyy?"" he, it was a he, not a hot blonde like he'd seen portrayed before. he wasn't even blue , like the other famous genie. and he was humming queen.

"" fine. i want a different family. happy?"" ""no. why would i be? you're an ass, and i have to do what you say. would that make you happy?"" ""story of my life."" the kid muttered.  ""not anymore."" the genie declared. ugh. he was an ugly fella. old and wrinkly, too.   ""are you going to gaze lovingly at me all evening, or see if it came true?""  he ran home. never before had he ran home. he saw his house in the distance. the closer he got, the more he realized what a fool he'd been. for a brief moment, he had hope, which he hadn't allowed in a long time. there was no new family. there couldn't be. just his doped, drunk mother. his old, senile grammy. which ever guy had gotten his script filled that week and had been unlucky enough to meet them.   he started up the porch. did his mother clean up? had they been robbed? no, nobody wanted junk. he opened the door. 80's music hit him in the face. the smells of fried chicken, and something sweet wafted towards him. holy shit. holy shit. holy shit.   he cautiously approached the kitchen. everything looked different now that he had stopped looking with eyes of disbelief. he heard someone humming along with the radio.   ""ma?"" he poked his head around the corner.  ""ma, ma?! when did you start calling me something so disrespectful?"" a smartly dressed, auburn-haired woman was standing by the stove, looking expectantly towards him.  ""well? do you need your tv taken away again? can you not even understand simple etiquette?""  he was shocked. she didn't care about propriety, or silly things like manners, ""sorry, ma'am, er, mother...?""  "" are you not sure? do i need to remind you of the awful labor, and what a horrible child you were?"" oh, no. she was different alright.   "" i'm sorry.

""really? because it's been so nice this far?"" the boy, who's name wasn't christopher, hung his head. the heartless, sociopathic genie was right. what did he expect?  why had he had any expectations. he sighed,  resigned.  "" i want to see the future."" ""you want to, or you wish to?"" he had to choose his words carefully.  "" i want to see if i'll be happy. if i'll ever find love. if anyone will ever be there, no matter what. someone who cares if i drown or not, who cares about how i feel. someone who doesn't treat me like i'm a burden for being born. someone who can hold my hand, or show me what a hug feels like. someone to take the pain away."" tears were falling down the kids face. he didn't know he could still cry. he thought emotions were for the weak. he stifled his feelings, and gathered up the words.  ""show me who will love me.""  in an instant, he saw a scene, holographic, playing out in front of him. a woman. small, head down, sitting in a chair. waiting for something. her head pops up. a noise, a car, can be heard . she jumps up, facing the door.  the door opens with a bang. it slams against the wall,  and the woman, pretty in a tired way, pales and cowers.   ""fucking day i had. everyone has shit to say! no ones got shit to back it. i'll prove that i can handle them!""  the woman stands there, worried. ""i'm so sorry, baby."" she manages, softly. he looks at her, as if she just appeared.  ""yeah? are you? i don't think you know what i mean. you aren't jumping up to my defense or nothin'.""  "" you know how i feel, i'm sure you can fix it tomorrow. you know i think you're amazing and all."" she really believed this. she loved him. no matter what he did. he was broken. she could take his pain. she was made for him; knew him like she knew her own breath.   the devious genie shifted his eyes to the boy standing in front of him.

"" pfft, shhh. you control your dest....  all that. watch.""  the boy, as a man, is driving in an older, but clean farm truck. he sees a bunch of wildflowers along the road. he smiles and slows the vehicle. whistling, he stops and inspects each flower before choosing it for his pile. he gets back in the dusty hay-filled truck. shortly, he pulls up to the same house the boy/man used to live in. the small woman is on the larger-now porch. the house has grown by two stories and 1,500 sq ft. he looks up, and gives a sheepish wave.  he gathers his apology up and walks to his lady.   "" i'm an asshole."" "" no. you can't hel........"" "" you have to stop making excuses for my shit. tell me if you're unhappy, don't placate me."" "" i'm here for you. to love you. always will be. your temper...it just reminds me of worse times."" "" i'm not him. but, i know. you saved me. always remember that. here, these are yours. i'm gonna do cool shit like that more. promise."" they embrace and the woman softens. the evening light bathes them and her face is beautiful and content.   the images vanish. the old, ornery genie winked at the kid.  "" well, son, you rose above your shit. good for you. maybe. depends on what.."" "" i want my old family back."" no hesitation.  "" yeah? ya sure?""  a sly grin replaces the harsh countenance that had been the creatures default.  "" that's the only way i'll get her. if i live with what i've got and become..that guy. did you see what he did to this place?! i can do this. i can. yeah."" he shook hisself, as if he was clearing his head.

963925,"&gt;the first is the increasing obesity problem (which, btw, is probably a lot more complicated that ""people are too lazy"")  true, there is no one reason people are becoming fatter. let's go over some.   **genetics**. ok, so some people are naturally going to gain weight easier than their (seemingly unfairly) skinny counter parts. also, some people have bigger bone and muscle structures with more fat to boot, meaning no amount of dieting and exercise will make them look skinny. obviously we cannot expect them to be as skinny as the ""[ectomoprphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somatotype)"" body type, but that doesn't mean obesity is acceptable either. i realize that for a distinct minority, a thyroid problem means they can't be anything but obese, but as i said, this is a distinct genetic minority. the ability to repeatedly pass along traits to children often has genetic reasons comfused with...  **parenting**. there's no doubt that children who have been taught by example that eating junk/fast food and not exercising is ""normal"" are more likely to be obese, just like their parents. do these kids deserve sympathy for having something out of their control that is  their upbringing? yes. does it excuse obesity? no, not at all. the only time following such parenting becomes ""ok"" is when they succumb to...  **ignorance**. yep. many have bad parents, but learn good behavior from being socialzed in the real world. i'm sure there are still people out there who grow into being adults never knowing not knowing their lifestyle is a problem until their doctor tells them after they come in complaining about losing feeling in their right arm due to a weight related heart attack or something. i would again place these people in a minority, as more and more schools and tv programs and internet sites seem to promote health and basic steps towards becoming healthy. you would have to live in the woods to not get it.   anyways, there's also **class**. high caloric foods are cheaper due to subsidity/ease of production making it a better buy, though i'm pretty sure lean lunch meat and bread is always going to be a better buy than going to mcdonalds. also, someone working 2 or 3 jobs probably doesn't have time to ""hit the gym"".  so, in the end, though i guess i few people can get cut exceptions, i would say ""laziness"" *is* the number 1 factor in obesity. it's obviously compounded by other factors, but i would put it at the top of the list.   &gt;and the second problem is society's reaction to the influx of overweight people. namely, since there are fewer and fewer thin people around they are becoming increasingly attractive simply because it is now a hard to find trait.  i disagree. i guess i can't speak for other guys, but i find a whole plethora of women attractive, ranging from tall to short, thick to skinny, all races and creeds. that said, a thick girl isn't ""obese"" *pre se*, she just isn't skinny. doesn't mean she's unhealthy. i think the media are behind on this.  &gt;at one point in time im sure overweight women were society's ideal.  and paisty white!  &gt;so being overweight is bad, but you aren't as far off from being normal as you think you are simply because society currently thinks ultra thin is sexy.  ok, your line of thinking can justify healthy curvy girls, but if we are talking about 200 pound girls like the article says, then that is a bad use of this line of thinking. that goes from healthy thick to overweight pretty quick, and we shouldn't give these girls a free pass just because ""oh the media only likes the ultra skinny"" or ""oh some guy likes you for a fetish""",1,-2,1

210417,"&gt; that's a good point, but i don't see why this is not also the case for a private health insurer  because private health insurers aren't competing on the basis of outcome, which their clients are unable to verify, they are competing on the basis of *perception*. basically, marketing. the only agents with a stake in the actual outcome of treatment are society and government.  &gt; plus, given the option, i'd rather take a form of coverage that provides only catastrophic coverage,  the realization you need to come to is that this is *never* going to be an option. no agent in a private health insurance system has a stake in providing only *necessary* treatments.  another fact you're not taking into account is pre-existing conditions. should people die because of pre-existing conditions? this depends on what kind of society you want to live in and i suspect your answer is 'no'. but given that government will have to intervene in order to subsidize treatment for people with such conditions, you run into enormous problems.  because you can't cleanly separate pre-existing conditions from catastrophic symptoms. and as our diagnostic medical technology advances, the two will mix more and more. imagine if failure to have a gene that gives you resistance to hiv got classified as a pre-existing condition. what about male homosexuality, which makes you more exposed to hiv?  &gt; i think that there are more lightweight ways around the problem, like isolating those doctors who recommend treatment and those doctors who provide specialized treatment.  when you say that this is a lightweight solution, you are fantasizing. trust me on this, if you speak to any expert, or even informed amateur, on the subject of computer security. if you ask them about the problem of isolating agents from (cooperating with each other in ways that you dislike) when they need to (cooperate with each other to *do their job*), the answer is ""it can't be done"". even partial solutions are bulky, heavy and totalitarian.  the most lightweight, *cleanest* means of eradicating unnecessary surgery is to pay directly on the basis of outcome. so when a doctor chooses the patients which he will treat, these patients come with statistical data attached to them. basically, everything a medical insurer could conceive of to determine someone's life expectancy. this life expectancy is automatically calculated and the doctor is paid (or punished) depending on how long, and how healthy, he keeps his patients alive. if a doctor suggested unnecessary treatments, it would come out of his profits. if he didn't provide necessary treatments, it would also come out of his profits. this would be a perfect *cleanly separated* system, with minimal to zero overhead beyond the medical accountants doing the data crunching.  by the way, you should probably know that having two-steps (recommender / treater or general practitioner / specialist) is the number 1 (hell, the only one) reason for long waiting lists. it doesn't seem to matter whether the system is public or private, but as soon as you add roadblocks you create enormous waiting lists. and if it's necessary surgery, then people die.  &gt; i'm not an expert on the railroad industry, but my understanding is that they often are and have been separated -- at least the track infrastructure from the companies that use that track.  the infrastructure and operators have almost never been separated. the idea of separating them is entirely novel. in britain, one of the biggest champions of this separation (and generally of all things neo-liberal), people have died as a result. britain's railroads are a national embarrassment. and a deadly one at that.  note that i am talking about *meaningful* separation, not formal separation. in france for instance, rff provides infrastructure and sncf operates the trains. there is no meaningful separation between them.  &gt; basically, i don't want to see another iraq -- where the people of the united states get worked up and demand change, and a coalition of politicians select a scheme that is highly visible but does nothing to solve the problem and routes masses of money to industries paying lobbying fees.  have you considered that neo-liberal schemes are equally ineffective ""solutions"" to the problems of ailing industry? market reforms achieve nothing and solve nothing. but they invariably give the consultants and speculators who lobby for them great masses of money.  &gt; if we could get rid of bribery by getting rid of legalized lobbying, we would have done so by now   because the usa is of course an inferior country to sweden, finland, norway, switzerland, france, germany, and all the rest. they don't have these problems with political corruption. in sweden, a political scandal is a cabinet minister charging a toblerone bar on his government expense account. and immediately paying the money back. before anyone found out about it.  &gt; coal is currently, by far, the cheapest way to generate electricity,  this is false. nuclear power is now, and has been for the last thirty years, the cheapest means of generating electricity. it has been so consistently. irregardless of hypothetical global warming costs, irregardless of health care costs, and irregardless of pollution due to coal mining.  unfortunately, the coal industry is a very powerful industry. and you have to realize that nuclear power plants fill the same economic niche as coal power plants. they are after the exact same market. so whatever gains nuclear power has made in the last 30 years (and nuclear power's market share in the usa has steadily despite an effective moratorium on building new nuclear power plants) these gains have come at the expense of the coal industry.  so you can understand that the coal industry absolutely hates nuclear power and sees it as its enemy. now ask yourself this, how come:  1. france (which has no coal industry) built a nuclear industry 2. germany (which has a strong coal industry) is determined to phase out nuclear power (and is planning on building more coal power plants, as if by coincidence) 3. some treehugging fruitcakes (not exactly the kind of people who have deep financial pockets, let alone powerful political connections) managed to slow and then stop the construction of nuclear power plants in the usa?  you can imagine how the american coal industry breathed an enormous sigh of relief.  how the coal ^w environmental activists shackled the american nuclear industry, by causing its costs to rise to unmanageable levels, is actually a very interesting topic all on its own but i've written enough.  &gt; there may be ways to trap carbon dioxide at coal power plants  irrelevant. it wouldn't stop the pollution from coal mines. and it wouldn't matter anyways because all it would achieve is to make coal plants uneconomical. there are already ways to sequester carbon dioxide and they aren't used because they would cost about 20$ a tonne of co2.  &gt; i'm not equipped right now to make the correct economic call on what to do with respect to emissions.  there are many energy industry experts on the oil drum and eurotrib.com. they all agree that nuclear power is the only solution. i recommend the work of jÃ©rome a paris on eurotrib. he is an investment banker in the energy industry. he does not finance nuclear power plants and has no ties to the nuclear industry. he has deep ties to the renewable sector and especially to wind farms, since he finances *those*. and even he admits that nuclear power is a *necessity*. wind farms can't provide 100% of our electricity, solar power is ludicrously expensive, and coal power plants are simply unacceptable.  &gt; a tax basically says ""this is how much damage we believe to be causing   at least you're calling for a tax. many people call for tradeable carbon emissions rights. in theory they are identical, in practice they are very different. from [source](http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2006/12/3/13597/2556):  ""mommy, where do carbon offsets come from?""  ""well, you see sweetheart, when a major polluter and a consultant love money very, very much, they express that love in a special way. nine months later, the consultant produces an extremely large paper packet.""   &gt; maybe there's a great application for the waste products of coal power production  there isn't. some plants have experimented with recovering the heavy metals in their ash, but it is generally uneconomical. some plants have also experimented with venting co2 to greenhouses. you'll find this sort of thing in the netherlands. it's actually a good idea but it still doesn't come close to nuclear power. for one thing, europe doesn't have cheap coal and australia surely has limits on its exporting capacity.  &gt; at one point, natural gas was considered a waste product of oil extraction   at one point, gasoline was considered a waste product of kerosene refining. :)  &gt; i don't think that it's impossible to say that it might become profitable to make contain and use coal power generation waste products. why not keep that possibility open?  because it's not worth it? because making the switch to nuclear would save tens of thousands of lives each and every year? as well as be cheaper? and take a load off of the healthcare system? as well as generate technical know-how and expertise which will become valuable in the future? coal in a technology of the past, nuclear is the technology of the future. why stay stuck in the past until geology and rising extraction costs *force* you to change? vain hope is not a sound basis for an energy policy. and hey, you do realize that carbon sequestration costs *might* come down in 20 years but a nuclear power plant will eliminate that carbon (and pollution and mining) the moment it comes online?",0,,

from your core, being distributed up and downwards to different parts of your body. the vest eventually finishes its tightening, as you are left with a curvy but petite looking waist. your core, now devoid of fat, shows off a washboard stomach with abs being almost visible, although you lack a lot of muscle.  next you feel the fat deposits from your stomach begin to settle, having found their required places on your body. you feel a pressure build in your chest; the fat having settled there.  â€œoh, this is gonna be good!â€ you hear your friend say, still stood behind you. although her voice sounds different, now appearing slightly more refined and taking on an american twinge. confused by her voice, youâ€™re easily shocked when you notice her hands reach around your front from behind. she grips your growing chest, encouraging the development of fat, muscle and tissue as your new breasts become larger every second. sheâ€™s clearly having fun as she begins to tweak your nipples, causing them to harden while your breasts reach their final size.  â€œmmm. they feel good. perky and firm!â€ she says, her voice now taking on a more erotic tone. â€œjust how i like them.â€ that last part-initiated deductions in your head. she was into girls, so was she making you her girlfriend?  your thoughts are cut short, however. the changes continue ravaging your body, now focusing on your arms. any muscle in your biceps was quickly burned away, leaving behind very lean and skinny arms. furthermore, your hands begin to crack as they shrink in size. now taking on a dainty image, your long fingers and short palms now look very feminine and well-kept.  next, much like your hands, your pelvis begins to crack, your bones altering themselves to take on a more female shape. your hips appear to be the primary change, as they expand, now complementing your tiny waist as they work together to form a sexy hourglass figure. the changes to your pelvis had also made space inside you, your future female reproductive system beginning its formation.   â€œcanâ€™t be having that little thing can we?â€ you hear your friend once more, as your penis shrinks becoming barely noticeable against your now flat abdomen. resigned to losing your manhood, you feel it enter you, now forming the entrance to your new vagina as the skin shifts to leave behind your new labia. your attention entirely focused on the loss of your masculinity; you fail to notice the build up of fat in your rear.  â€œnow for one of my favourite things!â€ your friend states excitedly, â€œi hope you end up thick!â€   your ass expands, continually growing as your womanly curves begin to reach completion. you feel the fat layers add up, eventually stopping as your pants almost reach breaking point as your new rear stretches the seams. the completion of your new ass leaves one last place for your remaining fat to go, your thighs. you feel the familiar sensation of expansion in your legs, your thighs gaining a womanly layer of fat as the thicken but tone slightly. the toning of your legs continues downwards, shifting muscle in your calves to make them much more feminine. your calves now look lean and toned, as if you had spent years walking in heals to make your legs look just that extra bit more sexy. in terms of your lower half, there was only one place left for changes to occur. you felt the familiar crack in your feet, as they too became daintier. your toes shrank down, leaving a huge amount of space in your shoes, which were now much too big for your petite feminine size.   â€œnot long to go now!â€ your friend says as she yanks the fasteners of your vest, causing your spine to push inwards as the vest tightens further than you thought possible. you feel one final change to your torso as your spine cracks, shrinking to lower your height. you were now shorter than your friend and your there was no mistaking your body for anything other than a womanâ€™s.   â€œnow we

at the mirror you bent down, trying to get a good view of your changing face. you couldnâ€™t help but notice the rest of your body though. you new breasts hung from your chest, possessing a weight that you werenâ€™t used to. your hips were wide enough to see from this angle too. you definitely looked like a woman from the neck down, if only you could see your ass. you didnâ€™t have long to take in the view though. your face began to restructure, forcing your attention back to it as you watched it round to become more feminine in its appearance. you watched your eyes widen and change colour, their hue changing to a bluey green. your eyebrows thin, taking on a more refined curve, as if they had meticulously managed to look as feminine as possible. you feel a plumpness in your lips. raising a finger to them, you notice that they have increased in volume, though still remaining fairly thin. your skin also changes, lightening as it grows paler while your hair extends down the sides of your face. you run your new fingers through your hair, prompting it to change colour to become a bright orange with a striking white stripe running through it. finally, you notice freckles appear on your face, spread out over your cheeks and nose, finalising your cute new female face. you now looked exactly like

[why calories donâ€™t matter - mark hyman, md](http://drhyman.com/blog/2014/04/10/calories-dont-matter/#close) &gt; the vast majority of conventional nutritionists and doctors have it mostly wrong when it comes to weight loss. letâ€™s face it: if their advice were good and doable, we would all be thin and healthy by now. but as a general rule, itâ€™s not. and the mainstream media messages often confuse things even more. it is based on many â€œfood liesâ€. **and the biggest lie of them all is this: all calories are created equal.**  [why i didnâ€™t get fat from eating 5,000 calories a day of a high fat diet - sam feltham](http://live.smashthefat.com/why-i-didnt-get-fat/) &gt; a person who weighs 80kg and is 15% body fat, nearly what i am, stores approximately 108,000 calories of body fat. again this is a great biochemical trick, and much larger storage capability for energy compared to carbohydrates, so that in hard times we can call upon this large energy store and survive for around 21 days until food is available again. this is where the problem lies in terms of overweight or obese people. in their current biochemical status they have either limited ability or canâ€™t use the body fat they have stored for energy because of biochemical imbalances in their body. simply put the energy in their body fat stores is trapped and accumulating, similar to a tumour that is growing. unless their biochemical imbalances are rebalanced **they will remain overweight or obese, even in a calorie deficit in a lot of cases,** and will most likely develop either type 2 diabetes, chronic heart disease, cancer, alzheimerâ€™s or even a combination of these called metabolic syndrome.  emphasis mine.",1,-1,

821932,"i haven't been real vocal about the hfcs and corn growers stuff in general...  i try to keep out of it.  in fact, i thought it was something that would have straightened itself out, with people finally realizing that corn is actually only good as a feed stuff for livestock, and that is about it.  corn (ethanol) is bad for vehicles, obesity has shot up over what it was when i was young and corn is added to so many foods in so many forms.  it isn't just the hfcs, but in other forms as well - textured vegetable protein and other forms.  i remember back in the mid-70s, one of my mom's friends made the comment ""oh, i am on a diet right now, i don't even eat butter on my corn"" to which my mom replied ""neither do pigs"".  if some tiny japanese lady that had never been on a farm knew that pigs ate whole corn and that just corn alone was fattening...  i always figured it was pretty common knowledge.  that there is a place for really high corn consumption in the human diet, but not in a country where people are already well fed. perhaps in a place where the people are emaciated and starving.  i think about how just not that long ago, they were having all of these farm aid type concerts trying to help save the farms of families, and this and that...  a great many of those farms were exactly the farms that grow corn.  and at the time, there were enough people growing corn that they were losing their farms over it.  the subsidies (which actually were already in place at the time, for all subsidized type crops, not just corn) kicked up a little higher and there was more incentives for corporate farms to go in which in turn were able to put lobbyists in the capitol to get even more and to strengthen the ties between corn and our politicians.  so the bottom line is that they don't care that it isn't healthy for you, it is lining their personal pockets.  my earlier comment about taxing sodas high... only a half joke.  i am still pissed about the personal vice nazis of the world deciding that they are going to tax my vice but not their own.  lets tax all of them.  yes, smokers can cost the system a lot of money in healthcare, and yes, they can get lung cancer.  but face it...  most smokers die of heart attacks which is fairly quick and fairly cheap to the tax payers.  but more than that, it pisses me off that the money that the tobacco industry has already payed has not gone into anything for the people who use the product, but was already stolen by the states for other projects.  then when on top of that, taxed all to hell, it still isn't going for the smokers.  it is going for everything but.  instead of paying taxes to subsidize people having kids that they can't afford, why don't we find a way to penalize people for having kids that they can not afford?  tax the hell out of corn and hfcs - just because it does cause negative health effects with the weight issues and diabetes.  i have a funny on this note - in the era i was a child in, i would be considered quite fat.  but in this day and age, the mark of what is obese has moved up so much that i would not be anymore...  i don't even wear large sized clothing.  i get my clothes off of the regular clothes size rack, and actually look to be on the thinner side when walking in a group.  of all of my aunts and cousins, i am the thinnest, by over 100 lbs in most cases.  but compared to the system set in place when i was young...  i know that i am heavier than i ought to be. when i was growing up, most of the grandmas looked something like beef jerky, they were thin and stringy.  now most grandmas look like plums, they are all round and soft.  those of you with kids, i am sure have already watched wall-e.  those of you that haven't, ought to.  but there is one part of it that was especially touching... where it was explaining that being on the ship for generations and lack of physical activity had caused everyone to get fatter for generations and their bones to get smaller...  as they were all floated around on their chairs.  wasn't too far off of the truth, as far as what is happening in society today.",1,-1,1

968011,"chapter sixteen: the seventh winter   1   the woods were white and beautiful. snow covered the ground and hung in layered mounds from the shaggy evergreen branches. occasionally, the wind whistling through the trees would vortex, causing a miniature white tornado to dance across the powder, then dissolve back into cold air. rays of sunlight shot through the small openings in the wooly green canopy like intangible golden pillars. the only sound was the shuffling of frozen feet. gray and blackened flesh moved through the branches and past the stout trunks of the larger trees. two men stood back to back in the snow. one was taller and broader than the other and stood at his full height, facing east toward the origin of the beautiful golden rays. he wore a long white coat that stopped at his calves and flapped gently in the wind just above the snow. his boots were buried in white, making him seem to be part of the winter blanket itself, rising above the frost like a thin, un-jolly snowman. his head was covered in a large white hood that came down to his brow. a sleek pair of sunglasses shielded his eyes, and his breathe steamed through the white wool scarf that covered his nose and mouth. over his coat he wore a set of olive drab suspenders that supported the utility belt around his waist. there were pouches all along the belt, and on his right hip, a holstered glock pistol. his gloved right hand gripped a curved kukri machete, which he let dangle at his side. his left hand held the blackened handle of a tomahawk. the hardwood stock of an ak-47 rose above his left shoulder. the second, smaller man did not stand at his full height, but crouched low and to one side. in his hands he held a japanese katana with a gold pommel and hand guard. the fine black silk hand-wrapping was thin and tattered in places. he held the weapon close to himself, the blade reversed, running down his outstretched leg. the sword glowed orange, painted by the morning sun. he too wore a long white overcoat with combat gear strapped over it, but he had no hood. a white ski mask and the same dark glasses covered his head and face. the thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck and mouth made the top of his head look like an egg huddled in a nest of snow. his gloves were black, and he bore an army-issue m4 carbine on his slender back. he did not look like a snowman standing tall above the earth, but rather the snow-covered statue of an ancient warrior, poised and ready to defend himself. neither of the men moved at all. they stood quiet, alert, ready. their enemies didnâ€™t know itâ€”in fact, were incapable of knowing itâ€”but the two men had drawn an imaginary circle on the ground, ten meters in diameter. the first gray-skinned wretch moved into the clearing from the surrounding trees. it slouched at the shoulders and staggered as it moved forward. one leg was almost totally stripped of flesh. it held out its gnarled arms as it approached the smaller man, who tightened his grip on the curved wooden handle as the thing neared the rim of the invisible ring. it stepped its fleshless foot into the ring and was headless within seven tenths of a second. its body jerked backward, as if the wound had been a backstab, and fell limp into the snow. the head fell facedown beside it.  â€œgood,â€ the bigger man whispered. he hadnâ€™t yet moved. â€œnow stab the eye.â€ the small man lunged forward and pinned the head to the ground through the back of the skull and out the left orbital socket. he raised the head from the ground. there was only a tiny brown stain on the snow where it had been. the head did not move or try to bite, and flew off into the bushes as the small man flicked his blade to the right. the small man did not clean the blade, not yet. near the big manâ€™s side of the circle, a small dead child wandered over the line. without hesitation, the big man raised his left arm and brought the tomahawk smashing down upon the childâ€™s head. the small stainless steel axe head came loose as the grotesque corpse fell to the ground, truly dead.  another, a bloated naked thing with its bowels trailing in rotting brown strands behind it, stepped into the circle. with a small grunt, the big man wheeled to his left and silenced its moans with a powerful chop of his curved blade. the heavy head fell and was not cushioned by the snow. it hit the frozen soil with a solid thud. the big man recovered, stepped forward, and crushed the thingâ€™s skull with his boot heel. its wood-like crack echoed through the trees.  the small manâ€™s coat whipped up a swirl of snow as he twirled like a dancer and gracefully unfolded his arms. the two heads seemed to fall in perfect synchrony, but the bodies fell in their own ways. another one, coming in from the right, had most of its lower left torso missing. the rot-covered spine looked a grotesque clay brown in the morning sun. the small man struck its head off. the two worked in harmony, weaving in and out of one another, making sure that the other was at a safe distance when it came time to strike. no energy was wasted on redundant theatrics that would only intimidate living attackers. neither of the men adopted a particularly complicated stance other than in preparing to strike. every movement was a necessary one.  close to a dozen bodies lined their transparent circle now. from above, it looked like a giant white eye, rimmed in gray, with two pupils bouncing from side to side. the whites swirled from their coats. their breath fogged the air as they fought, sometimes making it difficult to see far back into the woods surrounding the clearing. the once-smooth blanket of snow was now viciously furrowed with tracks and body prints. the big man held his breath to get a clear view of the tree line. the living deadâ€™s rate of advance was increasing steadily. he killed four more before sliding his machete into its scabbard behind him and securing the tomahawk in his belt.  â€œguns,â€ he said quietly after the small manâ€™s strike was complete and another body deposited onto the fattening gray edge of the ring. the small man produced a small rag from his pocket, scooped up some snow, and wiped the filth from his blade. it was sheathed a moment later. the small manâ€™s rifle was out a bit faster than the bigger manâ€™s. both fired at will at anything that approached the ring of the circle. at such a close range, all of their shots were true, sending pieces of skull and reanimated brain matter back into the woods. their circle expanded as their shots got longer.  the bigger man dropped his left hand from the wooden forend of his ak to the pouch on his left hip. he opened the flap and produced a long, curved banana clip. he dropped the empty clip between his left middle and ring fingers and used the other fingers to fit the new clip into place. it locked in with a click and the left hand deposited the empty clip into the pouch.  undead were now tripping and crawling over the bodies of the slain. the all-important head shot had just become much more difficult to achieve. through his small scope the small man would see a rotten face flash into view, only to disappear an instant later behind an expired zombie. he was starting to miss, and often. â€œheadsâ€™re moving too much,â€ he shouted over his shoulder to the big man, whoâ€™d already slung his rifle over his shoulder. the big man responded by pulling down his scarf, cupping his hands to his mouth. â€œmove it up, fellas!â€ he shouted to the east, his teeth catching the light of a thin sun-beam.  there was a rustling back in the snow-caked fir branches, followed by the sound of rope softly thudding into the snow. six white-covered men of varying sizes and weaponry drifted to the earth like spiders. not even the enormous one made a sound. they dropped ropes and drew weapons immediately. blades and cudgels of various kinds grinded and sang as they were draw from their holding places.  crawling corpses were put down as the tree-men advanced from behind. skulls cracked and split as the undead continued to move into the clearing toward the duo. in a matter of seconds the tree-men reached the two surrounded fighters and absorbed them into the unit. with the line now two men wider, they moved west across the clearing, killing as they went.  it was over soon. the eight men stood by the jagged western rim of the clearing and looked over the multitude of gray bodies half-immersed in the fresh white snow.  shoulders heaved and clouds of vapor plumed from covered mouths into the frigid air.  at last, the bigger of the two for-goers pulled the hood from his head and the sunglasses from his cold brown eyes. â€œall right. mark it up, please, mr. arnold.â€ the giant stepped forward, reached a big hand into his heavy white coat, produced a can of neon pink spray paint, and set to marking the closest trees with large xs. â€œgrab gear, fellas, itâ€™s breakfast time,â€ jake jones said to the others. the tree-men, save for big phil, began trudging back to their perches to retrieve their guns. the small man stepped after them, but was held back by jakeâ€™s hand on his shoulder.  â€œwhat is it?â€ he said in a mid-pitched adolescent voice, a voice with the warbled gravel of newly-developed depth. his left hand left the hilt of his katana and pulled the mask up and off of his head, sending his tousle of curly blonde hair flapping in the wind like a bad comb-over. jones smiled and punched him lightly in the shoulder. â€œnot too shabby back there. you just might be useful around here, you know,â€ he said warmly, and chuckled. trace gave him the stink-eye as he stuffed his mask into his coat and slid his sunglasses back onto his face. â€œmight? know where you can shove your might, jones?â€ jake laughed out loud and gave trace a gentle shove toward the others. â€œall right, tough guy. go carry philâ€™s deer for him if youâ€™re such a hard-ass.â€",0,,

567405,"[herbert west](http://imgur.com/vl1hljo), my chaotic good/neutral marxist revolutionary necromancer of noble motives. herbert was always very obviously intelligent, despite lacking a formal education. while the other urchins would pickpocket or resort to mugging travelers, herbert would usually con to pay his way. his mother is a prostitute, and he left to go adventuring to pay off his mother's debt to her ""employer"" of 1500 gold pieces. when he asked her why she needed that much gold she simply told him that she needed to ""disappear"". he never knew his father- his mother said that she knew who he was, but was always reluctant to answer any questions about his identity.  about a year and a half ago herbert was hanging outside of ""the musky goat"". at 1 in the morning, this was the place to find an easy mark. herbert was, ahem, temporarily distracted by a voluptuous cleric of light who was asking for directions, when he heard the tavern door swing open and a gruff man yelling something along the lines of ""...and don't come back!"", albeit in a bit more colorful language. he turned and saw a lanky half-elf with a lute broken over his head and a smarmy look on his face lying on the ground. herbert made sure to take note of his satchel, which had a large bulge sticking out of the side of it. two men, a half-naked halfling with a sword bigger than his entire body on his back, and a hoigty-toighty looking human in plate armor with a large shield bearing a symbol of a roaring red lion walking out with his chest puffed out like it was nobody's buisness came out of the tavern quickly afterwords. when the halfling moved it looked like a 3 foot tall ocean of muscle that was splashing down the narrow streets, and the human had the look about him of a paladin that was much too divine and important for this nonsense. they walked up to their elven compatriot and picked him up to carry the lightweight down the cobbled road. adventurers! to gehenna with curvacious clerics, adventurers are loaded, and drunk adventurers are especially easy to swindle. herbert gave the cleric the cold shoulder decided to trail them. he got within earshot right when the bard began to slur. "" hic why did that guy kick me out? that lich story really did hic happen""! mister goody-two-shoes turned to look forward, sighed deeply, and sarcastically remarked ""i'm sure that jumping on the table, kicking steins at the tavern owner, and asking his daughter if she wanted to touch your sigh 'wand of lordly might' had nothing to do with your ejection. we need to stop mucking about. we can't be sure that the vase was his phylactery"". the pointy eared bard begin to mimic the paladin in a high pitched tone, not unlike how a 12 year old boy is want to do, but this was quickly stopped by the musclebound hobbit by a quick twist of the arm. the half elf proceeded to fall to the ground moaning and whining. the exasperated paladin pulled him along the road, during which time the satchel fell off of his shoulder. herbert decided to wait until they walked out of sight to snatch the man-purse. i mean, if he really wanted his satchel, he'd keep better care of it. besides, it's basically redistribution of wealth from the strong to the weak. he opened the satchel and was immediately captivated. he found about 60 gold pieces, but more importantly an ornate black gauntlet a purple glowing eminating from the cracks between the metal plates. herbert heard the gauntlet call to him in a voice that for some reason felt intensely familiar. he finally put it on to his right hand, and he felt it.  he suddenly understood the secrets of arcane magic, and the words he saw on signs around him suddenly began to make sense. he could read! he felt the magic nearly bursting from inside him. herbert, in mad frenzy, ran to the local scribe,""the flaccid quill"", almost on autopilot. he ran into the shop and smelt ink and parchment. he plopped his bag of coins onto the counter, staring blankly at the gnome attendant, who was not expecting a customer this late into the graveyard shift. he took a spell book from the nearest shelf without saying a word and began to write incantations in a language he had never seen before in his life. whenever he looked upon this script he saw visions of madness and hundreds upon hundreds of eyes and tentacled men holding minds in their hands. he wanted to test these new powers he felt and he knew just where he could. he went down to the city square, stopping at ""the rusty hatchet"" along the way to buy some ""gently used"" leather armor. in the square he tore an old sign off of the wanted board- a sign for bounty for a bandit gang at 10 gold pieces per bandit killed. he left town, leaving towards the bandits' forest lair.  ""bastard!"" the other children yelled. ""freak!"" ""son of a whore!"" herbert was always a string bean, but at the age of 9 his head was so large it made him look more like a lollipop than anything. the other boys would try to beat him up, but his older brother cedric would stop them. although herbert was always smarter in some ways, cedric understood people in a way he never did. cedric was the one who taught him to follow drunk adventurers late at night for easy pickings. mom didn't like him staying out late. his mom always told him he was lucky because he had such a big family. and that people like the ones in his family always had to look out for each other to survive. he had so many aunts. and his uncle. but his uncle was mean him. he always said that having him around would lose him business. herbert didn't like to be home at night anyways. he didn't like listening to mom and his aunties work. it always sounded like those strangers were trying to hurt them. the guards were usually a pain to him and his brother, and the were avoidable, except for when the prince's birthday came. they would always have a parade throughout town, being carried down the street in their chariots. they would always send royal cleaners in first to make sure the streets were ""decent"" enough for them, and the guards would be on high alert for any tomfoolery. cedric was trying get a dragonborn he found wandering down the street to help him grab a fictional lost wallet from a small drainage ditch. the dragonborn had gold shimmering scales and a gait that only a paladin can walk in without feeling a fool. paladins were always easy to fool, seeing the world as black and white, stop criminals, help the poor in need. well these poor were in need of an easy mark so that they could afford breakfast. cedric began to dig around through the prone paladins pockets. he threw herb a gold talisman of an ankh that was encrusted with a few small gems and, more importantly, a platinum piece! that's when herbert saw the guard. cedric had always tried to teach herbert that special cant, but he could never quite get the hang of it. this is one of a number of reasons ended up blaming himself for the events that were about to transpire. the guard called out ""stop ya lil feives! we got the prince's birfday comin' up and we can't have you lot scarin' away all the guests!"" and ran towards them. cedric took a small rock from the ground near him and threw it at the guard. the stone hit the guard right in the eye, startling him and throwing him back. herbert looked upon this scene with complete surprise, not once moving from his spot, even after the disoriented guard let off a crossbow bolt that punctured cedric right between the eyes, instantly killing him. herbert ran from the scene to his mother. cedric was his role model. he followed him everywhere. and now he was gone. why don the rich have so much, and he and hsi have nothing, not even a brother anymore? it wasn't fair.  through the bushes he saw the bandits carrying caravaners, bound and gagged, being carried. there were 7 bandits he counted and 3 captives, two women, a dwarf and a human, and a half-orc man. herbert studied the bandits' patterns, and sneaked down to their lair door. an hour later, he walked out of the lair, blood on his purple glowing hands. the captives are not sure of what they saw. floating objects, bandits being strangled to death by skeletal hands with a purple glowing aura and being fried crispy by lightning, a cloaked figure disappearing and reappearing from shadows and taking the form of fallen bandits, a royal purple blur passing over the brigands and leaving them dead on the ground that took the bandits' clan necklace after each kill. they ran back to town, before more bandits came back.  it was early morning by the time herbert had buried all of the bandits. they may have done awful things, but they were still just people who were done on their luck and had to do something that they normally wouldn't, and deserved a proper burial. he went down to the guards' station to pick up his bounty. he had to make it home anyways to mend his wounds. the captain of the guard was more than surprised by the skinny, weak looking, teenager who walked in and plopped several symbols of the bandits upon the counter. it was moments like these that he wished that the king hadn't instituted a no-questions-asked policy for bounties, just so he could hear this story. herbert knew that he could finally use his new-found powers to buy his mother's freedom, but that she wouldn't want him to go adventuring. she had a fire in her eyes before, and this fire was put out when cedric died. herbert knew that she couldn't stand to lose another son, so he would tell one of her coworkers. he walked into ""the tiny succubus"". when he entered, the smell of cheap perfume and sweat me his nostirls, and comforted him in a strange way.",0,,
766918,"i'm totally not trying to say being skinny is more difficult, or even on the same level. i'm just saying i don't think people who are heavier should put skinny people down to feel better about themselves, and that it's not okay to comment on a persons weight like that at all.  and it's not okay to break up with someone just because they gained weight, just like it's not okay to break up with someone just because they lose weight.   the important thing to remember though is that your experience is not necessarily everyone's experience. i've had a lot of negative comments on my skinny weight and small breasts, whereas you didn't find that in your experience. i'm not going to pretend like i know what it's like to be overweight, but i know it's something a lot of people struggle with and that a lot of people can be hurtful about. and even if i did gain weight for a period of, say, a year, i wouldn't presume to know what a lifetime of being fat feels like. but it's not considered mean or hurtful to tell an underweight girl to eat a burger and put on a few pounds, but it is considered hurtful to tell an overweight person to lose a few pounds.  as for your particular situation, i'm very sorry you've had that experience. i don't think fat people are disgusting, but if you are unhappy with your body there is nothing wrong with trying to change it for yourself. it's if you're doing it because of other people that it's an issue. but i think your should take steps to feel more positive about yourself, especially because the way you treat yourself and act about your appearance will greatly impact how your child will treat themselves and others.  here's two examples to counter yours. firstly, i will always remember wanting to hang out with a guy i had met, and making plans with him to do so. his friend, overhearing us, immediately turns around and says in front of me 'you can't hang out with her, she's got no fucking tits'. to which nobody came to my defense, or called him out on his behaviour.  secondly, being told by a friend that isn't it weird for me to shave down there, because wouldn't i look like a child? since i've got no curves, i'm just like a stick, not a womanly figure at all.  on top of lots of 'eat something' and 'you look anorexic' and 'put on some weight'.  out experiences are very valuable because they provide a lot of insight, but as always they don't encompass how it is for everyone.  also, i was talking about people who are noticeably underweight, not just an 'average' weight. according to your measurements that you gave you were actual an ideal weight for your height. which is not the same as being skinny.   &gt;the ideal weight ranges for a 5-foot-tall woman is 90 to 110   http://www.livestrong.com/article/353578-ideal-weight-and-height-ratios/  at least for me, the lowest i think i've been form my 'ideal' weight was weighing 83lbs and being about 5'3"" there in a big difference between being your ideal weight, and being skinny. the first definition of skinny that came up is:  skinny adjective 1.

849196,"wall of text incoming. sorry for venting here  eating disorders are mental shit shows beyond comprehension. i've always been on the lower end of normal bmi, but i started to think i was getting fat, that i should lose a bit of weight to look better. i had a history of untreated depression and bad anxiety/ocd.  eventually i convinced myself that if i ate more than 800 kcal a day i'd gain weight. before i knew it, i was in a nasty restrict/binge cycle. i felt like i couldn't control myself when i was around food, i felt like i was gluttonous, weak, fat, i needed to have more willpower. i started isolating myself. i stayed mostly at home and only bought foods i knew wouldn't trigger a binge. i would watch documentaries on diet, food and health all day to pass the time, trying to find info that would help me lose even more weight. all i could think about was food and what i would be eating that day. i also exercised daily to burn more calories. i lost weight and people commented on how thin i looked, but they were all positive or neutral comments. nobody expressed any concern or disgust because i wasn't skeletal. but mentally i was suffering immensely and dealing with suicidal thoughts daily. i was exhausted, i couldn't focus on my studies (i was in uni). i felt completely worthless, the only thing that gave me some satisfaction was seeing my weight go down. i couldn't continue living like this, but if i stopped i would get fat, and i couldn't live with that either! so i reached out for help.  at that time my physical health was starting to suffer as well: i started to get dizzy even when doing light exercises. blood tests showed that my bone marrow had started shutting down, leading to low white blood cell count and low platelets. however, the only person who ever showed concern for my physical health was my grandmother, and even that was when i was at my skinniest and had already been inpatient at the psych ward for a while. but i still wasn't draugr tier skinny. i didn't look like eugenia cooney. you couldn't clock me as ""definitely anorexic"" on the streets.  and still i thought i should lose more weight. i thought my stomach and thighs were still massive. i was 100% obsessed with food and eating 24/7, which made me feel even worse. i must be the greediest, fattest, most disgusting human being ever to be this consumed by thoughts of food, right? i have to fight these urges to eat, if i give in i will become fat!  what drives us to eat is purely neurological. there are certain parts in the brain which regulate our eating. and these neural signalling pathways can get fucked up, driving you to overeat or to undereat. in anorexia starvation drives your brain to obsess over food: your body is screaming for nutrition, your more primitive brain is trying its best to *just get you to eat* (see the minnesota starvation experiment), but the executive function and emotional side are denying that. it's a constant tug of war. there's also an emotional component to eating as well: tasty food is pleasurable. sadly, for some people it's the only pleasure they feel in life.  i was ""lucky"" to have a restrictive type of eating disorder. i didn't get shamed for it, *au contraire!* people with binge eating disorder or bulimia are often normal weight or overweight, but the mental suffering is all the same. however, because they aren't the ""poor dainty starving anorexic girl"" they get shamed for their disordered eating.  everyone deserves compassion and help. shaming and bullying doesn't help a person dealing with emotional eating, it only makes it worse. someone in an overweight or obese body can't just unzip their skin and walk out of it as a skeleton. they have to live in that body every day. you don't know how or why they gained the weight, and it shouldn't matter to you at all. they're a person, they have feelings and an inner life you know nothing about. treat everyone with respect and kindness.",1,-1,0

314703,"225lb -&gt; 175lb since 2nd january 2016. (6""1')  i'm 50, and i'm now the lightest i've been since i was 20. i've yoyoed a bit over the years, although in my 20s i got as big as 260lb, and then down to 190lb when i was 30. i did creep up over my 30s and 40s, but never got anywhere near the original 260lb, so i am one of those rare people who can lose weight and keep it off for a long time. i'm pretty confident i can manage to keep my weight below 190 for the rest of my life.   1. get a doctor to suggest you go on a diet. this makes it easier to resist 'helpful' people who say 'go on, go on' when there is cake around.  2. booze isn't helpful. when i was at my biggest (260lb) i was drinking beer (real ale) every day. i stopped almost completely in my 30s (when i had some still-mystery liver complaint, but it went away and i'm fine now), and gradually reintroduced booze in the form, mainly, of wine. however, this year, i did dry january (i didn't plan to: i just noticed by mid-jan i hadn't had anything to drink) and decided to carry on. although booze has many calories (beer and sweet cocktails are the worst), that's not the biggest problem - it's mainly the hangover munchies i get the next day. i now have a few glasses of wine on a friday or saturday evening, manage to resist eating nibbles at the same time, and then try my hardest to eat sensibly the next day. it seems to work.  3. you need to find a regime that works for you. little and often would be a disaster for me. i'm much better missing breakfast entirely, probably skipping lunch and then having a reasonable supper.  4. for me, the key has been avoiding carbs. i've completely given up bread and chips (my favourite foods), and also rice, pasta, and had already given up beer. i never snack. my diet has been mainly soup, smoked salmon and salad. if i do come off the wagon i still avoid carbs. for example, i've been out for a couple of curries, and just have the curry itself, no rice, bread or poppadoms.   5. i'm not too fussed about high fat. if i know i'm about to go out for a high fat meal, i pop a couple of alli (orlistat) beforehand. (i know you're not supposed to do this, but it works). warning: only do this if you trust your sphincter. i have a non-scientific theory that having non-digested fat going through your gut helps to remove fat-soluble pcbs and other toxins from your body. i have an even less scientific theory that if you drink booze while you're undergoing this process, it helps to dissolve the toxins in your body and transfer them to your gut where the fat can absorb them on the way out.   6. treat foods are steak (no chips/fries), bacon and eggs.  7. it really helps to have something you can eat straight away as soon as you get home. soup is great for this, as you can slam it in the microwave and it's ready in a few minutes. in the meantime you can eat some smoked salmon and salad. other good stuff is ham and chicken breast. i eat supermarket prepared (not tinned) soups. there are plenty of good ones which come in tubs of about a pint. i picked up one the other day from the same section called 'meal soup' which was the most delicious soup i ever tasted. unfortunately, looking at it more closely, that was because it was about 800 calories for the tub. normally, a pint of soup comes in about 400-500 calories, so with 200 calories of salmon and some salad that comes to around 700 calories for the main meal of the day.  8. feel free to starve yourself for the odd day if you can. i'm sure this 'crashing your metabolism' thing is rubbish. i can't believe that we would be deliberately running at level of inefficiency just so we can drop back to optimal efficiency if food is scarce. evolution wouldn't do that to us. that's not to say that muscle mass retention is a bad idea, as that does increase your base metabolic rate. for me, crash dieting at the start was a good thing, as it gave me the resolve to carry on. your psychology might differ.  9. unfortunately, you will find that your rate of weight loss decreases as your basal metabolic rate decreases, largely because you will lose some muscle mass, and it takes quite a lot of energy to drag 50lbs of lard around with you 24/7. don't worry about this.  10. see 9: i didn't bother to increase my exercise much. having said that, although i'm fairly sedentary in my job, i do wander around the office a lot, and whenever i'm in london i try to walk from meeting to meeting (walking in a city is much more interesting to me than walking in the country). on a london day, i'll often walk 12,000 to 16,000 steps. eating less is much more important than exercising more, if your aim is to lose weight (having said that, i acknowledge that there are health benefits to exercising. that's my next job. also to do a bit of weights, to build up some muscle mass. but i don't really mind being skinny and weedy.  11. you will have to change your lifestyle.  i'm pretty sure i will be on a low carb diet for the rest of my life, but i'm going to try not to be obsessive about it.   12. you will learn that a gutful of food weighs about 3-4lb. thus if you pig out (like i did last night) on a huge bowl of greek salad (with not too much cheese, and some pretty light dressing), and chicken breast, you will put on weight in the short term. if you then starve yourself for a couple of days, the emptying of your gut alone will lose you 3-4lb. (every shit is an achievement). i weigh daily, but don't worry that your weight fluctuates in the short term. a gutful of food is one thing, and water retention is the other. booze makes me retain water, so that amounts to another couple of lb. i drink about 1-1.5 bottles of wine a week, almost exclusively on friday and saturday. even if i don't eat much on either of those two days, my weight will be up on monday morning, so my lightest day of the week is always friday. i will normally be about 4-5lb lighter on friday than on monday.   13. i lost about 10 lb a month for the first three months, and then steadily down. i'm now losing at a rate of about 5lb a month. i'm a bit obsessive now, but i need to stop at about 165 (another 10lb or so) and maintain from there. having said that, i did say i'd stop at 180, but carried on (largely because, i was very pleased with my progress to 180, and realised that my body shape is such that i have extremely narrow hips, so even thought i'm 6'1"", i still have a bit of a belly at that weight. my waist is down to something less than 32"", but i would like to get down to 30 (i'd forgotten that in my early 20s it was 28"", but i think that's a bit too far).  14. people won't notice until you've lost about 40lbs (!). although some other people won't recognise the slimmer you.  15. i weigh myself every day using an activ8rlives body analyser, which sends your weight (and other health data) to your smartphone. even though the first one i bought broke, i'm giving them a huge shout out, as their customer service is ridiculously good (i sent them a message on amazon asking how i can arrange a return, and got a call from a guy called kevin who was really helpful sorting out the problem - turns out he was their managing director). i also have a buddy band of theirs (fitbit type thing) but i don't wear it at the moment, as i'm not obsessing about my activity. weighing my self gamifies the whole thing for me and has been a great motivator. that doesn't work for everyone, though.   16. i drink lots of water, as it's something to keep my mouth busy. from memory, drinking a pint of ice cold water will lose you about 17 calories. also peeing is fun. i drink quite a lot of diet fizzy drinks, but i'm not sure that's a good idea.  17. buying new clothes has been fun. i live very close to a designer outlet shopping village and find it a lot easier to find good clothes now i'm this weight. i also had a couple of jackets taken in, although there's a limit to the extent that it's possible to do this without the jacket looking weird (pockets being in the wrong place, and the whole cut looking unbalanced).  18. i'm down a shoe size. weird.  19. it's been good for the rest of the family. the kids have lost weight as there are fewer snacks around, and my wife has also been dieting.   20. i really enjoy cooking but i've been cooking things like greek salads and low-fat casseroles. i'm eating tons of hot sauces, though.  21. i'm not counting calories (although i do look at the calorie content of food that i'm not sure about). it's much more about the type of food than the actual calories.",1,-1,2

 excuse me, jennyy1, a food problem? are these people happy with themselves? is it any of your business to consider their eating habits to be a problem. i mean, if you're 600 lbs and a fucking crane has to come to haul your dead, bloated ass, out of your second story apartment you hadn't been able to leave in the last 2 years due to your inability to fit through the door, or even travel up (or down) the stairs, because your arteries were glued shut with lard, with pink, fleshy cellulite covered legs and arms and a sickening roundness which makes me want to proclaim, like a cynical gene wilder to ""take them to the juicing room"",  okay jennyy1, this person may have a ""food problem"".  acting like you're some martyr who is finally coming out to say ""omgz, i'm not attracted to bigger, or even fat, guys,"" but don't worry, you're willing to bare your cross:  &gt;i'm probably about to get a swarm of people saying how terrible i am. but majority of you would turn down or friend-zone a girl fatchicklinkididn'tclick or fatchicklinkididn'tclick  you know, i don't know if you realize this, but attraction is so much more than just physical attraction - but granted it's a significant portion - but people get friend-zoned who are fit (and they know it). and you know what, this never really seemed to occur to you, but people like all types of fucking people. there are guys who like bigger girls, girls who like bigger guys, guys who like bigger guys, sexy hot teenage lesbians who like other sexy, petite teenage lesbians. the fact that you think all overweight people are simply unattractive, and generally undesired sexually, romantically, or in any other way a relationship may arise is simply ignorantly absurd.   **tl;dr:** op sounds like a ""popular-girl"" (christ quotations get me hard) in high school who looks at people who aren't ""beautiful"" (yessss) as second-class people. undesired second-class people.   /and by the way, jennyy1 - you might want to seriously reevaluate the way you express your social commentaries, it makes you sound like a cunt. now, this is perfectly fine if this is something you embrace within your identity; this comment in fact proves that i'm a bit of a cunt myself, really. just think about what you said, though.  //and i don't even have a *""food problem""*, and eights, nines, and even sometimes tens (by politically incorrect female standards which kill the confidence of size 4 or 5 women throughout the western world) are often interested in me. women who i don't go out of my way to pursue. are these the only types of women i find attractive? christ-no - but they are part of a huge demographic of the women who capture my interest. ahh, but you see, it has nothing to do with their weight. but everything to do with the insanity and baggage which comes with a woman who is willing to torture herself to appear attractive in the most unrealistic light females are gloried within our culture. the naturally thin, or those who over excise don't particularly excite me. i like the cigarette smoking, emaciated thinness of someone who enjoys the feeling of hunger and eats picking at their food and hates their drunk of a father for commenting repeatedly on their slight, hormonal weight gained throughout middle-school. i love madness, loathing insecurity, perfectionism, obsession. all often a very thin person's crutch of their figure, at least the type who seem jaded and bitter and spiteful and everything i want to feel being taken out on me, through me, in their bedrooms.   ///no one will ever believe me. i type too much.  **those who are down-voting, not that it means anything, but i'd love to hear a reply. i suspect i took a rather angered tone, maybe a bit too early in the day..**",1,-1,
664175,"great. let me just start off by saying that there are a lot of bullshit fitness channels and incorrect info online.  the most trustworthy channels i have found would be:  â€œathleanxâ€ his titles can be seem very clickbaity but he actually does end up teaching you something in each video. this channel is the only one that youâ€™re basically required to check out.  â€œbuff dudesâ€ this channel is a more laid back version of athleanx. they also do more funny videos and interesting challenges. but overall their serious videos are trustworthy.  â€œjaxbladeâ€ his channel is unique and can teach you a lot about fitness in a fun way. itâ€™s hard to explain what exactly it is that he does, but i recommend that you check him out.  â€œvirtuvian physiqueâ€ kinda like athlean x   now for the basics.  **nutrition** nutrition is gonna be your most important focus. no matter what you cannot grow or lose weight properly of youâ€™re eating wrong. no amount of crunches can get rid of stomach fat. no amount of running alone is going to get rid of your fat. it can take like an hour of running to burn 500 calories. which is like 8 chicken nuggets. or a few donuts. thatâ€™s not even a meal. nutrition is what will make or break your fitness journey. i promise you.  now i will go over four goals.  1 losing weight.  in order to lose weight you will have to end up eating less calories that youâ€™re daily maintenance. what is your daily maintenance? it is how many calories you eat in a day in order to stay the exact same weight. you can find out your daily maintenance here: https://tdeecalculator.net   if you want to lose weight you will have to eat **less** than your maintenance. typically 500 calories under your maintenance level each day can burn a pound of weight per weak. unfortunately you canâ€™t lose fat without losing muscle. thats a myth. which is why i use the term â€œweightâ€.  no, you canâ€™t lose weight by eating less fat or carbs. thatâ€™s not how it works. calories are all that matters in the end.   now this isnâ€™t to say that what you eat doesnâ€™t matter. it most certainly does. you should try to keep the three macronutrients in balance. these are protein, carbs, and fat. you want to keep all of these at around 30ish percent of what you eat. a little more or less is fine. but donâ€™t go overboard. you may be wondering how you can keep track of that. most people use an app called â€œmyfitnesspalâ€ for this. itâ€™s free to use. if you canâ€™t figure out how to use it i can explain later.  also remember when losing weight that sodas have calories. this is why many people become fat, because they always drink soda. water has no calories and can almost become addictive if you drink it for a while. luckily water is extremely healthy so itâ€™s a good thing to be addicted to it. after drinking it for a while you may find that you no longer want soda. of course this doesnâ€™t happen for everyone.  2. bulking  this one is much easier. now youâ€™re going to eat 500 calories **more** than your daily maintenance. make sure you also eat at least 0.9 grams of protein per pound of your body weight. the more protein, the better. although past 1.5 grams per pound, it wonâ€™t really do anything extra.  thatâ€™s it. just follow these rules every day and your nutrition will be optimal for muscle growth. be warned though. you will gain a little fat. thatâ€™s just how it is. do not bulk if you are already chubby. or you will become bloated.  also drink lots of water. at least 10 cups a day. your piss should never be dark yellow, or else you wonâ€™t build muscle very well. muscle needs water.  3. cutting.  do this to lose fat while keeping more of your muscle. you will still lose some muscle unfortunately, but you will keep most of it. follow the steps from the first goal, except with some added rules. eat at least 1.2 grams of protein per pound. drink lots of water. continue to work out so you provide stimulus to your muscles. if you donâ€™t, your body will destroy your muscles within a few months and leave you in the dreaded â€œskinny fatâ€ state. drink lots of water.  4. body recomposition.   if you are under the age of 30 and are new to working out, it is possible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time. do not try this if you are very overweight. eat the same amount of protein as if you were bulking, but eat 300 calories under your maintenance. your body will take the calories it needs from your fat. drink lots of water. once you are under 15% body fat, switch to bulking.  **macro nutrients** i mentioned these earlier but here they are.   fat is responsible for making food taste good and storing energy. 1 gram of fat is 9 calories. your body will transform any unused nutrients into fat. so you canâ€™t â€œeat less fatâ€ to lose weight. also if you donâ€™t eat any fat, your body will hold onto its own fat. causing you to lose only muscle.  protein is responsible for healing your muscles. unfortunately it also tastes like shit or like nothing. (which is why chicken is tasteless without seasoning.) 1 gram of protein is 4 calories. it is hard for you to digest protein, so you may actually lose calories by eating a lot of it. this can be abused to lose weight quicker. donâ€™t worry about that when building muscle though. just make sure you eat enough protein.  carbs are responsible for providing energy to your muscles. they also taste good as well. 1 carb is 4 calories. you need to eat a lot of them to have the energy to lift. at least 30% of your diet. try to avoid eating too many added sugars. cupcakes ainâ€™t good for you bro. although having some every now and again is alright.   one last thing, cheat meals. cheat meals are used to keep you sane when losing weight. basically choose one day a week where you can eat maintenance level of calories instead of 500 under that. or even above maintenance level if youâ€™d like. only do this once a week.   so to sum it all up, find your daily maintenance. choose a path based on your goal. (like do you want to be swole but youâ€™re fat? go for weight loss, then recomposition, then bulk.) keep a balanced amount of macro nutrients. drink a lot of water. try to not drink sodas. use myfitnesspal or an equivalent.     whew that was a-lot. the next ones will be shorter.  **working out**  working out is pretty straightforward, but you need a work out program to actually get results. you canâ€™t just walk in and slam a few weights around expecting to get jacked. a program is a detailed list of what youâ€™ll be doing for each workout. as a beginner your best bet will be to do an alternating 5x5 program.  the first number in 5x5 means sets. the second means reps. a set is how many reps you have to complete until you can take a break. 5 pushups is 5 reps. 5 squats is 5 reps. and a break should last no more than 90 seconds.   an example of this program would be working your triceps/chest/shoulders on one day. and working your legs/biceps/back/abs the next day. this way three groups rest while four are trained. you can only grow while you rest, which is why this matters. choose one or two days where you do not do any weight training at all. one should be enough, but two is still okay.   you can also do cardio every day. weâ€™re built for cardio so you recover from it quite easily as long as you eat enough and drink enough. but it would still be in your best interest to not do cardio every day. rest is still important.  why should you do cardio? if you donâ€™t want to have a stroke at the age of 55, please do cardio. the running gets easy eventually. but honestly cardio can be as simple as walking your dog every day. (if you have a dog please walk them every day. they get bored of being home too.)  many other programs do exist and are specialized for different results. some people do 10 sets of 7 on each of their workouts for example. or 6 sets of 12. not to mention that each program will have different exercises. youâ€™ll have to do some digging on your own to find which program you want to do. you can find them for free so donâ€™t buy one unless youâ€™re sure you want it. i can share what i use if youâ€™re interested.  i also have to explain hypertrophy and strength. it is possible to be strong without being big (like bruce lee). every workout will get you strong, but the amount of reps you do will lead to different results. 5 reps will usually focus on strength. 10+ focus on building larger muscles. 6 to 9 will do a combination of both.   keep in mind this doesnâ€™t really matter for a beginner. just doing 5 reps will be enough to get bigger and stronger. also the 5 reps must be challenging to the point that you cannot do anymore. but easy enough so that you can do 5 more after resting for 90 seconds.   make sure you look up proper form for every exercise. improper form can literally cause a life changing injury.   go with a partner if you can. lifting weights can be embarrassing if you get pinned. and even fatal. if you donâ€™t have a parter, make sure you start off very light so that you donâ€™t injure yourself. you can still build up to heavy weights. just make sure that you can handle them. (protip, remember to breathe or you may pass out!)  stretching or yoga is also very important. watch this video for a stretching routine and explanation: https://youtu.be/pme5xckddbc never stretch before a workout. only after.   **rest**  last and shortest bit of info. rest is very important. you absolutely must get at least 7 hours of sleep a night bare minimum. or else your muscles will not heal. and you will not grow. you also need at least 1 rest day a week.  i recommend checking out the youtube channels for more info. athleanx has the most science in his videos btw.",0,,
949656,"similar story, having been a fat kid and even fatter teenager. approaching 40 iâ€™m as slim now as iâ€™ve ever been, which is hardly skinny but pretty normal. iâ€™ve never been into intense diet or exercise. but i am about 60lbs lighter than i was at 18 and never want to go back.   having been fat and not-so-fat, frankly, i donâ€™t want my two daughters to ever be as chunky as i was. i didnâ€™t suffer all that much from my weight socially, but did have pretty deep body image issues. more importantly, i had a host of odd physiological problems that *disappeared* when i lost weight. knee and back pain, hormone disregulation, high cholesterol, even things like excess body hair.   if thereâ€™s anything iâ€™m sure of, itâ€™s that having your mom try to keep you from getting fat is probably not going to work. my mom, bless her, made a point of not harassing me about my weight. as she saw it, her mother had done that and she was still fat. i also still ended up fat, but with fewer psychological complexes. which has probably helped me get to healthier weight as an adult!  so how to encourage my kids to make healthier choices? so far hereâ€™s my plan:  -i have the advantage of being a decent cook and a wildly adventurous eater. i take my toddlers on these adventures. iâ€™m not sure how much itâ€™s just their personalities, but at 1 and 4 they seem eager to try nearly everything, and there are plenty of fruits and vegetables they enthusiastically enjoy.  -my kids are powerfully motivated by sugar. we donâ€™t ban it, but a small piece of candy for dessert in the evening is contingent on eating some combination of vegetables and protein at dinner. we donâ€™t pressure them to eat more than that, just â€œfour green beans and two bites of eggâ€.  -juice, likewise, occasionally exists in our house but is a treat or an ingredient in a smoothie with lots of greens.  -we eat nearly all of our meals at the table. we all sit down together, and food stays at the table, but after a certain time the kids can excuse themselves. theyâ€™re still little, and we donâ€™t want them to dread dinnertime by forcing them to eat or keeping them in their chairs too long.  -as they get older, my husband and i want to encourage them to do at least â€œone thing with your hands, and one thing with your feetâ€. this is to say we want them to always be involved in at least one creative activity, and one that gets them up and moving. i was probably fat as a kid largely because i was so sedentary.   -without belaboring the point, i do want my girls to know their weight is to a great extent within their control. coming from a fat family gave me a kind of learned helplessness that i didnâ€™t recognize until i left for college. it was just â€œhow it wasâ€ to be a fat person. when i left home for college i realized that if i ate more vegetables and exercised, i would in fact lose weight.  -someone who is really into fitness would probably not be terribly impressed with my physique, but i feel like iâ€™m in a good place. normal weight, able to do things, not suffering any weird effects from obesity-related hormonal imbalance. at the same time, i havenâ€™t given anything up. i eat more or less what i want and donâ€™t worry too much about exercise so long as iâ€™m up and moving (i walk a lot). i am hoping my girls can see â€œhealthyâ€ as sort of a wide band. iâ€™ve said to my 4-year-old that itâ€™s ok to be a little chubby, but you need to be healthy or youâ€™ll get so chubby itâ€™s not fun anymore.  -my takeaway after 20 years of this is that, yeah, everything you put in your mouth- it all matters. and the thinner you want to be, the more every glass of wine and slice of cake matters. maintaining a healthy weight for me is â€œconstant vigilanceâ€, but mainly in the sense that i weigh myself every other day or so. thatâ€™s supposedly not a correct thing to do, but given how what iâ€™m doing is just losing the same 2lbs over and over again forever, it keeps me honest.   -i will encourage them to check their thyroids. i donâ€™t think it was making me fat but iâ€™m sure regulating a subtle problem starting i my 20s has helped.  -eventually i will tell them when it comes to their weight not to worry so much about tacos and instead worry about depression. i donâ€™t think depression made me fat, but it did correlate with being heavier. and for the people i know who are/have been the heaviest, this is almost universally involved.   i think i have some advantages over my own mother. in her day, women were not encouraged to exercise, and she actively dissuaded me from working out. in her day when a woman complained about her weight, the doctor just gave her diet pills that were basically speed. which further wrecked her metabolism. food culture wasnâ€™t what it is now, and while my mom was a great cook, her food was heavy. and i was pressured to eat too much of it, because that was how my parents were raised. and of course nobody had any clue about mental health and its role in all of this. so maybe my kids have a better chance at never being more than a little chubby.",1,-1,
352346,"i grew up on pop tarts and fast food.  i was a massively obese kid.   i discovered stimulants around the end of high school and dropped most of my fat, for a few months anyway.  i had flaps of skin where fat pouches used to be.  now i have a  desk job, and am bigger than i ever had been before.  the worst part of being fat is is internal: realizing i am ""the fat guy"".  it's hard to overcome, even when larger people are around.  the good parts about being fat: you can convince women (or men, whatever you're into) that you're squishy without much trouble.  it's nice to be a pillow.  being a slightly imposing figure has its benefits too.  i have yet to pay extra on an airline.  i do request the emergency exit though.  they tend to ask a few times whether or not i'm ""willing and *capable*"" of performing the emergency row duties.  i feel sad for the stewardesses, having to ask me if  i'm capable of twisting my torso 30 degrees and pulling a lever.  that has never been a comfortable conversation.",1,-1,

330851,"[screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/z2trf6z.jpg)  text:   ""here's what it feels like to be a fat person on a plane."" by lindy west  on a crack-of-dawn flight from new york city to seattle recently, i had my first ever, um, altercation with a seat mate. i'd almost missed the planeâ€”i was that person staggering on board just before the doors closedâ€”and i'm sure he thought he was going to have the row all to himself. i flashed him an apologetic smile (i know that aeronautical heartbreak too well!) and pointed to the middle seat. ""hey, sorry, i'm over there."" he looked at my body, sort of glared blankly at my hips, but didn't respond or make eye contact with me. then, as i went to put my bag in the overhead bin, i heard him mutter something sour.  ""[something something] say excuse me.""  my adrenaline went bonkers. was someone being a dick to me? in person? at 7 am? in an enclosed space? for no reason? when i have a hangover? and we're about to be stuck next to each other for the next five hours? i'm used to men treating me like garbage virtually, or from fast-moving cars, but this close-quarters irl shit-talking was a jarring novelty.  me: ""what?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no, you said something. what did you say?""  him: ""nothing.""  me: ""no. what did you say? tell me.""  other passengers: [silent screams]  him: ""i said that if you want someone to move, it helps to say 'excuse me' and then get out of the way. you told me to move and then you just [gestures at my body in the aisle].""  me [head melting]: ""i'm putting my bag in the overhead bin. you know, because that's how planes work?""  him [dripping with disdain]: ""yeah, okay.""  i sat down. they closed the doors. i said, ""looks like there's no one in the middle seat, so you won't actually have to sit next to me. since i apparently bother you so much.""  him: ""sounds great to me.""  as soon as he fell asleep (with his mouth open like a nerd), i passive-aggressively jarred his foot with my backpack and then said, ""oh, excuse me,"" because i am an adult. we ignored each other for the rest of the flight.  it felt foreign to be confronted so vocally and so publicly (and for such an arbitrary reason), but it also felt familiar. people say the same kind of thing to me with their eyes on nearly every flightâ€”this guy just chose to say it with his mouth.  this is the subtext of my life: ""you're bigger than i'd like you to be."" ""i dread being near you."" ""your body itself is a breach of etiquette."" ""you are clearly a fucking moron who thinks that cheesecake is a vegetable."" ""i know that you will fart on me.""  nobody wants to sit next to a fat person on a plane. don't think we don't know.  i have, in my life, been a considerably thinner person and had a fat person sit next to me on a plane. i have also, more recently, been the fat person that makes other travelers' faces fall. anecdotally, i can verify that being the fat person is almost indescribably worse.  this year, for the first time ever, i got on a plane and discovered that i didn't fit in the seat. i've always been fat, but i was the fat person that still mostly fit. i mean, i couldn't fit into clothes (more tunics patterned like a parisian suitcase, please), and i had to be careful with butt safety (i'll take the chair side, not the banquette, thanks), but i was still the kind of fat person who could move through the straight-size world without causing too many ripples. until this fall.  it's been an incredibly busy year for me professionallyâ€”i've probably flown 20 times in the past eight monthsâ€”and one day i sat down and it just didn't work. i was on a flight home from texas, i think, and the flight out there had been fine. suddenly, on the return flight, i had to cram myself in. i mean, i know i ate that brisket, but i was only gone for two days! i'm no butt scientist (at least, not certified...anymore), but how fast could a person's butt possibly grow!?  if you've never tried cramming your hips into a jagged metal box that's an inch or two narrower than your flesh (under the watchful eye of resentful tourists), then sitting motionless in there for five hours while you fold your arms and shoulders up like an origami orchid in order to be as unobtrusive as possible, run don't walk. it's like squeezing your bones in a vise. the pain makes your teeth ache. it fucking hurts.  but even worse than any physical pain is the anxiety of walking up the aisle and not knowing what plane you're on. am i going to fit this time? will i have to ask for a seatbelt extender? is this a 17-incher or an 18-incher? did i get on early enough that i can get myself crammed in before someone comes and sits next to me? is the person next to me going to hate me? does everyone on this plane hate me? i paid money for this?  people's butts might be getting bigger, sure, but it's a certainty that seats are getting smaller. i fit in every other chair. (some people don't. that's fine too. those are good bodies too. those people deserve respect and accommodations too, without caveats.)  i'm sure some fat people are fat by their own hand, without any underlying medical conditions, but a lot of other fat people are fat because they're sick or disabled. and unless you're checking every human being's bloodwork before they pull up kayak.com, you do not know which fat people are which. which means, inevitably, if you think fat people are ""the problem"" (and not, say, airlines hoping to squeeze out an extra $200 million a year in revenue, or consumers who want cheap airline tickets without sacrificing amenities), you are penalizing a significant number of human beings emotionally and financially for a disease or disability that already complicates their lives. to me, ethically, that's fucked up.  a few weeks ago, i went to seattle's museum of flight for my nephew's 6th birthday party. they have the body of an old airliner from the '60s in there, and you can go hang out in it and pretend you're a mad man or whatever and honk the buns of invisible flight attendants. whatever you're into. and you know what? those seats are fucking huge. it's like sitting in a normal human chair, but in the sky. the difference was incredible. (it was definitely the most interesting exhibit in the museum, and that place also has, like, the first plane. which, to be fair, didn't have seats at all. so...upgrade? i guess?)  soon after that museum visit, i came across this post: ""it is now physically impossible for an adult to fit on a plane."" the wall street journal reported that seats are getting smaller and smaller, even on long international flightsâ€”some squeezing below an already scrunchy 17 inches. in case you don't know how small small is, that is crazy small. that's not just too small for fat people, it's inhumanely small for ""normal""-size people too. another headline: ""airlines squeezing in even more seating.""  southwest, the largest domestic carrier, is installing seats with less cushion and thinner materials â€” a svelte model known in the business as slim-line. it is also reducing the maximum recline to 2 inches from 3. my boyfriend is 6'5"". his shoulders are so wide that he physically must use both armrests (and then some), and his legs are so long that the person in front of him absolutely cannot recline their seat. he doesn't fucking fit. he fits worse than i do. even though fat people are always blamed for ruining everything on planes, i realized the other day thatâ€”thanks to insecurity and my proficiency at origami-armsâ€”i've literally never used a plane armrest. even when i'm in the middle seat. i hear it's nice, though!  none of this is news. the should-fat-people-be-allowed-on-planes debate has been raging for years, and i have no interest in pointlessly rehashing it all over again. some people will always disagree. that's fine.  but i just want to say this: before the day i didn't fit, this conversation was largely an abstraction for me. my stance was the same as it is now (if people pay for a service, it's the seller's obligation to accommodate those people and provide the service they paid for), but i didn't understand what that panicky, uncertain walk down the aisle actually felt like. how inhumane it is. how much it makes you question your worth as a human being. i've done it a dozen or so times now, and i've also had a fat person sit next to me and squish me a little bit for six hours. there is no comparison.  i'm telling you this right now not to get sympathy or pity, or even to change your opinion about how airplanes should accommodate larger passengers. i'm just telling you, human to human, that life is complicated and fat people are trying to live. same as you. regardless of your stance on the ""obesity epidemic,"" these things are objectively true: airplane seats are too small. they're too small for everyone except for small people. it's bad. passengers are going fucking nuts. and, sorry, it's not my responsibility to fix it.  that guy next to me didn't call me fat to my face. i don't even know if that's what was bothering him, although i know the way he looked at my body (my body, not my face, not once, not ever). i can't be sure why that guy was mad at me, but i know why people are mad at me on planes. i know that he disliked me instantly, he invented a reason to be a dick to me, and then he executed it. at 7 am. in a flying fart-can. when i had a hangover. and, much more importantly, i see other people staring those same daggers at other fat people's bodies every day, in the sky and on the ground. it's just a shitty way to go through life, for everyone.  you don't have to change your mind about fat people. but you could just be fucking kind. you could give it a shot. it's the holidays, and we're all in this fart-can together.",1,2,
306624,"the fact is the way she acted after that... imagine a old lady acting like a middle school catty kid.  so wow, she was so courteous to ask if i was in line but then turns around and tries to harass me in a cowardly manner  whoopsie when i dropped the phone battery? like sarcasm ""oooops"" and then stares hard into my face, then looks over my body and called me fat in a loud whisper....really?  &amp;#x200b;  i was way way way off to the side. how could i be in line? i was way back and to the side... plus she went ""whopppsie"" when i dropped the phone battery like trying at that point to annoy me and seemed happy i dropped the battery because of her..... whooopsie? get real and it's funny that a fat cow calls soembody slimmer then them fat. and does so in a low tone and is old enough to be my mother.  as i was plugging the battery back into the cell phone she stood way back from the counter in front of me staring in my face instead of just going to the counter.... yes, it's so courteous to make sure i was not inline when it was obvious i was not inline then proceed to try to bully me. yeah, reall  nice. tsk  because you as a society refuse to believe mental and emotional abuse is violence. you think as long as she did not take a hammer to my head her verbal abuse is ok...verbal abuse is harmful. causes eating disorders and everything else.  and they maliciously know this, but you as a society do not want to believe such evil exists in this world. the victim is just crazy.   but all these cowards who say stuff under their breaths just for the target to hear and think because this was not plainly outloud they can get away with it because if you call them out on it, they know nobody else heard it but the target.  cowards. and calling me fat is not going to make them thinner or prettier. and since i only weigh 115 pounds , even some people said they are trying to make me go anorexic. i have curves even at 100 pounds because i've been there before while others asked me if i was sick,  &amp;#x200b;  i still had those bitches who called me fat names...even in a size 0 they did..... because i still had curves but tiny, you can have curves and be thin... . very small waist, breasts, a little butt and a little hips.  . why don't they go down to 80 pounds and show me how it's done? the fact that they are in fact over weight and call me fat when i am not over weight, i should laugh about but verbal abuse is violence and still abuse even if it's not true.   i'm waiting for them to go down to 80 and 70 pounds and show me how it's done when they are not even as slim as i am....  my own mother heard people and she even said they obviously want me to die by starving... and so you are going to call my mom crazy too?  when i see how fat they are and stuffing their faces. i go have fries and a grilled cheese when they do this to me now, but i do get on the treadmill.... something they obviously don't do.    they also call me slut and other names. ugly when i look like a normal pretty woman.  i had so much sexual harassment from guys and bullied by girls and women.  &amp;#x200b;  so when this woman did this to me yesterday because of my hypervigilance i heard her and noticed her looking me over... then ordering a course meal with her stomach sticking way out.  so she was courteous at first, cowards will be courteous to your face and say shit low but loud enough for their target to hear.  i think because i have large breasts they say i am just fat out of cattiness but if i was just fat, my stomach would not be flat and i would not be wearing a size small in leggings and size small and size 2.  what heavy person wears these sizes?  if i am heavy at 115 they are really in trouble. i should have a fat stomach and no boobs then i'll be fine. sarcasm  for a long time i was bullimic because of these pos... and the funny part is, it's never a skinny girl always fat women and fat girls who try to say i am fat even when i fit into a size 0 and it's not like i am a runway model but they act like i suppose to look like one while they are fatter then a cow.   they are so miserable and spiteful and trying but now failing to try to make me feel about myself the way they feel about themselves. there is always an unusual obsession about my body, my clothes, my hair... insanity at it's best.  i was in a theater class at college and the teacher picked me to do a scene as juliet from romeo and juliet and people were saying ""i knew it"" and some girls were so pissed but if any other girl who got picked to do the scene for that part , not one word would have been said and nobody would be pissed.  you don't know half of it...this is why i noticed this old woman's passive insult and attitude who i started the topic about.  always attacking my looks and body.  .  i believe in karma. one lady who bullied me for two years straight on a job lost her child to intestine mal rotation and even though i would never wish this on a child, karma can be very ugly.. two other women who bullied me died from cancer.  so i believe in karma.  so this is why i am now standoffish, angry and suffer from hypervigilance which now makes it so i notice very slight stuff.  &amp;#x200b;  i be minding my own business and get called a fat name or ugly or slut by some random woman or girl.  who don't even know me.  they have also many times accused me of having a wig or weave when it's my own natural long strawberry blonde hair. then when i flip my hair and put my fingers through my hair they call me a bitch or say i need a wig. after accusing me of having a wig... this has been constant.  i'd be at a amusement park and get wet ""she got her wig wet hahahahahahahahhaa"" it's my real hair.  it gets to the point i feel like harming them.  you don't even know how many jobs women did not want me there and were vicious to me.  one day i was walking in the mall in shorts on a hot summer day and these women walk by ""slut' , ""bitch"" ""oh that's ok, she's going to get raped"" ""cow. "" and i am slimmer then the majority... and just wearing shorts like so many girls and women do when it's hot. i started a job and an obese woman , the first thing she said out of her mouth to the other employee about me ""this bitch looks like she has not eaten in two months"" and talked to me in a very hostile abrupt tone and called me ugly and made my life hell in the job.. then one day i come in ""oh she gained weight, fat"" and it was just the clothes i had on that day and water retention but how can somebody go from too thin to fat in three days and why would she care sooo much and she weighed about 250 pounds... one of her arms was the size of my thigh... . my body had nothing to do with her or the job.  then i started doing really well on the job and she would go running out and slamming doors when i was getting sales on the phone, one after another. telling the owner lies.  i had to quit because of her.  another job they destroyed my work... i can go on all day. crazy. this is why i now work alone making food deliveries.  only to still have some woman or girl here and there try to harass me and attack me in a cowardly way.  another job where my mom worked with me. this lady was so enraged and once again kept calling me fat, and i have a small nose, full lips, nice eyes but just like most people i am not perfect so i have a slight over bite and i am not vain enough to go have surgery on my narrow upper jaw or braces to help and it's not severe or anything and she and her friends kept making beaver sounds, making jokes about beaver, making gestures with their teeth going ""uh ohfffffaaa "" with their teeth intentionally sticking far out of their mouths like mine are not even like that. mine don't come out of my mouth. threatening to burn my hair. my mother ran out crying and because my mother was a witness and threatened to sue, they all got fired. the only time out of all these jobs, so many some kind of justice was done ... and  even the owner was confused saying to me ""but you're beautiful and they're ugly"" well, it's not like the movies where only hot people bully someone less fortunate.  and you don't know half of it. i try to be nice and only to get verbally abused and ostrasized .... constantly... and men only talk down to me and sexaulize me. i crave for somebody to see me as a human being... i don't know how that feels so before you call me crazy and say this woman was just polite. calling somebody heavy in an angry tone and saying ""whooopsie"" in a nasty tone was real polite.    they act like a stranger is a family member or somebody they know, getting in peoples private space. i was soooo far back from the counter, way off to the side. i am not an idiot. if i was in line i would have been at the counter, nobody else was there.   people have low iq's... they are cowards bullying in a indirect passive manner. if i was not being friendly, no need to try at that point to aggravate me, oh, i was not all jolly and friendly. i don't owe a stranger anything.  it's feces like this lady who start something and then if i kicked her old fat ass i would have been in trouble. the fact  this is how she handled somebody who was not overly joyful... you don't know what women have done to me on jobs because they are jealous and miserable. complaining i am too thin or fat when they are obese and my body has nothing to do with them.....you have no idea, none... so i may have hyperviglilance because of this but i know when somebody is being aggressive and i use to be sooo sweet and nice , for women to still insult me in a low tone..attacking my body and looks.... when they could not ever get my pants passed their ankles or my shirts passed their shoulders.  firing me because i wore fitted dresses and leggings when the whole place was wearing leggings, short dresses with no tights,  and the abuse i've been through you have no idea.. .and this was just another pos yesterday...",1,-2,

246098,"re: your ""running through a backyard"" anecdote. i absolutely have no doubt that skin color and sex make a huge difference in how a person is seen as they perform the same acts.  but, i do find some real frustration in the subtle claim that i am being racist (or sexist) by viewing it as such (not by your comment, but overall).   i mean, i don't live in a community very heavily populated by blacks, but we do have ethnic groups up here that are viewed the same way, and i admit that if i were to see one of them running through my yard, i would assume it's because he just stole something. in most cases, according to the statistics (yes, yes... but it's the best i have) i'd be right.  unquestionably, there are numerous much, much deeper social and political reasons why the statistics say what they do, but strictly as it pertains to your tale -- the cold truth is that racial assumptions are often correct.   let me put it this way: the home-boy with gold teeth and triple oversized jeans standing across the street at night in any big city just *might* have a damned gun, and i admit that i resent the implication that my crossing the street to keep a distance makes me a racist.   my safety is more important than how he feels. it's like me wearing a freaking swastika and a shaved head and then complaining when people make their own assumptions.",0,,

970249,"&gt;are you equating obesity with schizophrenia?  of course not.  that's a straw-man argument.  there are parallels, however.  &gt;i won't deny that there is a genetic component to obesity, but there are real and proven methods for reducing obesity, and yes they include eating less (and better) and moving more.  i will agree that there are ""real methods"". proven?  that's another story.  can you cite a large-scale controlled study where obese patients have been able to consistently maintain a healthy bmi for &gt; 2 years?  i'll give you a hint.  there isn't one. the majority of obese people rebound off of weight loss, which has led researchers to suspect an 'optimal' bmi which can be moved about 5-10%, but no more than that.  in addition, further weight-loss is typically associated with a rebound weight gain that is *more* than what was originally lost.  this cycling is also correlated with a reduction in life-span.  &gt;is there some sort of sudden genetic epidemic that we're missing that has caused the us population to suddenly get larger over the past fifty years? no, people are moving less and eating worse.  no.  i'm saying there is a sudden *epi*genetic generational epidemic that, yes, was/is caused by cheap high-calorie content food.  as i pointed out elsewhere in this thread, there *are* epigenetic components to obesity.    just because they don't agree with your world view makes them no less real.  &gt;even if, as you seem to claim, there is an epigenetic component, epigenetic components are not permanant since they have evolved to allow individuals to respond to short-term (environmental) conditions.  we're basically agreeing here.  but saying that it's not permanent provides no insight into its duration.  it could be multi-generational for all we know.  and with respect to the argument of ""people were skinny...now they're fat...so it must be reversible.""  not everything works that way.  i can break your bones by running you over with my car, but i'll just make it worse if i shift into reverse.  put another way...all chemical reactions are theoretically reversible.  but if the delta-g is &lt;&lt; 0, it can be a real bitch going from product back to reactants.  &gt;obese people need help, both moral support and medical help for those who have difficulty losing weight. but let's be honest as well, much of the cure rests in the individual, as opposed with, say, schizophrenia.  at some level, *all* cures rest with the individual.  but what is the cure?  do you think obese people genuinely enjoy being fat?  i think what drives a lot of these opinions on obesity are as follows:  the following points are jmho  * obesity is largely a derangement/decoupling of appetite/energy needs that is largely genetic/epigenetic/physiological.  * those who are not obese tend **not** to have this derangement/decoupling and are therefore mystified at people who over-eat.  they chalk obesity up to ""stupidity"" and ""lack of will"" (whatever that means).  * this opinion then allows the non-obese to partition themselves into a sense of superiority--at some level this is true by definition--they *are* healthier, but they see obesity as largely a ""choice"" much the same way that conservatives see homosexuality.  * many dogs will typically eat as much as much food as you give them--to the point where they can die from over-eating.  they don't do this because they're stupid (although they are, relatively speaking).  they do this because **that's how they're programmed**.  cats are equally (if not less) intelligent and yet their physiological programming prevents significant overeating.  why would programmatic regulation of appetite *not* be a factor with other species as well?  * i'm not saying that modern society with its luxuries and such haven't caused obesity.  they probably have a significant contribution.  but this doesn't mean that reversing it is as easy as walking up to the sink and shutting off the faucet.",1,1,
967475,"i suggest you check out [r/eatingdisorders](http://www.reddit.com/r/eatingdisorders).  edit:  oh, dear lord, wall of text.  tl;dr had anorexia, what it was like, got over it, ideas for helping girlfriend (that may or may not be beneficial--sorry, not a psychologist), and good luck!  edit 2:  also, know that my case of anorexia was not particularly severe.  your girlfriend's could likely be much worse.  as such, i don't know of how much help, if any, my story or advice will be.  just fair warning.  *my personal story*:  i developed anorexia when i was in tenth grade.  i've always been kind of on the heavy-ish side of healthy, but it had always bothered me a little that i wasn't naturally thin like all of the other girls.  the trigger for my anorexia was kind of weird; i was involved in marching band my sophomore year, and our marching band was always practicing, 3-5 hours a day minimum (we were one of the best bands in the state).  but all of the practice outside gave me ample opportunity possible trigger ahead [to see how skinny everyone else's legs and shadows were.  it was stupid, but it got to me that my legs were so solid compared to a lot of people's.](/spoiler)  i'm not really sure why that pushed me over the edge, but it did.  i felt fat and ugly, and so i stopped eating almost completely.  it was bad.  i'd eat a real meal with my family once a week (dinner, the night i had off from band practice), but other than that i'd throw my food away whenever i could hide it from people, i'd never finish drinks, and i felt bad even drinking water.  even though i hated seeing myself in the mirror and seeing the number on the scale, i couldn't stop looking at myself in every reflective surface and i'd strip myself down several times an hour to weigh myself when i was at home.  besides marching band, i also had gym class, plus i'd work out 1-3 hours on the treadmill at home besides.  fortunately, i was only anorexic for a month or two.  i lost about 15-20 pounds, but i still looked fat to myself.  to give you an idea of what might be going on from your girlfriend's point of view, here's how i would describe the anorexic outlook on body image, based on my own experiences:  you know those pictures where there's an anorexic girl looking at herself in a mirror, and her reflection is a chubby girl?  those pictures are a little bit misleading.  when i was anorexic, yes, i looked fat to myself, but i didn't see that when i looked in the mirror.  and it wasn't like i couldn't see my bones showing.  quite to the contrary, i could see my ribs and my spine where i couldn't see them nearly as well before i was anorexic.  but that didn't matter.  they looked like fat rolls to me.  so i'm guessing your girlfriend can see her bones, too.  it's just that when you're anorexic, you don't *really* see them, if that makes sense.  you only see them in terms of the fat on them, and the other imperfections surrounding them.  so even if your girlfriend can see bone, she doesn't see skinny, like a healthy person.  she sees fat, and--for me at least--fat equaled ugly.  so, i guess, remember that an anorexic person doesn't stop eating because she wants to be prettier.  she just doesn't want to feel hideous.  *how i got better*:  i was really lucky in that i got better without any intentional outside help.  it happened because i was brushing my hair after gym class, and a girl i perceived as thin (which she was) was sharing my mirror.  i happened to glance at her reflection, and i suddenly realized that even though i still looked fat to myself, i was skinnier than her.  i went home and weighed myself with all my (winter) clothes on, and the numbers told me that i was thinner than i had been in years--since early middle school, in fact, when i was several inches shorter.  these realizations, plus comments from my parents like, ""oh, now you have a girlish figure!"" and the end of marching band and gym class (which greatly enabled my anorexia) convinced me intellectually that, okay, even if you can't see it, you are thin.  you can eat more food now.  so i did.  i gained the weight back, but because i didn't have nearly as much time to exercise and excuses to avoid eating (as i had to eat meals with my family again) i had to actively train myself to not see myself as ugly.  i had to lie to myself that i was thin, even as i could see myself gaining weight, that i was not gaining weight, and that even if i was, i looked fine.  i refused to weigh myself anymore because i didn't think i could take seeing the rising numbers.  after about a year of this, i looked good to myself again, better than i ever had, in fact (even though i actually weighed more).  one thing that i think helped was getting my first boyfriend, because i had always kind of thought that i was plain on my ""good"" days.  but just getting a boyfriend, even though it didn't ultimately work out, helped me realize that i was attractive enough.  today (several years later), i don't have any body image issues, though there are a few habits from my anorexic days that i still have.  i don't like finishing drinks i pour for myself, not even water (when i was anorexic, doing so made me feel bloated and like a pig, plus if i didn't finish that meant i wasn't taking in as many calories), i still compulsively look at myself in mirrors, and i am still a bit picky about the fit of the clothes i wear (they have to fit a certain way or i think they make me look fat).  so yeah, that's my story.  i don't know if it was what you're looking for, but maybe it helped?  *ideas for helping your girlfriend*:  getting treatment is already a hugely positive thing.  be careful about what you say around her regarding her looks; when i was anorexic, anything and everything could be construed to mean, ""you look fat,"" or, ""you should keep being anorexic because it's helping you.""  but ultimately, to become truly better your girlfriend has to change her thought processes, and the only way people on the outside can help is by helping her change her exterior habits (like, eating habits, exercise habits, that sort of thing).  otherwise, it's up to her and luck, and it will be difficult and it will take time.  but if she can just kick the anorexia in the mind, really kick it, things do get better.  if she can get through it, she'll likely become more comfortable with her body than she ever has before.  i certainly did.  still am.  i definitely would not do anorexia over again if i had a choice, but getting over it taught me a lot.  i wish both of you the best of luck!  i hope your girlfriend gets better!",1,-1,1
949746,"1: that's fairly normal. the foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. if it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. but in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. it might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so i wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. if it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, i don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. i hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  i know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, i really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. but here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/penis-health/pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. and it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. but, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. i wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. it isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  but every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. your reaction is up to you.  most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. so doing it quick and only short glances is best. but curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  it isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  but eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. it's one of those things you get used to. when you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. nobody really does tbh.",0,,
740781,"you're getting a lot of conflicting advice all over this thread and as someone who used to hate climbing hills, i'm going to try to reign it in and tame this herd of wild ponies for you a little better:  first and foremost: despite what people are saying, pain and suffering aren't good or necessary. you shouldn't be *suffering* to climb hills, especially with knee or leg pain.  pain in the knees or legs isn't something you should be embracing or accepting. knee and leg pain is bad and it's not something you should just pedal through.  you don't *mash* a bike uphill like you're doing leg presses or squats on a weight machine. if you're straining and mashing at the pedals something is wrong with your setup or experience.  you *spin* a bike up hill by having a high pedal cadence (cadence = pedal strokes per minute), a properly fitting bike and the right gears for the job.  where your efforts should be is in cardio, not strength. you're not weightlifting or strength training on a bike. a bike is more like running or swimming and it's supposed to be low impact, not a test of strength.  when pedaling the proper technique is to ""spin"" the balls of your feet in tight, smooth circles. visualize the balls of your feet making nice, clean circles as you pedal instead of mashing them like pistons. pretend you're a sewing machine or an eggbeater or some other delicate, well oiled precision machine instead of thinking about it like your legs are hydraulic pistons.  spinning your feet like this is how you get the most energy into your pedals through your chain and gears to the tires. you're applying some power around most of the circle of each pedal stroke, with the bulk of the power on the downward stroke, while consciously lifting your rear foot as it also is tracing a nearly perfect circle.  as each foot traces that nearly perfect circular but opposing strokes your feet help each other through the pedal stroke. at the back of the stroke your foot should be lifting, at the top it should be pushing forward, at the front it's pushing down, and at the bottom it's pulling back, like you're running and pushing forward off the ground.  do that with each foot opposite of each other and focus on making them turn in even circles and you're *spinning* your pedals.  you also need a properly sized and adjusted bicycle. if your seat is too low or your bike frame is too small or too large it's going to hurt more and this is super bad for your knees.  your legs should be almost straight but not fully extended at the bottom of each stroke. your seat (saddle) should be adjust high enough to make that happen, but it also needs to be adjust in position front to back on top of the seat post to give you a comfortable position for pedaling.  yes, unfortunately modern mountain bikes aren't actually good at climbing hills. the squishy suspension and fat tires are made for going down rough terrain at high speeds, not climbing. if you have locking suspension, lock it out for climbs.  this is also why mtbs have ""dropper"" seat posts or seats with quick releases.   raise your seat for climbing hills or riding flats so you can have a clean pedal stroke and leg length. lower your seat for bombing down hills so you can stand up on your pedals and have room to throw the bike around on rough terrain.  the stock gear ratios that came with your might also not be ideal for climbing. if you have lots and lots of hills you can usually gain a lot of benefit by changing out the gears, especially the rear ones.  a smaller front gear (chainring, the ones on the cranks) and larger rear gear (cassette or cogs, the ones on the back wheel) make it much much easier to climb hills and enable higher pedal speeds and easier climbing.  the stock default gears that come with almost all bikes are usually pretty basic and set up for average, flatland casual riding. even on mtbs the default gears aren't usually that good for climbing.  so, for an example i do bike touring on a bike that's somewhere between a road bike and an old school mtb with skinny tires and no suspension. check out /r/xbiking for lots of examples of this kind of bike. my bike basically looks like an old school mtb with flat bars and bar ends and everything except it's running on 700c x 38c wheels with semi-slick touring tires.  i'm usually running a triple chain ring on the front (3x) and a nine speed cassette on the rear (9x) making it a 27 speed. (the new way of doing things is a 1x on the front and like 10 to 12x on the back.)  for climbing my smallest chainring on the front is a bit smaller than stock, while the largest cog on the back cassette is rather large. they make 9 speed ""touring"" cassettes to expand hill climbing just for bikes like mine and climbing hills with heavy loads. off the top of my head the largest gear on my rear cassette is, i think, a 42t while the small/low gear on my front is like a 30t.  sure, these gears are slower but with a good spinning technique and cadence i can climb right up the sides of dirt trails so steep i can barely walk up them - and that's on a skinny tired bike that's basically just a heavy duty road bike with too many racks and stuff bolted on it.  and because i have higher pressure, skinnier tires and lots of gears on a lighter bike and i'm using good pedaling technique and experience - i can climb up roads and dirt trails and dust most people when climbing on heavier mtbs with full suspension and fat tires and even beat mtbs at cross country single track or trail riding.  the only place an mtb rider can leave me in the dust is downhill over really rough terrain or catching air on jumps. i can't handle heavy roots or rocks bigger than gravel sized at high speeds, but i can still go some pretty tough places at much lower speeds even though i have relatively skinny tires and no suspension.  i hope that helps a lot of things make more sense. i absolutely *hated* climbing hills until i learned how to spin my pedals properly and changed up my stock gears.",0,,

569442,"for anyone who doesn't want to give the mail any clicks.  **why are today's young women so unashamed about being fat? horrified by the rolls of flesh she's witnessed on show this summer, linda kelsey takes no prisoners**  * our writer is a self-confessed fattist * she thinks being obese is unattractive and unhealthy * she doesn't believe issue should be tip-toed around for fear of causing eating disorders  standing in the queue for airport security at luton last week, en route to malaga and my fortnight in the sun, i became transfixed by the three young women in front of me.  all in their early 20s, they were laughing and chatting, clearly looking forward to their hols on the costa del sol, excitedly planning their days on the beach and nights on the town.  they sounded - and looked - happy and carefree. but what mesmerised me most about this jolly trio was not their conversation, but their appearance: they were size 18 apiece, at least.  they were not chubby, but fat. they had bulging bellies and billowing pillows of back and shoulder stuffing, punctured by flabby arms and lardy legs that no amount of fake-tan could disguise.  and what struck me even more forcefully about these lumpen individuals (there were dozens more, equally large, in the queue behind me) was how obviously unconcerned they were about it.  one was wearing shockingly skimpy crochet shorts, as seen on size-zero models in adverts. but in this case, the shorts made it appear the wearer had an extra bottom hanging below the cut-off hemline.  another girl wore white stretch leggings with a pattern of cellulite dimples showing through, accessorised with a super-sized sausage of overhanging belly.  meanwhile, the third sported a cut-away vest top revealing the entire back of her pink bra, complete with chunky rolls of fat above, beneath and around the straps. to top it all, these three were - i kid you not - sharing a bag of crisps.  it occurred to me that if these girls hated their bodies and were racked with self-loathing, as we're so often told that the majority of young women do and are, they were doing a grand job of projecting exactly the opposite impression.  far from body hatred, what i witnessed was a let-it-all-hang-out faith in themselves and a don't-give-a-damn attitude to their evident obesity.  and it's one that must be shared by many, given that it's not just in departure lounges that i witness young fatties confidently flashing their flesh. i see it on the high street every day of summer, in the park where they strip down to their undies the second the sun comes out, and outside any given pub after dark, even in winter.  un-pc of me as it may be to criticise my sex for their size, when it comes to weight i'm not afraid to say it: i am unapologetically fattist. it's unattractive, it's unhealthy and, given the problems that being fat can cause, it should be as unacceptable as smoking.  yet to judge by the moral panic over anorexia you would think our daughters are a generation of self-starving stick insects. that each and every one of them is dangerously striving for keira knightley's razor-sharp scapula and fried egg breasts or victoria beckham's hand-span thighs and knife-edge hips.  this is clearly a fallacy, and it's one that needs addressing, because not only are most fatties doing nothing substantial to reduce their size, the cost of obesity to the nation's health - not to mention the health budget - is enormous. and it's getting worse.  i don't deny that anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders are a pernicious problem, and i've witnessed at close hand the devastating effects of anorexia as young daughters of friends and acquaintances have succumbed to it.  but in the cases i've come across, the psychological issues these girls were suffering from had far more to do with their driven personalities, their determination to be a* students at any cost, as well as troubles with over-demanding parents, than simply emulating glossy magazine images of super-skinny models and stick-thin celebrities on the red carpet.  skinny celebrity icons are an issue, but i don't believe they're the issue on which society should focus in our muddle over body image.  far more attention and, dare i say it, opprobrium needs to be directed at young fatties who eat unhealthy diets and sit around watching tv and texting rather than going to the gym or even for a walk.  while it's well known that socio-economic factors have a bearing on weight - with those on lower incomes more likely to eat sugar and fat-laden diets, and less likely to exercise - there are other factors being ignored.  a generation of mothers seem to have swallowed a dangerously misguided message of body acceptance; making them terrified of telling their daughters they're getting fat for fear they'll stop eating altogether.  mums are now so busy shoring up their daughters' self-worth by telling them they're lovely just the way they are, they're becoming guilty of benign neglect instead.  i can't count the number of mothers who have confided in me their concerns about their daughters' weight, while emphasising they'd never say anything about them tipping the scales because they don't want to tip them into anorexia.  i don't have a daughter, nor do i have a weight problem. i've always felt it was unattractive and unhealthy to be fat and i've always been disciplined about what i eat without ever starving myself.  i love food, but even today, at 62, i am still very careful to cut back if i feel my jeans getting too tight. while i have sympathy for those with genuine metabolic conditions, the majority of today's fatties seem simply too greedy, ill-disciplined and or ignorant to do the same.  the statistics speak for themselves. according to the government-backed health and social care information centre, the proportion of overweight and obese women has increased by 10 per cent in less than a decade.  and youngsters are getting fatter at an ever earlier age - one in ten four to five-year olds are now officially obese when they start school. that figure almost doubles when you look at under-15s. these statistics are particularly shocking because the earlier fat sets in, the harder it is to shift in later life.  of course we can, and should, blame the greedy manufacturers of addictive sugar and fat-loaded foods for cynically marketing them at the young.  but as a mother of a food-loving son myself - who was only allowed biscuits, ice cream and the occasional mcdonald's as treats - i know full well that healthy alternatives are out there. overfeeding your kids is not love, it's abuse.  fat is killing millions and costing billions. more than Â£5 billion to the nhs each year, in fact, compared to the Â£80 million to Â£100 million that eating disorders cost.  of course, eating disorders can kill. but being overweight leads to high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks and even cancer. according to cancer research uk, as many as one in ten cancer cases could be prevented by improving our diet. the link to breast cancer is less clear, but dietary fats are increasingly thought to be implicated.  type 2 diabetes, linked to being overweight, is on the increase and more children are suffering from it. asthma, sleep apnoea, acid reflux, fatty liver disease, dozens of illnesses, minor and major, can be linked to being overweight. fat, and this canâ€™t be denied, is fatal.  we live in a society in which it has become ok to shame people for being skinny, but to come out and say 'youâ€™re fat. not healthy, not a good look' would be tantamount to a crime.  it's about time we stopped tiptoeing around the size issue, stopped kidding ourselves that anorexia, however serious, is the biggest eating problem we face, and started to tackle fat for the problem that it is.  not because celebrities and models are worthy of emulating but because fat is a blight on both individuals and society.  one way to start might be by calling a fat girl a fat girl. no apology required.  **i'm just sorry that i can't capture the pics and comments as easily**",1,-2,

170332,"slimness indicates health ... in the the contemporary era. throughout human history, where food shortages and food scarcity have been a huge concern, having extra weight was a better indicator of health than being skinny. as well, caring a little extra body fat is better than having no body fat. if you get cancer and you start losing weight, your body starts with the fat. if you don't have any, it goes for the muscle, which is much worse for your health in the long run. so the extreme thinness we idealize in contemporary western culture is totally out of sync with historical ideals of beauty, and out of sync with what is actually healthy. anorexia (which kills one in five) and other eating disorders (which are illnesses! not a signifier of health) along with cocain abuse run rampent in the fashion industry. so they achieve a skinniness that is unhealthy, then that gets photoshopped to make them even thinner. so cultural influence is what's driving the slim ideal, not nature or health.  if you look back into the victorian era ideals of women were more plump than what we've got bow. the renaissance had heavy set women in most of their paintings, not just portraits but even those of mythical figures.  just as an fyi before you mention corsets - most women didn't wear them to the point of organ damage, certain models did, and yes they pulled in the waist but the rest of them was fairly plump - they were more about pushing up the bust and making the butt and bust appear more noticable relative to their middle, not about the slimmness itself.  heck, even with fertility, extra weight is usually better. gymnists don't hit puberty till their late teens for a reason. their bodies just don't have enough energy to go through the process. women who are anorexic stop having their periods. being really thin and having no body fat fucks around with fertility, hardly something any natural ideal of beauty based on reproduction success would zero in on.  the preference for thinness isn't as innate as evo-psych theorists like to think. they rarely include cross cultural studies or historical examples. in most parts of the world women who look as thin as north american women do are sickly looking. when cross cultural studies do happen, it's found most men prefer women who carry some extra weight - not obese but in the higher end of healthy weight ranges while north americans prefer those at the lower ranges, or those who are medically underweight - so those who would be in trouble if food scarsity or a plague hit.",1,,-1

310929,"i don't know anything about socal.  so i can't help you there.  there's gotta be stuff online.  plus, you can always call some rangers.  i agree that starting out with what acies says about starting out with shoes, a pack, warm clothing (no cotton) and rain gear.  but if you really want to jump right in, i'll give you some advice.  *the complete walker* by fletcher and rawlins is the backpacking encyclopedia.  they cover everything from tents and snowcaves to backpacks and boots.  some of the info is a little bit dated and some of the gear they suggest is a bit on the heavy side.  even so, the techniques and ideas they discuss are indispensable.   *trail life*, by ray jardine (i have the previous edition called *beyond backpacking*) is a fantastic resource.  jardine seeks to elevate backpacking to a science and an art.  he is a pioneer in ultralight backpacking and a real do-it-yourself-er.  when he first thru-hiked the pacific crest trail, his ""base weight"" (all his gear and extra clothing, no food and water) was 24 pounds.  now it is about 8.5 pounds.  jardine's book probably isn't that good of a book for the novice.  he assumes you have a good working knowledge of backpacking and backpacking gear.  so he sometimes skips over things that might not be obvious to novices.  even so, it is a great resource.  i wish i read it years ago instead of a month ago.  both of these books are highly readable and full of interesting stories from the adventures these men have had.  as for backpacking gear specifically, here we go!  * [the ten essentials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten_essentials)  * renting: many outfitters will let you rent tents, packs and other equipment at minimal costs.  this is a great way to go backpacking without spending a ton of money up front.  of course, if you really like it you'll want to get your own gear, but this is a great way to start.  * shelter  this is pretty important, obviously, because if you don't have a comfortable and dry place to sleep, you won't have a very good time.  but are you sure you need a tent.  if it isn't going to rain, why bother?  the most affordable setup is a tarp.  there are countless ways to set up a tarp.  the a-frame an the lean-to are two very simple and common setups.  you can get an economy urethane tarp for like 10 bucks.  a sil-nylon tarp is much lighter and nicer. it is also 6 times as expensive.  if it is going to be buggy, you need some protection.  you could get something called a ""bug bivy"", or you could just get a bunch of mosquito netting (or, better yet, no-see-em netting).  not the most elegant setup, but it is cheap and it works.  this would be my recommendation.  you will have a much larger shelter then you would with a tent and you will spend far less money.  some people use hammocks.  they hang out. under a tarp.  pretty neat, but not for me.  a hammock system will probably run you about $200.  another option is a tent.  tents range in price from 60 bucks to boy, this is really expensive!  the lightest tents are about 2 pounds.  if you get a tent, get it for one more person than you need it for.  2 people in most (but not all) 2-person tents will be pretty cramped.  cheap tents are heavy.  if you go to target and get a 2-man tent, it will probably be 5 or 6 pounds.  not terrible if you are with someone, but a lot of weight for one person.  there are some other options too.  like tarp-tents, bivi bags and amphetamines (that's a joke).  don't sink much money into this one.  either get a cheapo heavy tent from target or get a tarp, some line, some netting and a ground cloth (a smaller tarp or just plastic painter's drop cloths work great). in fact, you can use a painter's tarp. it is much lighter.  it is also far less durable and you might feel bad about buying something that you will probably just throw away after a few uses.  * sleeping bag  this is extremely important.  if you become hypothermic (which is very possible anytime the temp is below 50*f), a sleeping bag can save your life. you have a lot of choices here.  down vs. synthetic.  mummy vs. rectangular vs. backpacking quilt (it is like 1/2 of a sleeping bag, it just goes above you).  get one that will be warm enough.  but you might be able to get away with one that isn't.  for example, suppose you have a 40 degree bag and you know the low temp is supposed to be 20 degrees.  you might be ok if you wear a lot of extra clothing (long johns, pants, down jacket, hat, gloves), eat a big, hot meal with lots of fat before bed (think bacon) and have some hot drinks at hand when you get into bed.  * sleeping pad  sleeping bags keep you warm by trapping hot air in the insulation.  so the part of the bag you are lying on does nothing to keep you warm.  the ground is cold, so you need to get off that shit.  a cheap, blue, closed-cell [pad](http://www.rei.com/product/374053/standard-blue-foam-pad-regular) shouldn't be more than 20 bucks.  it will be cheaper other places.  a pad is also nice to have because it is softer.  but the primary reason to use a pad is because the ground is cold.  * cooking  all you need is a simple pot with a lid.  aluminum is cheap and much lighter than steel, but less durable.  titanium is light, strong and expensive.  don't buy a stove.  [make one!](http://jwbasecamp.com/articles/supercat/index.html) it will be almost free.  plus, it is lighter than just about anything on the marketplace.  * water  gatorade bottles are light, strong and cheap.  you probably want to make your water clean to drink. you could boil it, but that takes a while and uses too much fuel.  i like aquamira drops.  iodine is a bit old-school, but it works.  don't buy a filter.  maybe later, but not now.  when you fill your bottles, point them down stream, so they don't get as much sediment in them.  you can also cover the openings with a bandanna or something to form a crude filter.  * clothing  take what you need, leave what you don't.  good-by clean undies!  but taking some extra socks is a really good ideas.  do not bring cotton.  ok? no fucking cotton!  cotton is fine for the city, but it is the exact opposite of what you want to wear in the woods.  synthetics, wool, silk. it all works.  several thin layers are better than a few thick layers.  a rain coat (or at least a poncho) is pretty important.  i don't want to say that you don't need rain pants....but you don't need rain pants.  * luxuries  books, candles, whiskey, camp shoes.  you don't need these things, but you might want them.  try not to carry too many.  the weight adds up fast.  * pack  get one that fits you and all your gear with some room left over for food and water.  there are a lot of options here.  the annoying thing is this: it is a good idea to buy your pack last.  on the other hand, you can't do any backpacking without a pack, so it is a bit of a catch-22.  * footwear  don't assume you need big-time shit-kicking boots. many people prefer trail runners.  it is partly a function of weight.  if you have a really heavy pack, you might need heavy boots.  but i've don't backpacking in minimalist shoes with a heavy pack and it was ok for me.  lots of people use trail running shoes.  shoes, like packs, are very idiosyncratic.  a good pot is a good pot.  if i like it you will probably think it is pretty good too.  but a pack or some shoes which might fit me and work for me are not guaranteed to work for you.  so try before you buy.  and when you try the pack, put some weight in it (ideally your gear +food and water).  many stores have sandbags that let you simulate different weights.",0,,

612360,"yes, seasonal at best ... the fruit in nature is typically small and often not nearly as sweet as what we're accustomed to. plus full of pits, so there's even less edible flesh. when it comes to vegetables ... what vegetables exactly are there in nature? leafy greens like kale and  spinach, or broccoli are out of the picture since they're man made. so are carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. there's nearly nothing left!  not to mention humanity has been through ice ages ... i recently read a piece about how all we could possibly eat then was raw meat. no vegetation available.  &gt;great point and it speaks to the larger point of what would our ancestors have eaten given the choice?  i listened to a video where it was said that during our history as a species there was a group of apes (or something of the sort) who did remain herbivorous. they simply didn't develop the brain that their carnivorous counterparts did (which started out as following larger predators and eating whatever they left behind of their prey), so they eventually died off.  &gt;this doesn't mean we haven't eaten vegetables historically.  i guess depends how far back we go ... in middle ages yes, people relied on crops and such, but those were poor malnourished peasants, and people at the time generally were rather short. while the earlier humans (pre-agriculture) are said to be much taller (even taller than us!) and healthier. i haven't double checked this information, but i think the majority checks out from what i can remember learning in school. egyptians also had a [heavily plant-based diet](https://www.insidescience.org/news/what-did-ancient-egyptians-really-eat), interestingly [atherosclerosis was a thing then](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/piis0140-6736(10)60294-2/fulltext), so was diabetes, etc.  &gt;yeah i'm not sure what the options are if not water. broth maybe?  yup, broth is something i heard mentioned a lot. also raw eggs are said to be refreshing. maybe also stuff like bone marrow. it's definitely fatty so it should help with retaining the moisture. i still haven't come to the bottom of it, i've been busy with stuff, but i think maybe water with some lemon juice? milk does seem to be good for that! two dcl of full fat milk is only about 10g of carbs, so it's not detrimental.   if we go completely by his logic, then yeah raw meat, blood, and some water would be the go to. to be honest, that is a bit hardcore for my taste, not to mention unpractical. at this point i still enjoy cooked meat, and while i'd be happy to try a rare steak, full on raw is still a lot. that would be a chore to get down, and i do think while food is fuel it should be enjoyable to have too. not to mention blood drinking ... where am i even supposed to get it? but i hear that people do great with just (cooked) read meat and water too. so i'll hold my horses with that now. :)  &gt;i suppose one way to actively test this would be to get a pet and feed it the carnivore diet and see how much water they drink?  again, anecdotal, but some people say that when they feed their pets raw meat they stop drinking entirely. with my own cats, they eat a mix of canned meat, whatever they catch, and dry food. to be honest, they do seem to be markedly thirstier after starting on the latter. i don't really recall them ever drinking much or at all before that.  water ph, distilled water, infused water, electrolyte water, sparkling water, crystal activated water ... there's so much out there and i honestly don't know. it would make sense that if we evolved without something we shouldn't need it, but then again natural isn't necessarily always better ... maybe there's still room to optimise the diet by figuring out what exactly we run on best. what is probably safe to say is that the food is a much bigger part of the equation that the type of water. you're probably good or great with whatever, and those final alterations might not make a big difference.  yes, exactly, seeing those does look like borderline mania or eating disorder. they often eat a ton of food for every meal, there's a lot that goes into preparation, they have numerous meals that are soon followed by sweet desserts. they just seem to be in constant flux from that sugar crash, or in chase of the sugar high. they're mad for chocolate, tea, coffee, super sweet tropical fruit, dried fruit, dates, syrup drizzles, anything to give them an extra oomph. i remember how i felt, and maybe i'm projecting to a degree, or maybe just understand what is behind those wide-eyed foodies ... they're never full and food is *always* on your mind.  not to mention the mukbang channels. i know they are very much not limited to the vegan demimonde, and they didn't start out as such. but they are very popular with them. i used to watch them too, just to feel some of that vicarious satisfaction of eating when i had already had enough but was still famished.  when you consider having to pair up certain foods, your choices of what to have for lunch are suddenly drastically diminished. so much for an 'abundant, varied diet.' you get to choose between eating a lot of different (heavily processed) foods that will likely not meet your rdas, or you have to stick to tried and true daily plans. they do say 'eat enough' but just to meet the vitamin and mineral requirements on paper you'd be met with more food that is comfortable to put in your stomach, which would lead to digestive issues, and if you managed to eat it all, severe weight gain. (and given all the carbs, probably diabetes.)  yeah ... it does seem like veganism is no longer the loony pariah diet and it's actually gaining public favour. so finding overtly negative things said about it or its practitioners is kinda tough. i did research about veganism and was always met with articles that said something affirmative about it, that it should be safe when properly supplemented with those pesky b vitamins. but once i developed a number of very obvious issues i had something to pair my original google search with: veganism + (insert symptom). and lo and behold, then, only then i came across a treasure trove of new, never before seen information. a whole channel dedicated to ex-vegans sharing their horrible stories of becoming ill and finally quitting. that's how i ran into the carnivore sphere in the first place. through hearing about what it took for them to recover.  &gt;but ask a vegan to do a jump or a pull up or use their strength in some way outside of the routine. they'll fail every time.   my experience also. i'm not an athletic sporty person, but i've been wanting to get in shape for some time now. well, poor nutrition is a sure way of preventing that. i worked out very regularly in college, at the time mostly body weight stuff and cardio, but my muscle mass was simply wasting away. i developed that classic skinny fat body: stick-like limbs and a bulky torso. i looked like an insect. with those corpse-bride eyes to boot. and then i gave up for quite a while, mainly due to depression. and last year i got back into it, upped my protein intake, bought weights, all of that. i gained *some* muscle in my arms, but not much. can't say anything happened for my lower body despite focusing on that area more. i could not lean out without significant calorie restriction + cardio, but then all the muscle went right along with the fat. eating more meant getting fatter still, plus feeling fatigued all the time from the food. eating less meant no progress with my workouts. my body was fighting me at every step. and yes, while i did very gradually gain some strength, i plateaued quickly and couldn't progress. i had some stamina once i got over that initial period of discomfort after being sedentary for so long. however, outside of those workouts i was weak! i didn't have any energy, no explosiveness (if i had to move in a hurry), i was slow, dragged myself through my days, couldn't even raise myself from a squat without using my arms for support. despite being able to do squats with (some) added weight when exercising.  &gt;one thing i have noticed in the various vegan videos, maybe you have too, is the faces just seem somewhat dead and lifeless?  yep! had it myself too! the 'vegan face' or the 'auschwitz face' or the 'starving african child face.' over time you lose all the fat under your eyelids, so your eyes look round and sunken, like bug's eyes. often you get the heavy eyelids too, or keep them far too open like a deer in headlights. the gaze is also strange, it's called [the thousand-yard stare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thousand-yard_stare). your cheeks get bony, your neck gets thin, skin thins out, loses it's colour, elasticity, your lips look pale and dry, gums recede ... it's a very distinct look. they also get spacey, and very new age spiritual. as if on some level they're trying to make peace with the fact they're dying, in an attempt to detach from their body. there are several channels that basically point these things out in long-term vegans. [this one shocked me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3pe5m34u_g) well, they're all shocking, especially with people i used to watch in uni (who looked fit and healthy back then), and seeing how they literally deteriorated in a short few years.

102093,"also from vermont! since water has a much higher specific heat than air or rock/earth, large bodies of water like lakes or oceans moderate the temperature of surrounding areas, making it cooler in the summer (since the cooler water absorbs a lot of the heat from the air) and warmer in the winter (warmer water gives off lots of heat into the air).  so generally the air temperature is colder inland in the winters.  however, it's also windier on the coast, and more damp... both of which make it feel colder than dry, still air.  check out the climactic data for each:   -- [maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maine#climate)  -- [vermont (burlington intl. airport)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate_of_new_england#northern)  avg. high in july in portland, me is 78Âºf.  avg. high in july in burlington, vt is 80.9Âºf.  avg. high in jan in portland is 31Âºf.  avg. high in jan in burlington is 27.1Âºf  of course, burlington is also on lake champlain, but it's affect is far less than the atlantic.",0,,

243565,"&gt; &gt;     second, both the ak and the ar series lock up in the &gt; &gt; barrel/trunnion. and how does the ar-15 rifle ""avoid a clean &gt; &gt; transfer of torque"" while the ak doesn't? they are both just as &gt; &gt; locked up when the cartridge goes off. there is no ""de-torquer"" in &gt; &gt; an ar that i know of. is there one? am i missing something? it seems &gt; &gt; to me that a heavier ak would deal with torque better than a lighter &gt; &gt; ar. or is it that the .223 and the .308 impart less torque than the &gt; &gt; 7.62x39? &gt;  &gt; this, i admit, is pure speculation. the whole bolt/barrel/trunnion &gt; relationship is, for the most part, identical between the two rifles &gt; (yes, i know the ar rifles use a barrel extension instead of a &gt; hard-mounted trunnion which bears on the receiver, but this is &gt; arguing semantics). what is different is the relationship between &gt; the locking lugs on these rifles. this is where i started to &gt; speculate (admittedly, probably not very well). the fact of the &gt; matter is, thick-walled aluminum forgings are much stiffer materials &gt; for a base platform, which reduces the amount of flexing from shot &gt; to shot, but guarantees receiver failure at some point (show me a &gt; 20,000 round receiver, ar folks - it doesn't exist). the .223 &gt; cartridge obviously imparts less torque than the 7.62x39, and this &gt; probably helps the accuracy potential. i have heard that the &gt; 5.45x39.5 ak74 rifles do display slightly better accuracy than their &gt; 7.62 counterparts, and this may be part of the reason why. the .308 &gt; cartridge out-torques 'em both (higher velocities with the same &gt; basic projectile weight and longer barrels for slightly greater &gt; dwell time = more torque). i have trouble with the whole torque argument, and here's why: i can't  twist the ak stock. i can't see any twisting going on in that video  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6bpi3xd6h0&amp;feature=related). i can  see the ak barrel flopping around, but i think that's because the barrel  is too light. (early ars had the same problem)  the .308, .50 cal, etc are much heavier rounds and, i think, impart much more  torque. yet they are still very accurate rounds. .308 bolt action  rifles can weigh significantly less and still preform better accuracy-wise.  for years, very accurate rifles were made with long wooden stocks that  were much less rigid than the stocks are now.  any problems can easily be dealt with by using a bull-barrel or a stiffer  receiver. i just don't see it an an inherent limitation of the ak.  &gt; &gt;     look, i'm not saying that the ak is the best, most accurate &gt; &gt; rifle ever. i am saying that i think the ak would do about as well &gt; &gt; as an ar if the same effort and attention were put into it.  &gt; &gt; i respectfully disagree. many top-notch designers have turned their &gt; &gt; magnifying glass at the ak platform, with the result being 2 moa &gt; &gt; rifles. galil sniper rifles (which cheat by using milled receivers) &gt; &gt; are a prime example. this is decent accuracy for a battle rifle, but &gt; &gt; miserable performance for a so-called sniper rifle. to extract moa &gt; &gt; accuracy out of the design requires changing it so much that it flat &gt; &gt; does not resemble an ak in any way, shape, or form. the 1.5 moa sig &gt; &gt; 556 (which cheats by using using a stiffer, load bearing recevier &gt; &gt; cover to acheive ""boxing"" of the lower receiver) is a prime example &gt; &gt; of this. no layperson on earth would peg sig's rifle as having its &gt; &gt; roots in the kalashnikov, but it is, at its root, an ak47. well, i don't know anything about the sig 556, but a load bearing  cover seems like a reasonable modification to me. i think that is  one of the things that could be done to improve the ak, along with a  milled receiver, bull barrel, better trigger, etc... except for the  milled receiver, people make those changes all the time to ars. the  only reason people don't use after-market milled receivers is because  the ar comes with one.  from what i hear sig make a good gun, and they get 1.5 moa out of their  ak ""clones"". that seems to prove my point, that the ak platform is  limited by poor manufacturing and maintenance, and lack of quality  components, not any inherent ""lack of capability"". a well-tuned ar is  about 1 moa, so say i'm off by about 0.5 moa. i'm not trying to say  the ak is better, or identical, just that it's about the same. my guess  is that a 1 moa rifle and a 1.5 moa rifle will produce almost exactly  the same results in 95% or more of the shooters out there.  &gt; &gt; if your saiga is capable of better than 4-8 moa, post a video of a &gt; &gt; 5-shot group being fired at 100 yards and target retrieval complete &gt; &gt; with ruler, in one shot with no editing (no, i am not accusing you &gt; &gt; of dishonesty, i just think that videos like this should be &gt; &gt; available on youtube for others to judge for themselves, separate &gt; &gt; from this forum). these types of videos cannot be found online &gt; &gt; because most people are very embarrassed by the poor results. even &gt; &gt; so-called ""big name"" gun writers (guys like peter kokalis and masaad &gt; &gt; ayoob) won't take a challenge like this. they'll just take a picture &gt; &gt; of some random 50 yard target and call it good! (that's really not &gt; &gt; fair to kokalis, he has enough dignity to admit the rifles just &gt; &gt; aren't capable of decent accuracy, regardless of who is paying for &gt; &gt; his articles). i agree, you can shoot all day and get a few good targets, just by  statistics. it doesn't mean there's a good rifle or a good rifleman  at the other end. with my saiga, with a scope, i can hit poker-chip  size targets all day long at 100 yards. (i don't use actual poker  chips, but daisy air-gun targets from walmart because they are  biodegradable, and also slightly larger than a poker chip).  but i doubt i'll get any you tube videos out soon... i don't  have a video camera for one thing. for another, i'm just not  into shooting at targets at outdoor ranges. i much prefer  shotgun clays or daisy targets.) there is one indoor range  around here that lets you shoot rifles, but its maybe 40  yards deep -- not too much of a point shooting anything other  than a .22.",0,,

358076,"cenn is described as ""gnarled and dark as an old root,"" and i would argue that the addition of ""gnarled"" actually changes the context of the sentence. to immediately assume that he has dark skin (especially considering the age of a root doesn't necessarily impact its coloration) is stretching more than assuming that egwene looks more like an aiel than she doesn't based on the fact that the cairhienin (who have fought a war against the aiel in recent memory, and before then were one of the only few people the aiel would allow into the waste, meaning they would actually be better acquainted than the average randlander) think she's aiel when she walks around in aiel clothing. you could argue that that's a minor element that really doesn't need to occur in the show, and sure, that's fine, but josha and madeleine look completely different.  obviously no one here knows the full list of people brought in to audition for roles in the show, but i would be curious to see the general makeup of the average actor brought in for each role, as well as the discussion that took place when finalizing actual casting, especially given that elaida's ""hey roll up your sleeves you don't look like you came from the two rivers"" now makes basically no sense, given barney's complexion compared to the others.  this may or may not be fair, but, given everything else we've seen from rafe, it's safe to say he's a progressive leftist and that his personal politics will play at least some role in the show (like alluding to rand not being the only one getting any in his love square, which, if it's avi and elayne [which is the most likely], kind of adds a quasi-incestuous undertone to their becoming first sisters that i really don't want [they might just cut that whole thing altogether, assuming the show makes it that far, but cutting a deep friendship like that to get some titillation seems very cheap and, frankly, boring]). again, i would mind a lot less if he (and others here and elsewhere) would come right out and say ""yes, we made these decisions because of our personal politics,"" instead of ""the fuck why would you assume that robert jordan's personal fan-casting would be more accurate than my headcanon, you fucking racist?""  tbh re: michael mcelhatton, i've never noticed his eye color (it doesn't help that the casting photo they have of him is in black and white, at least on dragonmount), but seeing as how you never asked (and probably don't care), here are my thoughts on the cast:  moiraine: too tall, which eliminates a central character trait. if they're actually for real doing nothing to show aes sedai as ageless (which is fucking insane), then she's about the right age, but like, come on. and i don't know exactly why, but i don't like rosamund (it's probably because gone girl is the first, and possibly only, thing i've seen her in, and she did an excellent job of making me hate her character)  rand: i dunno he has too square a head an his eyes are too far apart. also this probably sounds weird but i'm mildly concerned that he might be too fit to play rand, based solely on google's image results, but whatever  egwene: i'm going to be overly harsh and state that i don't find madeleine attractive in the slightest. aside from blah blah blah race, she's slightly taller than eggy, but whatever. i haven't seen her in anything, so who knows if she's good  mat: i've never seen barney in anything but based solely on the few pictures i've seen he looks like a megadouche. i've always pictured mat as having a fox-like face (dunno how best to describe it), so his ""i'm a soft boy with big pouty lips and a chin dimple"" really doesn't fit at all  nynaeve: dragonmount's picture is actually pretty terrible, because she's fucking gorgeous. i've never seen her in anything, so who knows if she can pull off ""i fucking hate everyone but if you fuck with them i'll hunt you down to shayol ghul itself""  perrin: everyone's biggest concern with marcus was if he was going to be ripped and shred'd like perrin is supposed to be, and the leaks i've seen have made him look...wide &lt;_&lt; like he's fat. it's definitely the clothes (which is another thing that kind of bugs me, because the clothes seemed to be at least somewhat ill-fitting, which doesn't really make sense to me, as someone living in a rural and secluded area would have their clothes made personally for them, so they would likely fit better than ""this is literally just an empty sack that i've cut extra holes in for your head and one arm,"" although obviously not as well as moiraine's should. and his hair is too tightly curled to have perrin's shaggy, loose curls smh give him a wig  lan: too pretty. nynaeve isn't birgitte in terms of ""i love ugly,"" but lan always seemed like more of an ""i'm rugged moreso than ruggedly handsome,"" with like scars and shit i dunno. tbh i think alexandre willaume looks a lot more like i would have pictured lan than thom. given that his biggest role has been on criminal minds...ehhhhhhhhh. it sucks for him that i'm going into this thinking he's going to be shit because he was on a shit show. sorry, dude  tam: not thicc enough. rj makes a point consistently about tam being stout (not fat), and michael is...not. he was good as roose bolton, but then he also looked nothing like roose bolton was ever described...  fain: haven't seen the dude in anything, but he doesn't look crazy enough in any pictures (not really that fair of a point, though). and the guy they cast is actually taller than rand, so what the fuck is that  logain: good casting, dunno if he can act huehuehue  loial: dunno what he's going to look like because i don't think we know how much will be makeup and prosthetics and how much will be cgi  thom: like i said, he looks more like lan to me than thom. haven't seen him in anything, but he can grow a p gud beard, so hopefully they have him grow a fucking mustache. also, the guitar? dumb bullshit (it's literally more cumbersome than a flute and small harp, which i know having walked about a mile and a half with a guitar more than a few times in my life). his gleeman's coat being nondescript brown and having patches on the inside? fucking dumb. literally the entire goddamned point of a gleeman's coat is his advertising that he's a gleeman. i don't remember exactly where i saw this, so it may have turned out to be false or like a red herring, but come the fuck on if true.  alanna: they actually cast someone whose skin was too light. what a world.  i'll save you some time right now (and none for myself) and state that i've seen none of the rest of the actors in anything ever  ihvon: dude looks okay  owein: they changed his name anyway i don't think he was described before he died  liandrin: eyes and hair are the wrong color. the actress' cheekbones fucking weird me out, man.  leane: i'm going to be overly harsh and say she's not pretty enough, but whatever she's close  ila: i dunno whatever  aram: seems a lot darker than the woman they cast to play his literal grandmother smh  peter franzen: don't remember if they confirmed his character  kerene: supposed to be beautiful but they lady they cast ain't smh. i mean she really, really isn't  the cauthons: whatever but they don't look, at least to me, like they could be barney's parents.  bran: not fat enough. they're likely dropping the whole ""don't trust a skinny innkeeper"" thing that i'm pretty sure gets dropped by tsr, but come on. bran is supposed to be a big boy and jolly like santa  cenn: tbh the guy they hired is too big. he's not like fat, but he's got some chub, and i've always seen cenn as like old and wiry, like maybe slightly malnourished.  daise: whatever she's supposed to be thick but strong, not just fat  marin: the actress they hired is legit just not attractive, which marin is supposed to be. also, eggy's parents, like mat's, don't look like they could be maddy's. she has big eyes and high cheekbones, and her show-parents just don't. i dunno.  eamon: ""hard, dark face"" sure, i guess  geofram: assuming they're keeping dain, tbh they cast a dude who is and looks too young by at least fifteen years.  grinwells: i dunno  dana: who the fuck is she going to be  basel: dude looks sufficiently chubbed up to be a solid innkeeper  raen: dude isn't wiry and doesn't look like he could have fathered whoever aram's parent was  min: ""min is pretty with big eyes"" huh. kae is quite pretty, but i dunno if she's slimthicc like min clearly is. also she's like in her mid-30s and in some pictures actually looks a couple years older. also also i guess if people want to they could make the argument that wherever her family was from they moved to baerlon, but it just seems strange to me that we're supposed to accept that andor as a region is so racially diverse that the cauthons, aybaras, al'veres, farshaws (again, assuming min isn't supposed to be a transplant in the last like generation) and then, presumably, trakands (still waiting on the casting) are all supposed to live within its bounds, but people would still be able to

324266,"here's a proper analogy to explain the situation. and, you'll want to note, i interpret what the guy was saying slightly different then ninguem here; i'll make a note of that when we get there.  the story of lie groups goes something like this: as physics was getting more modern people started studying the properties of entire families of rotations, etc., at once. for example, if you pick a given # of dimensions to work with (2,3, etc), you can define a group o(n) as the group of all reflections and rotations in that space; each member of o(n) is some combination of rotation (around the origin) and reflections (across some plane or whatever). you can also slice it down to be just rotations (so(n)), and there's similar-but-more-exotic groups.   because there's so many such groups -- for each family, there's one for each n&gt;0 -- with each family of groups pretty-similar-to-the-others but still slightly-different as well, it made sense to find some abstract thing that captured the essential properties of all these various things; that makes life easier*.   it turns out that there are a set of axioms that do capture the essential properties of the major families -- o(n), so(n), and friends -- and so they get grouped together as so-called lie groups (pronounced: lee, after the discoverer/inventor). any result that gets proven about abstract lie groups gets proven for all lie groups, so it's a big win for efficiency.  what does the study of lie groups look like? well, right off the bat it turns out there's ways to make bigger lie groups out of smaller lie groups. when you have large objects that can be made out of smaller ones, a mathematician's first instinct is: when are decompositions of larger things into smaller things unique, how do the properties of smaller things feed into the properties of teh combined object, and, most importantly, are there ""smallest"" (or atomic, or basic, etc.) objects, so that we can stop decomposing things after a point?   and with lie groups the answer to the last question is basically ""yes, there are ""smallest"" groups"" for a certain measure of small.  at one point a largish initiative in math was characterizing the ""smallest"" lie groups; it was discovered that the following situation held: * there are a few infinite families of ""atomic"" lie groups, basically in each family there's one for each n (these are, more-or-less, like the o(n) above). these guys can be made as ""big"" as you want, but in a kind of trivial way (going from o(5) to o(10) makes the group a lot bigger but doesn't radically change most of its properties) * there's a finite set of so-called exceptional lie groups. it's proven that they are the only ""atomic"" lie groups aside from the infinite families mentioned above**.  of the exceptional lie groups, e8 is the biggest. you can always make bigger lie groups (e8 x e8, for example, is bigger, it's just not ""atomic""), but the following are true: * there aren't any reasonable axiom sets for lie groups that include all the motivating examples while also ruling out the exceptional ones * if you make the axioms for lie groups more ""permissive"" then a lot more groups are allowed in (ie, teh exceptional groups aren't the only exceptional ""lie"" groups if you do that), but loosening the axioms _at all_ lets in things that don't fit the feel of the original motivation for lie groups (which, originally, was to model certain physical things).  thus i think what the commenter was trying to say is that: e8 is the biggest ""atomic"" lie group, and you can't get a bigger ""atomic"" lie group without cheapening the axioms to let through a lot more things outside the original definition of lie groups (all of the original examples of which were originally motivated as ways of modelling observed physical symmetries).  it's very remarkable that there's a finite list of exceptional groups, and the exceptional groups themselves are all amazingly bizarre compared to the ""mainstream"" lie groups. i can't actually think of a great example to how bizarre it is: it'd be like writing down axioms to capture the notion of ""animal"", realizing your axioms also included fire, airplanes, the mekong river, suspension bridges, and provably nothing else, and also realizing that the axioms you'd picked were the only reasonable axioms defining ""animal"" (anything broader is too broad, anything narrower misses known animals). still not a great analogy, so that's what it's like.  * it makes life easier in that you can work at a higher level of abstraction and prove things for bigger collections of objects at the same time; it's the difference between writing ""wash all the windshields"" and writing specific washcloth-moving-directions for each car's windshield in my car cleaning facility.   ** one version of the proof can be sketched like this: there's kinds of diagrams used for classifying lie groups, robust enough that some proofs of properties of the diagrams &lt;=&gt; some proofs of properties of the groups; you can show that if a diagram is valid it's either representing something out of the infinite families or one of the exceptional ones, so there you are...not amazingly intuitive, that's why it's a bit of a mystery).",0,,

527589,"inhale.  take in as much air as you can.  this story should last about as long as you can hold your breath, and then just a little bit longer. so listen as fast as you can.  a friend of mine, when he was thirteen years old he heard about ""pegging."" this is when a guy gets banged up the butt with a dildo. stimulate the prostate gland hard enough, and the rumor is you can have explosive hands-free orgasms. at that age, this friend's a little sex maniac. he's always jonesing for a better way to get his rocks off. he goes out to buy a carrot and some petroleum jelly. to conduct a little private research. then he pictures how it's going to look at the supermarket checkstand, the lonely carrot and petroleum jelly rolling down the conveyer belt toward the grocery store cashier. all the shoppers waiting in line, watching. everyone seeing the big evening he has planned.  so, my friend, he buys milk and eggs and sugar and a carrot, all the ingredients for a carrot cake. and vaseline.  like he's going home to stick a carrot cake up his butt.  at home, he whittles the carrot into a blunt tool. he slathers it with grease and grinds his ass down on it. then, nothing. no orgasm. nothing happens except it hurts.   then, this kid, his mom yells it's suppertime. she says to come down, right now.  he works the carrot out and stashes the slippery, filthy thing in the dirty clothes under his bed.  after dinner, he goes to find the carrot and it's gone. all his dirty clothes, while he ate dinner, his mom grabbed them all to do laundry. no way could she not find the carrot, carefully shaped with a paring knife from her kitchen, still shiny with lube and stinky.  this friend of mine, he waits months under a black cloud, waiting for his folks to confront him. and they never do. ever. even now he's grown up, that invisible carrot hangs over every christmas dinner, every birthday party. every easter egg hunt with his kids, his parents' grandkids, that ghost carrot is hovering over all of them.  that something too awful to name.  people in france have a phrase: ""spirit of the stairway."" in french: esprit de l'escalier. it means that moment when you find the answer, but it's too late. say you're at a party and someone insults you. you have to say something. so under pressure, with everybody watching, you say something lame. but the moment you leave the partyâ€¦  as you start down the stairway, then -- magic. you come up with the perfect thing you should've said. the perfect crippling put-down.  that's the spirit of the stairway.  the trouble is even the french don't have a phrase for the stupid things you actually do say under pressure. those stupid, desperate things you actually think or do.  some deeds are too low to even get a name. too low to even get talked about.  looking back, kid-psych experts, school counselors now say that most of the last peak in teen suicide was kids trying to choke while they beat off. their folks would find them, a towel twisted around the kid's neck, the towel tied to the rod in their bedroom closet, the kid dead. dead sperm everywhere. of course the folks cleaned up. they put some pants on their kid. they made it lookâ€¦ better. intentional at least. the regular kind of sad, teen suicide.  another friend of mine, a kid from school, his older brother in the navy said how guys in the middle east jack off different than we do here. this brother was stationed in some camel country where the public market sells what could be fancy letter openers. each fancy tool is just a thin rod of polished brass or silver, maybe as long as your hand, with a big tip at one end, either a big metal ball or the kind of fancy carved handle you'd see on a sword. this navy brother says how arab guys get their dick hard and then insert this metal rod inside the whole length of their boner. they jack off with the rod inside, and it makes getting off so much better. more intense.  it's this big brother who travels around the world, sending back french phrases. russian phrases. helpful jack-off tips.  after this, the little brother, one day he doesn't show up at school. that night, he calls to ask if i'll pick up his homework for the next couple weeks. because he's in the hospital.  he's got to share a room with old people getting their guts worked on. he says how they all have to share the same television. all he's got for privacy is a curtain. his folks don't come and visit. on the phone, he says how right now his folks could just kill his big brother in the navy.  on the phone, the kid says how -- the day before -- he was just a little stoned. at home in his bedroom, he was flopped on the bed. he was lighting a candle and flipping through some old porno magazines, getting ready to beat off. this is after he's heard from his navy brother. that helpful hint about how arabs beat off. the kid looks around for something that might do the job. a ball-point pen's too big. a pencil's too big and rough. but dripped down the side of the candle, there's a thin, smooth ridge of wax that just might work. with just the tip of one finger, this kid snaps the long ridge of wax off the candle. he rolls it smooth between the palms of his hands. long and smooth and thin.  stoned and horny, he slips it down inside, deeper and deeper into the piss slit of his boner. with a good hank of the wax still poking out the top, he gets to work.  even now, he says those arab guys are pretty damn smart. they've totally re-invented jacking off. flat on his back in bed, things are getting so good, this kid can't keep track of the wax. he's one good squeeze from shooting his wad when the wax isn't sticking out anymore.  the thin wax rod, it's slipped inside. all the way inside. so deep inside he can't even feel the lump of it inside his piss tube.  from downstairs, his mom shouts it's suppertime. she says to come down, right now. this wax kid and the carrot kid are different people, but we all live pretty much the same life.  it's after dinner when the kid's guts start to hurt. it's wax so he figured it would just melt inside him and he'd pee it out. now his back hurts. his kidneys. he can't stand straight.  this kid talking on the phone from his hospital bed, in the background you can hear bells ding, people screaming. game shows.  the x-rays show the truth, something long and thin, bent double inside his bladder. this long, thin v inside him, it's collecting all the minerals in his piss. it's getting bigger and more rough, coated with crystals of calcium, it's bumping around, ripping up the soft lining of his bladder, blocking his piss from getting out. his kidneys are backed up. what little that leaks out his dick is red with blood.  this kid and his folks, his whole family, them looking at the black x-ray with the doctor and the nurses standing there, the big v of wax glowing white for everybody to see, he has to tell the truth. the way arabs get off. what his big brother wrote him from the navy.  on the phone, right now, he starts to cry.  they paid for the bladder operation with his college fund. one stupid mistake, and now he'll never be a lawyer.  sticking stuff inside yourself. sticking yourself inside stuff. a candle in your dick or your head in a noose, we knew it was going to be big trouble.  what got me in trouble, i called it pearl diving. this meant whacking off underwater, sitting on the bottom at the deep end of my parents' swimming pool. with one deep breath, i'd kick my way to the bottom and slip off my swim trucks. i'd sit down there for two, three, four minutes.  just from jacking off, i had huge lung capacity. if i had the house to myself, i'd do this all afternoon. after i'd finally pump out my stuff, my sperm, it would hang there in big, fat, milky gobs.  after that was more diving, to catch it all. to collect it and wipe each handful in a towel. that's why it was called pearl diving. even with chlorine, there was my sister to worry about. or, christ almighty, my mom.  that used to be my worst fear in the world: my teenage virgin sister, thinking she's just getting fat, then giving birth to a two-headed retard baby. both heads looking just like me. me, the father and the uncle.  in the end, it's never what you worry about that gets you.  the best part of pearl diving was the inlet port for the swimming pool filter and the circulation pump. the best part was getting naked and sitting on it.  as the french would say: who doesn't like getting their butt sucked?  still, one minute you're just a kid getting off, and the next minute you'll never be a lawyer.  one minute, i'm settling on the pool bottom, and the sky is wavy, light blue through eight feet of water above my head. the world is silent except for the heartbeat in my ears. my yellow-striped swim trunks are looped around my neck for safe keeping, just in case a friend, a neighbor, anybody shows up to ask why i skipped football practice. the steady suck of the pool inlet hole is lapping at me and i'm grinding my skinny white ass around on that feeling.  one minute, i've got enough air, and my dick's in my hand. my folks are gone at their work and my sister's got ballet. nobody's supposed to be home for hours.  my hand brings me right to getting off, and i stop. i swim up to catch another big breath. i dive down and settle on the bottom.  i do this again and again.  this must be why girls want to sit on your face. the suction is like taking a dump that never ends. my dick hard and getting my butt eaten out, i do not need air. my heartbeat in my ears, i stay under until bright stars of light start worming around in my eyes. my legs straight out, the back of each knee rubbed raw against the concrete bottom. my toes are turning blue, my toes and fingers wrinkled from being so long in the water.  and then i let it happen. the big white gobs start spouting. the pearls.  it's then i need some air. but when i go to kick off against the bottom, i can't. i can't get my feet under me. my ass is stuck.  emergency paramedics will tell you that every year about 150 people get stuck this way, sucked by a circulation pump. get your long hair caught, or your ass, and you're going to drown. every year, tons of people do. most of them in florida.  people just don't talk about it. not even french people talk about everything.  getting one knee up, getting one foot tucked under me, i get to half standing when i feel the tug against my butt. getting my other foot under me, i kick off against the bottom. i'm kicking free, not touching the concrete, but not getting to the air, either.  still kicking water, thrashing with both arms, i'm maybe halfway to the surface but not going higher. the heartbeat inside my head getting loud and fast.  the bright sparks of light crossing and criss-crossing my eyes, i turn and look backâ€¦ but it doesn't make sense. this thick rope, some kind of snake, blue-white and braided with veins has come up out of the pool drain and it's holding onto my butt. some of the veins are leaking blood, red blood that looks black underwater and drifts away from little rips in the pale skin of the snake. the blood trails away, disappearing in the water, and inside the snake's thin, blue-white skin you can see lumps of some half-digested meal.  that's the only way this makes sense. some horrible sea monster, a sea serpent, something that's never seen the light of day, it's been hiding in the dark bottom of the pool drain, waiting to eat me.  soâ€¦ i kick at it, at the slippery, rubbery knotted skin and veins of it, and more of it seems to pull out of the pool drain. it's maybe as long as my leg now, but still holding tight around my butthole. with another kick, i'm an inch closer to getting another breath. still feeling the snake tug at my ass, i'm an inch closer to my escape.  knotted inside the snake, you can see corn and peanuts. you can see a long bright-orange ball. it's the kind of horse-pill vitamin my dad makes me take, to help put on weight. to get a football scholarship. with extra iron and omega-three fatty acids.  it's seeing that vitamin pill that saves my life.  it's not a snake. it's my large intestine, my colon pulled out of me. what doctors call, prolapsed. it's my guts sucked into the drain.  paramedics will tell you a swimming pool pump pulls 80 gallons of water every minute. that's about 400 pounds of pressure. the big problem is we're all connected together inside. your ass is just the far end of your mouth. if i let go, the pump keeps working - unraveling my insides -- until it's got my tongue. imagine taking a 400-pound shit, and you can see how this might turn you inside out.  what i can tell you is your guts don't feel much pain. not the way your skin feels pain. the stuff you're digesting, doctor's call it fecal matter. higher up is chyme, pockets of a thin runny mess studded with corn and peanuts and round green peas.  that's all this soup of blood and corn, shit and sperm and peanuts floating around me. even with my guts unraveling out my ass, me holding onto what's left, even then my first want is to somehow get my swimsuit back on.  god forbid my folks see my dick.  my one hand holding a fist around my ass, my other hand snags my yellow-striped swim trunks and pulls them from around my neck. still, getting into them is impossible.  you want to feel your intestines, go buy a pack of those lamb-skin condoms. take one out and unroll it. pack it with peanut butter. smear it with petroleum jelly and hold it under water. then, try to tear it. try to pull it in half. it's too tough and rubbery. it's so slimy you can't hold on.  a lamb-skin condom, that's just plain old intestine.  you can see what i'm up against.  you let go for a second, and you're gutted.  you swim for the surface, for a breath, and you're gutted.  you don't swim, and you drown.  it's a choice between being dead right now or a minute from right now.  what my folks will find after work is a big naked fetus, curled in on itself. floating in the cloudy water of their backyard pool. tethered to the bottom by a thick rope of veins and twisted guts. the opposite of a kid hanging himself to death while he jacks off. this is the baby they brought home from the hospital thirteen years ago. here's the kid they hoped would snag a football scholarship and get an mba. who'd care for them in their old age. here's all their hopes and dreams. floating here, naked and dead. all around him, big milky pearls of wasted sperm.  either that or my folks will find me wrapped in a bloody towel, collapsed halfway from the pool to the kitchen telephone, the ragged, torn scrap of my guts still hanging out the leg of my yellow-striped swim trunks.  what even the french won't talk about.  that big brother in the navy, he taught us one other good phrase. a russian phrase. the way we say: ""i need that like i need a hole in my headâ€¦"" russian people say: ""i need that like i need teeth in my assholeâ€¦""  mne eto nado kak zuby v zadnitse  those stories about how animals caught in a trap will chew off their leg, well, any coyote would tell you a couple bites beats the hell out of being dead.  hellâ€¦ even if you're russian, some day you just might want those teeth.  otherwise, what you have to do is -- you have to twist around. you hook one elbow behind your knee and pull that leg up into your face. you bite and snap at your own ass. you run out of air, and you will chew through anything to get that next breath.  it's not something you want to tell a girl on the first date. not if you expect a kiss good night.  if i told you how it tasted, you would never, ever again eat calamari.  it's hard to say what my parents were more disgusted by: how i'd got in trouble or how i'd saved myself. after the hospital, my mom said, ""you didn't know what you were doing, honey. you were in shock."" and she learned how to cook poached eggs.  all those people grossed out or feeling sorry for meâ€¦  i need that like i need teeth in my asshole.  nowadays, people always tell me i look too skinny. people at dinner parties get all quiet and pissed off when i don't eat the pot roast they cooked. pot roast kills me. baked ham. anything that hangs around inside my guts for longer than a couple hours, it comes out still food. home-cooked lima beans or chunk light tuna fish, i'll stand up and find it still sitting there in the toilet.  after you have a radical bowel resectioning, you don't digest meat so great. most people, you have five feet of large intestine. i'm lucky to have my six inches. so i never got a football scholarship. never got an mba. both my friends, the wax kid and the carrot kid, they grew up, got big, but i've never weighed a pound more than i did that day when i was thirteen.  another big problem was my folks paid a lot of good money for that swimming pool. in the end my dad just told the pool guy it was a dog. the family dog fell in and drowned. the dead body got pulled into the pump. even when the pool guy cracked open the filter casing and fished out a rubbery tube, a watery hank of intestine with a big orange vitamin pill still inside, even then, my dad just said, ""that dog was fucking nuts.""  even from my upstairs bedroom window, you could hear my dad say, ""we couldn't trust that dog alone for a secondâ€¦""  then my sister missed her period.   even after they changed the pool water, after they sold the house and we moved to another state, after my sister's abortion, even then my folks never mentioned it again.  ever.  that is our invisible carrot.  you. now you can take a good, deep breath.  i still have not.  end   (edit: this is a copypasta titled ""guts."" didn't put this because i didn't think so many people see it.)

343032,"this might be the most non-medical answer you get. basically, it boils down to the fact that you never get exactly the same cold every year. firstly, we're talking about viruses here. whenever you get sick, your body creates antibodies to fight off that virus, but during that time you feel the symptons of having a cold. your body then retains those antibodies to fight off future colds before you even know it. the same goes for chicken pox. your body still has antibodies floating around inside it that have probably killed off the chicken pox virus quite a few times without you noticing. viruses that have made you sick in the past can also still be floating around inside your body, but they are essentially ""inactive."" the big difference is that the number of viruses that cause symptons of the ""common cold"" are more numerous. or rather, the virus(es) responsible for the ""common cold"" can replicate and mutate fast enough in the wild for your body to have to fight a new version of it every time you encounter it, where as the chicken pox virus doesn't behave in the same way, which is also why there is an effective vaccine against chicken pox but not the ""common cold.""",0,,
762695,"i don't understand how people can be happy with being that heavy, and resign themselves to doing nothing about it.  when i got fat from having shitty eating habits, i was never in denial that my shitty eating habits were responsible. at 6' tall, my heaviest weight was over 220 lbs., which is just barely into the obese bmi range. i could look in the mirror and see how grotesque i was, and meanwhile, most of the people i know were telling me i was fine. some even told me i was *thin* - unsurprisingly, those were mostly the people so large i did look thin, in comparison to their bulk.  ironically, one of the biggest factors that motivated me to lose weight was the drama surrounding fph. people who have resigned themselves to failure look at a community like that and see it as nothing but a collection of toxic bullies desperate to inflict emotional damage upon others. you know what i saw in it? i saw a group of people so marginalized by the echo chamber of personal responsibility avoidance that they had no choice but to create a place where they could share their frustrations with the decline of health literacy.  and it gave me motivation, because it said things that other people are too afraid to say: that being overweight *is* unattractive, that it *is* unhealthy, and most importantly of all, that it *is* within our power to change - *and the change isn't even difficult.* i downloaded myfitnesspal and started tracking my food intake. i set my daily calorie budget according to what the app conveniently calculated for me to achieve a 1-lb. per week loss. are there days where i go over and slow my progress? sure there are. but that's no reason to give up. do i have to ""starve myself"" or completely eliminate treats? no, not at all! it's as easy as managing portions. say no to the extra piece of toast. reduce the quantities of simple carbs in meals and increase vegetables proportionally. opt for grilled instead of fried. use a little less dressing - it's a salad, not a soup. have dessert sometimes, not with every single meal, and in a reasonable portion. *it's not at all difficult to stick to a reduced calorie budget if you do all this.*  many of the people in the echo chamber would have you believe that monitoring one's eating habits to this extent (which is really ridiculous in the first place, because it's not at all a chore) is an ""unhealthy relationship with food"" or that it's a gateway to anorexia or some other such bullshit. to which i counter that, no, the real unhealthy relationship with food is eating whatever you want, whenever you want, in whatever quantity you want, with no consideration given to the adverse effects it will have on your body. we only get one body, and the way to show that we love it is to take care of it, not to abuse it by filling it with shitty fuel. and that's what food is: fuel.  anyway, i've lost over 30 lbs. and i have probably another 10-15 to go. my waist size has dropped from 38 to around 34. i discovered that i have cheekbones and that my face is a lot more handsome when its shape is not obscured by a second chin and soft, pudgy cheeks. i look better, i feel better, it's easier to walk and run - it's almost as if i have springs in my feet, compared to how it was before. it's even easier to pedal my bike. all of these positive changes are happening in my life because i decided to eat a little bit less. that's all it took. that's all it takes for anyone, and the only difference for people with bad thyroids and other weight-management disorders is that they have to watch a little more closely than other folks.  this business of people eating themselves into an early grave, limiting their own mobility and endurance, causing innumerable health complications from infertility to stroke to heart disease to type 2 diabetes to back and joint problems to elevated cancer risk and so on, while simultaneously demanding that people not voice disapproval of their poor choices, is ludicrous. and it's very frustrating for me as a canadian, since the elevated healthcare expenses these problems incur not only contributes directly to increases in my taxes, it also overloads the hospitals, affecting the availability of care that i hope i will never need in an emergency situation.  it took me until 225 lbs., as a six-foot-tall man, to finally get fed up with myself and decide to make a major change. at that weight, i was already feeling the effects of my obesity, and that's downright tiny compared to the size some people are allowing themselves to reach. i don't understand how they can go about their day-to-day lives without realizing that something needs to change. not because of ""society's beauty standards"", not because of the way they look, but because of the way that being so heavy *feels*. your body is basically screaming at you to save it from itself, and you're going to ignore those aches and pains? the burning in your lungs from going up one flight of stairs? the constant windedness? i don't even know.  now at ~186, down from an all-time peak of probably more than 230, and i won't be happy until i'm below 180 and lean. not because society told me i should be - because biology tells me i should be, and i only get one body, so it deserves to be taken care of and kept in good condition.",1,-2,2

157008,"i doubt it. i think it is in certain interests to try to paint the picture you describe, but it's not going to happen, and it's not really happening to any significant extent, other than via well organized media circuses that try to make things appear larger than they really are.  fascism does require the external enemy, but muslims don't cut it; the ones that have integrated into western society are far too well educated, though they lack the collective bargaining power that other ethnic groups have established for themselves. the muslim stigmatization doesn't really work here, won't work in europe where the majority are more sophisticated than the average american.  fascism would like to think it's on the rise or that it is inevitable, but frankly its not. when you have a world visible beta cycle with the disastrous results that team bush/cheney continues to reap, then you start to wonder why the backers of these movements think they can one-off it in their locality to make it succeed. modern fascism is a failed startup model, and the us is the proof.   i would encourage wealthy backers to support such enterprises so i can position myself to take advantage of the inherent inabilities within the platform, much as china has done over the last 6 years vis-a-vis the us, except on a much smaller scale - i will ride them all the way down.  my real-politic two cents.  i personally think the biggest problem worldwide is the rise of china to global dominance. they have yet to assert their authority, but when they do they have a long history of both winning and making western fascism look like sesame street. i don't think the western world has really come to under stand what it means for the dragon to wake up again, yet.   the idea of putting the muslim as the man in the middle to rally the west is a poor one. a much smarter strategy would be to befriend the ""muslim"" and get him to go bother china, as he has historically done. by approaching it the other way around we are basically making the same mistake as every other people group that has approached china externally, which leads to the fatal chinization of the external group.  ideally it would be nice to reform the west into a true collective democracy and then absorb the rest of the world into that, but somehow western elites are never able to think in terms beyond the personal family/tribe and its immediately succeeding generational. look at the executive suites and boardrooms throughout the us for examples of this, and of course the white house which is the poster child of everything these groups value.  they continue to refuse to use the one resource that they possess which china does not, the overwhelming number of minds within the largely educated populous. rather the west spends an inordinate amount of time preventing its people from learning and keeping them isolated from each other- something china will not do as they stretch their muscles and look around.  france is in the unique position of being able to move to the next stage without putting itself in hock, as the us has done. sarkozy is an invitation to re-create the bush/cheney disasters in a more french fashion, while royal not being an ideal candidate will at least attempt a technocratic solution, which could open the field to a more realistic political solution. i hope france does not make the mistake that we have.",0,,

360076,"ellie hummed slightly, with effort, as she started to massage her plump breasts. just enough to overflow her hands, they were more than enough for her to be considered busty, but she felt like she needed to do a little bit extra today. being the daughter of the goddess of motherhood had its perks, but she had thus far resisted the urge to have the same outrageous proportions as her sisters. desperate times called for desperate measures though, and her scrawny boyfriend, tiberius, definitely needed the help. ellie's breasts started to swell in her hands, and as the rush of pleasure that came with the growth washed through her, she bit her lip and started to regret not having tapped into her powers sooner.  ellie groped and massaged her swelling tits, her skin flushing and her breath quickening as she got more and more aroused with each inch that they grew. they swelled to the size of grapefruits, and then to the size of small melons, dominating her chest and fighting for space, overflowing her hands generously and then even her arms, as she crossed her arms under her bust trying to contain it. ellie's breasts grew to nearly the size of her head, and it was all she could do to sit still, her pussy growing wetter by the moment, as her sexual desire and indeed her underlying sexual appetites themselves grew along with the power she was unleashing from within herself.  one of ellie's hands found its way down between her legs, as she lay back in her chair, willing herself to manifest more and more sexual and fertility magic, focusing on what she would need to do next. her fingers found the pearl of her womanhood, and she stroked herself as she concentrated on the next part of the process.   at least breasts, buoyant and almost immune to gravity, even with their great size and softness, started to sag slightly, they were clearly growing heavier and heavier, soon they started to balloon yet again, but this time they were growing rounder, fatter, filling up from within. blue veins were visible underneath her pale skin, as her breasts swelled fuller and fuller with nourishing milk. soon, her breasts were each round and tight, stretched taut with the bounty within, each easily large enough to hold a gallon of milk, and with the magic of the fertility that coursed through her, perhaps somehow even holding more than that. ellie's breasts wobbled with each of her breaths, and they swayed tightly on her chest, her nipples beginning to darken to a deep pink, even as they stood out erect from her chest, growing a bit longer.  with some effort, ellie stood up, obviously not used to her news center of gravity, as her breasts threatened to pull her forward. even with her long, long legs and her wide hips, her breasts were now the dominant aspect of her figure, jutting out from her chest like two round parade floats, sitting low on her rib cage and swaying and sloshing with their great milky weight. she walked to the den of the small house that she and tiberius had taken refuge in for the spring rainy season, finding him pouring over his books and scrolls.  tiberius was quite the wizard, very powerful in his own right, at least for a mortal. powerful enough that her mother wouldn't find him too unsuitable at least. aside from his scrawny frame that is. she'd been on ellie's case to do something about it, and now, with the way that her dear boyfriend kept getting himself hurt ellie finally was going to do something about itâ€¦  ""dear,"" ellie began, drawing tiberius attention to her. she noticed his eyes go wide when he saw her massively expanded bust. she shrugged, sending her great globes wobbling anew, but with a blush on her cheeks and the smile on her face reassured him. ""we'll have some things to talk about, but that is forâ€¦later. you know how you've been asking to see my mother? well, she's not really an elfâ€¦not as such, anyway""   ""ellie! you're breasts!? you're so huge! is this magic is thisâ€¦do you have your own magic?"" the questions burbled from the scholars lips, but ellie's eyes started to glow, and he found himself suddenly lost within them.   ""tiberius, my beloved, aren't you thirsty?"" she squeezed her breasts together between her arms, and they seemed to swell even bigger. her boyfriend found his gaze drawn to her cleavage, everything in the room aside from her body seeming to fade entirely from view, and her breasts themselves seeming to glow as though under a heavenly spotlight.  ""thirstyâ€¦yesâ€¦soâ€¦thirstyâ€¦"" he seemed to sigh.  ellie moved forward, taking him by the hand and leading him to the large bed that was there in the room. she lay him on his back, slightly propped up against the pillows, and she brought her stiff, aching nipple to his mouth.  he left on instantly, licking at her nipple, even as the first drop of sweet, heavenly milk started to leak. he instantly began to suck, pulling her nipple into his mouth and suckling her ardently. she moaned in uncontainable pleasure at the sensation. it was incredible to feel him drink from her, and she started to massage her own breast with one hand, urging the milk to come faster, even as he gulped it down. he drank and drank, seemingly endlessly hungry for her divine milk. she was a wash in pleasure, and she could see that his own manhood was starting to become rock hard.  gently, with her free hand, she pulled his pants back and started to stroke him, gently squeezing his shaft and running her silky, smooth palms and fingers over the length of his rod. he groaned anew, another layer of pleasure coming to the trance like experience he was in. all that he knew was the rich, intoxicating flavor of her milk as it flowed down his throat and filled his stomach, and the heavenly embrace of her hand upon his manhood, and she stroked and pleasured him.  he drank even though his belly felt full to bursting, and he kept drinking even as his stomach started to visibly grow round and heavy with her milk. his belly was growing rounder and heavier still, making him look pregnant by the time she felt one of her breasts beginning to empty and switched to the other one, shoving her other nipple into his mouth. he grew rounder and rounder, his skin even seeming to groan under the sheer volume of the feeding, as she made him drink and drink.   somehow, this only seemed to heighten his arousal, and his cock grew harder in her hand. his head was freely leaking precum, and she smeared it over the length of him, stroking faster and faster, slippery noises coming from her palm as she raced to make him climax. he gulped her milk down, and she stroked his manhood, even as his lips and tongue pleasured her nipple.  she felt an orgasm ripple through her from her breasts, and her strokes became erratic. his manhood exploded, spring come along the swollen underside of his belly, which was now fat and heavy with her milk. she stroked and stroked him even through her own ecstasy, and he pumped what seemed like a pint of seed onto the bottom of his belly, splattering it all over his her hand and his tummy. when his climax finally ebbed off, he was truly spent, and so was her milk. he fell away, unconscious, pinned to the bed by his big belly.  catching her own breath, ellie rubbed her boyfriend's round tummy, feeling a bit of pride in her handy work. she scooped up a handful of cum from his belly and tasted it herself, licking it from her hand. it was delicious, as a demigod of fertility she had always enjoyed the taste of his seed, but she could tell that her milk was already working it's magic, and his creamy, smooth cum was extra delightful tonight. she kissed her way down his belly and laughed up the cum from his smooth skin. she took his manhood into her mouth and sucked on him until he became hard again in his sleep, and then she straddled his lap, guiding him into her sex.  ellie rested her hands on his round, swollen belly as she rode him, and she stroked slow circles over the dome of milk inside him. magic flowed from her body and seemed to kick his digestion into overdrive. slowly, his belly started to smooth and shrink, becoming flat again as she worked herself against him, milking him with her womanhood even as she bounced in his lap and rubbed his rapidly shrinking belly.  visible layers of supple muscle started to knit themselves over his frame, making him look ever fitter by the moment. rather than being scrawny and undernourished, he looked like a lean, tall swimmer. indeed, his height did grow a few inches underneath his girlfriend as she worked her magic on him, and his body took on the perfected aspect of a chiseled statue, his warm, smooth flesh becoming ever more perfect underneath her. he came inside her, pumping her womb full of his seed just as the magic was completed, and she cried out as another of her own climax is washed through her. she always loved it when he came inside her, it triggered a certain pleasure linked to her nature that always gave her the strongest orgasms.  ellie collapsed forward onto him, rubbing his smooth, hairless, and now chiseled chest, her hand playing down along his flat, well-toned stomach and her eyes gazing upon the perfect clear nature of his skin, a smile crossing her lips as she drank in his peaceful, sleeping face. he was going to have a lot more questions, but she could handle those later, and as she felt her breasts, still enormous even empty, starting to fill again, she could think of all sorts of reasons to feed him her milk againâ€¦",1,1,-1

he sojourned? that's what he did? ok.   &gt;kinsley turned and answered his call with a joyous smile. the others in the room glared at eduard as though he were a solicitor who had interrupted an important conversation.  the above is redundant. so they looked at him as if he'd interrupted. why the simile if that's pretty much what he did. kind of reads like. "" i barged into the room. everyone looked at me as if i had just barged into the room"".   &gt;kinsley's account of his character and better qualities. eduard entertained fantasies of asserting himself as an enigmatic figurehead among the group, one about whom not much is known but much is inquired about, picturing scenes in which he would arrive to the theater and, by way of his mere entrance, command total silence, a silence that was at once respectful and surrendered in awe of the dashing and mysterious figure he wished he could appear as. but, woe to simple and plain eduard, the reality of his minor role within the group, failed to fit into the grand frame of his expectations.  when i read this, i wanted to punch myself in the face.   alright, so i got through about two pages, but i can't be sure really. it all felt like a dream.  i was harsh through and so i will remain. i hated this. every word of it. i forged on though, waiting to see if something would happen. nothing did. eduard ended up being a jealous sniveler, not worth my time.   now let me get to your questions:  is the story interesting: no.  relatable: no.  writing: this, to me, is an example of something that needs to be hidden somewhere far away. don't even keep this an an example of what not to do, no. tuck this away somewhere, much like if it were a smallpox blanket. consider it a blood letting. you've gotten this out of your system and you can now move onto to better things. everything here is bad. the writing is overwrought in a painful way. just tell me a story and keep it simple. jealousy is something almost all people can relate to. don't bury underneath a stinking mountain of obnoxious prose. cool it on the descriptions. ignore asides. i know they're tempting, but unless they are truly well written and witty, they slow your story down.   anyways, i don't know what else to say.   cw",0,,

894135,"##continued from parent comment *** illyrio's hands are covered with rings, and those rings are ""crusted"" with gemstones. tyrion thinks they look impossible to remove. perhaps illyrio was slimmer c. 283, but regardless, tyrion's words nod to the idea that illyrio's gem-encrusted rings remain on his hands *at all times,* right? further, they *clearly* remind us of a distinctly illyrio-esque pirateâ€”i.e. someone who looks to steal that which is not hisâ€”who is practically called a ""visitor in the night"" *a la* rhaella's ""visitor"" (illyrio-glamored-as-aerys): &gt;**the corsairs had come aboard in the darkness before the dawn,** as the meadowlark was anchored off the coast of the disputed lands. the crew had beaten them off, at the cost of twelve lives. afterward the sailors stripped the dead corsairs of boots and belts and weapons, divvied up their purses, and yanked gemstones from their ears and rings from their fingers. **one of the corpses was so fat that the ship's cook had to cut his fingers off with a meat cleaver to claim his rings.** it took three meadowlarks to roll the body into the sea. (dwd tmm)  the parallel to quentyn's nightly ""visitor"" really is on the nose: the fat-like-illyrio pirate's corpse is dumped in the sea, whileâ€¦ &gt;[illyrio] reminded tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under casterly rock. (dwd ty i)  gem-""crusted"" rings could very possibly leave scratches that look like ""clawing"", especially when the wearer is beset with a ""madness""â€”note the allusion to the *mad* king, rhaella's supposed savagerâ€”causing him to treat the woman he is fucking (euphemistically) ""vigorously""? &gt;""daenerys was half a child when she came to me, yet fairer even than my second wife, so lovely i was tempted to claim her for myself. such a fearful, furtive thing, however, i knew i should get no joy from coupling with her. instead i summoned a bedwarmer and **fucked her vigorously until the madness passed**. if truth be told, i did not think daenerys would survive for long amongst the horselords."" - illyrio (dwd ty ii)  why didn't you think dany would survive, illyrio? perhaps you know what *you*â€”surely a weaker, in some senses smaller man than the immensely strong, very tall, very large-(ahem)-handed khal drogoâ€”would have done to her, *given your experience with rhaella?*  theon's description of dagmer cleftjaw's similarly ring-laden hands is interesting: &gt;the fingers curled around the drinking horn were ***heavy* with rings, gold and silver and bronze, set with *chunks* of sapphire and garnet and *dragonglass*.** (cok th iii)  ""chunks"" don't sound smooth, and ""dragonglass"" makes us think of (a) weapons and (b) dragons with their *claws*. sure, those are dagmer's rings, not illyrio's, but it's tough to read about dagmer's rings and not immediately think of illyrio's, and this is a dramatic narrative full of rhyme and allusion.  regardless of his rings' capacity to ""claw"", there's no way illyrio's hands weren't, like dagmer's, ""*heavy* with rings"", a phrase which underscores that any blows illyrio landedâ€”including open-handed ass and thigh smacking, whether conceived out of malice or notâ€”would surely land more forcefully and produce more visible trauma than they would without said rings.  ###rings as claws while i believe some of the trauma on rhaella's thighs might have been simple bruising and will return to this idea, there are nonetheless some neat allusions to the idea that illyrio's rings were responsible for the quote-unquote ""clawing"" rhaella's maids whispered ofâ€”whatever it actually looked like.  rubies are the first gem associated with illyrio's rings, and ""ruby claws"" are a thing in our story: &gt;joff's hilt was a good deal more ornate, the arms of its crossguard done as lions' paws with **ruby claws** unsheathedâ€¦ (sos ty iv)  consider also that alayaya claws the shit out to osney kettleblack: &gt;""she fought."" unlike his brothers, osney kettleblack was clean-shaven, so **the scratches showed plainly on his bare cheeks. ""*got claws* like a shadowcat, this one.""** (cok ty xii) *** &gt;ser osney had faint scratches on his cheek where another of tyrion's whores had **clawed** him. (ffc c i)  even if we accept that yaya simply clawed osney with her nails, it's curious that this most foregrounded human clawing episode was effected by someone who surely loves jewels as much as illyrioâ€” &gt;fool of a dwarf, it is only the gold and **jewels** the whore loves. (cok ty x) *** &gt;he'd sent [alayaya] a necklace of silver and jade and a pair of matching bracelets by way of apologyâ€¦ (sos ty ii)  â€”and whose primary role in the story is otherwise to provide cover for tyrion's use of (wait for itâ€¦) *a secret egress en route to having illicit sex, as facilitated by (a disguised) varys:* &gt;""if my lord will open the wardrobe, he will find what he seeks.""  &gt;tyrion kissed her hand, and climbed inside the empty wardrobe. alayaya closed it after him. he groped for the back panel, felt it slide under his fingers, and pushed it all the way aside. the hollow space behind the walls was pitch-black, but he fumbled until he felt metal. his hand closed around the rung of a ladder. he found a lower rung with his foot, and started down. well below street level, the shaft opened onto a slanting earthen tunnel, where he found varys waiting with candle in hand. (cok ty iii)  another asoiaf rhyme?  ###black diamond two of the stones on illyrio's rings jump out as far more unusual than the rest and suggest that he was rhaella's ""beast"". first, his black diamond. rhaella was supposedly bitten and clawed, and asoiaf calls the *teeth* of the greatest beast of all (a) ""black diamonds"" and (b) ""knives"". &gt;the teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond. (got ty ii)  when we're shown a black diamond up close, it's ""jagged""â€” &gt;**jagged chunks of black diamond** studded his swordbelt, and a chain of gold and emeralds looped around his neck. (cok c iii)  â€”which sounds dangerous. but it's far more auspicious that when we see sex in the queen's bedchamber, we see ""black diamonds""â€” &gt;[taean's] nipples were two black diamonds, her sex slick and steamy. (ffc c vii)  â€”conflated with breasts that are abused, leading taena to (surely not coincidentally) say *the exact same thing jaime heard rhaella say:* &gt;cersei pinched the nipple now, pulling on it hard, twisting it between her fingers. the myrish woman gave a gasp of pain. **""you're hurting me.""** (c vii)  ###a brazen beast: tiger's eyes &amp; teeth the other gem that stands out on illyrio's rings are his tiger's eyes. this isn't the only time illyrio is associated with tigers: &gt;""those are illyrio's tiger skins,"" she objected.  &gt;""and illyrio is a friend to house targaryen."" (sos dae i)  (a *close"" ""friend"", indeed, if i'm right.) illyrio's tiger's eye rings and tiger skins at least *seem* to augur that he is a ""tiger"" per the tiger/elephant divide in volantene politics, right?  now, what *obvious* fact about real tigers does grrm somehow shoehorn into dialogue? &gt;""tigers have been known to have sharp teeth."" (dwd ty vi)  all the better to chew a woman's breasts like a beast.  and what ""is"" a tiger like illyrio, explicitly, in our story? &gt;the man wore the mask of a brazen beast, the fearsome likeness of a tiger. (dwd tdt)  not just a ""beast"" like the one jaime imagines savaged rhaella, but a masked, *brazen* beast. ""brazen"" enough to cuckold a king under his own roof by ""masking"" himself as the king, mayhaps? i think so.  ###pentoshi tigers and whales and little monkeys, oh my given that illyrio thus ""is"" a brazen beast, ""a whale with whiskers"" (who, as i will detail in an appendix, is likened in a dozen ways to the yunkishman known as the yellow whale), a valyrian, a pentoshi, and an owner of many, many ships, i was intrigued to notice a passage which seems to reference all of these ""hats"" *immediately* after a shoehorned reference to the cat arya is chasing when we discover that illyrio can access the red keep secretly via the secret staircase in the ""deep black well"" in its sub-basement: &gt;[arya-cat's] favorite [of the cats that were following her] was a scrawny old tom with a chewed ear who **reminded her of a cat that she'd once chased all around the red keep.** no, that was some other girl, not me.  &gt;two of the ships that had been here yesterday were gone, cat saw, but five new ones had docked; **a small carrack called the brazen monkey**, a huge ibbenese **whaler** that reeked of tar and blood and whale oil, **two battered cogs from pentos**, and a lean green **galley up from old volantis**. (ffc cotc)  a brazen beast, a whaler, two pentoshi trading cogs, and the closest thing to a valyrian ship in existence. how can we *not* think of illyrio? especially when it is aboard the ""big-bellied pentoshi cog named bountiful harvest"", *owned by illyrio*, that saan calls illyrio a ""whale"". especially when cogs are *constantly* called illryio-evoking things like ""fat"", ""great"" (as in big), ""sow of a ship"", and ""big-bellied wine cogs"", and when the other explicitly paired cogs in asoiaf are named *brave magister* and *horn of plenty*, which pretty blatantly recalls the *bountiful harvest* and its owner, magister illyrio. (dwd dav ii) (it also recalls the ""horn-of-plenty hand"", who preceded the ""mace-and-dagger hand"" who was burned the night ""aerys"" visited rhaella.)  but what's *really* interesting is the fact that ""the little *brazen monkey*"" is ""little"" and a ""monkey"". why is this interesting? because of how the *hands* of little brazen monkeys might be described, per a passage in which a ""little monkey"" is floated as a possible means of wooing a targaryen queen who will soon be wed to a king she does not love (sound familiar, rhaella?): *** ##continued in oldest reply",1,0,
