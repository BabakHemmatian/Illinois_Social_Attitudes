172249,"i am so confused about what your post is related to.  it's sort of vague, unrelated straw-man argument, punctuated with levity.    however, i think i'll address some of what you are saying.    if a person has homosexual relations for kicks, or to ""figure themselves out"" or because of a drunken dare, or they wanted to experiment, that does not make them a homosexual.  a man can have sex with a woman and still be gay.  therefore a man can have sex with a man and still be straight.  granted, it isn't likely, but that's besides the point.    as for the counseling argument (which this comment all grandfathers from, and i assume was the target of your post), you will notice that they are counseling homos to become heteros.  that's the argument.  not people who have ""grazed on the other side of the fence"", not switch-hitters, or whatever.  honest to goodness homos, converted to heteros.  that, good sir, is as impossible as the reverse.    as for declaring a lack of interest in gay sex... i have a pair of homosexual friends that do not have gay sex.  they refer to themselves as ""non-practicing gays"".  notice, despite not wanting man sex, they are ~still homosexuals~.  this is because they still desire members of their gender.  that's it.  that's all.  they do not need to be active to be declared.    now, as for the continuum comment...  yes, sexuality is a diverse banquet of options and possibilities.  i never suggested otherwise.    have you ever heard of the kinsey scale?  it may not be accurate so much these days, but it certainly is suggestive of sexuality being something non-binary.    so, if you are addressing my original points, i would like to restate them for comprehension purposes: if this church claims to be able to cure homosexuals and convert them into heterosexuals, then they are lying.  what they are doing is harmful.  the homosexuals in question who would avail themselves of this service need to learn acceptance, not how to lie to others and to themselves.  sexuality is not a decision.    the journey of sexuality, the experiments, the adventures, that's choice.  you can try the other side.  you can see if leather floats your boat.  go for it.  have a blast.  but ultimately, you will come to a rest somewhere.  that place of rest, that's your sexuality.",1,
130858,"truth, damn lies and execution  three hundred years ago, courts of justice could be blinded by superstition. in those dark times, people in positions of power could snuff out the light from any candle of hope that the condemned still held for life. innumerable falsely accused victims were burned at the stake, ignited by the flames of flourishing injustice, and fanned by the falsehoods spoke by their peers. sadly, no joyous sunrise would come to end their tortured nights of captivity.  but three hundred years later, courts remain hoodwinked by dishonesty. three hundred years later, lives are still tossed to the proverbial pit of fire. three hundred years later, people in positions of power demonstrate that they are impossibly all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-hearing by summarily judging the actions of others and then doling out executions with omnipotent strength. and so i share with you today a reiteration that acts can be neither omniscient nor omnipotent, that we all have faults, and by extension so do our governments and judicial conditions.  in a sense, capital punishment is like writing a cheque to purchase the life of a criminal. a payment, some argue, that is cheaper than supporting lifelong imprisonment. yet the laws of australia, canada, the united states of america, and numerous others guarantee the ""unalienable rights"" of life and liberty. our past actions liberated slaves and all but abolished slavery. our present actions show that we believe the authority to limit the life of a human being belongs to no one. but coldheartedly, these representative cheques continue to be cashed at banks of justice, even though banks of life and liberty would return them marked ""insufficient funds""!  we must refuse to endorse banks of justice that continue to honour such cheques. we refuse to believe that money can indemnify human lives, regardless of the crimes in question. these deplorable bank drafts must be noneified to redeem our courts of justice and our humanity.  every moment that our voices remain silent widens the gap between being human and being humane. there is an urgency that cannot, must not, be ignored. every hour of apathy lends credence to legalized vengeance. now is the time to speak out for those lost voices smothered behind iron. now is the time to turn our backs on barbaric states. now is the time to tell the people in power that killing is wrong. now is the time to teach compassion to all of our children.  lives are lost forever by ignoring the fierce urgency of now. the dark winter veil of cold-blooded murder will not be lifted until the springtime infusion of life is guaranteed throughout our societies. and those who believe that tomorrow will be just another day will have a rude awakening if the executions continue. there will be neither rest nor tranquility in the world until unconditional life is granted to all its citizens. the snowstorm of revolution will not end until the clear dawn of humble justice emerges.  and to the people united on the peaceful threshold of merciful justice: do not embark in wrongful deeds. life cannot be sanctioned by vengeful actions or riotous demonstrations. no, the right to life will not be chartered by outbursts of physical violence. our actions must embody this monumental goal; we must segregate villainous force from moral force.  when light from our morality is used to judge the shadows cast by criminals, we must appraise ourselves and our laws by the same rays of ethics. to do otherwise places governments and judicial systems beyond the reach of mediated introspection, beyond the grasp of justice itself. by this beam of self-inspection, when a death sentence is dispatched we lift the offender to the moral equality of societal norms, and find ourselves standing deep inside the shadows of criminals.  we shall not walk in those shadows.  we will walk without the spectre of hypocrisy to haunt our footfalls. and as we walk, our steps bring us closer to a golden era that waits ahead.  we cannot turn back.  there are those who oppose the progression toward leniency. they raise statistics like a stoic hammer, driving the belief that executing murderers will reduce homicides. however, this interpretation does not a nail in the coffin make. numbers are tools to add weight to debates; debates that must be continually cross-examined for applicability and accountability. yet statistics are also the claw to the hammer's head, pulling out deterrence arguments by suggesting that legitimising murder through the death penalty actually raises the rate of homicides!  so we will not be satisfied by statistics. we can never be satisfied as long as the guiltless are slaughtered. we cannot be satisfied when fallible humans are the judge and the jury to deadly trials. we can never be satisfied while the press pilots our opinions with sensationalized stigma. no, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until tolerance towers like the tallest of trees and forgiveness flowers like an endless forest.  let us be mindful that forgetfulness is not a bedfellow of forgiveness. to forget that many death row inmates committed terrible crimes would let befall a grave injustice. by the same token, to overlook that the dead can only be exonerated posthumously defiles the memory of innocent victims. instead of incapacitation, let criminals atone for their crimes with positive contributions to society. instead of martyrs, make them educators. instead of miscreants, fashion them material makers. instead of misfits, mold them as missionaries. instead of being slain for malevolence, give them the chance to change.  even though we face the turmoil of retribution, we can see the tenets of redemption. within these tenets, i, too, have a dream.  i dream of a day when no human will have the right to revoke the life from another.  i dream of a day when miscarriage of justice does not result in fresh flowers to a solitary grave, but in the freedom of an unjustly accused prisoner.  i dream of a day when even the ghosts of salem massachusetts, whose deaths were inconceivably shackled to ""spectral evidence"", and whose memories still mock modern justice, may finally find peace.  i dream of a people who understand that no heated crime warrants a cold resolution by death; that death is unjustly everlasting when pit against both fleeting and permanent transgressions; and that humane disciplines can meet the needs of society while being a fair reproach for felonies.  i have a dream today!  i dream of a world where we can judge our justice systems as though they were individuals: not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. where at the highest courts of international law we find that justice is morally, ethically, and logically consistent across all countries.  i have a dream today!  i dream of a world in which mercy opens the door of knowledge to reveal that the real truth in any situation can never be known entirely. a world in which we are keenly aware that the whirlwind of motives, emotions, psyche, and actions behind a trial cannot be judged and punished with absolute conviction. a world that has cast off the rattling chains of death to embrace the foundations of life.  i dream of a world without injustice buried within injustice. a world where the poverty line does not foreshadow a flatline. a world where the accused wealthy and the convicted poor face their fates with equal outcomes and equal opportunities. a world where the concept of just justice is not an ironic fairytale, but a practical reality.  this is our dream, a dream inspired by an extraordinary man.  in the spirit of dr martin luther king jr, a man who made an enormous march for liberty, these words strive to be an extension of his ideas, a continuation to his ideals. but this time the walk is for life. and along the road to the global abolishment of capital punishment sits a world that is one small step closer to unity. it is only through this journey will our collective conscience truly be free at last.",0,

504376,"i came here following this link http://reddit.com/goto?id=2m727  the heading was:  why feminists believe that men are ""in charge.""  i am replying to your comment in that context.  ----------------  you were onto something when you were talking about how not all men are in charge. but then, i think you lost me somewhere along the lines of how the majority of women (80% you say) are in a much better position than the majority of men (90% you say).   let me start with the stats you propose. these are not only unreferenced, but also false, and impossible. here is the reason: a white working class man will be more privileged than a white working class woman; or, another example, a black middle class lesbian will be much more stigmatized compared to a black middle class gay etc etc. so, if we account for such variances in the population, we see that you lied in order to justify your argument.   but as i said, you were onto a very important point at the beginning, a point that many feminists already realized and as a result revising their discourses. you see, when you take notice of the existing social relationships of power such as class, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, race, and so on, it is impossible to argue that ""all men govern all women"".   it is true that our society is patriarchal. that is, overall, men dominate women. however, on the other hand, looking at our society's power structure, one should note that **overall** [crucial word: *overall*], men dominate women (patriarchy), rich dominate working classes (capitalism), whites dominate non-whites (white supremacy), heterosexuals dominate homosexuals (heterosexism), people of european decent dominate ""other""s (ethnocentrism in a way), americans dominate the world (globalization / neocolonialism) etc.   now things aren't that simple, are they? what is the experience of, say, a black lesbian upper class african woman living in australia, as opposed to, say, a white heterosexual british white man living in west bank, in terms of power relationships within the societies they are located? who controls whom? who's in charge now?   feminism has long abandoned the idea that women are a homogeneous group. they are not. there is power struggle between each other. in fact, some women will find governing some men in such a patriarchal society as the united states.   you also mention that if anything, women are at least valued  for their sexuality. what you have to think is whether this is a desirable valuation for women. or is it a devaluation... the answer is, for most women, it is a devaluation. most are aware that the value they get from being ""fuckable"" is just that - being seen as a formation of meat around the vagina.   one of the crucial concepts you have to investigate here is ""**privilege**"". so many of americans think that privilege is just and good and comes by merit. to the contrary, privilege is a sign of power inequality. as a man, you have the privilege of not being subject to sexual harassment, not being one of each 3 to 5 women who is sexually assaulted or raped, not having to worry about the engineering job application you made because of your gender etc. you probably are white - as a white man, you never have to worry about being attacked by kkk, never hear racial slurs targeting you, never perceive that you have a skin color, etc. you probably are american - you will never have to worry about the probability of american jets bombing your village.   finally, i couldn't disagree more with your argument of men having been viewed as ""inferior and almost inhuman"". to the contrary: during our government since the hunter-gatherer societies started, we staged witch hunts to get rid of literate women in europe and elsewhere, we started so many wars that counting them is impossible, we killed so many people that we cannot do the body count, we invented slavery, we invented segregation, we invented empires and imperialism, we came up with the best ways to exploit each other, etc etc etc...  yet there are few men in history that we think of as inhuman - count them for me: stalin, hitler, ... when we look at our gender-mates, we see them as regular human beings, as if it wasn't the power they (we) held and still hold that resulted (and is still resulting) in such atrocities.   nevertheless, i see your comment as one coming from a depressed privileged boy who is sad because he cannot exploit his male privileges as much as he wants.",1,

""i don't approve of children being raised by homosexual parents.""  why?  what are you afraid might happen?  do you think gay parents can 'turn kids gay'?  if so, why is that a problem?  ""i don't approve of children being read gay books in grammar school as is happening on my state.""  why?  what are you afraid might happen?   ""i don't understand why they can't live their lives in peace without intruding on ours.""  i find this strange.  surely you can imagine a situation where you were denied rights.  you are denied the rights and benefits of marriage to someone you love.  you are denied the rights to raise children.  you are denied the right to join the army, or church.   people and institutions condemn and oppress you.   would you consider this satisfactory?    also, what do you think 'intrusion' would mean?  why does it scare you?

410282,"a minor correction before we go any further.  if you voted for or supported prop 8 i label you as a person who has undertaken an evil action, not as an evil person.  i think the difference is rather important.  ***  your central claims appear to be:  1) marriage is, if not entirely at least mostly, about procreation.  2) homosexuals cannot reproduce.  which leads, naturally, to the conclusion: marriage should be restricted to heterosexuals.  i think both of your central claims are manifestly false, and i really do wonder if you have thought them through.  i'd like to address the claim about homosexuals and reproduction first.  while it is inarguable that reproduction, at our current level of technology anyway, requires a woman with a working uterus, that hardly excludes homosexuals.  lesbian couples are perfectly capable of reproduction.  yes, they do require outside help in the form of donated sperm, but that's hardly a major problem.  there's the turkey baster and sperm donated by a male friend method for lesbians looking to do things locally and inexpensively. other couples, such as mary cheney and heather poe used more expensive services.  obviously a pair of men lack the necessary uterus, but this hardly prevents gay couples from raising children.  sex advice columnist dan savage wrote a book, ""the kid"", about the experience he and his partner had in adopting and raising a child.  other than adoption of genetically random children, other possibilities abound.  i read about a gay couple who had a child when one of the men's sister donated both her uterus and one of her eggs to the cause.  i personally know two same sex couples (one male the other female) who cooperated to reproduce.  the men donated the sperm, the women the eggs and uteri.  nine months later the men adopted one of the children, the women kept the other, and everyone was happy.  the point is that lesbian couples can quite easily procreate, and that gay male couples can raise children.  while i do not wish to belittle the hardship of pregnancy, i do think that, in the modern era, it is the raising of a child that is the more important part.  so, even if we accept your first claim, that marriage is about procreation, then lesbian couples should hardly be excluded from marriage, yes?  but your first claim is even more wrong, and self evidently false, than your second.  the mere existence of childless married couples soundly refutes the claim that the institution exists solely to offer advantages for those who chose to breed.  unless you believe that sterile people should be banned from marriage, and that married couples who do not produce children within a few years should have their marriages annoneed, etc we can see that you yourself don't believe that marriage is all about procreation.  the idea that people marry because after thinking something along the lines of ""hmmm, this person has many positive genetic traits and is fertile, we should procreate but i'd like some legal protections and tax breaks too so i'll propose marriage"" is patently ridiculous.  people never talk about marriage in exclusively, or even primarily, reproductive terms unless they're arguing against same sex marriage.  outside of this context all discussion of marriage is about commitment, love, and devotion.  this leads me to strongly suspect that people are lying, perhaps even to themselves, when they suddenly start talking about marriage exclusively in terms reproduction when they argue against same sex marriage.  &gt;these ""perks"" such as tax deductions and employer benefits for example are given to married couples who reproduce offspring.  first, you are incorrect.  employer benefits apply to childless straight couples as well as those who have children.  second, what of gay couples who have children?  you seem oddly convinced that gay == childless, and that is simply not true.  committed gay couples tend to have children at about the same rate as committed straight couples.   &gt;if gay couples who have shared their lives together and love each other want to be protected by law why shouldn't they have some protection. shouldn't they be allowed to visit each other in hospital in times of sickness? i see no reason to object and would argue in favor of this.  then you should be supporting gay marriage.  in hospitals it is extremely common for visitors to critical patients to be limited to family only, and homophobic hospital staff sometimes take a sadistic joy in applying that rule quite strictly.  there are several instances on record of gay couples in states with ""domestic partnership"" laws being denied visitation on the grounds that they aren't family, that they aren't ""married"".    in addition to hostile hospital staff there is also the issue of hostile in-laws.  vastly more common than visitation denied by sadistic hospital employees is the genetic family of the dying partner blocking visitation.  since, thanks to the efforts of you and people like you, the couple can't be legally married the vindictive genetic family of a gay person in a coma can quite lawfully prohibit his partner from visiting, from attending the funeral, etc.  worse in many states the constitutional amendments passed explicitly forbade any legal recognition of agreements that closely approximated marriage.  which means that even if a gay couple took the time and money to have a lawyer draw up a power of attorney, even if the partner who wants to visit has (by some stroke of fortune) the legal documents in his possession those amendments noneify such documents.  and that's not even mentioning the issue of prison visitation, insurance coverage, etc.  not too long back a gay man on the daily kos posted an account of his marriage in florida.  he married a lesbian woman and his partner married her partner; they didn't really know each other, they don't live together, and they rarely speak to their ""spouses"".  why?  insurance.  he had a job that offered insurance to a ""wife"", the woman his partner married had a job that offered insurance to her ""husband"".  thanks to you, and people like you, they were forced to make a mockery of marriage by marrying people they didn't love, in fact people they hardly knew simply to get health insurance for their loved ones.  he says that all four of them cried during the brief ceremony at the courthouse, not from joy but from outrage and misery at the fact that they could not marry the people they loved.  when people take actions that cause that sort of undeserved anguish, i call that evil.  the question remains: why do you think it isn't evil to cause such pain and suffering to gay people?",1,

 i loved my women but i can't imagine digging anonymous sex with women, glory holes, cruising them in public bathrooms, sex in the bushes, etc.  gay men apparently do expect to find something worth staying on the hunt for, and i'm talking men in their 40's, 50's, 60's and beyond.  i'm sorry, to me that's ""different"" enough that i don't wish to see marriage stretched to include that value system.  marriage is about commitment and child rearing.  neither of those values do well with endless promiscuity which is a value for many gay men.  there is no such value among married heterosexuals.  i don't think marriage would cut down on casual sex...  these guys are gonna roll, married or not.  and i'm fine with that, go for it.  but don't take the heterosexual ideal of marriage for your own if your lifestyle honors promiscuity and the gay lifestyle does honor and respect promiscuity.  i've certainly never heard it criticized beyond perhaps, ""have safe sex.""  but never heard a gay organization or leader say commitment is the ideal we should strive for.  that's too straight a value.  no, it's, sex is good in all it's forms, whenever, wherever.  that's just too different from what heterosexuals do, to say we're the same and should share the institution of marriage.  i guess i'm the one to decide, because there's a ballot proposition before me and i have to make a choice.  it affects me because i don't want what i view as a promiscuous section of society entering into a relationship that was formed to value monogamy and has historically never, in any society anywhere, accepted homosexuality.  the definition of marriage, a union between man and woman, shouldn't be changed to include another type of coupling just because they want to.  what's next? triads?  children getting married?    btw it is the society's place to judge what a marriage is and should be, not activist judges ignoring the will of the people and established definition society has rendered over thousands of years because their philosophy is different from the general population.  it's not enough gay people suddenly feel they should be married.  it is and has been a union of man and woman.  let gay people join together but call it something else.  it's not exactly analogous, but it reminds me of the betrayal of the catholic church by homosexual men.  i know some people call them pedophiles, to distance homosexuals from this betrayal, but they were pre-teen and teenage boys that were abused, not toddlers, who are pedophiles' victims of choice.  these men betrayed their faith to satisfy their urges.  they should have never been priests and in a place alone with children.  sure, you can have a heterosexual abuse here and there but never on the scale that happened with the church and homosexual priests.  i can assure you the church, no matter how much homosexual men want to be priests, will not bow to their ""rights"" and allow themselves and the children to be victimized again.  my admittedly non-expert opinion is that the gay culture values, anything goes between consenting adults and no behavior is ""bad"" or off-limits.  this simply does not fit in an institution that has a religious heritage and history and was structured at least in part to provide a stable environment for children.  if you're rocking and celebrating sex in all its forms and permutations all the time why would you want to be married?  true or not, this is the image the gay male community has carved out for itself.  check out gay pride parades...all about half naked, young, buff hotties and fetishists celebrating sexuality.  there is no heterosexual counterpart, reason being, most heterosexuals lives don't revolve around sex, at least after 25 or so...  and if it isn't true, the leaders of the gay community should start denouncing debauchery instead of affirming it or wincing and looking the other way.  don't hold your breath on that happening, it'd be betraying the ""movement"" i guess.    again, i have no problem with legal rights to property, visitation, etc. but marriage historically is one man, one woman and ideally, a true and forever love.  there are exceptions i suppose but i see hedonism as a value that sadly, gay men celebrate and are known for.  if i were a lesbian, i guess i'd be pissed at the image that's been established by the guys...  the weirdness of it, the clumsiness of the attempt to be absorbed in marriage is revealed in the terminology.  two guys get married, who's the wife?  hi, i'd like you to meet my wife joe?  there's a reason and history behind husband and wife.  even the language of the society can't handle it, which is indicative of the problem for the society at large.  i know you feel differently then i do and i can see why.  your arguments are not without merit.  i appreciate that you're able to hear a different opinion without hurling the homophobe, bigot, etc. card.  i guess we'll find out soon how the rest of the state thinks.",1,

734058,"yes, i read the passage you quoted, it isn't the first time i've seen it. i was pointing out that the **entire bible** doesn't condemn loving, monogamous homosexual relationships, anywhere, even in the very few places it addresses homosexual behavior. the contexts in which it discusses it have nothing to do with, for example, gay marriage.  since you want to fixate on this particular passage, though, romans i is actually *about* denouncing paganism. it talks of a people who had turned away from god and had returned to worshiping idols (in verse 21-23), and participated in [presumably heterosexual] orgies (verse 24) - potentially pagan fertility rites.  because they turn away from god, once we get to the part where you started quoting, they lapse into ""vile affections"" that are ""against nature"" (which, by the by, is probably a mistranslation, since the same greek phrase is used elsewhere in the bible to simply mean unconventional), and then there's the guy-on-guy and girl-on-girl action.  but no, what you claim is ""quite clear"" is not, in fact, clear the way you put it. the ""unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness"", etc etc etc is stated in the epistle as a result of their return to paganism, not a result of guys sleeping with guys or gals sleeping with gals. that paul is citing their homosexual acts as yet another result of that paganism is hard to refute, but the passage does not, in fact, say clearly that ""if you are homosexual you are unrighteous/wicked/etc"". the people turn away from god; it turns out badly. the long string of derogatories (""full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of god, despiteful, proud..."") is pointed at idol-worshippers (who ""did not like to retain god in their knowledge""), not homosexuals.  and *again*, even if things in that passage or any passage of the bible relating to homosexuality were as simple and straightforward as you're saying, from a practical standpoint it does. not. matter. for christians, the bible has a center of christ or it has no center at all. the message of love is to be paramount. end of story. whether we think homosexuality is immoral or not (and once again, many of us don't believe it is), we are not somehow better people than they are.  believe me - or don't, your choice, but i consider it important to say - the reason i respond in threads like these is to try to demonstrate that the fred phelpses and the jerry falwells have it horribly wrong, and that a lot of christians do in fact know that.  i've got to get to bed, work in the morning. will be happy to continue the discussion tomorrow if you wish.  edit: here's the [kjv version](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%201;&amp;version=9;) of romans i in entirety for anyone interested.",1,

397430,"homosexuality is not a lifestyle choice: sexual orientation is not chosen, but appears to be determined by complex biological factors that, once established, become immutable.   ##evidence from neuroanatomical studies:##  in rats, part of the brain called the [sexually-dimorphic-nucleus/pre-optic-area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexually_dimorphic_nucleus) (sdn-poa) is larger in male than females. the size of this area of the brain is determined by the level of testosterone the fetus is exposed to in the womb. in 1982, nordeen and yahr, showed that this area of the brain was likely related to sexual behaviour. female rats which were exposed to testosterone, while still in the womb, showed male-like sexual activity (mounting). male rats that were not exposed to any testosterone whatsoever while in the womb showed female-like sexual activity (accepting it, “lordosis”).   	 in humans, a roughly equivalent area associated with sexual activity is the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the hypothalamus (inah3). this region of the brain is about 3x larger in males the females. in a 1991 study by levay, 41 cadavers were analyzed. the size of the inah3 area was found to be about 2-3 times larger in males versus females. the size of the inah3 area was also found to be 2-3 times larger in straight males versus homosexual males. 	 further evidence that exposure to prenatal testosterone levels are involved in sexual preference determination comes from several studies which linked increased exposure to testosterone prenatally, to female homosexual behaviour. (rahman et al. behav. neurosci. 2003; mcfadden and pasanen, pnas, 1998; williams et al. nature, 2000)  ##evidence from familiar and genetic studies:##  in a study in 1991 by bailey and pillard, [concordance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concordance_%28genetics%29) rates were measured for homosexuality in humans. within identical twins (who have the same dna), there was a 52% chance that if one twin was gay, the other was too. among fraternal twins (who have different dna, but are exposed to the same environment in the womb), there was a 22% chance that if one twin was gay, the other was too. among normal brothers (different dna, different prenatal environment), the chance was 9%. the significance of this was that it showed that not only does genetics play a large role in determining sexual orientation (52% among identical twins), but also that prenatal environment was an important factor (22% in fraternal vs 9% among brothers).  in a 1993 study by hamer et al., rates of homosexuality among families was studied. no correlation was found between the father’s side of the family and sexuality; however, correlation was found between the maternal side of the family and sexual orientation. this evidence is in agreement with the hypothesis that sexuality is at least partially determined by environment in the womb (which is part of the mother – there’s a little bit of captain obvious in all of us)  ##closing comments (stolen from a lecture :p)##  homosexuality is not synonymous with promiscuity. men, irregardless of sexual orientation are more likely to be assertive in finding sexual partners than women. as a result, male homosexual relations are less likely to be long lasting, whereas female homosexual relations are more likely to be long lasting.   it is a well established fact that boys raised by homosexual fathers are no more likely to have a homosexual orientation than the general population.   there is no association between homosexuality and pedophilia. on average, it is actually less likely for an individual to be a pedophile if they are homosexual, than if they are heterosexual.",1,

934972,"&gt; feminism is about decreasing and eliminating these negative stereotypes.  this statement is simply not true.   women's studies departments across north america are actively blocking development of men's studies programs. read daphne patai's ""hetero-phobia"" for more information. this is just one example.   i do believe you're upset at all those points above you outlined.   and i believe you honestly feel **your brand** of feminism is fighting for equality.   but the track record of feminism, as a collective social movement, has not only remained indifferent towards men's suffering (genital mutilation, child abuse, suicide, violence towards men), in some cases it's actually added to men's oppression (domestic violence laws and the sexual harassment industry are two examples).   a ""feminist"" can believe in equality, the scum manifesto, or anything in between. which is why i don't believe ""feminism"", as a label, is much use anymore. when you tell me you're a feminist, i have to ask: does that mean you believe in equality, or in cutting up men and limiting the number of men to no more than 10% of the population?  based on your comments, i believe the term [equalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equalism) is a precise description of your beliefs, whereas feminist is not.   &gt; feminists historically fought for women because they were historically most discriminated against.  i do not believe this. i believe farrell was correct when, in ""the myth of male power"", he claims that 40 years ago **both** sexes were oppressed. feminism has gone a long way towards helping women, but feminism has done little for men (except as coincidental side effects of pro-women policies such as mandatory maternity time off).   feminism has done nothing to better the working conditions in the 25 worst jobs (mining, garbage collector, etc). not coincidentally, 24 of the 25 worst jobs are 98% filled by men. the one job in the list with equal female participation is in theatre, considered poor due to the lack of job security.  &gt; most people's views of feminism are based on mind-sticking extreme examples,  my view of feminism is based on the criminal code of canada section 268 which explicitly protects infant females from genital mutilation, while providing no such protection for male infants -- in a country which has a track record of mutilating infant male genitals and continues to mutilate 70 infant boys per **day** today. as a victim of said genital mutilation, i'm offended by the feminists who wrote this law protecting women but cast a blind eye to my (male) suffering.  my view of feminism is based on canadian divorce and family law where some men are forced to pay more in alimony and child support than they earn. failing to pay the required support payments lands them in jail. in other words, having a wife and kids you cannot afford is a criminal offense. there is no appeal process. this law was written with the fore-knowledge that it would devastate men -- it was not an accident. feminism in action.   my view of feminism is based on the chilling and anti-human effects of the sexual harassment industry and it's devastating and isolating effect on inter-sex relations in schools and the workplace.   my view of feminism is based on the continual blaming of men for all the world's ills. elementary school males today are burdened with the gilt of crimes from generations past, being taught by their female feminist teachers that they are perverted violent rapists who must be shamed and denigrated regularly.   policies embodied in law, culture, and our education system are not ""extreme examples"".   misandry is all around us, and feminism is doing fuck-all to fight it. feminism is indifferent to male suffering.   if you are not indifferent to male suffering, you are not a feminist in my book.",0,

(maybe, but that seems vanishingly unlikely to happen, so we should push for basic fairness until then.)  * all the substantive right of marriage are already available to california same-sex couples via the state's domestic partnership statute.  trying to call it ""marriage"" doesn't gain anything but pisses a lot of people off.  (perhaps, but pissing people off is not a compelling reason to abrogate a fundamental right, which the case law says it is.)  if you'd tried those two, at least you wouldn't have come off looking hateful and small-minded.  yes, that's personal, but clearly this is personal for you.  when you use a phrase like ""gaying it up,"" that shows that this is about disgust for you, not about rational argument.  well, it's personal for me, too.  i'm not gay, but my dad is.  he was married to my mom for 28 years — that's 28 years living a lie, instead of being himself.  he was over 50 years old before he began to come to terms with it, even to acknowledge it to himself.  he didn't choose that course for tax benefits, as you so callously suggest.  he chose it because it was the only path available in his time.  gay marriage, or even being gay, wasn't an option he even knew about.  gay marriage is a powerful signal that a better life is available.  the more visible it is, the more acceptable it is, the less gay kids growing up today need to hide, need to pretend, need to worry that their lives will be second class, like my dad's was for so many years.  this is why gay marriage is important, why calling it ""marriage"" is paramount, and why vile rhetoric such as your own needs to be shown for what it is at every turn.",1,

""this issue is about the historical imperatives handed down by british colonialists that conditioned black caribbean people to view themselves as sexual beings; it is about patriarchal tenets that support the domination of heterosexual men; it is about the christian and rastafari fundamentalism that guides the greater majority of our religious circles; and it is about the rites of passage that dancehall artistes must undergo to claim their authoritative positions as jamaican wordsmiths.... it is, therefore, critical for us to question the vociferous and explicit nature of the anti-homosexual dialogue in the society since the late 1990s. my research shows that this rise in anti-homosexual dancehall lyrics is a direct result of the progressive unmasking of (male) homosexuality since the late 1990s. this is reflected in growing numbers of openly homosexual television programmes broadcast during prime-time on cable television stations that are accessible to jamaicans. these include will and grace, queer as folk and queer eye for the straight guy. many popular sitcoms also broadcast episodes that feature actors as homosexual men and women. the formation of j-flag in december 1998 acted as another catalyst when it raised the visibility of proud, gay jamaican men and women. homosexuality in jamaica has been tolerated for many decades, cloaked under a hypocritical kind of 'respectable' silence as long as gays 'do their thing' in private and the response to the open panorama of homosexuality since the 1990s has generally been cloaked in this same 'respectable' silence. on the other hand dancehall's extreme response has been the very public increase in anti-homosexual lyrics. in its early years dancehall lyrics mentioned gay men (or women) in a line or two of a song. now entire songs are devoted to condemning male homosexuality as an abomination that threatens to corrupt and overturn jamaican society, like the biblical example of sodom and gomorrah”.

424892,"i can't say that i'm the best person to answer your questions (i come from a very similar home situation and i have yet to tell my parents), but maybe i can just help with a few things.  firstly, the relationship thing. i'm a senior in college (i go to a very conservative, christian college--cliche, i know), and i have quite a few friends that are in relationships. i sometimes wish i was as close with someone as they were, but, being where i am, it's not really the easiest thing to have an openly gay relationship--if to have a relationship at all. my advice: choose a non-conservative college if you can. if you can't (my parents told me they would only pay for college if i went to a christian one!), then just make the most of it. i know it seems like a long time, but four years is a lot shorter than most people think. hell, i feel like i've been in college for like 6 seconds and i'm freaked out about graduating.  the way i justify it? i'd rather be alone than be with a girl. any day. and i'd rather be alone than in a relationship that i'm even mildly unhappy with. a few perks? don't have to buy someone else bday, christmas, etc. presents; spend time doing only what *you* want to do; don't have to worry about impressing anyone else; don't have to always think 'what would [insert partner's name here] want me to do/be doing. the list goes on...  as i said, i've yet to tell my parents; we'll see how that goes. i've never been personally threatened to be disowned, but they've made it clear how much they despise homosexuality in all its forms, so i'm sure disownment won't be too far down their list when they find out. the one thing that i can say is that my parents love me, and your parents probably love you. if love counts for anything in their book, then something as simple as sexuality should stand in the way of a good parent-child relationship. (at least that's what i've been telling myself! :) ) also, it's up to you when you tell them. tell them when you're ready. i mean, you've kept it a secret this long, what's a little longer? :)  about the depression: keep a journal. empty all your thoughts every night. that's what helped me. i went through a pretty depressed time in my life two years ago for many reasons, and i do have to say that journaling (along with writing poetry) really helped me. that and coming out to friends. the more friends that knew, the less dissonance i had about it, and that's always a comforting place to be.   i don't fully understand what you mean by ""start looking for someone."" i assume you mean ""a gay relationship."" the only thing i have to say is this: college was a lot more fun when i wasn't involved with someone and could just let myself go. don't feel like you need to be in a relationship because you might be jealous of your friends now. the only good reason to be in a relationship is so that you can enjoy someone else, not to fulfill or fill a part of your life that you think is lacking. do some thinking, and you might find that you're fine on your own, but deep friendships are all that you need (right now and in college). and if you're worried about meeting people because of introversion, don't be. i'm very introverted myself, and i've had no problem with anything because of it. you meet people in college. it comes with the territory. you meet more people than you really ever want to (as an introvert). and you can choose the relationships you want and maintain them at a very quick pace with little effort (at least at the beginning). so don't worry about being quiet.  and about being open. don't think that just because you're gay you need to be overly open about it. think of it like this: how often do you see someone and think 'wow. they're really straight.' just be yourself. your true colors will, effectively, shine through. and if you're worried about not ""being gay enough to be obvious to potential partners,"" i've found that this is not, in actuality, that true. homosexuals have a lot better gaydar than heterosexuals, and, unless they're a complete dolt, you'll find that you don't have to be a queen to be noticed.  one final piece of advice: don't spend all your time worrying about this. i try not to label myself too often, but, as a human (and an american), it happens so involuntarily. don't think 'i have to be gay. i have to be open and obvious all the time. i have to do x because i'm gay.' just relax and take it easy. labels are dangerous things, so apply them lightly and sparingly. just like salt and butter!   and finally: you don't sound bitchy at all. i think everyone who has read your post knows exactly where you are. you're not alone; you're not unloved; you're not whiny. you're just a little unsure and confused. and who isn't?",1,

851422,"there are problems associated with sodomy/anal sex.  the inner walls of the rectum are not very strong and can easily rupture. this can lead to infections.  anal sex involves contact with human feces and there are a number of health hazards associated with that.   from zenit:  two extensive studies appearing in the october 1999 issue of the american medical association's archives of general psychiatry confirm a strong link between homosexual sex and suicide, as well as a relationship between homosexuality and emotional and mental problems.  one of the studies in the journal, by david m. fergusson and his team, found that ""gay, lesbian and bisexual young people are at increased risk of psychiatric disorder and suicidal behaviors.""  the youth suffering from these disorders were four times as likely as their peers to suffer from major depression, almost three times as likely to suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, nearly four times as likely to experience conduct disorder, five times as likely to have nicotine dependence, six times as likely to suffer from multiple disorders, and over six times as likely to have attempted suicide.  an extensive study in the netherlands undermines the assumption that homophobia is the cause of increased psychiatric illness among gays and lesbians. the dutch have been considerably more accepting of same-sex relationships than other western countries -- in fact, same-sex couples now have the legal right to marry in the netherlands.  so a high rate of psychiatric disorders associated with homosexual behavior in the netherlands means that psychiatric disease cannot be attributed to social rejection and homophobia. the dutch study, published in the archives of general psychiatry, did indeed find a high rate of psychiatric disease associated with same-sex sex behaviors.  compared to controls who had no homosexual experience in the 12 months prior to the interview, males who had any homosexual contact within that time period were much more likely to experience major depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder.  females with any homosexual contact within the previous 12 months were more often diagnosed with major depression, social phobia or alcohol dependence.  in fact, those with a history of homosexual contact had higher prevalence of nearly all psychiatric disorders measured in the study.  also, a recent study in the american journal of public health has shown that 39% of males with same-sex attraction have been abused by other males with same-sex attraction.   the list of medical diseases found with extraordinary frequency among male homosexual practitioners as a result of homosexual behavior is alarming: anal cancer, chlamydia trachomatis, cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus or hiv, human papilloma virus -- hpv or genital warts -- isospora belli, microsporidia, gonorrhea, viral hepatitis types b and c, and syphilis.  sexual transmission of some of these diseases is so rare in the exclusively heterosexual population as to be virtually unknown. others, while found among heterosexual and homosexual practitioners, are clearly predominated by those involved in homosexual activity.  men who have sex with men account for the lion's share of the increasing number of cases in america of sexually transmitted infections that are not generally spread through sexual contact.  these diseases, with consequences that range from severe and even life-threatening to mere annoyances, include hepatitis a, giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica, epstein-barr virus, neisseria meningitides, shigellosis, salmonellosis, pediculosis, scabies and campylobacter.",1,

306533,"fair enough. and yes, that is what i'm arguing-- that the components of the concept existed but they weren't recognized as a coherent concept. a significant part of this, to me, is the fact that marriage for romantic love wasn't widely considered valid for centuries after christ's time, the greeks or the romans. so how can we criticize their lustful same-sex intercourse by the same standard as a monogamous loving long-term relationship? we tend to draw the parallel because, in both cases, the issue involves two people of the same biological sex engaging in intercourse. but please admit to me that you understand that sexuality is more than just having sex? like, i, as a gay woman, do actually do more than have sex with my partner? occasionally we do things like talk, relate to each other, help each other through emotional downs, celebrate emotional highs, we help each other become better people, hold each other accountable, take platonic pleasure in each other's company? and then also sometimes we have sex. i assume it's the same way with you and your wife/girlfriend? you do more than just have sex? is that truly, to you, the same thing as ""here i am in ancient greece, here's my slave boy who is societally obliged to have sex with me.""  to me, as a christian and a homosexual, it is absolutely and disgustingly offensive to me the way that people a) assume that they know about and have the right to discuss my private sex life and b) they assume that those assumptions are all that constitute my entire sexual identity. i don't look at straight people and go ""oh, i am going to assume you love getting blow jobs and because of that you must just go around getting blow jobs all the time with everyone!"" so why people think its justifiable to do that to homosexuals is baffling to me and it never ceases to kill my soul a little. again, my point is that sexuality is not just who you have sex with, it's a whole pattern of behavior centered around how we interact with the world in regards to relationships.   another side note on that point is that, to me, a large reason why homosexuality wasn't conceived of and, therefore, practiced was the emphasis on progeny. that was the reason you got married, was to have offspring. this is the case biblically as well-- the sin of onan was spilling his seed and preventing his line from continuing. the emphasis on progeny was enormous. did same-sex intercourse still occur? totally! but not in a lifestyle, committed manner-- these were extramarital affairs often carried out according to strict cultural rule (this still certainly occurs-- young men who spend their youth experimenting with other men but then get married to other women. the emphasis, in these cultures, is on progeny not on romantic love).  i agree that sexual sin, in terms of intercourse, is the issue. but again, why do you assume that my homosexual relationship devolves into one around lust any more than your heterosexual one? am i lustful sometimes? absolutely, i'm imperfect. but we all, as humans, fall into that same trap regardless of who our partner is. i mean, i think about the sexual one-night-stand behavior of my straight friends in college-- and it blows my mind to hear people denounce gays for being ""lustful."" hmm... i wasn't the one going home with a different stranger every night. but me and my girlfriend, in our committed relationship, are considered lustful because.... we're both girls? this makes no sense. ""lust"" refers to the spirit of an action-- not to the action itself. you can have unlustful sex, you can have lustful sex.   the reason why sodomy was considered, in my opinion, synonomous with lust is because that-- between two men-- was something that did not occur in committed, loving relationships at the time. it occurred in extra-marital relationships that existed only for the purpose of sex. lustful sex. but nowadays? that's simply not the same. and lets look at it this way-- you say ""these guys are hurting themselves."" alright. now, how many times do we hear this story: man marries woman, a marriage recognized under god. man then pursues secretive, extra marital affair with boy-- while still in wedlock-- exposing himself, his wife, his male partner and his whole family to a wide gammut of problems. now, i'm not making the case that you're justifying that, i understand you're not. but the pressure that the christian right often puts on people is that straight is something ""you can become--"" just marry a nice girl and it'll fix itself! are those guys helping themselves by repressing their nature? no. they are exposing a lot more people to hurt. and people sometimes say ""well they shouldn't give into their nature!"" well, thats bs. if i shouldn't, then neither should you.   not to mention, ""sodomy' is usually what people translate to ""homosexuality,"" in terms of a christian condemnation of it. phew!!! as a homosexual woman, i guess i dodged the bullet on that one! either we can accept that a) the biblical condemnation of homosexuality doesn't apply to women or b) the author didn't include any reference to it because it didn't exist. see arguments from above.  as a christian, i agree-- the ignorance of god's word among fundamentalists drives me up the wall. it makes me sad and sick. but at the end of the day, i know that god guides me and that god accepts me. his word offers me no suggestion to the contrary. instead, it tells me to be vigilant against false prophets, to hold myself accountable. i never want to stand in front of god and have to answer to him for why i was silent in the face of people propagating hatred in his name. as christians, we should challenge ourselves to understand the totality of god's word, not just the text. and, the more i do this, the more i realize the current christian attack on homosexuality is nothing more than a rehashing of their attack on minorities, women, interracial marriages or whoever the scapegoat of the day is.  perhaps the greater sin is the inhospitality of churches to homosexuals, the flashing messages of ""we don't want your kind here"" that so many of us get when we seek guidance from the church. to me, this is the antithesis of what christ taught, far more so than who i love.",1,

259874,"the reason this system works so well is because the construction companies do not retain the workers during down time. this is an enormous cost savings. they do  not have to directly pay health care for these workers and deal with the associated administrative cost. once again a huge savings. and they are not saddled with life long pension and healthcare  responsibility  and we know that those costs are ruinous. so why should the companies relinquish  those advantages?  the other side of the coin.  the workers can afford healthcare because they by in bulk. (like sam’s club or costco does). they can afford  retirement  because they hire professional investment administrators (like g. e. or boing or any number of corporations do). it’s just good business to buy that way, in fact it’s the american way .  the workers receive all those benefits by taking on the responsibility  themselves through elected representatives.  increasingly companies  do not want to be burdened with providing these lifelong benefits so they are dropping them and i don’t blame them. it is a drag on the economy. but because they do not want to provide them does not mean they are unnecessary. it just should not be their sole responsibility.  the workers can do this themselves  as in the above example taking advantage of their buying power in numbers and modern business principles. in other words they can take care of themselves.  so unless you have something against companies making more money and workers living a decent life what’s wrong with this arrangement?",0,
692896,"another concept i cannot wrap my mind around is the holy trinity and the way the church views it. jesus and his spirit after his death, the holy ghost, are two different beings but are still one in the same. i get that. (my ghost would still be me.) but god and the man and the ghost are all one? well, if jesus was created directly by god's will, as though he were a little piece of god, i kind of grasp that too. so why does the church worship christ, instead of god? if they are all one, and god was the source of jesus, who was the source of the holy ghost, shouldn't the church worship god, not jesus? (by the way, if a pregnant young woman were to claim an immaculate conception today, would you believe her? even if her boyfriend vouched for her, would you believe it? i wouldn't.)  so, when did you decide to be heterosexual? did you decide at age ten? did you decide at age six? i never decided to be heterosexual, i just was. i remember around 4 or 5 years old and finding a playboy magazine. having no concept of gay or straight or sex, i asked my mother why my penis got hard when i looked at the pictures. (my mother was awesome! i mean she really rocked! i asked her some very hard questions growing up, and she always answered me honestly and accurately, and in a way i could understand at the time. i remember her taking a deep breath and gritting her teeth while figuring out how to explain some things. lol! she passed away this feb. and i think of her often.) i do not remember exactly what she said that day, only that she let me know it was a normal reaction for a boy, and that i shouldn't be looking at those pictures because i was too young to understand them. it wasn't a complete answer, but probably all i could have understood at that age. she was a wonderful mom!  i could no more force myself to be gay than a homosexual can force themselves to be straight. it is hard wired into the brain. some church group has been claiming in recent years to be able to cure homosexuality through faith. there was an article i read a few months ago that did a follow up on them and found many of the 'cured' had gone back to homosexuality or committed suicide. many of the converted did not go back to being openly gay, but were very depressed and could not function in daily life. the article said that almost none of them were well adjusted or happy. so very sad. our sexuality is hard wired into the brain and cannot be changed or denied.  it is so much more than gay or straight. there are many varieties of ""not straight"" behavior. a gay friend of mine, except for his good fashion sense and being neat, is as masculine as any man you ever met. (and he is only attracted to manly men.) some are only attracted to feminine men. some gay men are fat slobs. some are flaming fags, (as liberal as i try to be, the flamers get on my nerves. i hate being around cross dressing men.) there are straight men that cross dress. some lesbians are very feminine, while others are bull dykes. some people are physically one gender and mentally the other. many people are bisexual. i am a hetero man, but i hate sports and i hate macho behavior. it is not just one wire that is variable, but many wires that are variable. i picture it as whole banks of switches in the brain, controlling different behaviors and desires, and different switches are flipped for each of us. many different variables and many different outcomes.  you apparently want to believe what you believe and want to be accepted for it. however, you are prepared to not be accepted for your beliefs, because you believe so strongly. (you are brave. i give you that.) wouldn't you rather be loved by all, and not have it infringe on your beliefs? wouldn't that be best of all? of course it would.  no one wants to be gay. no one chooses to be hated if they can help it. we would all prefer to be liked. we are a social creature and cannot survive and thrive alone. we all want to fit in and be accepted. no one would choose to be gay knowing the hatred and unacceptability that comes with it. (*well, that isn't entirely true. we all know at least one asshole who would do it just to piss us off. but that would be more like 1% of the current gay population. nowhere near the numbers that occur.)  most of us just want to fit in and be accepted. while they are in school, (the harshest social situation any of us will ever have to endure,) most homosexual people, if given a choice, would choose to be straight and fit in. most really try to, but cannot. (magic straight pill? they would take it in a heart beat!) that is why i am convinced that homosexuality is naturally occurring and involuntary.  to say that something involuntary is a sin is like saying that having cancer is a sin, or having a heart attack is a sin, or that catching the flu is a sin, or getting alzheimer's disease is a sin. or that having red hair is a sin, or having dark skin is a sin, or having big feet is a sin,or having an ugly mole is a sin, or having a birth defect is a sin. no one gets sick on purpose, and no one is gay on purpose. it just is. whether it is god's plan or a quirk of evolution doesn't matter, it just is.  if homosexuality is naturally occurring, (as i believe it is,) homosexuals are unable to change, (as the evidence indicates,) and god says that homosexuality is a sin, (as you believe,) doesn't that make god appear to be a very cruel and sadistic being? i can not believe god is twisted and cruel. since i know gay people who are good people and cannot change their inner orientation, and research is being done that seems to uphold that, then i have to conclude that the committee edited old book must be the weak link.  it is sad really, because i am a very spiritual person and want to believe, but i cannot ignore the evidence i see every day. i have had to find my own set of beliefs that can allow me to live. i believe god created the hot subatomic particles of the beginning universe, defined the conditions and laws of nature governing them, and put the universe into motion. we have a chance to survive. we have everything we need to thrive, (barring the occasional natural disaster.) we even have the intellect to study the universe and hopefully can one day understand it. will we ever have the wisdom to live together and survive? that is up to us. (so far, it looks very iffy! i am frightened for us.)  i do not know how long these threads live on reddit. my email is mlashinsky@gmail.com. you seem a decent person. feel free to email me directly if you like.",1,1
461494,"1. the rates are much higher in some geographical areas. among men who have sex with men in chicago, for example, the infection rate is almost 18%. that's directly from the chicago department of public health 2009 surveillance [report](http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/cocwebportal/coc_editorial/std_hiv_aids_chicago_july09.pdf). new transmissions have more or less stayed level over the last few years, although you are correct to point out that more people are living with hiv and fewer are progressing to aids. however, of new infections, msm contact still represents 48% of transmission. this means that gay men and other men who have sex with men are still far overrepresented in new hiv infections. 2. bug chasing is not a myth, although its prevalence certainly is. i work as an hiv tester and counselor, and after delivered a negative result i've had a few people act sad. after explaining that ""negative"" means no hiv, they responded ""i know. i'm trying to get it."" whatever their reasons, there are people who want it or just don't care if they get it. the misrepresentation is to identify this as a gay phenomenon, as there are straight people who have similar tendencies. it's very rare in both communities, but it does happen and is not a myth. also, ""revolting"" is not the right word for this. judging/attempting to shame a person's practices might *seem* like a good way to try and change those practices, but in reality it's not. every bit of data suggests that shaming tactics (like calling this practice ""revolting"") actually further discourage people engaging in the practice from being tested/counseled, which provides us (hiv testers and counselors) with an opportunity to talk to them about it.  3. you hit on the key here, that systematic societal problems are the things we should be analyzing; more on this at the bottom. 4. good point. 5. this is not true. homosexual males earn less than their heterosexual counterparts, and as a community we have lower earning power - in part because of the high rates of homelessness among youth (means later starts on education and careers). i realize you want to ""win"" this argument, but don't misrepresent the reality, especially for those in our communities who need the most help. 6. this is true, but let's not self-stigmatize... if our argument is that queer people aren't icky and evil, should we really point and laugh at someone because they might be repressing homosexual attractions? i've always been disturbed by this tactic.  anyway, the high rates of hiv are a major problem of societal structures. gay sex has, since well before the hiv/aids epidemic, been shamed into secrecy. gay men have fewer social opportunities to pursue sex and romance, having to rely on traditionally gay (also traditionally anonymous) venues like bathhouses, bars, and the internet. there's also less opportunity for romance and less reason to pursue romance, as marriage isn't a viable option and same-sex relationships are often treated with negativity by the individuals in our lives (think bosses, relatives, neighbors, landlords, police, the various other individuals with whom we may have interactions, may have to say ""oh yes, this is my... roomate?"" for fear that they will treat us poorly if we say ""partner,"" ""lover,"" ""wife,"" or ""husband""). the reality is that our society is extremely negative towards queer people... because of this, we move though society differently than straight people. we move through relationships differently. we move through public health differently, and we are more likely to suffer from *many* public health conditions (not just hiv/aids).  tl;dr - i agree with some of your points, but take serious issue with others. honestly representing the challenges our communities face is better than misrepresenting them to win an argument. hiv/aids is best understood as a logical public health outcome in a society that is distinctly homophobic.  *edit: for purposes of full disclosure, i am gay, am hiv positive, and work in hiv services*",1,
473099,"good, i can tell you directly... you are a moron. your reasons are very idiotic and baseless.  1. what is the relation between having the highest player and winning the ws?  that's like saying, no team with a one armed pitcher from minnesota has ever won the ws.  there is no correlation between the one and the other.  2. what does javy vasquez or kevin brown's performance have to do with the expected performance of cc, aj or teixeira?  do the yankees put some hex on first year players?    3. look at teams like the 1928 yankees, 1975-1976 reds or any other team with a boat load of stars... they seemed to have got along and won just fine.  using the 2008 tigers as reason to state why the 2009 yankees will fail is weak.   4. the yankees had one of the best bullpens in the mlb. you use era to explain your point (in the comments section of the blog post), but using era to evaluate a reliever is ineffective.  a reliever does not throw enough innings to offset one bad performance.  plus, if a reliever comes in the middle of an inning and lets all the inherited runners score, then he did not do his job.  the catch here... that relievers era will not be effected, the pitcher who he replaced will have a higher era.   in terms of inherited runners prevented, the yankees were 9th in the ml and 7th in the al (above tb and bos).  http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/sortable/index.php?cid=441697  if you want to look at reliever era, yankees were #7 in ml, #5 in al.   baa #3 in both ml and al  ops against #4 in ml, #3 in al blown saves fewest in mlb  whip #4 in ml, #3 in al  http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/aggregate?stattype=pitching&amp;seasontype=2&amp;group=9&amp;type=reg&amp;sort=&amp;split=128&amp;season=2008  should i go on?    5, 6 and 7 are all very weak, so i'm not going to entertain them.  8. replacing abreu with nady or swisher was solid, in terms of defense.  abreu was terrible in the of.  replacing giambi w/teixeira or swisher is a tremendous upgrade offensively and defensively.  i can go into the numbers if you would like, but maybe this can be your hw assignment.  9. replacing pettitte and mussina w/younger and better pitchers such as cc and aj is a win for the yankees.  pettitte had an awful 2nd half of the season (he's traditionally been a strong 2nd half pitcher, so somethings amiss), so he won't be missed as a front line starter.  the yanks have a potential rotation of: 1. cc 2. wang 3. aj 4. joba 5. hughes / aceves / pettitte (?) / kennedy  that's a hell of a lot better than the crap that was pitching for the majority of the 2008 season.  10. tampa bay rays - ever hear of the 2007 colorado rockies?  in all fairness, the rays are a good team, but i want to see them do it again to really believe in them.   rob neyer, joe sheehan (or anyone else from bp) know their shit.  i suggest reading articles from bp, hardball times, etc. to get a better understanding of the game.  a lot of the points your tried to make are just nonsense and typical of the crap that is spewed on espn or other main stream media outlets.  there is a lot of good stuff out there, do some research and you'll be pleasantly surprised.",0,
585780,"another explanation of these data is found in barlow, sakheim, and beck's ( 1983) theory of the role of anxiety and attention in sexual responding. it is possible that viewing homosexual stimuli causes negative emotions such as anxiety in homophobic men but not in nonhomophobic men. because anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection, this theory would predict increases in erection in homophobic men. furthermore, it would indicate that a response to homosexual stimuli is a function of the threat condition rather than sexual arousal per se. whereas difficulties of objectively evaluating psychoanalytic hypotheses are well-documented, these approaches would predict that sexual arousal is an intrinsic response to homosexual stimuli, whereas barlow's (1986 ) theory would predict that sexual arousal to homosexual stimuli by homophobic individuals is a function of anxiety. these competing potions can and should be evaluated by future research. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/freud.html",0,

347607,"yeah, was thinking and realised something. i was standing at birmingham new street bus station a few months ago (waiting for the bus) and was approached by two girls who, after talking for about 0.4 seconds, i realised to be street preachers.  sadly, i was the last person they should have picked. anyway, me (and my like-minded friend) had a heavy exchange with these girls (by heavy i mean deep) and we were a bit drunk, but not too much, and basically reached a stalemate. i do at one point remember talking about homosexuality (im straight) and why it should be seen as bad. she referred to gay guys as 'sodomists', and i replied ""what, they are gay, so therefore, they are sodomists?"" and she said ""yes"" and i said ""but some heterosexual couples practice anal sex"" and i saw her recoil. i said ""you know, anal sex?"" and she said ""yes, anal sex"" like she never said the words before in her life. this girl looked mid-twenties. holy fuck.  anyway. the point of my submission is this. i wonder how xtians (those girls were pentacostal, so they do the whole 'blahahwwhahlahaalhghhgg' talking spirit nonsense stuff) get around the idea of sex. i mean, anyone have insight into how a sexual encouter between two devout xtians might work? or, more importantly, how they might just let loose in that respect, and struggle with the whole 'sin' aspect of sexual experimentation?  thankyou for reading this far. here's a ascii cookie.

903616,"i think it's alright to declare you're gay up front so long as you explain why you're doing it: ""some guys have problems with this, and i don't want it to be a surprise if you're the kind of guy who has a problem with this - not saying you are; i just don't know you yet and want to get it out of the way for both of our sake.  i hope it simply won't be an issue.""  i think it is key to explain *why* you're telling this (otherwise it can come off as ""i am a big bundle of gay with an insignificant human being attached."")  it also gives some food for thought - like maybe as a straight guy i might think, ""that's odd - i wouldn't ever think it necessary to tell a potential roommate i'm straight.  kind of fucked up he feels he has to tell me he's gay.""  getting straight people to think about these double standards is in everyone's best interest.  i don't like people who define themselves primarily by their sexuality and tbh the majority of people who do this have been straight guys i met who, i assume, are trying to prove their heterosexuality or something by talking graphically about sex with women constantly.  it's always amusing when a guy won't shut up about how much he likes women.  if you explain why you're declaring your homosexuality - that you don't want it to be a surprise, i think that has several positive effects - the one i mention plus a sense of consideration for your roommate.  it is actually potentially stranger to come out later.    my own experience is i roomed with a guy for a few years before he came out of the closet.  i didn't feel betrayed or angry at him, but there was a sense of shock (you think you know somebody well by that point).    i've been told more than once that ""people don't tell you they're gay because they don't think you can handle it,"" which is surprising to me personally because i didn't think i gave off homophobic vibes (for example, words like ""gay"" or ""fag"" to describe people or things i don't like, are not in my vocabulary and haven't been since i was 12 or so).  still trying to figure that out.   in a sense i felt a little insulted by this assumption.  i guess i said or did something or somehow indicated i didn't like gays but i can't really figure out where or how i did.  because you know, all of these dumb mental gymastics homosexuals have to play is because of straight peoples' issues and hangups - it really is *our* problem, and our fault.  in terms of swishiness or whatever, well, i'm not a big fan of it but then i'm not a fan of the diva-esque equivalent some women are into either.  but it is hardly some obsessive thing.  and i'd feel worse if someone had to squelch themselves or be phony around me because of my problems or tastes.    i live a lie every day not related to my sexuality and i know quite well what it is to have to do that.  anyway, i'd say that gay people have a right to be not only tolerated but respected, and a straight roommate has a right only to the same courtesies he'd ask of another straight roommate.  overall, i think you should approach him like you assume he will or can be okay with it.  explain that in your experience it can be an issue and you don't want it to be but thought you'd be honest up front.",1,1

""thats cool! can you bring it in tomorrow?"" he asked, our game of one-upmanship forgotten with the potential awesomeness of a paper sea-plane. i could only nod.   that night, my mind raced feverishly. my father was no help as usual - he was still at work, which i later discovered meant getting to know his secretary a little too well and my mother was very busy with the housework, which i later discovered meant that she was trying not to think of how well my father knew his secretaries. so i went into the bathroom with a ream of paper, filled the tub up and sat there trying to work it out.   everything i tried was an abject failure. no plane design i tried could do anything approaching a real landing on the water. i felt terrible. i was going to have to fess up to my friend and have to put up with his smugness for like a week. i slept poorly that night.   the next day i was dreading going to school and seeing my friend later on in the afternoon, but on the way into school i had a sudden flash of inspiration. all i had to do was fold the wings of a normal aeroplane down like steps so half of them were below the fuselage and that should give the stability it needed to land. sadly there was no body of water big enough to test my hypothesis, so i had secretely make my plane in class and hope for the best.  that afternoon, i met my friend at the lake. he was there when i got there, tapping his left foot anxiously, and without a word i held up something i had never tested before, never even conceived until that day. i took a deep breath and threw the plane.   it left my hand dead straight, then much to my surprise, suddenly did a loop-de-loop, then another one, and then another one. i could only watch open-mouthed as it continued looping towards the lake, expecting it to crash headfirst, but then something magical happened. somehow the plane straightened out again as it was coming near ground level and gracefully touched the water's surface, coming to a halt. yes, it had landed, and it remained there in all its glory for about 3 seconds, before the water swept it below.   so yeah. as far as the inner 6 year old in me is concerned (he does occupy a surprisingly large part of my psyche, actually), that was the best paper aeroplane in the world, and no other plane can ever come close.",0,

510428,"&gt;the mandate from the fcc that ""equal time for opposing viewpoints"" be presented made the networks tow a more moderate position and carefully delineate editorial and news reporting.  according to the wp:fairness doctrine article:  &gt;it should not be confused, but often is, with the equal time rule. the fairness doctrine deals with matters of public importance, and has no specific equal-time requirement; the equal time rule only deals with political candidates.  [end]  &gt;this is the reason why the conservatives are so dead set against the fairness doctrine -- since they're in bed with the big corporations, it's good business for the conservative, big-business agenda to be steamrolled in the media.  i'd say that most tv stations i see have a liberal bent, and most talk radio a conservative bent.  i don't really have a problem with that much, though -- if someone wants slanted media, they're going to get it.  there's a definite line between the government deciding what's good for people to watch and mandating it and the government preventing lock-out of particular views.  as i understand it, the scotus basis for allowing the fairness doctrine was *specifically* in areas where stations were limited, it was possible for someone who owned all stations to lock out particular viewpoints.  it wasn't that people weren't watching what was best for them, and that that situation needed to be corrected.  imho, today, the internet, increased population funding many, many channels, and the relative cheapness of various forms of media pretty much cover the problems that the fd was introduced to handle.",0,

372581,"&gt;auxiv  &gt;whats happening now in our society is this: [secularization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secularization) i havent been to church in years myself. my concern is for the kids, and society as a whole. society is straying further from basic principals. i believe single parents, kids having kids, and homosexuality are leading factors in the degradation of our society. i was born in the early 70's. i grew up in a time when kids didnt bring guns to school and shoot everyone, and all the other nonsense that is going on with our younger generation these days. all these are contributing factors in the decline and degradation of society as a whole. to allow ""out of the norm"" breeds more ""out of the norm"". you call it progress, i call it a bunch of people who cant accept rules that were handed down from generations past. the further we stray from these basic ""rules"" and ideologies, the further society will stray from basic moral principals. people are trying to raise their kids in this mess. they see marriage of gays as another milestone further away from a healthy society, in which their kids must grow up and live. ps. you should tell your wife you're gay.  in regards to your childish ps note telling me to tell my wife that i'm gay, i need to ask you this: standing up for the freedoms and equality of everyone makes me gay?  i personally feel that people of all ages, backgrounds, skin tones, sexes, and sexual orientations should have equal rights and treatment, and that somehow makes me gay?  your statements are only proving you're a close-minded bigot.  different sexual orientations are nothing new, as homosexuality was around even before the days of greece.  it's obviously a part of humanity, and just because you disagree with that fact does not make you right above everyone else.  and you're concern is for the children?  you're still a close-minded bigot.  there has never been any evidence suggesting that the degradation of our society is directly linked to homosexuality, single-parent families, etc.  let's just say that there are case studies that state otherwise.  we can easily argue right back against it.  was there mass chaos in our society back in wwii, when mothers were forced to raise their children alone because their husband's had died in the war?  nope, just the same routine problems society faces.  homosexuality was a closed topic back in the early part of the 20th century, but it was slowly emerging.  just because it wasn't a frequently as discussed topic today as it was back then, doesn't undermine the fact that there were homosexuals.  so according to your pathetic, childish argument, the frequency of people admitting they're gay is contributing to the downfall of our country?  by that logic, children admitting that they want to be astronauts or firemen would contribute to the fixing of our nation's problems.  and that's why you're clearly wrong.  people admitting who they are isn't doing the damage, as there is no substantial connection.  instead, maybe we should actually blame the *real* problems?  for example, we have corrupt politicians taking bribes to alter laws.  our laws, every year, keep compounding on top of one another, making the law difficult and confusing.  that's why our forefathers had the simple style of government: so that things would run and be handled more easily and efficiently.  also, let's not forget the pressures our schools and system put on our youth, or the fact that our schools only function as well as the amount of funding they get [i.e., poor neighborhoods receive little].  you need to stop blaming homosexuality as some sort of ""megasource"" of problems and face up to the fact that there are other factors at play.  and where in our constitution does it state we're supposed to stick to these ""basic rules"" and ""idealogies"" you seem to make mention of?  you're definitely wrong, as the treaty of tripoli, specifically article 11, states that there is a separation of church and state in our government.  so you're wrong, there was no religious foundation from our nation that we're straying away from.  and even more importantly, is that religion does not equate to level of morality.  child molestation has been documented from the catholic church in this nation for well over 100 years.  and that's just one example...  you have no evidence supporting your argument, and there's plenty of evidence and strong argument against it.  stop criticizing the things you have a prejudice for, and maybe focus more on the *actual* problems contributing the downfall of our civilizations.  not everything in the world is the way you perceive it.",1,

741416,"your point? um . . . er . . . well, if you want to address it seriously, honestly: i found your response—on the surface—to be clever and well-meaning. if i wanted to be more pompous and priggish, however, i'd point out that it's only superficially clever. after all, if you live in the united states and europe, the ratio of aids among homosexuals dwarfs that of heterosexuals. (africa is a different situation, granted.) in the west, however—and i just assume you live in the west—aids is encountered at massively higher proportions among gays. in the early history of the aids epidemic, it was originally called ""gay cancer"" by the scientists researching it. and historians of the disease are unanimous about gay communities being largely responsible for the corruption of the blood supply which would later infect children, hemophiliacs, surgery patients, etc. it happened when gay activists--to demonstrate the utter normality of homosexuals--had blood drives in their communities to help the red cross. you can google the flyers from the early 1980s from san francisco, new york, etc. (the two other largest groups to have aids in the early days were iv-drug users and haitians. neither of the latter groups had mobilized blood donation programs and community outreach campaigns.) gays alone tried to do the right thing. so their hearts were in the right place. but--tragically--thousands of infected men donated blood. so, contrary to your implication, the aids mishaps which ended up killing children were not the result of straight people, nor of anti-social iv drug-users. it was largely laid at the doorstep of the gay community because statistically the infections were traced back to them--not by bigots but by the red cross and the centers for disease control. so, yes, i know--in some made-up fairytale universe--straight people have aids at equal proportions to gay people. but in this universe--i.e., the real world--aids cases in the us and europe are overwhelmingly dominated statistically by gays. so your comeback would have been clever if gay and straight lifestyles had similar disease-rates. but--past the superficial smugness--honest people admit (albeit reluctantly) that yes: aids, in the west, overwhelmingly affects the gay community more than it affects the straight host-population.",1,

946457,"imagine this product reaching the united states.  ""after three weeks of highly publicized and riveting testimony, a jury took nearly fours days to reach a verdict of acquittal in the case of a st. louis man, notoriously dubbed as the ""gotcha guy"". he had been accused of raping a woman in her south side home last summer.  a counter suit filed by the man resulted in an awarding of $6.2 million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries the man received during the course of what now appears to have been an attempt of consensual sex between himself and the woman.  jason demerest, 29, was arrested last july after being treated in a local hospital following an incident at a benton park home. officers, responding to a 911 hang-up call, discovered the man in a condition that was described during the trial as ""almost totally bathed in blood, fiercely attempting to remove an unknown device from his penis, and screaming at the top of his lungs."" a woman inside the home, the plaintiff in the criminal trial and the defendant in the civil case, was reported to have immediately accused the man of forcible rape.  mr. demerest was airlifted to a downtown hospital due to a massive loss of blood at the scene and spent several hours in surgery to remove the aforementioned device from his body. the woman was taken to a separate hospital and released several hours later.  during the trial, it was alleged by the defense attorney that mr. demerest had met the woman at a downtown tavern, and that they had consensually agreed to meet at her home for sex. the woman denied that assertion under oath. adding to the mystery was the fact that although the woman was taken to the hospital and examined as is usual in suspected rape cases, no evidence was introduced during the trial to support her testimony of having been battered and forced to submit to intercourse.  mr. demerest testified under oath that, ""everything was goin' just fine, and the bitc...um...lady over there was beggin' me to...you know...put it in....and bam!!! it was like jaws had locked down on my junk!!""  he further went on to say, ""that cun...i mean...lady starting laughin' and pointin' at me down there...like some crazy lady!!...and i looked down and saw all the blood and started screamin' and shi...uh..stuff...and she laughed even louder. i was dyin' and all she could do was laugh. i begged her to call for me some help.""   it was never determined who actually called 911. both claimed to have made the call during their testimonies from the woman's home phone.  the woman testified that she had inserted a controversial device into her vaginal cavity, aptly referred to as the ""rapex,"" upon arriving at her home on the night that the disputed events took place. she stated that she felt uncomfortable shortly after mr. demerest arrived and that she excused herself to go to the restroom to insert the protective device. the rapex is a device recently approved by the fda as a method of rape prevention and detection. the device must be methodically and surgically removed once a penis is forcibly inserted into it. the damage incurred is sudden, excruciating, and it is intended to allow a victim of rape to make a quick escape. because it must be surgically removed, it is also a useful tool, giving authorities at least some ability to track down rapists shortly after the crime. hospitals have been cooperative and immediately call local authorities whenever they encounter anyone seeking treatment to remove the devices. delays in seeking medical attention have resulted in fatalities.  during the trial, the surgeon who removed the device from mr. demerest's genitals stated that he did not consider his injuries to be an indicative of someone who would have been committing an act of rape. ""the depth to which his penis had gone inside the device was minimal, although severely damaging."" he further stated, ""if mr. demerest had actually been forcing himself on the woman, he would have achieved a much farther intrusion into the device, and would have effectively done far more damage to himself.""  the prosecution defiantly asked the surgeon if mr. demerest had been ""capable of reaching a deeper depth,"" a question that brought laughter to the packed room. the surgeon, who did not appear to be amused, replied quickly that mr. demerest was ""not erect"" at the time he was attempting to remove the device from his penis, and therefore was unable to provide a conclusive answer to the question. pressed further to describe the dimensions of mr. demerest's penis, the surgeon replied, ""the size of a flaccid penis is no indication of the size that may be achieved when it is fully engorged. and since the tip of his penis was literally destroyed at the time, i can testify that it was not in any state to be inflated, if you will pardon me, for an assessment of that nature.""  some may recall the furor that ensued in many of the local online forums after the nightly news aired last thursday, when a courtroom camera panned to the female plaintiff as mr. demerest was on the stand that day, catching what appeared to be her laughing at the testimony he was offering when describing the horror he went through on the night in question. her attorney was seen pushing her head down onto the table until she seemed to have composed herself. the jury was also noted staring at the woman as well. some of them appeared to be amused at the attorney's reaction, while others appeared to be shocked.  upon leaving court today, mr. demerest offered a brief statement and then was quickly whisked off to a waiting car by his attorney.   ""i don't know if i will ever see any of that money, but one thing i know...if the doctors can fix me back up, i ain't gonna be chasing no more barflies from now on, that's for sure. and another thing...i'm gonna let my fingers do the walkin' first from now on!!!""",0,

do the yankees put some hex on first year players?  it means we've been down this road before where the yankees sign big name guys and everybody jumps out of their seats swearing the yanks will win all 162 games and they end up missing the playoffs because these big name guys fail to perform at the same level. i believe i've provided documented proof of this.  &gt;look at teams like the 1928 yankees, 1975-1976 reds or any other team with a boat load of stars... they seemed to have got along and won just fine. using the 2008 tigers as reason to state why the 2009 yankees will fail is weak.  i'm not just using the 2008 tigers. i'm using the recent yankee teams as well to explain that there appears to be a phenomenon where teams that are projected to be dominant on paper end up coming up well short at the end of the season.  &gt;the yankees had one of the best bullpens in the mlb. you use era to explain your point (in the comments section of the blog post), but using era to evaluate a reliever is ineffective. a reliever does not throw enough innings to offset one bad performance. plus, if a reliever comes in the middle of an inning and lets all the inherited runners score, then he did not do his job. the catch here... that relievers era will not be effected, the pitcher who he replaced will have a higher era.  just think about that ""overcoming a bad outing"" statement for a min. what is a ""bad outing"" for a reliver? giving up 2 or 3 runs in an outing? you're saying a reliever can't overcome that? dominant relievers can overcome a ""bad outing"" by pitching another 8 scoreless outings, which isn't all that hard for good major league relievers. and that's if he gives up 2 or 3 runs every 9 outings. if he gives up 1 run, he need only pitch 2 straight scoreless outings before giving up a run to be considered a ""good"" reliever. just what is your example of an era-damaging outing for a ""very good"" reliever?  you seem to be basing the bulk of your argument on the yanks bullpen. i never said they were downright horrible or even incapable of putting together a nice year in 2009. my main point was that they're unproven (just like you say the rays are...and you can't have it both ways).  you have to take into account that those bullpen stats you're giving are taking into account two of the more dominant relief pitchers in the game last season in joba and rivera. i never mentioned any concern with rivera other than mentioning he's going to be 39 next season. in fact, if you remove rivera and joba from those stats, the yanks bullpen era jumps to 4.29 which would be good for 24th in the majors last year. i'm not talking about the bullpen as a whole necessarily...just rivera's unproven help.  &gt;5, 6 and 7 are all very weak, so i'm not going to entertain them.  ha! even if i leave the pressure of the bronx alone, your boy joe sheehan wrote a lot more on how age and injuries played a huge role in the demise of the 2008 yanks.....so how is that weak when they're all going to be a year older next season? not to mention burnett's injury history.  &gt;replacing abreu with nady or swisher was solid, in terms of defense. abreu was terrible in the of. replacing giambi w/teixeira or swisher is a tremendous upgrade offensively and defensively. i can go into the numbers if you would like, but maybe this can be your hw assignment.  nady was already with the yanks for a good chunk of the season last year. he can't entirely be placed in the discussion of replacing abreu when they played together for the last 2 months of the season. swisher is mainly the guy that replaces abreu's production.  again, not saying that on paper that they didn't do a decent job in replacing these guys, but even if teixeira and swisher play well (and that's a big if in the bronx), it's not gong to be as great of an improvement as people think. abreu and giambi both averaged over .800 opss and 6.0 rc/27 which are desirable seasons.  &gt;replacing pettitte and mussina w/younger and better pitchers such as cc and aj is a win for the yankees. pettitte had an awful 2nd half of the season (he's traditionally been a strong 2nd half pitcher, so somethings amiss), so he won't be missed as a front line starter. the yanks have a potential rotation of:  aj at his best is a comparable pitcher to mussina. wang coming back is a boost, and even if cc pitches like he did in cleveland last year, the yanks will definitely have a improved rotation. my main point: it may not be as improved as people think.  &gt;tampa bay rays - ever hear of the 2007 colorado rockies? in all fairness, the rays are a good team, but i want to see them do it again to really believe in them.  the rockies weren't even close to the rays. they only won 90 games in a horrible nl west division that the 08 rays probably would have won 100 in. their pitching staff was nowhere near the 08 rays....no one even had a sub-4.00 era.  you seem to want it both ways where you want to bring up stats about how great the yanks were last season, but ignore how good the rays were. you want to base the rays future performance off of how the rockies turned out, but ignore the past of how the big name acquisitions the yanks have made have dropped in performance their first year in the bronx.  &gt;rob neyer, joe sheehan (or anyone else from bp) know their shit. i suggest reading articles from bp, hardball times, etc. to get a better understanding of the game. a lot of the points your tried to make are just nonsense and typical of the crap that is spewed on espn or other main stream media outlets. there is a lot of good stuff out there, do some research and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  you're all over the place, kid. you bring up rob neyer (who is well-known for being wrong about stuff time and time again....including calling for the braves' demise every year since like 2002) and then you knock espn....are you unaware that rob neyer works for espn? you're the kind of guy that would eat up what i wrote if it came from joe sheehan. seems like you have a man crush on the guy or something.  deal with what i wrote and try to refute it...don't deal with who i am or who i'm not. if i say something ridiculous, then talk about it.  i even ended my article by saying ""i’m not saying that it’s out of the question for the yankees to go all the way in 2009, but there are a lot of factors against that happening that people are overlooking just because the yankees are throwing money out there again."" i'm not ridiculous enough to say that it's impossible for them to go all the way. i just wanted to make a point to say there are a lot of factors people are overlooking that they have to overcome in order for them to do it.",0,
425707,"so you're saying that because the law currently denies gays privileges open to straight people, they don't deserve the right to change the law because there's less of them than of straight people?    'cause that's a less sugarcoated version of what you said.  and are you really so naieve as to believe the law is *always* right?  if so, we can quit now.  that law used to deem black people as lesser because their genes paint them a funny colour.  homosexuality has been shown to be just as involuntary as race is, i fail to see how you can claim it's not nice to discriminate against blacks because their stigma (race) is involuntary, but with gays it's fine 'cause their stigma (homsexuality) is involu-  waaaaaait.  *neither* has a choice in what they turn out as.    this has, as far as i understand, nothing to do with ""sexual practices"" and everything with sexual *orientation*.  none of the things that homosexuals do with each other are illegal, or at least, prosecuted, for straights.  many straight couples engage in fellatio, cunnilingus, and sodomy and have a lot of fun.    if ""how humans reproduce"" is your argument against homosexual unions and their sexual *practices*, you must also be against any woman who has passed menopause having sex, post-vasectomy men are barred too, infertile couples aren't allowed any sex, and no one is allowed any oral.  ever.  if you're against homosexual *unions* for the same reasons, well, none of the first three there are allowed to get married.  even heterosexually, because they are incapable of reproduction.",1,
642863,"&gt;flamboyant, obnoxious fuckers for whom their homosexuality defines them as a person  i agree that overly flamboyant can be annoying, but i take offense at your implication that only the overly flamboyant types allow themselves to be defined by their homosexuality.  i'm _very_ straight acting - i grew up in the southern and midwestern united states, where ""manly"" traits are highly valued.  i drink beer, i watch football (i don't love it, but meh), and i work on a military installation every day.  as far as anyone who doesn't know me is concerned, i'm as straight as they come.  however, i'm also largely defined by my homosexuality; not because i _want_ to be defined by that trait, _per se_, but because that is how society defines me.  there's the old joke- if a man builds a thousand bridges, he's a bridgebuilder.  if he builds a thousands bridges and sucks one cock, he's a cocksucker.  my sexuality defines who i am reasonably capable of falling in love with, and it determines who i get along with the best (i.e. other people who share my interests or understand me).  my sexuality determines the implicit societal roles into which i am placed.  i have less rights than a heterosexual- purely because of my sexuality, and so it determines what i can and can't legally do.  this also means it drives my advocacy- i feel the desire to participate in certain activities (like protests) because i feel a bond with a minority group who shares the same trials and tribulations that i do.  if i want to meet a guy, i may go to a ""gay"" event (around here we have buddyball- gay volleyball, and yes, it's roughly as hilarious as it sounds).  i may not meet my soul mate, but i can certainly make friends.  these friends will link me into other friends, and so my social group is determined (in part), essentially, by my sexuality.  further, i feel the freedom to admit i like certain things; as a trivial example, i enjoy broadway musicals (i know, not cliche _at all_).  heterosexuals may also enjoy musicals, and some of them may even admit it- but others will not, because they feel pressured into disliking them by societal norms.  i, lacking that pressure, will admit this like, and therefore meet other people who share it- statistically these people are more likely to be like me, and thus gay.  if a straight guy says he likes britney spears, someone may comment that he's, ""weird"" or ""dude, wtf?""  and move on.  if i comment that i like britney spears, the first comment is always the same, ""ahh ... cuz you're gay.""  society chooses to define my role because of my sexuality, and i _could_ attempt to reject that role (some do), but in the end i can fight as much as i want, but society is defined by the majority- by the people who set the ""norms.""  so my sexuality, even if against my will, places me into situations, roles, and scenarios that heterosexuals may not have to deal with.  once again, as a trivial example, since gays can often be seen as effeminate, faggy, or worth less than heterosexuals, i had a boyfriend who was beaten and placed into a coma for a few days.  i experienced emotions and dealt with prejudices that affected my state of mind at that time, and that continue to affect my perspective.  all because of my sexuality.  so i find it insulting to have a heterosexual imply that it is somehow wrong or annoying to be defined by sexuality, when he employs reasoning that lies within a hetero-normative framework from which we have been ejected purely because of our sexuality.    we have been separated from the rest of society in a thousand implicit and explicit ways because of a single trait, and to imply that to then identify this trait as a major factor in the formation of our character is wrong is clearly ridiculous.  tl;dr- heterosexuality defines major traits in the majority of people, but the prevalence of this trait makes it to ""normal"" to notice.  yet conversely, homosexuals who are partially defined by their sexuality are, ""annoying"" even though the defining is often done by society, and not that homosexual.  this situation is ridiculous.",1,1

i'm sorry, that was rude, i'll take it back.  no, they shouldn't be allowed to marry because incest harms the children born of it. as for the gender part... yeah, you're trying to get into the whole ""homosexuality isn't natural"" issue and yes, yes it is. plenty of animals engage in homosexual sex.   **yeah. chronic homosexualism was not the cause, but the symptom of a collapsing society.**     you know that for sure?

140880,"you talk about human nature and development, but then promptly ignore it.  i wanted to exclude the children debate from the marriage conversation entirely for one simple reason: it doesn't matter.  homosexuals will have children regardless of whether or not they are married.  it may be a little harder for them to adopt without a marriage certificate, but that's it.  they can still get pregnant/impregnate.  they may be able to adopt depending on their state's law.  so regardless of what the law states about marriage in the usa, homosexuals will have children.    which is why it isn't important in the question of marriage.  it's moot, it'll happen regardless.    &gt;homosexuals have the same rights, just not the same tastes.    that's absurd.  if you look at it that way, then we're talking about sexism.  every woman is allowed to marry a man, but it is illegal for a woman to marry a woman.  every man is allowed to marry a woman, but it is illegal for a man to marry a man.  if that's the way you want to look at it, then the law is sexist.  a man should have the same rights as a woman, and vice versa.  if you want to look at it the way the gay community looks at it, it's that heterosexuals can marry whomever they love (some restrictions apply) while homosexuals cannot.  which is discrimination.  either way you want to look at it, it's wrong.    &gt;obviously gay activists don't care much about polygamists and to be frank they care little about anyone else and even their own community.    that's hyperbole and downright offensive.  we are talking about the gays for gay marriage camp here, not any of the other gays for ___ groups.  and yes, there is a lot of them.  it isn't the gay activists for marriage group's responsibility to fill other roles, any more than it's peta's place to feed the hungry, stop global warming or bring capitalism to korea.  different groups have different focuses.  you cannot hang the problems of an entire community on this one group.     &gt;is the biggest problem for homosexuals that so far people refuse to take marching orders from a tiny percentage of people about what words like marriage mean?    multiple groups means multiple points of focus.  just because gay marriage is getting media doesn't mean there aren't gay groups out there doing good and working hard.       &gt;the drug abuse rate, hiv/aids-- maybe the activists should work within their community to address these self-inflicted wounds that have in turn hurt people all over the world...    wrong group.    &gt;heterosexuals will be even more willing to pretend that sodomy and intercourse aren't much different.     you are hung up on the sex part of things for some strange reason.  what about the lesbians?  no sodomy, no intercourse (without toys or digits).  what about old gay men that can't get it up?  have no sex drive?  they aren't having intercourse or sodomy or fellatio or whatever else you want to think about.  they are just as gay as the party boys.  leave the sex out of it, that's not what's important. it's about wanting to be with someone you are attracted to, which happens to be of your gender.  period.    &gt;i wouldn't use that word, but rather simply call it objectively disordered-- in biological terms it is maladaptive    except it's persistent, isn't it?  and it exists within the animal world as well.  you'd think something maladaptive would have been bred out by now.  meanwhile, there are a number of studies which show that in pack and tribal groups, having non-reproducing (which, in the wild, they would be non-reproducing) males and females helps increase pack socializing.  helps the entire tribe, as it were.  some men stay at home to raise children.  some women go out hunting.  it's a part of the tribal dynamic.  and it has been studied to death.      &gt;i also think it's too simplistic to pretend that there are two immutable categories of people: homo and hetero.    it's called the kinsey scale.  black and white terms are used in conversation, but really it's a spectrum with most people falling between the extremes.  but it isn't like gay men are running around avoiding their feelings for women.  if one identifies as gay, it's likely that they have no sexual interest in the opposing gender.  and there will be no ""channeling"" of these non-harmful appetites.  that's just cruel.    &gt;nobody in america forces homosexuals to be promiscuous...    why is this comment in a marriage discussion?     to answer your side question about *why* homosexual males (specifically) are promiscuous, since you seem to be interested, you need to take two large points into consideration.  first, we're talking about men, all filled to the brim with testosterone.  if straight men could have frequent sex, they would.  that's how most of the jokes go, right?  women act like the brakes when it comes to sex?  men are designed to have sex with as many people as possible, as frequently as possible.  that's our biological imperative.  spread the seed.  he who has the most partners, has the most offspring.  originally.  so that's one part of it.   the second part *is* the fault of ""america"", or rather, society.  when did you start dating?  12?  13?  as late as 15?  how were the relationships back then?  chaotic?  shifting?  short-lived?  dramatic?  everyone trying to figure things out?  then you got older and by your 20s, relationships were less childish.  longer, better.  most homosexuals do not date in their teens.  they are busy feeling alone and repressed and scared of their peers and their social status.  so they wait until they leave high school to *start* dating.  that puts them almost 10 years behind.  is it any wonder that in relationships, gays in their 20's act like heteros in their teens?  who is surprised by this?    so biological imperative meets delayed relationship building skills.  that's where homosexual promiscuity comes from.  which isn't related to the legality of marriage in any way, shape or form.    so we've removed ""children"" from the equation, unless you have a strong counterpoint.   we've removed sex from the equation, as i have no idea why it was even there.   we've illustrated that either preventing gay marriage is sexism or sexual orientation discrimination, whichever thrills you more.   and we've tackled the whole biology nonsense (which again has no part in a marriage discussion).    what's left?",1,

684007,"that's a fair question. mostly i meet girls through friends or online or occasionally in gay bars, but i'll get back to that. i think the ""gay community"" is a somewhat fuzzy term. but rather than try to define it, i'll just tell you about myself...  for example, i don't attend gay pride parades. i respect them as a form of protest in countries where homosexuals are persecuted, but i don't support them as a form of celebration. even though the point of them, some will say, is to show off the diversity in the gay community, but i don't think it ever really works out that way, quite the opposite actually. i think it ends up looking like a circus and what most heterosexual people will remember is drag queens and dykes on bikes. i would avoid gay bars altogether if i could, but it's the easiest way to meet people and once in a while it's nice to be somewhere where you don't have to wonder who's homosexual and who's not. but i don't go very often because to me the ideal situation is not a separate community at all, to me the ideal is integration into 'normal' society. i don't like to to segregate myself. i will go out the most when i move to a new place, but i feel like i kind of use the gay scene. i mean, once i meet some people, i start to meet girls through friends, go to more private parties and just generally find a life that suits me. also, after meeting more homosexual people, i'm much better at recognizing the small signals straight-looking girls put out, so i'm able to sometimes meet people just out in the 'normal' world. and if i'm in a relationship i'll hardly go out on the gay scene at all unless my partner drags me. i've become more tolerant over time, but when i first started trying to meet other gay girls, i avoided everyone that represented the lesbian stereotypes i so disliked... and, to my surprise, i found that there were many more girls who didn't fit the stereotypes than i ever expected.   i don't think that going to a gay bar/cafe/club once in a while to meet people makes you a member of the gay community. i think a sports bar is a good comparison. a guy might go to a sports bar to be around people that support the same team he does or just to be around people who appreciate a sport, but that doesn't suddenly make him a jock or a obsessed fan. it doesn't define who he is. it just makes him a guy who likes sports. being in a gay bar generally means someone is homosexual, but it doesn't mean they are flying a rainbow flag. i don't mean to sound like bars are the only option but, like in the straight world, they are just the most obvious one. i also meet girls online, but that's pretty much like meeting anyone else online. i don't live in the us, so unfortunately, i can't recommend particular sites. all i know is that craigslist doesn't sound like the place to go.   since you are a guy, it's worth mentioning that among homosexual men there is a whole subculture of masculine men who only like other masculine men. they keyword is generally ""straight-acting"". and i don't think they usually consider themselves part of the gay community at all, quite the opposite. since i'm not a guy and no expert, i won't say too much about it. but if you google around a bit you can probably find more info.   in conclusion to this overly long post, don't assume you know too much about what homosexual men are like until you meet a whole lot more of them. the diversity among homosexuals is as great as any other group of people. there will be plenty of guys you don't like, but don't you sometimes put up with people you don't really like in the 'normal' world? it's no different. except of course that you have a much better chance to find some love in your life.",1,1

722385,"&gt; fine, but our current legal structure is set up so that marriage is encouraged, in that it is legally advantageous to be married. taxes etc. there's no legal advantage to fucking a random dude from vegas in the ass (that i'm aware of)  if marriage is rewarded through tax breaks and so forth, why are people waiting until they're older to do it, getting divorced more often, and so forth?  i think that other social and personal factors greatly outweigh these supposed benefits to marriage.  gay guys aren't getting married for tax breaks, they're getting married because they want to live in a committed relationship and have what they believe to be a normal family.  the concept of commitment is very important in any relationship, gay or straight.  &gt; that doesn't mean it's evolutionarily advantageous, though.   the majority of ""homosexual"" men are actually bisexual.  men, unlike women, do not suffer a significant biological risk from sexual intercourse (excluding disease, injury, etc) -- women, on the other hand, may carry a child for nine months and be committed to its care for nearly twenty years.  men are thus more prone to be willing to have sexual intercourse on a given occasion than women, as the biological risk is lower.  bisexual men are able to find mates earlier in life than heterosexual men, and thus combine the benefits of an older man (greater experience and expertise and understanding of relationships) with the benefits of a younger man (attractiveness, health, virility).  this is born out in studies, which show that bisexual men, even men with strong preferences for men as sexual partners, have many more female sexual partners throughout their lives than straight men do.  women are a slightly different story; again, the majority of non-heterosexual women are bisexual.  bisexual women tend to be bisexual for a phase of their lives (""college"") and then ""become"" straight.  but again, bisexuality has some interesting biological effects.  bisexual women tend to have larger numbers of male partners than straight women and have children at an earlier age but have fewer children overall.  iirc (this is the only part i don't remember for sure), these children tend to be healthier than the average.  this comes from the books i've read on evolutionary biology (*sperm wars*, *the red queen*, etc) and my sociology class on relationships i took a couple years back, as well as my mother's human sexuality textbook from about thirty years ago that i read as a kid.  i didn't make it up for the lulz, in other words.  &gt; i agree that sexual preference is not a choice. however, behavior is a choice - if you read on you'll see that my problem is not with homosexuality per se, but with our current public celebration of homosexuality.  behavior is not really all that much up to choice.  ever known someone who has really struggled to quit smoking?  (i did, just two months ago)  i'm fairly sure that ted haggard would rather not have been caught soliciting gay prostitutes.  and, really, pedophiles have to be aware that they're not very popular.  the problem with sexual preference, addiction, and things like that is that they're pretty goddamned powerful.  the sexual compulsion is extremely strong, strong enough to beat almost everything else.  addiction is brutal too -- perfectly nice people go and get addicted to crack or an opiate and will kill you for drug money five years later.  that's why those of us with good sense don't use crack or opiates... but sexual preference is not a choice.  wouldn't it be really upsetting to be born a normal, healthy, happy kid... but really like other boys instead of girls?  not that you necessarily find girls icky or anything, but they just aren't what makes your heart flutter?  and be told that you cannot have a meaningful, long-term, formalized commitment that is recognized legally because of *other people's* thoughts about your lifestyle?  i personally think that sounds absolutely horrible, which is why i stay out of the way of gay people.  i also don't see the current situation as anything approaching a ""public celebration.""  maybe it is in san francisco, but as you're aware the city is viewed as a mecca for homosexuals because of the level of tolerance there.  in las vegas, it's not spoken about.  in ohio, where i lived for six years, i only met one person who said ""btw i'm bi,"" even though i had to have met hundreds of homosexuals.  in new mexico, where i lived basically my entire sentient life until 2003, you could get stabbed to death for calling someone a *maricon* or a *puto*, and there was no such thing as a public discussion of homosexuality.  i'm sorry -- i just don't see it.  just like i don't see this massive victimization of christians by atheists that is supposedly going on everywhere.  if there is a public celebration of homosexuality or the final triumph of atheism, i'm certainly not aware of it.  &gt; this is a good point - incest would probably not become acceptable even if it were legal. at the same time, your vision of a society where social order is maintained by taboo seems to be at odds with your belief that people should be able to do whatever they want if they're not directly harming anyone else. see the bottom of my post for more about this. and no, i don't have a sister, and i wouldn't pork her if i did.  i don't believe that the social order is or should be maintained by taboo.  i just mean that our individual personal preferences aren't going to change because something becomes legally acceptable.    holy shit this is too long",1,

617864,"homosexuality is defined as an ""abomination"" and ""unnatural"" at several points in the nt (romans 1 towards the end talks about it). jesus does not single out homosexuality, but he has strong words against lust at many different points. a big part of it is that sex is seen as something sacred, a mystery, that is wonderful when preformed in the context of a marriage. so, as for the hatred, let's simplify the categories of opinions [american] christians could have about homosexuality:   1. ""god hates fags""/""kill them"" these people argue from a standpoint of a wrathful god that will judge and destroy nations for immorality (a la sodom &amp; gomorrah) and would probably not disagree if accused of advocating theocracy. at least some of them are trolls.   2. ""homosexuals suffer from a serious moral and psychological disorder/send them to camps to turn them straight."" far right christianity. these people are a bit better intentioned than no. 1 and from this category one can actually find someone who cares about a homosexual person (not that all of them do). there are ""former homosexuals"" in this category.   3. ""homosexuals are sinners like the rest of us, but the activity is offensive and they must abstain from it if they wish to be christians"" right win christianity. this is probably the position of most of the evangelicals i know (here in alabama).   4. ""homosexuals are sinners like the rest of us, the activity is a sin and they should take special effort to avoid it, but they can be christians as easily as the rest of us."" main-line christianity as far as i can tell   5. ""homosexuals are sinners like the rest of us, the activity is as sinful as heterosexual sex, they can be homosexually active and still be good church members."" left wing christianity, most episcopalians i know   6. ""sexual activity is not a sin."" far left christianity.   the two extreme ends are considered crazy by the middle, as far as i can tell. i know a guy who would fit under #3 but would not vote against gay marriage, simply because he believes that gay marriage is a civil matter and his church wouldn't have to recognize or preform one. so anyway, #1 and #6 both contradict scriptural teaching (about loving people on the one hand, and about homosexuality being a sin on the other), #2 is misinformed about the nature of homosexuality, and the rest are basically sane on one-level-or-another (thus not crazy enough to be worth paying attention to).   anyway, asking why christians hate this or that group of people means that you are probably dealing with a group of people who didn't take jesus saying ""love your neighbor"" or ""love your enemy"" very seriously. i don't reject the religion because some jackasses claim it, i'm just sort of on the fence between it and stoicism.",1,1

364555,"freshman year i had two really awful roommates. the other two i'm pretty neutral on.  **1st roomate**: randomly assigned. he and like half the dorm became a tight group, but somehow i did not. (i can only think that this is because i actually made efforts to interact with people not from the dorm--in hindsight, most friendsgroups at my college are strongly based on who was in your dorm during l&amp;t, a quasi-academic orientation freshman get put through in august.)  so anyways this would not have bothered me too much except for two things. first was that i had class friday mornings while nobody else did (my roommate had class on friday at like 2 pm). so they acted like i was some sort of insufferable asshole when i'd ask them to keep it down on thursday nights--and what was worse they'd insist on going to the room next to my room when i wanted to go to sleep, and my bed was against the shared wall, and the walls were paper thin.  the other problem was that my room somehow became the primary hangout room (via my roommate of course). so whenever i'd come home from class, there was a very good chance that was my door was ajar, and that people would be shuffling around my room, sitting on my bed (at least once i found someone passed out on my bed), etc. i just had no fucking private space and it drove me nuts.  to make matters worse i was basically viewed with total disrespect through all this. one time i was in my room, alone, listening to music, when my roommate and the whole group comes back. they turn on their own music without asking if i minded, and then someone who didn't even live in the room declared, ""omg, i can't handle having two different musics playing,"" and without even asking if i minded listening to their music for a while, came over to shut off my music.  i could go on but this sums up my bad experiences with them. i moved out when i came back from thanksgiving break.  **2nd roommate**: this one had to withdraw from school for the semester (it turned out being the rest of the year) a week after i moved in. he had been fine as a roommate though. i got the room to myself for the rest of december (i think because it wasn't clear if he was coming back or not) and part of the beginning of the spring. i had to spend december living with his stuff which was kind of creepy, but hey a dingle's a dingle.  he did scare the shit out of me when he came by one random day at the end of december, but as it happened i was oversleeping so he inadvertently did me a favor by scaring me awake.  **3rd roommate**: roommate from hell. i was presented a list of people who wanted to move out of their dorms for whatever reason, and told that i'd be given the courtesy of selecting one of them, but that if i didn't pick any of them they'd just give me someone. i wound up picking this gay (yes his sexuality is relevant) guy who seemed like he would be a good roommate. he wanted to move in because he was gay and involved in the qsa, and the pc (ra at most schools i think) who was a lesbian and head of the qsa lived two doors over.  before he moved in i mentioned to him a few things like, because the room was not actually big enough for all the furniture, would he mind lofting his bed--i really didn't want to loft mine, and made it clear that he didn't have to if he didn't want to. but he agreed.  at some point i asked him if he could stop getting buck naked without giving me some kind of warning and this is when shit starting going downhill. he started raving about how i was ""repressing his sexuality"" or some shit.   he started trying to strongarm me out of the room too (which i'd just recently let him move into!). he prominently left out his rough rider condoms and lube (probably to try to make me uncomfortable), but the single worst thing he would do is stay up until like 3 am doing his homework, and he seemed to particularly do it when i had class at 8:30 am. he made no attempt to be respectful about my schedule: he would walk in and out letting the door slam, he would type extremely loudly, etc. one time i offered to let him take my laptop out in the common room and he refused.  eventually after enough times of getting woken up i flipped a shit and started screaming at him. apparently they could hear what i was saying in the common room. it was inelegant but it did get him to leave, there was no way i was leaving the room after i let him move in in the first place.  but not before he started going on about shit like how i made him loft the bed! and of course he made a big fucking production of moving out the night before one of my 8:30 am classes as one last fuck you to me. i straight up told him, look, can i let you in to get the shit you don't need tomorrow, i really need to get to sleep. but no, this was ""absolutely the only time he had"". yeah fucking right.  it's also kind of hard to not feel like he was basically discriminating against me on some level, as he was one of those super-militant ""breeders are evil"" homosexuals; one time he had a draft of a paper lying on his desk, and it was basically about why heterosexual white men (i fit all three of those) are responsible for all the evil in the world.  **4th roommate**: i had the dingle again for a few weeks. then a guy a friend of mine knew wanted to move in--he seemed like he'd be fine because he was fleeing a noisy and disrespectful roommate. so he moves in, and his girlfriend makes his bed for him. now his girlfriend was going to china (it turned out she didn't, but they didn't find this out until later) so he spent literally five weeks sleeping at her room--the bed was still made from the day he moved in. i do think we would have been fine as a roommate if he'd actually slept in the room, but as it stands it worked out well, he mostly came by to shower in the morning and do some work, and he'd come in in the morning to shower at like 8. as i told him, ""if you wake me up when you're coming in to shower you're probably doing me a favor because i should already be up.""  thankfully i managed to get singles the other three years of college.",1,

832780,"to address a few general themes:   &gt; because we aren't on the street waiving gay pride flags we all of a sudden don't do anything for the gay movement? we're tearing it apart? if you ask me the people dividing the gays are the feminine gays insisting everyone do things their way or they're traitors.  &gt; i do want them to stop hogging the limelight and forcing people to do things their way. somehow i'm instantly a traitor because i won't join your side and use your methods. did i miss a memo where feminine gays were instantly in completely control of how i should live my life because we share a single common trait of sticking our dicks in the same places?  &gt; the complaints that straight acting gay men are dividing the gay community ring hollow when feminine gays immediately turn around and call straight acting gay men traitors and cowards.  &gt; a lot of the reasons why people struggle with their sexuality (and i know this first hand) is because they expect gay people to be feminine. when you're not feminine and you see gay pride marches full of feminine people, and you look at the culture with the feminine guys taking the lead, you feel completely alone. where is your big happy community for these people? what are you doing for them by getting on tv and showing them that they need to be in theater, wear tight shirts, and act feminine?  who exactly is insisting that all gay people have to be feminine, or that being masculine on its own is somehow traitorous or the ""wrong way"" to be gay? again, all i'm seeing here is masculine guys criticizing feminine guys simple for who they are, as if that alone is a problem. not so much the reverse. we only criticize the masculine guys who are doing *exactly what they accuse us of doing*: insisting that it's bad to be this way and harmful to progress.  and really, have you even seen a gay pride parade? you'll find just as many gay men who are as buff and manly as any masculine heterosexual - unless you happen to ignore them because of those same stereotype-forming expectations. for that matter, what television have you been watching? if anything, gay characters have nearly always been toned down, masculinized and quite often desexualized just to make them more palatable to heterosexual audiences.  also, it's quite inconsistent that you repeatedly claim you don't want feminine gay people to change who they are, all the while blaming them for anything and everything, apparently just for existing:  &gt; feminine gays create prejudices based on their behavior.  how is this our fault instead of the people who develop poorly-informed prejudices based on incomplete knowledge? they're the ones creating prejudices, not us.  &gt; feminine guys have essentially hijacked the gay movement. gay culture consists of a plethora of different people, with different religions, etc. yet the loudest part of the equation runs the entire show. being noticeably gay has nothing to do with actually being gay. it's a trait that's been transcribed upon homosexuals because of feminine gay guys.  so we're ""ruining"" things because we're ""loud""? what is this supposed to mean other than telling us to stop standing out and blend in with everyone else?  &gt; a lot of the reasons why people struggle with their sexuality (and i know this first hand) is because they expect gay people to be feminine. when you're not feminine and you see gay pride marches full of feminine people, and you look at the culture with the feminine guys taking the lead, you feel completely alone.  so are you suggesting that, instead, *we're* the ones who don't belong? because our presence might give people the wrong impression?  &gt; and feminine gay guys do absolutely nothing to support this. you say one thing and then do another.  what exactly do you expect from us? i've made it quite clear that there's nothing wrong with being masculine, and obviously you belong just as much as we do. keep in mind, we're not the ones who are treating you as as some kind of political/social liability. on that note, all of this is just disgusting:  &gt; it's progress for straight acting gay males. it just doesn't benefit everyone in the same movement, much like how i feel that letting the feminine gay males lead the movement hurts straight acting gay males.  if you think you can elevate your standing by bringing us down, and if you're actually willing to do so, you really are no better than any homophobe and have made it obvious that self-interest is a greater priority to you than any genuine concern for civil rights or equality.  &gt; they think of all sorts of things that gross them out, promiscuity, unprotected sex, unable to hold stable relationships, etc.  why would any of that be specific to feminine guys? look at any m4m personals and note the frequency of ""straight acting"", ""str8"", ""no femmes"" and so on. (honestly, why would any of that be specific to gay people in general? as if we have a monopoly on promiscuity and unsafe sex.)  &gt; if you're trying to get a baby to eat something that it doesn't want to, do you pick something that the baby thinks smells and looks bad, or something that only smells bad? assuming both have the same level of odor, of course you're going to go for the one that only smells bad.  you're missing the point: it *shouldn't have to be a bad thing.* the entire point is to move beyond that misconception. why is this something that ""looks bad""? to say that you don't blame us for these problems, when we're the ones who apparently ""look bad"" or something, is completely inconsistent. you can't eat your cake and have it too.  &gt; they won't admit their errors. if everyone wasn't so idioticially pushing for gay marriage in the 2004 election, the constitutional ban wouldn't have been such a rallying cry to the religious right. yet i hear nothing from the gay movement about how they helped get bush elected and we got what? gay marriage in iowa and a few civil unions?  news flash: we're not the ones who created the religious right as a political force. you are actually blaming people who are pushing for their rights, for having their rights denied, because they *dared* to ask for equal treatment under the law. are you kidding? you really think that's *our* fault, and not the people who considered the mere possibility of our legal equality to be so dangerous, it was cause for political action? talk about blaming the victim. yes, if only we never asked for the equality we're legally entitled to, the hateful majority that chose to deny us our rights would just hand them right over without a fuss! what world are you living in? as long as you consider the widespread prejudice against us to be our fault, and as long as you view fighting for our rights as ""idiotic"", i really can't believe you have any meaningful interest in our equality. that's the impression i get when you talk about ""the gay movement"", as if you're not a part of it, as if it's something to be criticized. what have you done lately?  &gt; no, but it's a start. are you going to argue that blacks in this country have it worse than they did 50 years ago? fyi we have a mixed race president right now. the method of the gay movement is going to do nothing but polarize those who like gays and those who don't. you need to slowly ease people into (and i use this term loosely) ""new"" cultures. black people eased themselves into more and more acceptance with leaders like mlk jr. they didn't gain acceptance with people like xzibit and snoop dogg.  if people were encouraging prejudice against you for their own benefit, would you call that ""a start"", too? try to put yourself in the place of the people you want to throw in front of a bus. as i've explained, the attitude to fight against is the idea that anything feminine is bad. how does that ""polarize"" anyone when we're fighting exactly that which you consider to be so polarizing? we're trying to make it no longer polarizing. why is it that encouraging the acceptance of feminine gay people rather than ostracizing them doesn't qualify as a way to ""slowly ease people into new cultures"" to you?  and for the record, there was no xzibit or snoop dogg in the 1900s when black men were regularly lynched. just like there was no liberace when gay people were being executed throughout most of the past two millennia. your blame is entirely misplaced.  finally, it's (again) really inconsistent of you to try and dismiss any connection at all between feminine people and gay people, while at the same time blaming all those feminine gay people for nearly everything. obviously, there are plenty of gay people who are also feminine. for some gay people, there is that connection there, and for others there isn't. i don't see why it should be a problem to acknowledge this. i don't think there's anything wrong with it, whether you're feminine or not. you, on the other hand, seem to treat femininity like a contaminant, something to be dissassociated from gay people as much as possible. see, we're not the ones trying to push you out. we're simply asking that you not push us out.  &gt; which is exactly why straight acting males blame feminine gays for their problems.  you're blaming us for people's misgeneralizations and biases? yeah, it's obviously our fault that people mistakenly believe things that aren't true due to their own inaccurate preconceptions. what would you have us do instead? i'm seriously curious now.  oh, and this just had to be either misunderstanding or dishonesty:  &gt; they aren't rubbing any sexuality in anyone's faces. i don't know how you came to the conclusion that the opposite magically applies to the other side of the argument. logic doesn't work that way.  if being perceived as gay means ""rubbing"" your sexuality ""in people's faces"", why doesn't being perceived as straight also imply rubbing that sexuality in people's faces? that's a clear double standard.",1,
600607,"wow, that guy's blog is just one big pile o' dumb.  &gt; as a result, we have now been told by a hyperactive federal judge that students who engage in sexually abnormal practices have a first amendment right to bring their sexually abnormal dates to a high school dance, and there's not a thing schools can do about it.  irrelevant; normality has never been a prerequisite to equal protection, and homosexuality is quite obviously normal anyway, so the use of terms like 'abnormality' is intended only to stigmatize.  &gt; the school's policy is just good common sense, and in alignment with the understanding of gender that has undergirded civil society from time immemorial, ever since god created mankind ""male and female,"" according to genesis 1:27.  mythology is not reality, he seems unable to tell the difference. homophobia is not a pillar of civilization.  &gt; further, the school retained the right to establish certain appropriate dress code policies for dance attendees.  there's a difference between allowing nobody to wear a tux, and specifically forbidding some people from wearing a tux while allowing others. that's what discrimination is.  &gt; judge davidson said the school violated ms. mcmillen's right to free speech. this is utterly absurd. ms. mcmillen has been talking non-stop to anybody who will listen, and the school has made no effort of any kind to stop her from doing so.  non-sequitur. the act of forbidding her from attending prom with her girlfriend and then cancelling the prom was the violation of her rights.  &gt; ""speech,"" after all, is ""speech,"" not behavior or conduct.  no, behavior and conduct are included under the interpretation of freedom of speech.  &gt; you will look in vain for any mention of proms, tuxedos, or sexual orientation in the federal constitution.  such specific freedoms do not need to be explicitly enumerated in the constitution as they are already covered generally.  &gt; the aclu, now empowered to push every school in the nation around, will now go after school after school and pressure them to normalize homosexual behavior, using senior proms as their battering ram.  ""homosexual behavior"" is normal and a consistent and enduring feature of human society.  &gt; that ultimately is what this is about: forcing schools to treat non-normative sexuality as it if were the moral equivalent of normative sexuality  that's because it is. there is no valid moral objection to homosexuality, nor any reason why it should be considered more ethically troubling than heterosexuality.  &gt; and at the same time shredding what remains of the judeo-christian value system on which this nation was built.  maybe some of us don't particularly care for a value system rooted in fantasy that supports discrimination.  &gt; the same policy - if you want to bring a date, the date must be of the opposite sex - applied to every student in the school. there wasn't one rule for ms. mcmillen and a different rule for everybody else. if she wanted to bring a date, she could, on the same basis as every other student in the school. you can't get any fairer and more equal than that.  a rule that is specifically intended to exclude same-sex couples, thus treating them differently from opposite-sex couples, is not 'equal' at all. requiring that gay students negate their sexual orientation by bringing an opposite-sex date in order to attend the prom means treating them unequally.  bringing a man or a woman to the prom is clearly not an issue -- this is obviously allowed. it only becomes an issue when a gay student does it. this clarifies that such a rule is targeted at gay and lesbian students. after all, what need would there be to impose such a rule upon heterosexuals? it's not going to affect them. it will affect lgbt students.  &gt; what this makes clear is that the aclu is not after after equal rights for homosexuals - they want special rights. ms. mcmillen already had equal rights, but that was not good enough for the tyrants at the aclu.  so, they only want gay students to be allowed to bring someone of the same sex to the prom, and nobody else would be allowed to? that's certainly not what they were fighting for. so what makes that a 'special' right? why is it a 'special right' when it comes to the rights of gay people, but not to the rights of straight people? it's likely portrayed as such due to the historical prevalence of discrimination against gay people and the relative novelty of the concept of gay equality. in essence, he's really just appealing to a history of heterosexual supremacism for the sake of perpetuating that supremacism.  &gt; the aclu claims to be pro-choice. but apparently that only applies if you make choices of which they approve.  more irrelevance. ""pro-choice"" does not mean ""supports the choice to violate people's rights"".  &gt; the aclu can't stop lecturing us about the evils of imposing our values on other people. yet here they are, gleefully forcing their values down the throat of an entire school district, aided and abetted by a federal judge. who is forcing their values on whom here?  intervening to stop discrimination is qualitatively different from 'forcing their values' on anyone. values that oppose discrimination are not the same thing as values that support discrimination. not all values are equal. he may as well complain that intervening to stop a genocide is 'imposing our values' on the people committing genocide. the principle would be the same.  &gt; after all, this country belongs to the people, not the thugs at the aclu. and it's time we told them so.  'the people' do not have the freedom to violate the rights of individuals. courts serve the necessary and valuable purpose of preventing this.  the real question is, why are right-wing religious extremists completely unable to construct anything approaching a valid argument without resorting to the most obvious fallacies, willful ignorance, and rhetorical hatemongering? i think that says a lot about their position.",1,

788234,"this has a lot to do with the understanding that the culture has for alternative sexual orientations. there is a [serious lack of exposure for bisexuals in the media](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/nobisexuals) so most of the public doesn't acknowledge it or in some cases aren't aware that they exists.   this is similar to how gays were perceived about 60-70 years ago. most people didn't have a concept of what a homosexual was or who this person was suppose to be. when gays started coming out and getting mainstream attention there was this sudden surge of interest from the general public, both bad and good (but mostly bad). the acknowledgment that there were people that only preferred the same sex was a bit new to the general public. the concept of homosexuality and the creation of the gay stereotype actually had a [huge cultural impact on how heterosexual males view themselves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks2my1fn_a4). this of course was helped with a lot of misinformation and a lot of overwhelming backlash from the more conservative groups in the country. the aids epidemic during the eighties didn't help the perception of homosexuality either.  in fact, it created a lot of negative stereotypes that were easy to apply to gays and reenforced by the media that was constantly reminding everyone that this was a problem that was affecting mostly gays. so overall for most of the later half of the twentieth century gays didn't have a lot going for them in terms of good public perception and the one major characteristic that set them apart from heterosexuals was fact that they had sex with members of the same sex. the culture hadn't and still doesn't widely accept that a heterosexual can have casual sexual experimentation with someone of the same sex and still be considered heterosexual. so any sexual act performed by a heterosexual that is perceived as exclusively homosexual instantly labels that person gay by most people. this is more true for men than women.   i believe that once gays and lesbians are able to achieve wide mainstream acceptance and understanding it'll be easier for bisexuals to build some 'cred' so to speak. until then most people will rely on what they know and understand about alternative sexual orientations, ""what is gay is gay and what straight is straight and bisexuality is some weird fling they heard about in college once.""  as for the “positive gay stereotypes,” this is just a side effect of public recognition of gays in the media. for example, when writers for a sitcom want to include a gay character and they want the audience to know that this character is gay without them having to spell it every episode, they tend to give this character very flamboyant roles for men and very butch roles for women. it's easier for the writing staff to make gay and gender related jokes associated with his character because the audience immediately understands that this character is gay. it's great that gays are getting a positive spotlight in the media but this technique has sort of warped the audience's perception of how a gay man or woman should act. i've witnessed this sort of gender swapping between gays and lesbians to be a source of frustration among even the reddit community. i constantly read threads about people that are annoyed by the fact that most people don't take their sexual orientation seriously because they don't fit the stereotype that many have seen in movies and television. this is also a problem that i see disappearing as well when there is a better understanding among the public about gays, lesbians, and of course bisexuals (eventually).  sorry for the wall of text and i hope it makes some sense and maybe answers some of your questions. also i am no expert and all this is based on my untrained observations.",1,

 is the woman who can't produce eggs supposed to suppress her desires to marry and have sex?  why should she miss out on other meaningful human experiences just because offspring isn't possible?  i don't think you believe that way about humans with physical differences...but you certainly do when it comes to mental differences.  my only [baptist] option is to subject myself to ""therapy"" that leads to depression and suicide, and after months or years, when i still don't have an attraction to women, if i haven't yet killed myself, i can choose to either pretend to be attracted to and marry some unfortunate woman who will never know what its like to have a husband sexually attracted to her, (which also happens all the time in your faith) or spend the rest of my life alone, begging god to bring an end to my sexual desires, because [your] god doesn't approve of me being attracted to and loving a man, despite the fact that i never did anything to become this way.  what a sad choice.  again, i feel sorry for gay men who share your faith.  so many of them have already killed themselves or entered into fake marriages.  some have hated themselves enough to mutilate their own genitals because of what your church teaches.  even steven black, the man counseling ""hundreds"" of gay men in oklahoma, admitted right there in the room with you and me that he was still sexually attracted to men and that most of his ""patients"" never fully get over their desires.   &gt;&gt;&gt; it's not a tiny piece of scripture that the liberal side of christianity teaches was misinterpreted. it runs throughout scripture with such purpose &amp; is such a fundamental piece of the fabric of our existence that it is very much a fundamental issue.&lt;&lt;&lt;  there are only 4 (some argue 5) places in the entire bible that address homosexuality.  all 5 places are very controversial.  hundreds of bible scholars have disagreed with the southern baptist's interpretation.  but you don't have to take my word for it.  here's how daniel a. helminiak, a christian author and biblical scholar with 2 ph.d.'s addresses all 5 ""clobber passages.""  you and your pastor may disagree with his and many other theologians' interpretations, but you have to agree the issue isn't as black and white as your southern baptist church would have everyone believe and that there is a lot of room for debate, as with any doctrinal issue that has split the christian church into countless christian faith practices. -----------------------------------------------------------      *   the story of sodom in genesis 19 is about offense against the sacred duty of hospitality. that is how ezekiel 16:48-49 and wisdom 9:13-14 interpret this text. the attempted male rape only heightens the atrocity of this offense.     * leviticus 18:22 does forbid male-male sex as an ""abomination."" but the word simply means an impurity or a religious taboo — like eating pork. as in the case of catholics who used to be forbidden under pain of mortal sin to eat meat on friday, the offense was not in the act itself but in the betrayal of one's religion. the ancient jews were to avoid practices common among the unclean gentiles.     * romans 1:27 mentions men having relations with men. but the terms used to describe them are ""dishonorable"" and ""shameless."" these refer deliberately to social disapproval, not to ethical condemnation. moreover, according to paul's usage, different from the prevalent stoic philosophy of the day, para physin (""unnatural"") would best be translated ""atypical"" or ""beyond the ordinary."" so it bears no reference to natural law. and it can imply no ethical condemnation because in romans 11:24 god is said to act para physin. paul sees gay sex as an impurity (see rm. 1:24), just like uncircumcision or eating forbidden foods. he mentions it to make the main point of his letter, that purity requirements of the jewish law are not relevant in christ jesus. see l. william countryman, dirt, greed, and sex.     * 1 corinthians 6:9-10 and 1 timothy 1:8-10 list arsenokoitai among those who will be excluded from the reign of god. this obscure term has been translated ""homosexuals"" but its exact meaning is debated. it certainly does not include women but only some kind of male sexual offenders. if it does refer to men having sex with men — which is dubious — it must be interpreted in light of the abuse and licentiousness commonly associated with male-male sex in the roman empire. see robin scroggs, the new testament and homosexuality.     * finally, genesis 1-3 shows adam and eve created for mutual companionship and procreation. these accounts use the most standard of human relationships to teach a religious lesson. the point is the love and wisdom of god, who made all things good and wills us no evil. nothing suggests the biblical authors intended a lesson on sexual orientation. ----------------------------------------------------------",1,

194522,"this deserves to be the most upvoted comment.  i have a lot of gay friends and from what i've witnessed, the ""gay accent"" is very real. even men who were in the closet when i first met them had it. i don't think it is all an act like the op is suggesting. i think it's rooted in biology.  ny magazine published a really interesting article a while ago called [the science of gaydar](http://nymag.com/news/features/33520/). it was pretty illuminating. some biological differences: gay men are more likely to have a counterclockwise hair pattern on their scalp. gay men and lesbians have about a 50 percent greater chance of being left-handed or ambidextrous than straight men or women. they have different digit lengths ratios and fingerprint patterns than their straight counterparts. and so on.  there's also [an interesting (although controversial) study about the gay accent](http://boingboing.net/2004/10/13/gay-accent.html).  &gt;vowel production in gay, lesbian, bisexual (glb), and heterosexual speakers was examined. differences in the acoustic characteristics of vowels were found as a function of sexual orientation. lesbian and bisexual women produced less fronted /u/ and /[open aye]/ than heterosexual women. gay men produced a more expanded vowel space than heterosexual men. however, the vowels of glb speakers were not generally shifted toward vowel patterns typical of the opposite sex. these results are inconsistent with the conjecture that innate biological factors have a broadly feminizing influence on the speech of gay men and a broadly masculinizing influence on the speech of lesbian/bisexual women. they are consistent with the idea that innate biological factors influence glb speech patterns indirectly by causing selective adoption of certain speech patterns characteristic of the opposite sex.   oh, and i have a theory about another biological indicator for gay men. it partially explains ""gay face."" i've noticed women are much more likely to have eyes that slant upward from the inner to the outer corner. men's eyes are much more likely to slant downward -- unless, of course, they belong to an ethnic group where *everyone's* eyes go upward. but compared to straight men, gay men are more likely to have eyes that slant upward.   just to test myself, i just picked three gay singers off the top of my head (adam lambert, rufus wainwright, and elton john) and all looked up their picture. all three had upward slanting eyes. obviously, not at all scientific, but i think it is worth examining.",1,
152169,"migraine is a neurochemical problem, not a nutritional problem, and dietary modification hasn't proven to be helpful for migraine patients.  **fruits and vegetables**  of course everybody should eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. but eating plenty of fruits and vegetables won't likely decrease your headaches. having said that, it is true that some fruits and vegetables contain substances that could theoretically influence headache:  * cruciferous vegetables (vegetables in the genus brassica: cabbage, red cabbage, broccoli, broccoli sprouts, turnip, rape, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, kohlrabi, chard, kale, bok choy, radish, horseradish, daikon, mizuna, tatsoi, collard greens, mustard greens, rutabaga, and watercress) contain indole-3-carbinole, a chemical that accelerates caffeine metabolism, so may promote caffeine withdrawal and thereby promote migraine.  * vegetables in the genus allium, including onions and garlic, may promote migraine by increasing the concentration of extracellular adenosine.  * grape juice. the linked article says, ""grape juices can help you heal your migraine problem,"" but it may be grape juice could make headaches more frequent. a scientific study in which grape juice was accidentally substituted for grapefruit juice serendipitously revealed that grape juice increases the activity of the enzyme phenacetin o-dealkylase. that means grape juice likely increases the rate of caffeine metabolism and may thereby promote caffeine withdrawal and therefore migraine. if so, that might explain why so many people report that wine, more than other alcoholic drinks, seems to promote their migraines.   * grapefruit may slow caffeine catabolism so may make caffeine withdrawal headache less likely to occur, and thereby protect against primary headache. grapefruit has not, however, been demonstrated to decrease headache frequency. naringin had been thought to be the active ingredient in grapefruit that slows caffeine catabolism, but a recent study casts doubt on that.         * apiaceous vegetables such as carrots and celery slow caffeine metabolism, so may make caffeine withdrawal less likely and thereby decrease migraine frequency. apiaceous vegetables have not, however, been demonstrated to decrease migraine frequency.   **tea**  the linked article says, ""in some cases, ingesting caffeine can cure your headache. but too much of caffeine consumption can do the opposite.""  tea isn't really a food, but, leaving aside the question of whether it's a food or not, the reason tea relieves migraines is that tea contains drugs: theophylline and caffeine. the theophylline and caffeine in tea relieve headache by reversing caffeine withdrawal.  the ability of tea to both promote and relieve headaches is a seeming paradox but is readily explained by the mechanism of addiction and withdrawal. the reason tea is both headache cause and headache medicine is that tea contains addictive drugs. tea both causes and relieves migraine for the same reason heroin both causes and relieves heroin withdrawal symptoms.  **peppermint, passionflower, ginger**  these may have some effect on migraine, good or bad, though this has never, to my knowledge, been demonstrated scientifically.",0,

443508,"i have a pet theory of sexuality.  it's got problems, but it's how explain the world and my own fetishes (i seem to collect them and later trade a few in for new ones on occasion).  according to my theories, there are different ways someone can be sexually aroused and as an individual you can actually try out the different ways and thus, get a new fetish...    the short story is that there are different 'concentrations' of how we masturbate that are based not on our sexuality, but on other factors.  let's just assume there is a general 'queerness' where gender doesn't actually matter at all as long as our own cultural (and in-born sexual) disgust doesn't get in the way.  the concentrations could be about 'power' roles (sub-dom, hardcore porn), being genuine (amateur porn), or just about re-imagining physical pleasure (most other porn).  there is also 'emotional closeness', but i can't really find porn of that.  those 3 above are the main types and encompass many sub-categories.  (i'm unsure where inter-racial porn goes and midget porn, but i'm sticking to what i know.)  power roles are the easiest to explain because it is the biggest 'fetish' out there.  bdsm is mostly about a feeling power or about feeling like your being protected.  there could be other words that describe the feelings, but i prefer those words.  bdsm sometimes takes a route where it can genderfuck you.  for straight men, it could feel powerful/dominating for them to fuck [another 'man' who looks very much like a female](http://www.trannytube.com/media/6915/nancy/) regardless of their actual sexuality.    i can't masturbate to a man and a woman kissing because my disgust gets in the way, but two females is particularly great for a reason.  within most lesbian kisses is a purity without domination/power (at least, to me a male) as well as some (good) amateur porn.  it's true passion (or at least more true than it's alternatives).  i think it's porn based on feeling something from the interaction of 'real' participants.   i was wondering if you like lesbian porn because culturally we don't allow males to have sexuality without 'aggressiveness' (domination).  the ones who aren't aggressive and dominating are on reddit or other forums who whine about being nice guys.  the moment a male figures out he has to be dominant (in a 'politically polite' way) - it's easy street as far as sex is concerned.  for many men, it seems to be natural because they are encouraged to go grab life by the horns, but for others who 'think too much'  it's something that has to picked apart and figured out (and feminist/sexuality studies help a ton as long as you realize 'domination' is not on/off but a gray area).  but domination is ugly in our culture.  other guys can see them as the jerks because we can tell it's actually part of their personality and not part of a facade that a lot guys put on.  women aren't as aggressive partly because they can't be 'a whore' (i think that's changing though), but also because they have to go through the same facade if they want to be (or have to be) the aggressor.  (i remember reading a post on reddit about girl who was disappointed with his 'dipshit' boyfriend of 2 years who wouldn't touch her as much as she wanted.  i bet he would be up for it if she showed some sexual aggression.)   in short, modern western culture has a few artifacts about how males should act and how females shouldn't act (and their 'purity) that is skewing everyone towards lesbians as a masturbatory tool (because women are accepted as sexual pure and 'sexual' in a way a man cannot be).  i've met a few gay guys who like lesbian porn - some other gay guys were completely flabbergasted at that (closeted heterosexuals :)  i believe they were called).  i don't think we have the cultural ideas (memes?) necessary to understand sexuality as a society.  fuck.  we can't even get people to acknowledge gays as people with the same rights.",1,

940814,"it's exactly what *maran* is saying above.   you can describe a sex act as homosexual or gay, just as the op does in the title of this thread: ""i'm a guy who just had gay sex."" he just told us that he's male and had gay sex, so we infer that he had a sexual encounter with another male person. or as you said: ""if you have sex with someone of the same gender it is a homosexual act"".   sexual orientation, though, isn't just the sum total of all sexual experiences you've ever had. you don't necessarily come up with a laundry list of everyone you've ever messed around with and conclude from their genders that you're straight, or gay, or bi. some people certainly *do:* if you're a guy who has only ever desired women, and only ever been with women, then you might look up your mental laundry list of previous partners and think, yeah, the conclusion fits: i'm straight. you know what you find desirable and appealing, and your experiences confirm that inclination; it seems like a simple equation. but for a lot of people, sexual orientation is not a simple equation. this is why so many people in this iama are shitting all over the original poster, because he wrote in the title that he is straight and then described having sex with a guy, and the idea that a guy can have sex with another guy and still call himself straight does not mesh with this idea that you tally up your sexual experiences and then conclude which way you swing. if you subscribe to this model, it seems like op is cheating or doing something wrong; he's breaking the rules.  the reality is that orientation is a lot more complicated, and it certainly isn't completely determined by the experiences you have accumulated. i would argue orientation is also influenced by more abstract concepts like desire, i.e. the experiences you *want* to have, but haven't yet seen through -- maybe for lack of opportunity, because it feels risky, and so on. it also gets more complicated when you put less stock in the gender binary; you might have had a variety of sexual experiences with people of many genders, and therefore the end total at the end of your ""laundry list"" isn't a clear indicator like ""you are into women"".   furthermore, people always have a subjective consideration of their own experiences. in the op's case, he talks about his stable relationship with his girlfriend; they've been together for a while, they love each other, he's really attracted to her, and they have great sex. she ranks really high up on his scale of sexy people with whom he's had important experiences. later on in this thread he describes his encounter with this guy and says he enjoyed it, but he says that he generally isn't attracted to men and the male physique doesn't really turn him on: ""that shit just doesn't do anything for me"" [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/ehggb/ima_straight_guy_in_a_committed_relationship_who/c185oqb). he's saying that his attraction to his girlfriend *and to women in general* is a much more important part of how he views his sexual identity. we all do this; we subjectively consider what we've had, what we want, and *what is important to us* (which is key). we come to our own conclusions about 'what we are' based on our analysis of what we value most. **and this is how you get terms like straight-identified or gay-identified.** these terms circumvent the idea that an orientation like ""straight"" is necessarily rigid and immutable by acknowledging that ""being straight"" is something you take on 'because it fits you'. you aren't ""straight"" because of some kind of reductivist equation whereby a(your gender) + b(the gender of the people you've had sex with) = this rigid category of straightness, but because you have constructed your own narrative of who you are, what you want, and what fits you.  the op of this thread is a straight-identified man who just had sex with a man.  the issue of terminology is really interesting to me. you must be aware of [the kinsey scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinsey_scale), which posits that sexual identity can be fluid and puts forth the idea that sexual orientations like 'heterosexual' or 'homosexual' are not mutually exclusive categories. i would argue that the kinsey scale is an unnecessarily linear model, but it at least introduced a *modicum* of flexibility at the time, which was a big step in the late 1940s!   until pretty recently, all sexual acts that didn't fit in the narrow and prescriptive concept of ""normal"" were considered homosexual. consider that sodomy means 'unnatural sex' and can refer to things like oral and anal sex *between men and women* -- it can be a heterosexual sex act that's being described. [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sodomy) not too long ago, it wasn't considered gay to get your dick sucked -- it was only gay to suck dick. then came a big shift in social consciousness where it was possible to be a gay top. do you see what i'm saying? these categories are very fluid. and consider the lgbtqia, etc. acronym and [all its variants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbtqi#variants) -- a list which just seems to be getting longer and longer. terms like [men who have sex with men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/men_who_have_sex_with_men) (msm) and [women who have sex with women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women_who_have_sex_with_women) (wsw) are often used in medical literature to, for example, study the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases in populations whose behaviors are not necessarily congruent with their professed identities. the terms msm and wsw try to sidestep the issue of what you *say* you are/are not by focusing on what you actually *do.*  lastly, i want to say that all the people yelling at op for refusing to call himself gay are underlining the sad truth of how male sexuality is considered. dan savage elucidates this in his extremely funny video, which [i am just going to leave here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks2my1fn_a4), but basically it goes like this: there are plenty of girls who mess around with girls they know and end up liking to fuck men, and having serious relationships with men, and rarely do people tell them that they can't *legitimately* call themselves straight. more often, as dan says in the video, ""straight guys marry them and say, 'oh, you ate pussy in college. cool. tell me more!'"" go to a frat party and observe girls making out with other girls for the benefit of a male audience, and then ask yourself why guys in a similarly macho and hypermasculine setting aren't being exhorted to hook up with other guys? this narrow, restrictive and shitty version of sexual orientations is what happens when you privilege a reductivist view that says you are defined by the things you have done, and nothing else. and it's made extra shitty when you toss in some revulsion to gay sex acts (because you could only ever get fucked in the ass if you're *gay,* right?). it's lame as hell.  and that's where i get that concept from.",1,

554200,"warning: wall of words.  skip to the critique of the indivudual arguments if you care to; you won't miss anything vital to my post.  thank you asterixisfly for doing this, and for explaining these arguments clearly. i am passionately devoted to the right for homosexuals to marry and enjoy the same benefits as hetero married couples. i am extremely curious about what the hell is going on in the heads and hearts of ant-gay activists, politicians, and policies.  your arguments didn't demonstrate to me a logical secular argument against gay marriage, but that wasn't your attempt, was it?  these are example faulty arguments you've come across, right?  i was really hoping they would have at least one or two ""wow"" points, so i could at least *maybe* see where the other side is coming from while continuing to vehemently disagree with them anyway.  i can't wait to see if what you disagree with about these points meshes with mine.  anyway, here's my reaction to those arguments.  **the natural law argument**  if the sole purpose of human procreation was to conceive, people would only have sex every few months or years, as many times as it takes to make a baby or three.  and sure, some people do that. but we don't all behave that way.  in fact i'd say a majority of us don't behave that way, not in this highly sexed culture and generation.  we have lots of sex because it's fun and it feels good *by nature*, and most times when we do it babies couldn't be further from our minds.  and it's not lady gaga or mainstream culture telling us sex feels good, as if we needed to be taught that.  virgins will find out sooner or later, and the rest of us already know. we simply do not have the same inherent mating rituals that lions, and tigers, and bears have.    **the kantian argument**  ""the law is needed to promote good behavior and good outcomes; to legalize gay marriage would be to promote a horrible outcome, and a perversion of the purpose of law.""    the ""horrible outcome"", being, as i interpreted it, the end of the human race because everyone would suddenly go gay and *nobody would procreate anymore ever again.*  the question is not ""what if everybody did it?""  because that's simply not an option.  heterosexuals would not immediately throw away their heterosexuality and marry a same-sex partner just because gay marriage was legalized.  i like men.  whether not not gay marriage is available to me does not change my desire to have sex with, marry, and raise children with a man.  but i would like my brother to have the right to desire and achieve the same goals i have: to have sex with, marry, and raise children with a man.  **the utilitarian argument**  ""legalizing gay marriage would give legitimization to gay culture. and that will in turn weight our overall culture to the pursuit of pointless pleasure seeking.""  every culture has its sluts and saints, gay culture included.  heterosexual culture included.  and we already live in a hedonistic culture, even though it may still be somewhat cloaked in a veil puritanism.  we are already in pursuit of pointless pleasure seeking, gay or straight.  almost everybody likes sex, and so we try to have it as often as we can and feel comfortable with.  go to a hoppin' bar or nightclub on a saturday night and i guarantee you a majority of the people are there for the same thing: to get laid. gay people like sex. straight people like sex.  promiscuity is not unique to ""gay culture.""  have you ever watched jersey shore?  or anything on tv for that matter?  sex is not just everywhere, it's entertainment!  **group right and democracy**  and finally, the last argument just didn't work for me any way i looked at it.  for one, no, you cannot just as easily argue that americans have the right to travel to morocco for a luxury casino vacation.  marriage is not a vacation, and i don't see how anyone could compare the two at all. marriage is not as frivolous as that (though i acknowledge the divorce rate indicates that some americans may have just that attitude.)  we're talking about giving same sex couples the right to hold each others' hands in the icu as one of them slips away from life.  and that's just one example, but a heartbreaking one.  yes, it's true that the government is not obligated to grant every petition brought before the king.  but that final argument boils down to *we'll never make everyone happy about everything, so let's just give up on that endeavor entirely, starting with homosexuals.*    then what if the government started just saying fuck it all, we give up, we tried, we failed.  forget health care, forget diplomatic foreign policy, forget improving education, etc.  it's tooo harrrrd.  well done.  that was an amazingly thought-provoking post and i thank you for it.  if you ever hear any other secular conservative anti-gay ideology, please share!",1,

""sexual attraction, behavior and identity may be incongruent. for example, sexual attraction and/or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity. some individuals may identify themselves as homosexual or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual. further, sexual orientation falls along a continuum. in other words, someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime-different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual.""[15]",1,

253892,"lots of facts matter.  &gt;if it was meant to be part of nature (evolution) then two men or two women could have babies.  shouldn't you look at the evidence first, and then hypothesize what nature is trying to do? one major goal of life is indeed to procreate, yes, and so heterosexuality can easily be explained. but because the existence of homosexuality is a scientific fact we need an additional theory. scientists haven't yet determined what factors cause certain humans to be sexually aroused by the same gender, be it genetic or environmental or both. they also haven't come up with any convincing reason for it, but this doesn't mean homosexuality doesn't exist.  numerous studies and observations have confirmed or make use of the existence of homosexuality; i don't know of any that claim it is just ""a social construct"".  for example, the sexual responses of people of different sexual orientations can now be measured in an mri machine. one study i've read tests the response to different kinds of pornography. the results were obvious: straight men had the strongest sexual response to straight porn (even more than to lesbian porn on average, interestingly) while the gays responded most strongly to gay porn.  another famous study tweaked a gene in male fruit flies and indeed seemed to turn them gay: they formed long sexual chains as adults. this isn't to say the same method works in other species, and as for humans the results raise moral questions.  &gt;the evidence of 'homosexual' tendencies in nature have always been in the context of procreation.  which ones? i can't think of any examples myself.  &gt;pedophiles and rapists  okay, what does a rapist do?--&gt; engages in a sexual act with an unwilling partner. what are the results?--&gt; the unwilling partner usually feels a mix a very strong negative emotions toward his or herself, the rapist, and society.  what does a pedophile do?--&gt; engages in a sexual act with a willing or unwilling young person. results?--&gt; this depends on the age i would suppose, but for very young people at least (pre-puberty) the results are often emotionally and psychologically scarring, similar to and worse than rape at older ages.  what does a homosexual do?--&gt; has consensual sexual intercourse with a willing partner. results?--&gt; the partners experience mutual pleasure, with a risk of disease in many cases.  what do heterosexuals do?--&gt; same as homosexuals. results?--&gt; same as homosexuals, with an added risk/reward of conception. (note according to my psychology book: 90% of sexual acts are performed for pleasure, not procreation)  which of these two don't belong? rape and pedophilia are despicable acts which create victims and have long lasting negative effects. normal heterosexuality and homosexuality, however, are often beneficial for all parties involved.  the sexual urge is immense in humans and to repress that is dangerous to the individual--think of the rate of depression in gays, all the unfortunate gay suicides (tchaikovsky was one of them, terrified of being outed), and the torn-apart marriages based on falsehoods.  in addition, there can be drawbacks in societies that don't accept gays. the example i'm thinking of is the aids epidemic in america, which was worsened because the government and society kept quiet on the issue. raised awareness and truthfulness would have saved thousands of lives. unnecessary death, the unchecked spread of the disease (which spread into and is still prevalent in the straight population), and the high cost of medical bills were the societal costs. after the government intervened, the spread of the disease started to ebb.  can you think of any negative effects to societies or people that accept gays? can you think of anyone who would be harmed if homosexuality was universally legal and acceptable? i truly can't.",1,

527090,"&gt;or are you recommending that heterosexual people be required to include homosexual characters in their novels in order to be ""fair""? what about eskimos? i find a great lack of eskimos in novels, specially in scifi. also, i am upset at the small representation of pygmies in literature and the arts.  oh god, not a valid parallel! i already discounted ethnicities from the argument because we are divided by ethnic and geographic bounds. if you write a novel set in philadelphia, you'd be unrealistic to include a tribe of eskimos or pygmies. but you'd also be unrealistic to not have any black characters, at least in the background or supporting cast, because philly is a heavily black city. it's not racist to forget them, but it is bad world building.  the same thing goes for gays. it isn't homophobic to forget them, but it's *bad world building*, because no matter where it's set, people will always be gay. there is no setting where no gay or bisexual people exist. it isn't about being fair, it's about being realistic. it's not like race, where yeah, one in six people in the world is chinese--but most of them live *in china*. there's no gay country where most of the gays are. although, in that respect, urban stories should have more lgbt characters in them, because there are more lgbt characters there. my point is that the sexuality minority is a minority that exists everywhere, no matter where you're set, but it is not represented.   *especially* with bisexuality. you see gay characters now and again, but when do you *ever* see bisexuals? torchwood is revolutionary in that regard. even in buffy, even though willow was very much in love with both xander and oz, and obviously had been quite into men, once she went for tara, all of a sudden she was a lesbian, ew no men, not a bisexual. the complete lack of bisexuals is even more ridiculous than a lack of gays, because there are more of them. science just keeps proving that a majority of women are bisexual to some extent, so why are no fictional women bisexual?  i also hate that gay writers are supposed to write gay storylines, or that only gay writers must write gay storylines. if a girl can write a male character, a straight writer can write a non-heterosexual love story, and vice versa. it's a ridiculous excuse to claim that because most authors are straight, they couldn't or shouldn't have gay and bisexual characters in their work. i'm a white redheaded female author, but hey, my plays and novels have characters unlike myself in them. what a concept.  i don't want to ensure equality of results. i don't think the issue is about homophobia. anyone who would make a stupid protest like this is, indeed, a jackass. but that doesn't mean there isn't a point that writers seem to forget there are a lot of gay and bisexual people out there, and that if they want their world to be really real, they should remember to include a non-straight character once in a while. a world where everyone is straight is just slightly less silly as the fanfiction worlds where everyone is gay.",1,

543361,"&gt;replacing blanket prejudice against gay people with a different prejudice against gay people who are judged to be insufficiently masculine is not progress.  it's progress for straight acting gay males. it just doesn't benefit everyone in the same movement, much like how i feel that letting the feminine gay males lead the movement hurts straight acting gay males. feminine gays create prejudices based on their behavior.  &gt;no, it isn't. such a comparison is deceptive, because ""black gangster culture"" immediately brings up all kinds of associations  to a homophobic person, it's the same. they think of all sorts of things that gross them out, promiscuity, unprotected sex, unable to hold stable relationships, etc. of course it's not true across all of gay culture, but to the people who hate gays it's no different than the people who hate blacks. unsurprisingly you'll find that racism and homophobia go hand in hand. but regardless, you'll find that to a homophobic person that mentioning homosexuality will immediately bring up all kinds of (untrue) associations.   &gt;when you imply that we should change who we are in order to appease these prejudices, you make it seem like those prejudices  i want sexuality disassociated with mannerisms. i'm not asking for all feminine gay guys to stop being feminine. i'm not asking anything of them at all. i don't care for them and i won't date them, but i'm not going to stop them from living how they want to live or being who they want to be. i do, however, have a problem with feminine gay guys hogging the spotlight and forcing people to join their warpath.  &gt;do you think this is helping anything, when minorities confirm for bigoted majorities that their bigotry and discrimination is actually right?  no, but it's a start. are you going to argue that blacks in this country have it worse than they did 50 years ago? fyi we have a mixed race president right now. the method of the gay movement is going to do nothing but polarize those who like gays and those who don't. you need to slowly ease people into (and i use this term loosely) ""new"" cultures. black people eased themselves into more and more acceptance with leaders like mlk jr. they didn't gain acceptance with people like xzibit and snoop dogg.  &gt;so, are heterosexual guys and masculine gay guys (also known as ""straight-acting"") similarly rubbing their (perceived) heterosexuality in our faces?  they aren't rubbing any sexuality in anyone's faces. i don't know how you came to the conclusion that the opposite magically applies to the other side of the argument. logic doesn't work that way.  &gt;if being visibly gay equates to ""rubbing their gayness in their faces"", being visibly not-gay should imply just the opposite, no?  it doesn't. being vocal about being an atheist doesn't rub theism in people's faces.  &gt;so of course someone who's noticeably gay instead of noticeably straight is going to stand out - even when they've done nothing more than the equivalent of ""acting masculine""! this is not their fault just for being different.  there are feminine straight guys. this is what bothers me. feminine guys have essentially hijacked the gay movement. gay culture consists of a plethora of different people, with different religions, etc. yet the loudest part of the equation runs the entire show. being noticeably gay has nothing to do with actually being gay. it's a trait that's been transcribed upon homosexuals because of feminine gay guys.   because we aren't on the street waiving gay pride flags we all of a sudden don't do anything for the gay movement? we're tearing it apart? if you ask me the people dividing the gays are the feminine gays insisting everyone do things their way or they're traitors.  &gt;masculine gay men do sometimes look down on feminine gay men (as essentially your entire post demonstrates), even to the extent of blaming them for anti-gay prejudice and ""making gay people look bad"".  i don't entirely blame them for the problems we face. however, to me it's simply another layer of acceptance people will have to take on. not only do they have to deal with different sexual practices, but they have to deal with different mannerisms as well. if you're trying to get a baby to eat something that it doesn't want to, do you pick something that the baby thinks smells and looks bad, or something that only smells bad? assuming both have the same level of odor, of course you're going to go for the one that only smells bad.  &gt;feminine gay men are not putting on an act any more than masculine gay men are. that's just how some people are, the same way as some people are masculine.  again, i don't want people to change. i do want them to stop hogging the limelight and forcing people to do things their way. somehow i'm instantly a traitor because i won't join your side and use your methods. did i miss a memo where feminine gays were instantly in completely control of how i should live my life because we share a single common trait of sticking our dicks in the same places?  &gt;homophobes will treat you like a faggot no matter how straight you act. (kind of like how you dismissed that guy as an ""angry flamer"". think about what you're doing here.)  baseless and opinion.  &gt;this is not all about you. the complaints that feminine gay men are making you look bad ring hollow when you immediately turn around and belittle feminine gay men.  the complaints that straight acting gay men are dividing the gay community ring hollow when feminine gays immediately turn around and call straight acting gay men traitors and cowards. they won't admit their errors. if everyone wasn't so idioticially pushing for gay marriage in the 2004 election, the constitutional ban wouldn't have been such a rallying cry to the religious right. yet i hear nothing from the gay movement about how they helped get bush elected and we got what? gay marriage in iowa and a few civil unions?   &gt;how can you even claim to be interested in progress and acceptance for gay people if you actually believe it's a problem to simply be recognized for who we are?  because i disassociated homosexuality and behavior. you still seem to have them associated. last i checked we were ""we"" because we both liked to fuck people of the same sex, not because of the way we act. i want acceptance to the point where i can walk down the street and hold my boyfriends hand. i want that for every gay person. as for gay pride and feminine behavior, i could care less. that's their problem. i'm not here to help the gay furries with their furdom acceptance. why aren't you doing anything to help the gay furries out? why aren't you helping the gay quadrapelegics?  &gt;the problem is that being recognizably gay is for some reason seen as a bad thing.  being ""recognizably gay"" doesn't actually mean you're gay. look at metrosexuals. look at straight cross dressers. being gay and behaving a certain way have absolutely **nothing** to do with each other. and yet thanks to people who think they do and should, people like me are placed in situations when you come out and people go ""what? no way i had no idea"" people shouldn't equate mannerisms with sexuality, and yet they do. no matter how you act, no one should be surprised that you're gay.  gee, i wonder why they all do?  &gt;why is that? don't you think the prejudice at work is what needs to change, rather than its victims?  i think that the association of being feminine making you gay needs to be broken. i don't know if you feminine gays realize it, but there are lots of straight acting gay guys who feel completely left out because they don't fit into the gay scene and aren't feminine. you're completely isolating an entire group of people because you tell them they have to be like you and accept you, or else they're traitors. i'm sick and tired of it. a lot of the reasons why people struggle with their sexuality (and i know this first hand) is because they expect gay people to be feminine. when you're not feminine and you see gay pride marches full of feminine people, and you look at the culture with the feminine guys taking the lead, you feel completely alone. where is your big happy community for these people? what are you doing for them by getting on tv and showing them that they need to be in theater, wear tight shirts, and act feminine?  &gt;basically, if people already have their own idea of what gay people are like (like the stereotype of feminine gay men), then they're only going to recognize the gay people who match that pattern, while missing all of those who don't.  which is exactly why straight acting males blame feminine gays for their problems.  &gt;but you don't have to be demeaning to feminine gay people in order to do this. obviously not all gay people are feminine, but not all of them are masculine, either.  as i said in the original post, if it wasn't for this video, i wouldn't have even bothered to be demeaning to feminine gays. yet somehow i'm responsible for responding? because someone felt the need to rant on youtube and it struck a chord with me? yet by this same logic you're debating with me over my views.  &gt;we're not all one or the other and we don't have to be. the idea that all gay men are masculine would be just as absurd as the idea that all gay men are feminine.  and feminine gay guys do absolutely nothing to support this. you say one thing and then do another.",1,1

982159,"most of my friends, coworkers, random people i talk to in eastern iowa are self-described conservatives... they are smart, nice, rational, reasonable, fair people.. unlike conservatives from western iowa like rep steve king or the people who support him...  these conservatives seldom bring up gay marriage, and if they do, it's not in a ""bad"" way.   for example, a gay marriage conversation might be one (conservative) man suggesting another (openly) gay man may be ""running off"" to get married, or facing the same imminent doom via same marital problems as people in heterosexual marriages, etc.    i haven't heard (m)any of them complain about it much, or call for it to be banned.   occasionally, you may have to argue the point with them, but that is very easy, and usually only happens once.   ideally, you are in a room full of people, with lots of ""lurkers"" listening to both sides of the conversation, but not inclined to speak up. if they had weak opinions about the issue, they can listen to the debate and change their opinion without ""flip-flopping"", because nobody knows what they originally thought...   later, in a different conversation with different people, they will repeat whichever argument made more sense to them. (kinda like how a good joke gets re-told)  3 debates may go something like:  1) you ask the conservative if the state of iowa has a legitimate interest in their sex life.   the government-skeptical conservative will usually agree that they don't want ""big brother"" peeking in their bedroom window.  they may suggest that government recognition of gay marriage may lead to state-recognized polygamy, bestiality, [turtle fucking](http://mediamatters.org/research/200905120006), etc.   the comeback is to focus on ""consenting adults"" in a ""free society"".   remind them that at one time, inter-racial marriage was not legally recognized... do they oppose recognition of interracial marriage? they usually don't, because they don't want to tarnish their own reputation by being associated with racism.  2) the conservative says the definition and institution of marriage comes from god, via the bible, is a traditional church matter and not to be changed on the whim of the secular iowa supreme court.   the liberal asks if the state of iowa has a legitimate interest in monitoring and regulating other religious activities such as baptisms, christian confirmations, ex-communications, dis-fellowships, etc.   answer: no!  then why let government monitor and regulate the religious tradition of marriage?  the government-skeptical conservative will usually not support ""big brother"" meddling in (m)any church affairs, and with good reason.   conservatives may also be swayed by the idea that ""freedom of religion"" means they have to extend the same religious freedom to others as they enjoy themselves, including how each unique church chooses to deal with marriages.   if they are opposed to gay marriage, boycott them! do not perform the marriages their churches. do not attend marriages you are invited to. do not buy gifts for the couple...  but at the same time, they need to understand and accept that there *will* be churches in iowa ""exercising freedom of religion more liberally"" by performing and recognizing homosexual marriages, guests *will* be attending, and people *will* be showering couples with gifts...  3) *if* the state of iowa does have a legitimate interest in my sex life, and marriage is not necessarily just a church institution, but rather a state issue, as it relates forming legal relationships, then why is the state of iowa allowed to pick-and-choose which relationships between consenting adults are legitimate and which are not?  the conservative may be inclined to like the idea of a ""limited government"" not over-reaching, not doing the bidding of a tyrannical taliban-like majority, and not allowing some people to hide their discrimination practices behind the so-called ""rule of law"".   many of the issues gay couples complain about, like hospital visitation, inheritance, etc. are *very* legitimate issues. most reasonable conservatives would agree that if a couple has been together 50 years or even 5 years, one partner should be able to visit the other in the hospital or nursing home...  conservatives may be swayed by the idea of ""economic liberty"" being extended to recognizing that gay couples should have the same right to leverage the the benefits of their relationship as straight couples.  should two 60 year old lesbians be able to share a house? share a heat and light bill? share a bed?    why do these arguments work so well?  because in most ""debates"" are based on the participants unique worldview.   most, if not all, people don't have time to know all there is to know about any subject, much less to be able to form good opinions about the myriad of new, complex world issues that pop up in the news daily.  most people then rely on other people they consider ""experts"" to help them understand the world in layman's terms. but even the ""experts"" seldom agree, so people tend to gravitate toward the explanation or argument that makes more sense, based on their world view and their pre-conceived notions.  with mass media, the ""debate"" is usually very predictable. there is a ""right-wing version"" of the facts, the story-line, etc., and there is a ""left-wing version"" of the facts and the story-line.  in old cowboy movies, ""the good guys"" wore white hats, and ""the bad guys"" wore black hats. the real world is not so simple and convenient.   in the real world, *everyone* thinks that they (and their friends, family, etc) are ""the good guys""   and *everyone else* is ""the bad guys""... (iraq, afghanistan)  thus, you have ""sheep"" on all sides following their [confirmation-biased](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confirmation_bias) ""experts"", and parroting the same slanted talking points, the same ""framed"" questions and debates, etc.  when you get someone to talk about an issue that isn't hot in the news, that person may not have his ""mental guard up"". they may not have pre-conceived ideas about ""what is the official liberal-conservative, left-right position on this issue"".   they may be more open to new ideas, especially if you have a balanced conversation and allow them to reach their own conclusions by encouraging them to think out loud, and to focus on areas of mutual agreement.  in the debate structures laid out above, the position ""the liberal"" is taking is actually ""to the right"" of most conservatives position. this confuses them, because they are conditioned by tactics like [straw man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man) arguments to anticipate a weak argument from an obvious position.  this will make them ""think on their feet"", which most people are not accustomed to, preferring the easier path of repeating what someone else told them.  if they want to be contrarian, they will either have to go all out ""right wing-nut-job"" or ""more-moderate"" (more left). most people, in a room full of lurkers, will want to appear to be the more reasonable, moderate person...  so you get back to agreeing on things... being reasonable... being moderate...  at some point (early) in the conversation, ask the conservative if they have any relatives who are gay or lesbian, and what that relationship is to them... uncle, cousin, sister, brother, etc.   everyone has a gay relative, and they know it. when they recall memories of that person, their brain is ""pinged"" with many more memories and ideas about that person, hopefully good ones...  an indivual can empathize with another individual, but empathy decays quickly as a group grows larger.   so, by changing the focus from a ""large"" group labeled as gays, lesbians, etc. they are now thinking about an individual they know personally, have real relationship with, and see that person in a more complex way (than the gay porn they accidentally found on the internet)  if a group of women is asked about men in general, women will agree most men are dogs...  but if the women are asked about *their own* man, the women say their man is not a dog... their man is the exception to the rule...  if a group of voters is asked about politicians in general, voters will agree most politicians are bad...  but if the voters are asked about *their own* representatives, the voters will say that their representatives are not bad... their representatives are the exception to the rule...  if a conservative is asked about gays in general, he may answer... but ask him about his own gay relative...  i think down deep most modern iowa conservatives are ok with the idea of gay marriage, and are usually pre-occupied with bigger, more important issues...   they just have to hear an argument that makes sense in their world-view, and once they hear it, they may have the ""justification"" in their own minds as to why gay marriage in iowa is ok.",1,

832831,"the current semi-acceptance of lgbt lifestyles is one of at least 2 cycles of such acceptance in the 20th century. the first time, social conservatism beat out social liberalism about gay issues. check out this review of ""gay new york"" which is a record of how that happened:  historian chauncey (univ. of chicago) brilliantly maps out the complex gay world of turn-of-the-century new york city. this book's publication is timed to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the uprising at the stonewall inn, which is often hailed as the birth of the modern gay and lesbian movement. yet chauncey convincingly puts stonewall in perspective: it hardly marked the beginning of urban gay pride or nightlife. rather than languishing in obscurity and isolation, as has long been assumed, many gay male new yorkers thrived in close, often proud communities decades before the famous riots. he argues that before ww ii the boundaries between homosexual and heterosexual behavior were far looser than they were later, particularly among working-class men. gay new york reconstructs prewar gay life through police records, newspapers, oral histories, the papers of the society for the suppression of vice, diaries, medical records, and other fascinating primary texts. the material is rich and much of it startlingly revealing about prewar social mores: a state liquor authority investigator in 1939 amiably refers to a drag queen by the feminine pronoun, boasting that ``she liked us very much,'' while a musician's diaries tell of his often successful attempts at picking up uniformed policemen. this was clearly a world of permeable sexual boundaries. chauncey (co-editor, hidden from history: reclaiming the gay and lesbian past, not reviewed) is a savvy tour guide, leading us through bars, speakeasies, parks, bathhouses, streets, rooming houses, and cafeterias, always providing ample historical context and intriguing interpretive possibilities. he explores not only the mainstream culture's influence on gay urban life, but vice versa, arguing that homosexuality and heterosexuality are historically specific categories that evolved in the beginning of this century and shaped each other. chauncey has made a stunning contribution not only to gay history, but to the study of urban life, class, gender--and heterosexuality. -- copyright ©1994, kirkus associates, lp. all rights reserved.",1,

(i have had gay and straight men, and sometimes women say this to me many times.) for the longest time, i thought they were right in their thinking. then i became friends with a very inspirational woman. a very inspirational gay woman, who taught me to follow my heart and soul to whatever end and to trust my instincts. i ended up trusting myself, and we became lovers. for some reason, this seemed to be a very big deal for everybody except the two of us. most people, our fiends etc, were loving and supportive but the world at large was against us from the start. straight men seemed baffled and derisive. most straight women seemed angry and vindictive. some gay men were amused and dismissive. a small but vocal minority of gay women were hostile, defensive and basically excommunicated this woman from her own community because she was seen as a traitor to her sexuality and her gender. these external factors ultimately drove us apart. i was resentful because these people had come between me and someone i loved, and still love, dearly. they had helped to destroy the best, most fulfilling and happiest relationship i had had up until that point in my life. yet, despite all this the thing that upset me most was the hypocrisy. i learnt from this episode. i did a lot of soul searching and asked myself many hard and difficult questions. the kind of questions that any gay/queer person knows all to well, the only difference being that i was not gay. after a time and a lot of heartache and heartbreak i learnt to only listen to myself, to be who i was meant to be and not what others want me to be. i learnt to be the happiest human being i could be by sharing my love with those that i want to, those that i love and care for and those that are of a like mind. being dishonest to your self, especially for the spurious reasons of conformity and not wanting to upset people simply by being yourself, is the greatest of sins. be true to your own sense of integrity. “why gay women?” that is a question i am asked all the time and i do not mind answering it anymore. i was raised by strong, powerful, intelligent women who knew their own minds and knew who they were and who they wanted to be. these women were beholden to their own principles and their own integrity. i learnt this at my mothers knee and i continued to learn this from all the amazing women, gay or straight, that i have had the pleasure to meet and commune with. these are traits that are not unique to gay women but that are more prevalent simply because of how society treats people who are not “normal” or subvert the status quo. also, i find the androgenous, “masculine” and dykey extremely attractive, both aesthetically and sexually. i always have and always will, and i am (now) proud to say as much. the standard norms of what is sexy and alluring for a woman are lost on me, happily.  since that time i have been in many mutually fulfilling, genuine, honest, caring and wonderfully free relationships with women who the world at large would deem unobtainable and unacceptable. i would like to thank each and every one of them for looking beyond gender, sexual labels and community dogma and instead following their own moral, ethical, emotional and sexual compasses. i just wish at we all could be a little more open, honest and mindful of ours and others inner selves, inner voices and inner dreams and strive to make all of them real.",1,1

980355,"&gt; it is also possible that you don't actually know said friend as well as you think you do.  i see what you're saying, and in general it's something to bear in mind, but with respect: please do not presume to lecture me on my own friendships, especially involving people you've never even met. &lt;:-)  obviously you have to be careful and calibrate your level of familiarity to avoid offending people, and i have plenty of friends (male and female) who you can't joke about with in this way, because they take offence.  but you know what?  in spite of the fact i like them, they're often perceived by others as up-tight, sniffy or over-sensitive, and hence seem to have a great deal of trouble making friends in our social circle.  they're the kind of high-maintenance friend you have to baby-sit at a party where they don't know many people, because they won't go out and meet people themselves.  they're also often not the kind of people who have a great many close male friends, because one of the primary things most guys look for in friends is *relaxation and acceptance*.  someone who you have to walk on eggshells around (or who constantly stands on ceremony) lest they judge you is not relaxing or accepting, especially when they habitually rebuff or take offence at traditional male overtures of bonding or friendship.  as i said, you're entirely correct, but there's no *moral* issue here - some people interact in a robust, rough-and-tumble way, and others are more refined and delicate, standing on ceremony and investing more attention and emotional support in their friendships.  however, neither of these is ""correct"" or ""incorrect"" - they're just *different*.  reddit is not a single conversation - it's more like a wide-open space where plenty of different groups are having plenty of different conversations.  if one group socialises in a way you don't like, leave the group.  don't start jumping to ill-supported conclusions and demanding *they all* change to conform to the way you prefer.  this whole comments page (and headline which started it) is basically a discussion on the theme ""i don't understand rough-and-tumble socialising, so i'm going to jump to conclusions regarding it and demand you all stop doing it"", and that's just as unwarranted as saying someone should be *forced* to endure insults when they socialise.  rather, how about we all just socialise how we want, and if you don't *like* rough-and-tumble, unsubscribe from the subreddits where it happens and set up new ones like 2xc.  frankly, there's only one group here *demanding* the other chance, and it's not the group making the off-colour jokes. &lt;:-/  &gt; on the other hand, the second instance of joke you put forward is not directed at an individual. it is you attacking outward at an entire group.  again, and as i've already explained, this is a misinterpretation.  in the same way you can take the piss out of a friend, and thereby demonstrate that you're comfortable enough with them that you feel no need to stand on ceremony, you can take the piss out of a group and thereby demonstrate that you have no problem with them as a group.  for example, i'll make gay jokes upon occasion - not because i have a problem with gay people (my best mate in the world is actually gay, and we first met when he actually hit on me in a nightclub!), but because it's a taboo, and because amongst my social circle it's accepted that it's a demonstration of comfort with the idea of homosexuality, not prejudice against it.  in fact, i'm pleased to say, rare occurrences of genuine homophobia are instantly treated with freezing contempt, and the person responsible is (as it were) not invited back.  importantly, we didn't used to make gay jokes - it started with my best friend and i insulting each other - he'd call me ""bender"" (because i'm straight, so it's traditionally an insult) or a ""breeder"" (pejorative term for heterosexual) and i'd call him a ""filthy gayer"" or a ""godless sodomite"" (because if i can invoke *those* vicious stereotypes and we laugh over them, it's obvious that the friendship is strong enough to endure anything).  from there he started doing it with others in the group, and eventually it just became generally acceptable.  now, when a new person is exposed to it they can be slightly confused, but with only a few seconds' thought it's generally pretty clear from context what's going on, and the *only* people who seriously take offence or get pissy are the kind of over-sensitive, judgemental people that we *all* want to gently dissuade from joining the group.  i think this is common in males these days, and it's certainly *highly* common on reddit - as evidenced by the fact that most of the examples of ""disgusting misogyny"" that get posted to 2xc or ladybashing are - from a male perspective - clearly and unambiguously jokes.",1,
193020,"i've been saving this one.   first, no, i've never read that blog but all the interest here has got me thinking about helping get my coworker started on one. it sucks seeing my friends living in paycheck to paycheck (i do too but i have a lot of other little projects going). sounds  like that blog's not active anymore and there is a bit of a gap in the market and definite interest.  (eta: that blog is the first i've seen that was entirely taken offline when the blog-to-book deal went through. what an odd business strategy. guess i'll never know if i want to read the book)  we've got a couple of guys that come in at least 4 times a week that never buy anything and seem to consider themselves part of the staff. we joke about them being the security force since they love to report back to us with whatever is going on our of sight (we don't want to know unless it's criminal!) these guys know the owner so it may have started as free passes to the theater but quickly become something else. they are both voyeurs and probably bi with heavy leanings toward guys. they flit from area to area for 3-8 hours at a time, try to chat us up for long periods, or just lean against the counter and watch the monitors. at least one of them brings up food a lot, so that's cool. he brings donuts at least once a week and i've made him go get me a sandwich before. i think it's fair to say we're all pretty annoyed by them, but we put up with em. i generally don't talk to them unless directly addressed.   there's a guy that is pretty tight with my coworker. they hang out, smoke, and talk like good friends for hours up here, only about half relating to porn. he is pretty clean cut, 35ish, into sports and liberal politics. he's strictly a voyeur here but apparently he's willing to meet someone here and go home with them. he seems to just like hanging out here and i think he's on a disability fixed income so he has a lot of time on his hands. beside my standard complaint about regulars hopping from place to place (requiring me to buzz them in and actually pay attention to my job), i have no problem with this guy. we even just told him we're writing about him..looked a little weirded out but didn't protest.  there's a guy that comes in a lot that i recognize as owner of a local bar. real well groomed older guy with a thing for denim, always does the same thing: buys a theater ticket, goes down there, then within 5 minutes comes back up and buys arcade tickets. i recognized the pattern and got fed up one day. when he bought his theater ticket i asked ""and $5 worth of arcade tickets""? he looked pissed and said no, then 5 minutes later came back and bought $5 worth of arcade coupons. i got into true blood when it came out and there's a scene just like this with andy and his cheeseburger.  we had a deaf guy that was coming in here a lot recently. we had to deal with a lot of communication issues with him and he asked for a lot of favors, like calling friends to borrow money, cabs (no biggie, always glad to do this). he was kind of a nuisance. i threatened him with a ban once when i caught him digging through the trash can outside (people throw out theater tickets and if they still have time on them others will try to reuse so we have to watch that). we finally banned him for good yesterday when he pissed all over the floor of a preview room. before that he's had us call a friend to ask for money (he told us her name was ""lil mama""..that was a fun phone call), then when she didn't come fast enough, first he had us call her back a couple times, then he got a cab. i thought he was gone but he took the cab right back here till we checked his room and saw what he'd done.  we used to have a really miserable bastard, old guy..70s+, that would come in very regularly, and by other customers accounts he'd go down in the theater and splay himself butt-nekkid for the entire time he was there. he could barely walk and i often wondered how long it'd be till he fell down a flight of stairs here (side note, we often wonder how long till we find a dead body here). somewhere along the line he gained the name stinky (other nicknamed regulars are spanky, the spider-monkey, glitter lips, etc.). my main memory of him is that he was guaranteed to complain if there was an interracial scene (or any non white-on-white) in the theater. i called him out on that one a time or 2, told him racism isn't a fetish i cater to. i left the job for a while and when i came back was told they'd found his obituary in the paper. he'd been banned before that for sneaking into the theater, and the security footage taken from that day showed him in neck brace holding a cane. there is no way this guy was doing anything with his dick at that age. i think like a lot of people that come in here he had a serious addiction. funny story about that guy..he once locked his keys in his car and had to call his wife to come unlock him. she had no idea he was coming up here regularly. awkward!   i'm flipping through our book of banned customers looking for interesting stories. we used to have a whole mob of ""couple chasers"" but they're either coming in on 2nd shift or they disappeared. i knew one guy was a teacher, one was a sound tech at local venues..there is a whole culture associated with exhibitionist and/or swinger couples going down to the theater and the people that come for the sole purpose of watching them. couples are good for business and we let them in the theater free, and the couple chasers pay so we tolerate them but they can be seriously creepy, especially if a single girl comes in for a toy. we've banned guys for following 5 feet behind a girl while trying to remain inconspicuous. i can only imagine how freaky that would be to a casual (and probably uncomfortable anyway) female customer.  we had a weird little rash of thefts a month or 2 where kids would come up from a local high school, run in the door as a mob of 4 or 5, grab all the dvd cases they could, and run back out. they did this 2 or 3 days in a row, which i don't get since the cases are empty. costs us money though since we have to sell the dvds marked down without their art. they quit coming the same day we had a trap ready for them.  there's a fat dragqueen that comes in that has long poofy-curly hair that we call foghat cause she looks more like a 70s rocker than a woman.   there's many more but maybe i'll save it for my book deal ;) or for when i'm not getting ready to go home at least.",0,

""are you on duty?"" i asked. i was lonely and wanted to make love with her.  ""no. since we've got the extra security i haven't taken a watch. but i make sure i check in at least once with every watch. so i'm up pretty much around the clock. i guess you could say that i'm on duty all the time. i catch catnaps whenever i can.""  she ran her fingers through my hair and down the back of my neck. i could tell that she wanted to make love too.  ""yes, i know. both craig and anthony told me that. when did you decide not to cover a watch?""  she was scratching the back of my neck with her right hand; her left hand was on my waist. goose bumps were rising up my back. i closed my eyes and let the feelings running up my spine take control of my body.  ""a couple of days after the extra security was added. i just left security a few moments ago. i won't have to go back there again for several hours."" she paused. then, ""i want to make love with you toni. i need you. we haven't made love for almost a week.""  i opened my eyes and put my hands on the sides of her face and drew her to me. we kissed; our tongues danced together. our arms wrapped around each other. we fell back on the bed and made love like there was no tomorrow. then we slept.  i love chantelle. i really do and i'll probably end up living with her someday. but i want to have a little more freedom before i settle down. i would also like to have a man around, a man who won't mind sharing me with my lesbian lover.  i guess that's what i'm really searching for, some warm, passionate man who won't get jealous if i happen to have an affair with another woman. so until he comes along, i'll remain the way i am.  my alarm went off a few minutes before twenty-four hundred. it woke chantelle too. she started to get up. but i asked her to stay till i got off watch in six hours. she said that she would have to make her rounds but she would be back before i got off watch.  she was. when i came into my berth just after 0 six hundred the next morning she was naked and sleeping in my bed. i quietly took off my clothes and then woke her up. we made love again with my strap-on dildo. we didn't get up until ten thirty. by the time we got dressed, brushed our teeth and got cleaned up it was eleven hundred.  she asked me to accompany her to the cafeteria. it was late. we both knew that they had stopped serving breakfast at 0 nine hundred and lunch wouldn't start for another half an hour. but all she wanted was for me to be with her for a little while longer, before she took on the weight of her job. we went together and she had a cup of coffee. i settled for a glass of orange juice; i don't like coffee.  father ray had just finished saying sunday mass when we got there. he was sitting at one of the tables reading. every sunday, in fact everyday, he said mass at ten hundred hours. he used the cafeteria as it was the single biggest room onboard. very few people attended but i did when i didn't have the late night watch.  i once asked him about missing mass on those mornings i had the graveyard shift. i know i could set my alarm and get up. but i would have to set it for 0 nine thirty and that would only give me about three hours sleep. then i would be dragging the rest of the day unless i somehow got back to sleep.  but as captain of the endeavour, once i was up and out of my berth there was frequently someone with a problem or something needing my attention. there was nearly always something that would prevent me from getting back to my cabin for some more sleep.  whenever that happened, then when i went on watch again at eighteen hundred it would be almost impossible to continue six hours on duty without nodding off, especially a duty where you sat and did nothing except watch the stars for six hours.  by the way, i know i only had about four hours sleep in me at that time but that extra hour helps.  anyway, i once asked father ray about missing mass. he told me that as he saw it i had a choice between the lesser of two evils.",0,

392976,"sorry for the pause, had a life to get back to.  anyway, like i said, you're making me do a lot of work here taking apart your ill-phrased, ill-constructed argument.   so here is what you are saying regarding laboratory assisted same sex reproduction which i have bulletted:  • these arent direct ways of natural reproduction.  which is true enough.  we'll take ""natural"" to mean ""that which can take place without the use of technology""  however, this is not a valid reason against it. it is in fact an example of the naturalistic fallacy, which assumes that all things ""natural"" are inherently good and all things ""unnatural"" are inherently bad. if you want to posit that all forms of non-natural reproduction are unacceptable then you have to concede all forms of reproduction which involve technology.things like antibiotics, c-sections, incubators, hormone replacement, fertility drugs, in-vitro and all the other unnatural methods of reproduction currently in use by male/female couples are likewise unacceptable.  • i wish people would stop saying gay people can have kids.  to say 2 gay people of either gender can have biological babies of their own is ridiculous and makes people look desperate in trying to have the straight 'community' accept them as legit.  sorry to offend your ears but: gay people can have kids.  they do it all the time.  they have kids the ""old-fashioned, natural way"" with a member of the opposite sex that does not stick around to be daddy or mommy.  they adopt; sometimes from a close relative.  they go the ""unnatural"" route with a surrogate, a sperm donor, an egg donor etc.  all methods of obtaining children that male/female couples can and do use as well.  the only difference being that the acting parents are of the same gender.    • playing god with a natural process is a slippery slope. (i.e. people who want to change their child's hair, eye, skin color. certain features be inserted and removed like the kid was some kind of customizable electronic device.)  edit: what i was talking about in the last sentence is a passive version of what hitler was trying to accomplish. a society where people look, talk, act, walk, and think the same way. just leave people they way they are. stop trying to control objects and persons that are out of your control.  slippery slope fallacy and the ever popular reductio ad hitlerum.  look them up before you make the mistake of using them again.  we have been playing god with natural process since the dawn of agriculture.  we have turned wolves into chihuahuas and weeds into ketchup.  we walk around with computers in our pockets, smash atoms, grow organs on mice and sent men to the moon.  you're just using ""playing god"" to refer to using technology for things you disagree with for reasons you fail to address.  • these are used to help an already natural process. what this article is saying is that gays can reproduce naturally when that is not the case.  that's not what the article says at all; read it again.  and furthermore, just because something can normally be done naturally does not mean it's being merely ""helped"" when technology steps in to make something possible that was otherwise impossible.  it's like saying a man in a motorized wheelchair is being ""helped"" to walk.   • those objects are designed to help, speed up, or in most cases slow down a process that happens alone in nature. so to say procreation by two people of the opposite sex is not natural is just plain stupid.  straw man fallacy:  i never said ""procreation by two people of the opposite sex is not natural"" and you would be stupid to draw that conclusion from what i have said.  again, there are opposite sex couples for whom procreation is impossible without technological intervention.  but i don't see you even acknowledging that fact or taking umbrage with it.  rather you keep retreating to the naturalistic fallacy.  • relying on scientific advancements that re-route resources to my home is not comparable to a process which involves circumventing and just showing plain disregard for a natural process designed to be a standard for our society.  here is where your real sentiments show themselves with: ""standard for our society.""  it's an ad populum fallacy and a poor one at that.  in fact without that bit of fallacy the rest of your sentence collapses in on itself.  ""relying on scientific advancements that re-route resources to my home"" is actually completely ""comparable to process which involves circumbenting and just showing plain disregard for a natural process...""  (tsk tsk spelling)  • but intercourse between homosexuals that want to create is natural? you seem to have a warped view of procreation.  straw man fallacy, yet again.  also a poorly worded sentence.  also not working for your argument because it is natural for people to want to procreate, whether or not they are homosexual or heterosexual.  also an ad hominim fallacy....i really hope you actually look these terms up.  • let me make one thing clear. i am not ""prejudiced"" or discriminatory"". i am opposed to trying to imitate a process that the default way to procreate. it shows up in nature but that doesnt mean humans should copy the actions of lesser beings does it? in that case, should we fling our feces at others? should we like the skin of other people in ou community? the answers are obvious. so if the response to those questions, which appear in nature, is of course not, then what do you think the answer is to humans using untamed animals to excuse their homosexual behavior?  here is where you just fall apart.  you are spelling out a prejudice against the non-standard way to procreate.  specifically when two people of the same gender are involved. you've demonstrated no objection to male/female couples using similar unnatural processes to procreate.  then you try to undo the naturalistic fallacy that you have been using earlier to try to prove your point with a slippery slope fallacy and a false dilemma fallacy.  in effect arguing that we should not take our cues of what is natural from nature because we'll be flinging feces and skinning our neighbors.  homosexual behavior does not need an excuse because there is nothing wrong with it.  as long as it occurs between consenting adults in private it does no harm and requires no apology to the prudish, the squeamish, the religious or the bigoted.  • i was pointing out that those advancements do not change a process in nature but either re-route the process (i.e. ac, heater) or improve a process that already occurs in nature (medicine, insulation.). and in case you didnt know, these processes help over 70% us residents/citizens not just me whereas these 3 processes would only benefit around half of the less than 5% of homosexuals currently in the us.  scientific and technological advancements do change processes in nature.  they do not always re-route or improve what already occurs.  one word: plastic.  as for processes that benefit us residents, be honest, you pulled that %70 right out of your ass unless %30 of us residents are luddite cave dwellers.  you're not even bothering to construct the logical framework you would need to make a point.  also, in case you didn't know; the processes that help us residents (medicine, insulation, heaters) includes us residents that are homosexual.  or do gays not ever get cold?  furthermore, processes that help same sex parents have children are most likely applicable to helping opposite sex couples have children as well.  if you had managed to make a point it i am afraid it would most likely have been another ad populum fallacy and/or false dilemma.  bottom line, in a free market system, even processes that exclusively benefit homosexuals will be funded because homosexuals can spend money on whatever they damn well please.  • rant  very emotional, however, very little coherent content.  btw what is msm?  manhattan school of music?  methylsulfonylmethane? morehouse school of medicine?",1,

222007,"others hace expressed the same thing i would in response to your direct question about why some have pride, so i'll skip over that; but i wanted to respond to your statement that your homosexuality doesn't define you as a person.  i understand that that's true for some people, but for me it _does_ help define me as a person, and so gives me another reason to be proud.  i'm very straight acting - i grew up in the southern and midwestern united states, where ""manly"" traits are highly valued. i drink beer, i watch football (i don't love it, but meh), and i work on a military installation every day. as far as anyone who doesn't know me is concerned, i'm as straight as they come.  however, i'm also largely defined by my homosexuality; not because i want to be defined by that trait, per se, but because that is how society defines me. there's the old joke- if a man builds a thousand bridges, he's a bridgebuilder. if he builds a thousands bridges and sucks one cock, he's a cocksucker.  my sexuality defines who i am reasonably capable of falling in love with, and it determines who i get along with the best (i.e. other people who share my interests or understand me). my sexuality determines the implicit societal roles into which i am placed. i have less rights than a heterosexual- purely because of my sexuality, and so it determines what i can and can't legally do. this also means it drives my advocacy- i feel the desire to participate in certain activities (like protests) because i feel a bond with a minority group who shares the same trials and tribulations that i do.  if i want to meet a guy, i may go to a ""gay"" event (around here we have buddyball- gay volleyball, and yes, it's roughly as hilarious as it sounds). i may not meet my soul mate, but i can certainly make friends. these friends will link me into other friends, and so my social group is determined (in part), essentially, by my sexuality.  further, i feel the freedom to admit i like certain things; as a trivial example, i enjoy broadway musicals (i know, not cliche at all). heterosexuals may also enjoy musicals, and some of them may even admit it- but others will not, because they feel pressured into disliking them by societal norms. i, lacking that pressure, will admit this like, and therefore meet other people who share it- statistically these people are more likely to be like me, and thus gay.  if a straight guy says he likes britney spears, someone may comment that he's, ""weird"" or ""dude, wtf?"" and move on. if i comment that i like britney spears, the first comment is always the same, ""ahh ... cuz you're gay."" society chooses to define my role because of my sexuality, and i could attempt to reject that role (some do), but in the end i can fight as much as i want, but society is defined by the majority- by the people who set the ""norms."" so my sexuality, even if against my will, places me into situations, roles, and scenarios that heterosexuals may not have to deal with. once again, as a trivial example, since gays can often be seen as effeminate, faggy, or worth less than heterosexuals, i had a boyfriend who was beaten and placed into a coma for a few days. i experienced emotions and dealt with prejudices that affected my state of mind at that time, and that continue to affect my perspective. all because of my sexuality.  so part of my pride comes from being proud of living my life as i see fit, and not as others would like me to (as commentors have alread mentioned in this thread), but another part of my pride is in knowing that my sexuality does make me who i am- and quite frankly, i'm a pretty cool guy.  :p",1,1
479487,"yep, sorry- i just didn't want to get carried away, but i realize i more agreed with the op's statement than offered up info to explain.  here's a (hopefully) better explanation.  i'll use the example of color as a parallel since it's easier to conceptualize but follows a lot of the same patterns.  intangible noun: a concept that, while having no tangible counterpart (such as chair or cat), is treated as a definitive object in language.   now think about color--- color is irrefutably a spectrum. and yet we divide it into discrete units: red, blue, orange, (orangered), etc. the question about concepts/intangible nouns is 'why do we assume that our categorization of that spectrum is concrete? isn't it ultimately an interpretation of a gradient with no clear boundaries?' there is no reason-- independent of our culturally trained eyes-- to see the line between orange and red where we do. other cultures have different categorizations of color-- some divide all colors into simply ""black"" and ""white."" do they perceive all those colors? yes. do they have a cultural necessity to differentiate purple from blue? no. their categorization of the exact same spectrum that we see is built into their language, and thus their thought patterns, in an entirely different way than our own.  (i promise i'll get to sexuality, though it's much easier to understand that having gone through the logical steps using a simpler concept first).   my thesis focused specifically on men and women. my question was exactly the op's: why do we see boatloads of bisexual women, but so few bisexual men? if sexuality was either a conscious choice or a biological imperative, wouldn't we see more consistent numbers? i theorized that the answer could be found in our differing uses of language.   men and women speak about color differently. we tend to perceive color differently. to me, the color of my wall is ""sage."" to all my male friends, it is green. men-- for the most part-- tend to see colors in fewer and more rigidly bound categories. red, blue, green. dark red, light red, dark blue, light blue. but women say things like magenta and teal, lilac and cerulean. they perceive colors to be divided into far smaller units within each rigidly bound category and-- more importantly-- they find it meaningful to distinguish between those smaller units. it's not that men dont see sage and lilac, it's that that degree of specificity-- in most situations-- isn't as important to note and so they go with the more general terms ""green"" and ""purple."" (and someone always refutes ""well my dad is a painter and he uses specific color names11!!1!11!1!"" yes... we're talking about generalized usage. obviously there are exceptions, but this is what is linguistically documented).   there's a parallel here to the categorization of sexuality. for men, sexual behavior is, very justifiably, straightforward: you like having sex with the same gender and you're gay. you like having sex with the opposite gender then you're straight. if you like having sex with both, you are probably gay. this is a structured, rule oriented paradigm that can be seen in everything right down to the way that boys play (when you were a little boy, you probably played games with a system of rules and a clear winner and a clear loser and room for little ambiguity.)  for women, it's not so. you like having sex with men...... but you feel emotionally attracted to your female friend? well maybe that means x. you kissed a girl at a bar but you want to spend forever and ever with your boyfriend? well, maybe that means y. it's incredibly situational and women find no problem with drawing that arbitrary line between ""bisexual"" ""homosexual""  and ""heterosexual"" as a dotted line or putting it in a different place. there's no 1:1 correlation between behavior and identity: there's only an interpretation of behavior into identity. i was so drunk! she's the only girl i've ever felt this way about! i only did it because my boyfriend was there and he thought it was hot! just like color, the units are smaller and more gradual. (think about play again: girls tend to play games with no set rules, that are situational and have no clear outcome. there's tons of ambiguity.)  okay, but your question is why does this happen? why is there a difference? is there a logical reason or is it machismo and sluttiness? no-- it's a very legitimate difference in interpretation of data. in speech, men and women negotiate social standing differently. we ""save face"" in our culture through speech that's appropriate for our race/gender/age/etc. men and women do this differently, and it (in my opinion) affects the way in which they perceive behavior and events.  women negotiate and save face through intimacy. meaning, i want my experience to be shared; i want to identify as closely as possible with other people. how do i do this in speech? &lt;--- things like that. women ask questions, even when they're unnecessary. ""it's hot in here, isn't it?"" ""that movie was great, wasn't it?"" ""what are you thinking about?"" we aren't trying to nag. instead, we perceive it necessary to keep the conversation going in order to create emotional intimacy between two parties. i can obviously tell if it's hot in a room or not, but i unconsciously ask because i want us to have the shared experience of being in a hot room. women are often blasted for being ""more emotional"" than men. not true: women are just more openly emotional because such a large part of our feelings of placement in society hinge on creating a network of shared emotion and experience with others.  men do it differently. men tend to negotiate using hierarchy, not intimacy. (and this is where i am using research and observation since i am not a man). men make statements: it's hot in here. that movie was good. they state their opinion as fact. when men have a shitty day, they want their day to have been the shittiest. when men do something cool, they want it to be the coolest. i dated a guy once and noticed the difference in speech patterns all the time: he would say something like ""ugh i had to stay up all night studying"" and my immediate response would be ""oh i know, me too, i'm so tired."" in my mind, i was showing sympathy to his situation by showing that i shared his experience. in his mind, i was trying to one-up him.   now combine these two ideas and i believe a pattern emerges about language, thought pattern and expressed behavior. for women, intimacy is important: the fewer categories you have-- the more gradual your gradient-- the easier it is to overlap the pieces and see similarities. for men, hierarchy is important: stark categories mean defined rules and clear answers; there's an obvious system in place for hierarchy to be established in.  according to a survey done by (i'm 90% sure... brain's fuzzy though) nih, approximately 92% of people, both men and women, are straight. of that remaining 8% in women 6% are bisexual and 2% are homosexual. in men, 6% are homosexual and 2% are bisexual. also in that same survey (and i don't remember the exact numbers, sorry), the stats showed numbers for ""having had a sexual experience with someone of the same gender."" for men, there was almost 1:1 overlap with men who identified as gay/bisexual and men who admitted to a same-sex encounter. for women? it was something like 3x the number of self-identified lesbians or bisexuals.   which is incredibly consistent with what we just talked about-- for men, the rules of sexuality are clear and defined. had fun with that same sex encounter? your are gay or, at the very least, bisexual (which, to most men, is just a cover word for gay). virtually no questions asked.    for women it's more like.... had fun with that same sex encounter? well would you do it again? was it better than with a guy? do you still think about her? did you like her or just like kissing her? there's no system for women here, it's entirely situational.   men don't like ambiguity. not in their speech, not in behavior. and so bisexuality, to men, is a hard sell because it is-- by its nature-- ambiguous.  women understand and welcome ambiguity. in their speech, in their behavior. so bisexuality, to women, is often a logical answer that allows them to comfortably identify with their ambiguity rather than categorize it into ""black"" or ""white."" they categorize it as ""lilac.""  i take a lot of pride in being probably the only person on earth to have used ""a shot at love with tila tequila"" in my university thesis, but it did offer up one interesting observation (and so, so many nightmares): tila identified as bisexual. a few times, the men she was 'courting' would earnestly talk to her and try to understand her mindset but would often say things like ""so you're bisexual... does that mean you haven't decided yet?"" they framed bisexuality as essentially a confusion of or competition between heterosexuality and homosexuality rather than its own equally legitimate and satisfying category. they couldn't (and, to be fair, most men i have met) understand bisexuality as an equal attraction rather than a competing attraction.   okay........ i'm gonna go cool off my fingers. hope that was more helpful. also, just for the sake of saying it, this was my thesis so it was obviously heavily influenced by my interpretation of data. i don't want to offer this up as fact because it isn't: it's merely my understanding of a discrepancy.",1,
387978,"&gt;in answer to your question, no. i was raised in a sheltered religious environment, and didn't know that there was such a thing as gay until i was eleven, by which point i had been masturbating to the thought of other girls for a couple of years. i didn't know anything about my aunts, since they lived on the other side of the country; my sisters are younger than me. i was a genuinely blank slate, as much as that is possible, the first time that i got a crush on someone; and that was a girl. like the crush after that, and the one after that, and then eventually the first person i fell in love with.  thanks for answering. first, i would say that there is no way that you could consider yourself to be a blank slate by the age of 11. a lot of happens between being born and 11 and i don't think that you can claim to be able to process it all consciously.  i don't say this to try to belittle you or to try to convince you that you don't know who you are and so on (not that i think that is true, i don't want it to sound like that is what i am saying). i'm only trying to explain this position and how it isn't really something you can argue with from a scientific standpoint. science doesn't know how all of this works. neither can you. it is a bunch of information, like everything else, on such a large scale that it becomes too abstract for us to process. it has been processed over time through natural processes and you can only see the rendered result at any given point in time. i think that that causes people to think things like ""i was born that way"", but there is really no way to say that it is that simple. you are just simplifying it for yourself and that brings me to the second point, that what is true for you is not true for everybody else.  i could concede that you might just have been born the way that you are and that there was no way that it could ever have been any different from an ontological standpoint (i'm not talking about determinism or lack of free will, etc.). but that doesn't mean that it is true for everybody else. does that make sense?  so i'm not saying that you were born to be ""queer"" or that i was not and there was nothing that could ever change that. i'm saying that you can't accurately claim one way or the other. you are claiming something that you cannot actually know. and again, that isn't to try to tell you that you don't know what you are talking about, but to say that you can't really argue against this kind of position.  &gt;i say 'queer' because i am not a lesbian, and saying 'bisexual' online almost always gets a host of can-i-watch, bet-you're-ugly, 'you only do it for the attention' bullshit. i say 'queer' because it has less fratboy baggage.  i'm not sure what fratboy baggage is. what is that? i interpreted ""queer"" as meaning you identify as gay. if you are bisexual then just say it and ignore the immaturity.  you almost sound ashamed of who you are. you want to be proud of it or something yet you use terms to obfuscate it a little, or maybe i'm over analyzing. i think you should stop worrying about fratboy baggage whatever that is!  &gt;i am perfectly comfortable with the idea that i am in large part a creation of my environment and personal choices and all the rest of the things that have happened since i was born; a world where i was only my genes would be a miserable place. i just really dislike the idea that what i am is not what i would have been, in terms of my sexual preference, because of some unknowable event or events.   here it seems like you agree with me.  &gt;not everyone is born straight, and i didn't have to get bent into this shape. events and choices made me partly blind, made me strong, made me favor martial arts and dislike moon pies, made it so that i read more than i do math, gave me the way that i act in relationships and out of them;  well, my point is that nobody is born either way. heterosexuality might be the ""default"", but that is only because of the way our species, and many others, reproduce. it has nothing to do with how they start out.  you contradict yourself from above when you say you didn't have to get bent into this shape. you did. we all did. not just by what has happened to you between now and when you were born, but before. during your parents' lives before you were born and before they were born. this information has been perpetuated and processed for millions and millions of years until it eventually *you* were rendered.  you wondering what your sexual preference *would* be if some unknowable event hadn't have happened to you is no different than wondering what any aspect of you would be like if world war ii hadn't happened, or if the nazi's had won, or to wonder if you would even exist that would be recognizable as *you*, if at all.  &gt;but sexual preference doesn't work like that.  i would say that sexual preference is more complicated than any of the things you listed before. genetics also played a role in all of those as well to some extent. there is no reason to consider your sexual preference any differently.  you seem to be polarizing these things or picking and choosing, but that is the point i am trying to get across. you can't. even if it *could* be done, you can't do it. nobody can, not about themselves or anybody else.  &gt; if it did, i wouldn't be queer. if it did, i'd be happily straight and still mormon.  this is kind of a non sequitur. you seem to be saying that if sexual preference *was* something constructed out of your ontogeny that somehow you would be straight instead of bisexual or homosexual. why? could you explain that?",1,

873427,"but wait! i *like* oversimplification. don't ruin it for me.  i think we as humans self-deceive a lot. like heterosexuals. we'd *like* to believe that our attraction to the opposite sex is elevated and pure, with rainbows and unicorns in attendance. if approached with darwinian assertions of ""perpetuation-of-the-species"" and bio-chemical proof that hormones change mental function, most straight people would lapse into a state of denial and say, ""nonsense! science and hardwired drives to perpetuate the species have *nothing* to do with why i sleep with my wife"".   of course, it has everything to do with it. but we find that un-poetic, bestial and insulting.  i can just imagine gays doing the same thing: ""no, no, no, bio-chemistry has *nothing* to do with my behavior! god just sprinkled fairy-dust on me and i've liked interior decorating and show tunes ever since!""  the thing that makes me wonder about an alleged ""gay gene"" is something simple: two black parents will genetically produce a black child, two fat parents will produce a fat child, two tall parents will produce a tall child, etc. genes are passed on by people who *have* them. if a man and woman breed, chances are: statistically, there's a massive likelihood that they're not gay. (yes, yes, i know: homosexuals are increasingly breeding to get children, but even that's an extremely small demographic. on balance, gay men aren't out cruising to sleep with girls.) i'm just speaking in stereotypes here: statistical probabilities. that being said at the outset, i'm left scratching my head because, to me, it doesn't make sense that straight people would have gay genes to pass on. that's like having two chinese parents and expecting them to produce a swede. that's not statistically likely to happen. . . . so the whole ""gay gene"" thing is—to me, at least—counter-intuitive. it's asking us to believe that two people not manifesting a characteristic are the ones passing it on. (such things are possible within the realm of ""recessive genes"".) but even there, it's rare. so much so that it makes newspaper headlines when it happens: like when two white south africans produced a black child, due to recessive genes. (see the case of sandra laing.) it's extraordinarily rare—much more so than the appearance of gays in our population. so it's happening at a much higher rate than that usually found for ""recessive-gene surprises"". ""a child born gay from straight parents"" is no newspaper's headline.   on a digression, it also seems self-defeating to assume that evolution would create a gene to specifically ensure that a person wouldn't breed. it'd be purposely creating a genetic dead-end. . . . and evolutionary processes usually don't do that. so the whole ""gay gene"" thing sounds extremely sketchy. the hormonal imbalance theory seems more easy to latch onto, because it introduces an element of chance. it familiarizes us with the same forces that create left-handed children. for ages, it was assumed that left-handedness was ""genetic,"" too—until twins with identical dna came about where one was right-handed and the other left-handed. it was then that they realized that it wasn't genetic. there was no specific left-handed gene. now scientists believe that left-handedness has to do with how the fetus is situated in the womb, and how its positioning influences its development. . . . similar paradigm shifts are coming about with regard to homosexuality. as with left-handedness, twins came about where one was gay and one was straight. (british gangsters reggie and ronnie cray are just such a pair of twins.) same dna, different sexual orientation. so it's clearly something more than genes in play.    to me, the ""gene theory"" was the one that was overly-simplistic and a cop-out. like how they try to find genes as an excuse now for alcoholism, divorce, not-liking-sylvester-stallone-movies, etc.    increasingly, as we become more sophisticated, we realize that more factors are in play, and that ""a magical, mystical gene"" isn't the smoking gun for everything anymore. if it was than both twins would be left-handed, both twins would be gay, etc.    but that's not the case.",1,

""homosexuality,"" while that's a mistranslation, was considered a natural part of male adolescence and older men were just teaching them about how to be a man by demonstrating sex to them. further, ""homosexuality"" was defined by the sex role; those who received the phallus were gay (""woman"" might be a more apt word, as women received the phallus) and those who gave the phallus were ""straight"" (they were the real men). no doubt, paul and the church didn't like either of these paradigms so they throw them both out. but for them, they are all fornication. it's not like paul saw men wanted to marry other men, have marital sex, adopt kids, build a swing set, and be christians. he, with the rest of scripture, is reacting to the culture of the day. our culture is different and the church's response should be different. gay marriage is no more like greek pederasty than paul's advocacy to servant-hood is like american 1800s slavery.  the bible says a whole lot more about bearing children and heterosexual sexual intercourse than gay marriage (which is exactly 0). so i think birth control, even if ambiguous which i agree, is far more clear cut than gay marriage.",1,

408777,"your post is so full of ignorant assumptions i don't know where to start.   yes, you do have your 'butch' dykes, and you do have femmy-gays, but to assume that every homosexual falls into these categories and are attracted to those types of people is pretty silly. that is a very narrow view of homosexuality.   i'm gay, i'm not feminine. my boyfriend is gay, he is not feminine. almost every gay person i know in my peer circle is the same. my best friend is a dyke, and is very fem - so is her girlfriend.    yes, you do get guys who like feminine/flamboyant guys, and you do get girls that are attracted to more butch girls. why? because people like what they like - everyone is wired differently, and are attracted to different things for different reasons.   same can be said in the heterosexual world - i know girls who like your more girly-emo-boys for whatever reason, and know guys who tend to be more attracted to assertive/strong females.    that said, i do think in most relationships, there does tend to be a power-dynamic that crops up of someone being the more assertive/dominate person in the relationship and the other one being more submissive. the whole 'who wears the pants in this relationship?' type thing. gay, straight, bi, monogamous, open, closed, poly, friendships, parents, etc. for various reasons (social conditioning/blah/blah gender studies type stuff) we tend to associate dominate = men/masculine, submissive = women/feminine.    generally, there seems to be a desire for a 'dominate' person to want to be with a more submissive person, and a submissive person tends to want to be with a more dominate person - it just seems to be way many people are wired. (again, broad generalizations - there are many people who are exceptions to this). a gay male going for a feminine male, or a lesbian going for a butch girl is sort of taking this type of thing to more extreme measures. but even if you do have two 'masculine' appearing men, or two girly-girl girls with each-other, there will generally be a power dynamic between the two where one is more assertive/authoritative than the other.",1,1

772731,"a hell of a long time. depending on your estimates, from thousands of years to billions. i've heard all sorts of analysis. sure, according to current usage rates and current reactor technologies, it would only last 200 years or so.   the thing is, that really doesn't mean much. current reactors use only the most easily accessible uranium. they're designed according to the cheapest available fuel supply.   true, current practices might only last a few centuries, but even currently available technology could extend nuclear power to millions of years. most of nuclear ""waste"" is actually perfectly usable fuel. we just don't bother reprocessing it because new fuel is cheaper. however, fuel is a minuscule part of a plant's budget. fuel costs can increase by an order of magnitude without presenting any problem. almost all of the cost is in construction and then continuing payroll costs. (nuclear engineers, skilled operators, security, etc.)  reprocessing can turn current nuclear waste into usable fuel. nuclear fuel only becomes waste when enough reaction byproducts have built up to make the reaction impossible. 90% of the fuel is still there. we just need to melt it down and separate it out again. we don't do this because it isn't economic. reprocessing would extend current technology to several thousand years.   second, we can use breeder reactors. these can use natural uranium ore, not just the tiny fraction of it that is uranium 235. this can extend nuclear fuel many thousands of years more.   finally, we can access more dilute sources of uranium. currently, we use only the best, most concentrated ore sites. as the fuel costs rise, more dilute sources become economic. eventually it becomes cost-effective to extract it from sea water. combined with the others, this extends nuclear fuel to geologic time scales.   now, the relevance of this is that it allow the earth's natural turning to be significant. the only accessible uranium is in the first few miles of the crust. there's still a whole lot more there, it's just buried deep in the earth. if you extend a fuel's usability to the several million year scale, the earth's natural turning will replenish the surface supply. taking this into account, you're talking hundreds of millions to billions of years here.   now, will we really be using nuclear power a hundred million years from now? probably not. by then, we'll either been killed by a natural disaster, destroyed by some catastrophe of our own, or we'll have gone well beyond nuclear fission. assuming we survive, nuclear power will be to those distant people like the most primitive fire is to us.   tldr: nuclear power will quite easily last long enough for successor technologies to be invented.",0,

572121,"it makes perfect sense. ""you're very welcome here, as long as you're not yourself!"" the church has apparently maintained that if you're gay, you're mentally ill. so they don't welcome you as much as they tolerate you, hoping that you'll see the error of your ways.  so you're not welcoming people for who they are. you're welcoming them for who you want them to be.  and your transgressions are a little different for heterosexuals. they're just frowned upon for having sex before marriage. gays aren't allowed to do anything until they manage to overcome their illness and not slip back into their sinful transgressful ways. oh, and they have to become straight. then they can marry and indulge in earthly passions that they would have enjoyed as homosexuals not in the church in the first place.  so you welcome everyone as long as they become exactly like you! you don't welcome people as they are. hence, why i said it's not welcoming. jesus didn't hang around with prostitutes and lepers and sinners because they had to change for him. he was with them out of love, as the story goes. they were people and he cared for them. there wasn't a special club and handshake they needed in order for him to give a damn about them. you welcome anyone and everyone who promises to turn into your boilerplate of the perfect church member, and change themselves fundamentally...that's not openly welcoming them. you don't like them as they are. you don't want them as they are. you're taking them in to change them. you're welcoming the person you want them to be. the person they are now isn't good enough. unless, i bet, they tithe regularly along the way to their transformation. i'm sure that helps make them more tolerable in the meantime.",1,

950837,"did you take a look at the references cited? many were from more than 20 years ago... a generation in terms of research. typically, unless, it's basic research, you try and use sources less than 10 years old, if possible.  of course, they are quote-mining, so they will look for anything which supports their views, no matter how out-dated or disproved by more recent research.  par for the course, really.  not only that, but several of those points are true because of discrimination.   **ten percent of the population is gay.**  while 3% *identify* as gay or bi, the percentage of those who actually are is much higher. after all, look at the percentage of republicans who identify as gay or bi, and then look that those who get *caught with a male prostitue, found in an airport bathroom soliciting sex, or sending pervy sms's to young men.*  **homosexuals do not experience a higher level of psychological disorders than heterosexuals. **  homosexuals do experience considerably higher levels of mental illness and substance abuse than heterosexuals, but could that not be because of the *abuse and trauma* they get from unsupportive families, churches, friends, etc.? they are told they are evil, thrown out of the house without support, beaten, and worse... and are expect to to come out of it *normal*?   **homosexual conduct is not harmful to one’s physical health.**  again, physical/mental/sexual abuse of *kids* creates the conditions where abnormal sexual development causes the problems, not being gay. i've know a few straight girls with major sexual issues who were sexually abused as kids, became sexually active very young, and are pretty much royally fucked up now. it had to do with abuse, not with the gender of their bed partners.  **children raised by homosexuals are no different from children raised by heterosexuals, nor do they suffer harm.**  on average, those raise by [lesbian couples turn out much better than those raised by straight couple](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfmoms/detail?entry_id=65267). the sources used by them are 8-13 years old. newer studies show different results... but those don't support their points, so are ignored. kids with gay parents also tend to be more accepting of others - they live in an ""unconventional"" family, and are more willing to accept other living situations.  **homosexuals are no more likely to molest children than heterosexuals.**  again, 10+ year-old studies, some more than 20 years old, nothing recent. grouping pedophilia and homosexuality together inappropriately, so it's pushing the ""gays will take your kids!"" idea. i know several gay men and women, and the only time they were even attracted to someone underage was when they were the *same age,* which is perfectly normal.  **homosexuals are seriously disadvantaged by discrimination.**  yes, homosexual tend to have higher incomes because of education, but *discrimination is discrimination*. it doesn't matter if i make more money than you, if you take away rights from me, i am disadvantaged. if you pay me $20 more per week, but i can't walk on the same side of the street as you, i'm being discriminated against. if i can't drink at the same bar as you, but i get a coupon for a free frostie at wendy's, i'm still not equal to you. this isn't a difficult concept.  **homosexual relationships are just the same as heterosexual ones, except for the gender of the partners.**  differentials are still based on points of sexual issues stemming from abuse, the necessity of ""underground"" relationships and sexual encounters because of societal and familial disapproval or rejection.   most of this crap would go away if homosexual relationships were normalized, and if gays were just another group of people. if you don't beat your gay kids, they'll probably be as normal as anyone else. if you don't force your gay kids to get married to someone they don't love for the look of it, they won't sneak off for a secret rendezvous with a lover... or a stranger. if you don't berate them constantly and make them feel worthless, maybe they won't end up with major mental issues as adults.  this is basically a paper saying that gays are bad because when we beat them and disparage them as kids, telling them they are evil, worthless, and unworthy of love, they become self-fulfilling prophesies and justify our descriptions of them.",1,

953274,"so many points to cover...  where to start...  this is gonna be long but you should definitely read it all!  it answers all your questions.  i'll make a list and then form an appropriate answer to each thing on the list:  1.  you kind of indirectly asked/assumed i am gay.  i am!!!  good job. :d  2.  not really a question but i just wanted to clarify.  you put down what the *definition* of gay/homosexual is and then followed through with understanding just the definition as it's complete meaning.  i just want to say that understanding a definition does not mean you now understand what the meaning of the word, or what being gay, actually is.  being homosexual means much more than just being physically attracted to someone of the same sex.  just like being heterosexual means much more than just wanting to do it with the opposite sex.  there is a specific culture in being gay.  we have a long long history that reaches into every culture on this planet because, as a sub-culture, we are inherently part of every culture.  so please understand that words have more meaning behind just their definitions.  3.  you seem to think that we are special because we like anal sex and then throw parades in honor of our sexual expression.  this question kind of threw me for a loop because both of these events (anal sex and pride parades) are completely independent of each other and really don't have much to do with each other other than they aspect that they both have *something* to do with homosexuality.  allow me to clarify:  first, let's talk sex.  sex is something that many of us (i'm talking everyone, not just the gays) aspire to participate in and is absolutely unique and personal to every individual.  i, for one, really enjoy sex and i see it as something along the lines as the closest way i can bond with someone on many different levels (emotionally, spiritually, physically, etc.).  i typically hold out on sex with strangers because it just doesn't feel the same to me when i don't have strong feelings for the guy i'm doing it with.  fortunately for me, i'm in a great relationship with my long time boyfriend and we love each other very much, so being physical is always great for both of us.  what that has to do with the notion of feeling ""special"" about it, i honestly have no idea.  does my wonderful boyfriend make me feel special? yes, very much so.  but does *just* having sex (just plain old random sex with a stranger) make me feel the same way?  not in the slightest understanding of the notion.  so really, i don't feel anymore special having sex than you do, or any other person for that matter.  next part to question 3; why do we have pride parades?  this is a question i've heard from a lot of people and the answer is actually simple to understand once you see our point of view about it.  in a very basic understanding of the term:  pride parades are held in order to celebrate our culture, history, and diversity.  this is what a pride parade is by definition, but again, a word is always much more than it's definition. :)  pride parades are held in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans communities in every major city or county because we are celebrating ourselves as a minority group and as a group that is marginalized like many other minority groups.  this is something that many groups of people don't understand.  we don't have the parades to taunt the people who make fun of us or hurt us in whatever way.  we don't march down the street to flaunt our sexual identity in your face.  we have these events because, despite all the hate, violence, and discrimination we face, we are so very proud of who we are as individuals that we like to express that pride outward to anyone who cares to see.  hence the name, pride.  if we were doing it to taunt all the haters, then we'd call it arrogance instead.  and really, you see this type of celebration in almost every culture, because every culture is proud of their heritage, where they come from, and who they are because of their culture.  aren't you proud of your heritage?  where your family came from?  what challenges your ancestors had to struggle through?  well, although our queer ancestors are not blood related, we do too.  4. ""why gay rights?""  well first, they're not so much ""gay rights"" as they are ""civil rights"" that have not been extended to our minority group.  let's try this as an example:   if you think back to the civil rights movements in the 1950s - 60s, black people were just fighting for their fair share of rights in which they were being excluded from too.  they weren't fighting for ""black rights.""  they were fighting for the same civil rights that their white counterparts were already receiving.  think about interracial relationships back then.  the then white majority was up in arms about interracial marriages back then.  it was seen as an abomination for two people of different ethnicities to wed.  there were laws that prevented them from marrying and living happy lives together.  today, most just see interracial marriages as just another pair of people who love each other and want to express that love by getting hitched and yelling it from the rooftops.  further, the people who still see interracial marriages as wrong are typically understood to be the same racist elitists who stained our american history with their horrible acts of oppression and hate.  now let's try that same paragraph again but with a twist:  if you think back to the civil rights movements in the 1990s - 2010s, gay people were just fighting for their fair share of rights in which they were being excluded from too.  they weren't fighting for ""gay rights.""  they were fighting for the same civil rights that their straight counterparts were already receiving.  think about gay relationships back then.  the then straight majority was up in arms about gay marriages back then.  it was seen as an abomination for two people of the same sex to wed.  there were laws that prevented them from marrying and living happy lives together.  of course now most just see gay marriages as just another pair of people who love each other and want to express that love by getting hitched and yelling it from the rooftops.  further, the people who still see gay marriages as wrong are typically understood to be the same racist elitists who stained our american history with their horrible acts of oppression and hate.   see what i mean?  we don't want special rights.  we don't want gay rights.  we just want to not be second class citizens in a country the majority of us were born into.  we are proud citizens who are not being given the same inherent rights as everyone else.  this is what needs to be recognized.  we're not special.  we're just gay.  ain't nothin' wrong with love and equal rights.  **edit for format but i can't seem to change that ""1."" to a ""4."" hrmmm**",1,

419862,"it's only recently-- the past 100 years or so-- that homosexuality as we know it now has really existed. this isn't to say that it's a recent invention, of course, but it's only since the trial of oscar wilde that homosexuality has really been an *orientation* rather than a *behavior*.  what this means is that in cultures where homosexuality is/was widespread, engaging in homosexual sex wasn't seen as something that actually made you gay. in the us (and probably canada and a lot of other christian-dominated countries as well, but the us is what i know), gay sex made you a sodomite, but so did a lot of non-reproductive heterosexual sex acts, like oral sex and anal sex.  you also get different ideas about sex and gender in different countries. i'll be talking about sex and gender as different things here, so in case you don't know the basic difference, it's that sex is purely biological; it's determined by your genetics, your primary sexual characteristics (genitals), your secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, body hair, shoulder width, etc) and your hormones (how much testosterone, estrogen and progesterone you have in your body). gender is the social construction of sex; the ideas you have about how women should be and how men should be are not about sex (what nature makes men and women) but about how society expects men and women to behave. the easy trick for remembering this is that ""gender is between the ears, sex is between the legs.""  there are people whose sex is different from their gender; these people feel that they were born as the wrong sex and choose to live as the opposite one. these are called ""transgender"" people. you will also hear the term ""transexual"", which refers to transgender people who choose to go through hormonal treatments and/or surgery in order to make their bodies match the way they feel inside.  there are also people who do not have consistant sexual characteristics; these are called ""intersex"" people. (they are also called ""hermaphrodites"", but this is a confusing term because it's also used to describe species who have both male and female genitals; it is also frequently used in ways that are rather rude, so it is best to avoid it when describing people. it's fine to use to describe hermaphrodite animals, like snails, though :))  anyway, back to homosexuality: you end up with some cultures where gender is not divided, as we think of it, into ""male"" and ""female"" but can be roughly described as ""male"" and ""not-male""; alternatively they may have what can be thought of as a third gender. (this is a bit of a simplification, but we don't really have good words in english for this.) in these cultures, there are people who are sexually male but identify, gender-wise, as female. the thai [kathooey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kathoey) and south american [travesti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/travesti) are examples of these.  in these cultures; it's generally okay for men who identify as straight to have sex with these third-gender people; that is not seen as something that makes them gay. sometimes it is more roughly divided between top/bottom (or pitcher/catcher; with the top/pitcher being the sexual aggressor/pursuer, the latter being the pursued, and the top/pitcher being the one that puts the penis into the bottom/catcher, whether that is done orally or anally). in these cases only the bottom/catcher is gay (or travesti or kathoey or third-gender etc).  what this all goes to show is that how we view sexual orientation is very dependent on our culture, and what we are taught about sex and sexuality when we're growing up really influences the way we behave sexually and the way we identify.  tl;dr: the idea of homosexuality and heterosexuality as orientations, rather than as just behavior, is a relatively recent thing. additionally, the way we see sex and gender really changes the way we view our own sexuality and a lot of cultures make it okay for straight men to have sex with other men as long as they are the penetrating partner; these men are still seen as straight and only the penetrated partner is seen as gay (or as third-gender, not male, or some combination thereof.)  edit: fixed ""transgender"" versus ""transgendered"" as per [iamprocrastinating's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jnh7f/why_was_homosexuality_more_accepted_and_widely/c2do22i).  edit edit: anyone notice how all we're talking about here are dudes? there's not generally a whole lot of history on women, but there's even less on female sexuality. i've heard the theory that the reason we find lesbians more acceptable than gay men is because if women-- particularly co-wives-- want to have sexual relations with each other, it doesn't really matter, because they're pretty much stuck with being property for most of history. just a bit of food for thought.  edit edit edit: fixed a pitcher/catcher mistake as noted by [agorilla](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/jnh7f/why_was_homosexuality_more_accepted_and_widely/c2dsv26)",1,

178194,"&gt;the male gay couple refer to themselves as 'the fat one and the thin one', referencing a common stereotype that all gay men are obsessed with their appearance.  then why would one be fat?  &gt;this is further exploited when the 'fat' one is killed off, symbolizing how all gays have to have perfect bodies.  right, the stereotype that all gay men have good bodies because those that don't are quickly selected for beheading by mysterious space cults, i forgot about that. did it not strike you as subtle irony that the one happy-go-lucky church marine was selected for conversion? despite his positive nature and devotion to the cause, he was worthless to the church. on whom does that reflect badly?  &gt;furthermore, they're the only characters that remain un-named through the episode, symbolizing how they're not as good as everyone else.  they are also the only nice marines except for that one woman from the gamma forests, but yeah that throw away line about not needing names was probably about grinding down the gays. oh, and there are a host of other nameless red shirts, and at least one other character known by a title instead of a name.   &gt;the lesbians basically enforce the stereotype that all lesbians are butch dykes who enjoy fighting.  they came off as butch? seriously? what branch of butch do the well kept victorian samurai fall in? oh, and ""the lesbians"" is it now? takes too long to type out madame vastra and jenny, despite an earlier point hanging on the nameless dismissal of homosexual men, i suppose. i guess, in the context of the plot, it would have been better for the doctor to collect a beautiful and demure pair of thoroughly non-stereotypical lesbians, whatever the hell that would even mean, to go assault the church's secrete asteroid. oh, and it bears mentioning that if the warrior lesbians are a stereotype, then the gay marines from earlier are subverting a stereotype by being tough marines and warriors in god's army.   &gt;not only that, but the fact that one of them is a lizard just denotes homosexuality to be in the same category as bestiality.  fucking speciest. we don't refrain from fucking animals because different cell structures are icky, we don't fuck them because they cannot communicate or understand consent. it's like how we don't fuck children; it's all about consent. there will come a day, and i am eager for it, when calling a loving relationship between members of two different species bestiality will be considered as abhorrent as comparing interracial or homosexual relationships to pederasty. there is no room for bronze age bigotry and ignorance in the space future.   &gt;thirdly, the fact that the lizard couldn't tell if some humans were male or female both symbolizes how all homosexuals are promiscuous, and also how gay people can alter themselves by being with members of the opposite sex.  that is a recurring joke throughout the series that is supposed to play on the very real phenomenon that people have greater difficulty differentiating people of other races. put less politically correctly, the all-chinese-people-look-the-same phenomenon. without that gag carrying over, we would have nothing but suggestive looks and a tongue gag to tell us that madame vastra and jenny were more than companions.   &gt;not only that, but they fall into moffat's chauvinistic sexism, as once again we are presented with unrealistic 'superwomen' that end up following male orders (ala sally sparrow, river song, amy pond, etc)  you mean following the doctor's orders? yeah, why would any strong, confident woman take instructions from a thousand year old time traveling genius who was risking his life and pulling out all the stops to rescue a friend? must be secret chauvinism. i suppose he was busy composing this gem of a rant while they explained that the doctor was collecting people who owed him favors.   what really upsets me about this rant is that i often come across such screeds condemning anti-gay sentiment and they all sound the same. they all take the unspoken position that a single stereotype confirmed is a grave transgression. the unstated alternative they yearn for is a world where media exists to challenge and subvert stereotypes, in essence that any media that is not a gay fairy tale about how everyone is a unique snowflake (so long as the shape of that snowflake doesn't resemble any of the names the jocks called me in high school) is an attack on the community and a sign of militant heteronormativism. it all boils down to ""the gays aren't acting right!"" and that's bullshit. people act all sorts of ways, and some of them line up with stereotypes. the straight white men didn't all get together in a secret straight-white-men meeting to assign random behavior traits to the subhuman masses. they have become memetic because they were observed repeatedly. no one complains of the wise old man with the long white beard, yet old people are often slow witted, senile, bigoted and short tempered. it would paralyze a team of writers and kill the series if people like that were permitted to screen scripts for unacceptable content. anyone who plays the part of the villain cannot display a single recognizable trait, or else we are slighting the group who define themselves by that trait. i guess we just stick with daleks until waste bins complain. i guess my point is stop defining yourself as a single trait. think of my favorite homosexual character from moffet's tenure, canton everett delaware iii. canton embodies the american aesthetic. quiet and reserved, he does not shy from violence, but he will listen to reason. canton bucks authority and wears his antiestablishmentarianism as a badge of honor, even thanking the president for recognizing that canton is his own man. he adapts quickly to the idea of space and time travel and video phones, this is a clever fellow. canton is also terribly brave. he stays behind in his own time, limited by its moors and attitudes while he watches the doctor disappear into the endless possibilities of time. he stays because there is work to be done and he is the man to do it. canton is a hero. those are the things about canton that matter, the things he chooses and endeavors to be.   edit: oh, and another thing: how can he stand torchwood if he complains about the silurians difficulty in distinguishing gender representing the mean and hateful notion that sexual orientation is fluid? captain jack is a man from the omnisexual future. he is fucking described, in the rtd years no less, as a man from a time when notions of gender and attraction are more fluid. that is the thesis of captain jack, that sex is excellent and without bigotry we would want to have it with everything.",1,1

916789,"look, i'm not a hateful person or anything—i believe we should all live and let live. but lately, i've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. you see, just about wherever i go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.    take last sunday, for instance, when i casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. the guy looked like a real man's man, too—big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. he didn't seem the least bit gay. at least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.    where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? did i look gay to him? was i wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? i don't recall the phrase, ""suck my cock"" entering the conversation, and i don't have a sign around my neck that reads, ""please, you homosexuals, suck my cock.""    i've got nothing against homosexuals. let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, i say. but when they start sucking my cock, i've got a real problem.   then there was the time i was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. he seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock!    what is it with these homos? can't they control their sexual urges? aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?   believe me, i have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. but try telling that to the guy at the beach club. or the one at the video store. or the one who catered my wedding. or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. all of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing i could do to stop them.   i tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: how the hell did this happen? where did this fairy ever get the idea that i was gay? and where did he get those fantastic boots?   it screws with your head at other times, too. every time a man passes me on the street, i'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. i've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations i enjoy with my wife—even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with vancouver canucks forward mark messier that i can't seem to stop thinking about.   things could be worse, i suppose. it could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. as it is, i'm just angry and sickened. but, believe me, that's enough. i don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, i don't want to know. i just wish there were some way to get them to stop.    i've tried all sorts of things, but it's all been to no avail. a few months back, i started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. in fact, it only seemed to encourage them. then, i really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, chest, and hair seemed to have no effect. what do i have to do to get the message across to these swishes?   i swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, i'm going to have to resort to drastic measures—like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much i disapprove of their unwelcome advances. i mean, you can't get much more direct than that.    i have no interest in your karma.",1,1

[citation needed]  doesn't seem to matter what the reasons are with women's issues, now does it? there's a sudden outcry to fix it immediately. i wonder why.  &gt;from my experience, drug dealers are much more likely to be men. i suspect that men are more likely to pimp. men, because of the social pressure of being breadwinners in a family, are more likely to steal or commit fraud. it cannot be denied that there could be sociocultural factors that make men more likely to commit crimes.  [citation needed]  again, you ask me for sources for my claims but come up with a bunch of shit out of nowhere to rationalize america having a massive incarceration rate, many of which are for simple offenses like marijuana possession-- which my country, canada, had to more or less legalize because it was clogging up the court systems and jails with people who were potheads of *no harm to society*.  &gt;huh, never knew about the foreskin's use in cosmetics . . . that is pretty gross. it also seems pretty recent (unlike the onset of circumcisions in the us) and probably nets less profit than does the actual surgery itself.  &gt;now, it is entirely possible that the sexual effects of both circumcisions could be equal, but that really is not the point.  &gt;my point, which you fail to acknowledge is how the procedure is done. male: anesthetics, painkillers, etc. female: ranges from the same as male to being held down as the clitoris is smashed with a rock. keep in mind that ritual female genital mutilation is typically practiced in developing nations outside of medical offices while ritual male genital mutilation is performed by a medical professional in a hospital.  &gt;and honestly, you can admit that both are problems. this is not a one-or-the-other issue.  did you know that many male circumcisions are performed without anesthesia or any kind of medication to dull the pain, even in first world countries? mine was, as i was told. i also have a scar on my penis because they almost fucked up the procedure and cut it off.  and yeah, you're right. female circ is not performed in first world countries. it's performed in impoverished ones. the question is... why? because we crassly condone male genital mutilation ($$$) while outlawing female mutilation of any kind as barbaric. could be why. just sayin'.  knowing this, how can you even make any kind of claim to them being different.  &gt;actually, it can be done for medical reasons. just sayin', get your facts straight.  can be. but it is illegal under the letter of the law and i guarantee you the only ones performed are for medical emergencies or possible cultural reasons for immigrants, and require some kind of waiver. whereas we cut up half of our boys to feed a multi-billion dollar industry-- the foreskin trade. used in things like ""anti-aging"" face cremes, skin grafts... the uses go on. this is why it's acceptable and this is why there's so much pro-circumcision propaganda, despite any reliable research proving any kind of benefits.  &gt;first, word soup. secondly, their was no such argument made.  how is it word soup? buy a dictionary. feminists cry lamentations that they have to choose between child-rearing and top-earning career all of the time and make arguments that exceptions should be made for them, well, just because.  &gt;so what are these atrocities facing men?  pretty much all of same ones. remember abu ghraib prison where us soldiers sodomized civilian male prisoners? yeah. that's a good example. how about us soldiers gunning down civilians, mostly men, from their gunships while howling with laughter? seen those leaked videos?  &gt;yes, but because they are men? most seem to be for homosexual activity so they would not be men's issues, but lgbt's issues. besides, given the nature of islam and hinduism, honor killing of women is significantly more common. add in acid throwing, bride burning, forced prostitution, sexual slavery and trafficking and there is a case to be made that there should be concern for women's (and human) rights in developing country. you can claim that these women have choices, but you also have never experienced the extreme social pressure that faces them. you have freedom and they do not. and the same goes for their families and communities, who will often coerce or even force women to perform practices like sati or dowry bride burning.  i do enjoy how you try to say that gay men and gay men only being the targets of hefty prison times, executions and so on are not a **men's*** issue. they most certainly are. lesbians are most often left alone. perhaps your attempt to appropriate gay men for your own agenda...? they are men. and it is disproportionately affecting men. therefore, it is a men's issue. just like feminists claim lesbian issues are a women's issue.  acid throwing happens to as many males as females, and is usually a financially motivated crime.  forced prostituion (seriously), slavery (sexual and labor) and trafficking also does happen to men.  bride burning is hysteria. like rape and domestic violence in the west is. here is something from someone who lives in india to give you a clue: http://www.avoiceformen.com/2010/12/05/dowry-death-and-bride-burning-a-look-beyond-the-smoke-screen-mrm-india/  &gt;far from it. you have done nothing but rationalize your beliefs to yourself. you need to wake up and realize that there is no war of men versus women. both suffer from certain cultural expectations and practices. you also need to realize that life experiences of men and women near and far from you will vary greatly from your experience. you have become very settled in your beliefs to the point of being a blind fanatic. to you, these issues are completely polarized when they are, in fact, just one huge blur,  i have statistical proofs to what i say. you do not. you have nothing but made up things and half truths; things made up and/or distorted from the truth by cleverly hiding the male side of the data for ideological reasons.  i did enjoy the ad hominem attacks, though. it seems that is your only way of communication here; with emotionally charged, logic-devoid arguments that attack the person, not the arguments and/or data.",1,

647307,"for the gay with more 'worldliness,' i think this is the core of some 'less-than-manly' behavior. in some places, the masculine roles played out can be seen to demonstrate hyper-aggressive behavior whilst increasingly projecting a feminine appearance. the slightly unanticipated convergence of the 'masculine' man dressing up in a more hipster-alternative/feminine way in contemporary society (flowing singlets and higher shorts, tight jeans and tight shirts) has probably confused the matter of a gay man's appearance.   some straight men who dress in such a way appear to me to be professing a kind of emotional empathy to women (represented by the more feminine clothing, perhaps appearing more approachable) whilst in complete contrast, attempting to assert their masculinity (maintaining an aggressive or arrogant tone and/or rejecting behavior that's not considered to be manly etc.). what i think this means is that an increasingly significant amount of heterosexual men desire to appear 'attractive' whilst maintaining traits like gender superiority and intra-gender hierarchy. a kind of imposition upon feminine ideals. this is probably something that the more insightful homosexual man may not want to agree with. seeing this hypocrisy, they might choose to act in a way which rejects this behavior. whether that be your typical 'flamer' with a flamboyant tone or your more 'kind but reserved' type of gay man, who wants to speak his mind in a loving, kind way.  in my opinion (and this was kinda put together slap-dash so... meh), gay men want to show people the parts of men that they believe are all too often rejected and hidden by their society's perception of manliness. they want to show people (sometimes through clothing, other times through expression) that men are capable of appreciating the human condition, too. it's a kinda subtle form of social protest, but if you think of all the things that gay men have to go through, we sort of justify the stuff we wear by our ability to wear it proudly, clearly rejecting society's prejudices which have impeded us developmentally, before. it's hard being oppressed, so when you get the chance to show yourself for who you want to be, it's just as hard to stifle it.",1,

385958,"human males have a directional sexuality and this also applies to bisexuals.  at any given time a bi-guy has a predominately subconscious sexual preference; bisexuals however are those males that are capable of exceeding their directional orientation.  conversely non-lesbian women have no sexual directionality.  **so what does that mean?**  well if you are not bisexual then it's impossible to understand bisexuality.  the subconscious brain will only deliver up fantasy in one flavor, you only dream about one sex, you're biologically responding to a single sexual stimulus.  unless your brain is bisexual, it seems like a load of bullshit when you hear about it because you have no experience with the process.  **also we get bleed over into social issues:**  a bisexual male enters into adulthood with a feminine focused sexuality but feels 'liberated' and is now mature enough to admit his sexuality.  with enough exposure to homosexual pornography and sex, the subconscious (this only applies to bisexual brains) can change it's directional sexuality.  for example you now *you wake up from dreams remembering an all guy orgy on the conan o'brien show while nine inch nails sings ""suck"" on stage.*  where as before you dreamed about that hot cheerleader you made out with at sadie hawkins.  the guy in our example is the **same guy** as before and is just as capable of having intercourse with both sexes.  however his biological drive switched directions.  it was previously programmed by the heterosexual universe; parental examples, first hand experience, mass media, all saying 'be straight.'  so this guy seems to an outside observer as a guy primarily talking about heterosexual sex slowly evolving into a gay male, with a focus on same-sex encounters.  this is exceedingly similar to a male focused sexuality guy slowly finding the courage to admit he is gay.  **unless we interviewed the two guys, their actions seems to be identical to an outside observer.**  also directional sexuality seems to be nearly immutable even for bisexuals.  you are only likely to have one or two changes ever in your lifetime if it is even possible. for example **predominately heterosexual and predominately homosexual males have zero capacity to change their directional sexuality.**  lesbians can't change their directional sexuality either.  whatever your directional sexuality is will be the predominately biased focus of your sexual experience over your lifetime.  if you're feminine focused bisexual male, you will *mostly* have sex with women.  this can easily be interpreted as the ""straight guy thats just horny"" or as experimentation before settling down.  most bisexual men that *can* find love with a woman and settle down in the comfortable heterosexual universe, will do so.  this can make those individuals seem like non-existent numbers on some survey, queer straw men that are invisible to the population.  **so if your a gay guy:**  you encounter peers that grew up with a great deal of fear and hatred about their sexuality; slowly ""evolving"" through a bisexual stage before coming out as gay later on.  you also then encounter a collage of men that sleep with both women and guys but the majority settle on with women and leave the lgbt community behind.  some of those guys, although capable of being aroused by both sexes, develop a preference for men and stay inside the lgbt community.  they blend in and are hard to identify and therefore don't have a meaningful bisexual identity.  *finally bisexual women and men that leave a same sex partner for an opposite sex partner, engender really harsh feelings.  there is a bias based in reality that bisexual people can cause you intense emotional pain.*",1,

238978,"this is a bold question.  i'm not surprised it doesn't come up more often, as it possibly separates by gender.  i'd be curious about any real science on the subject, i don't even know where to begin looking for such.  so, since we're constrained in the hypothetical, i'll take a guess.  this issue is on my mind frequently.  i don't think homosexuality is a choice... for everyone.  but it can be.  i personally think the average person's sexuality will take the shape of their surroundings.  on this premise i suppose that *if* one gender had a stronger sex drive, more sex in general would be had.  the other factor is environment itself.  society (modern american) is much more permissive about male sexuality in general, but at the same time male homosexuality is stigmatized harshly.  females have traditionally been denied sexual pleasure for most of our history, with homosexuality also harshly stigmatized.  so, all things being equal, i don't think society is more accepting of one genders gay sex.  i think the real question is: does society *value* the sexuality of one gender over another?  i think this can be measured in economic terms.  i look over the vast ocean of internet pornography, and the trade in prostitution, and male sex looks to be in very, very low demand.  this looks like an interesting study to that point: http://psr.sagepub.com/content/8/4/339.short edit: after reading (all 73 pages) of this paper, it's clear this is simply an essay and not a study of any scientific merit.  i find some interesting point but mainly a bunch of spurious claims based on inadequate assumptions and theories.  therefor i have to agree that men have higher sex drives than women. i think some men with unsatisfying sex lives choose to become bisexual.  this also happens among women of course, but i'd guess it's on a much smaller scale, and mostly influenced by the quality of heterosexual sex available; converse to quantity on the male side.  now, having set myself up to push my pet agenda:  lesbian ""deathbed"" not withstanding, i'd guess that the group with the lowest sex drives are long-term monogamous couples of any gender.  i think here we will find true gender parity.",1,

871084,"no, no worries. i appreciate you being inquisitive, it's fairly refreshing. this is a rather large topic, i might warn you, and you would do well to ask many people. see [r/lgbt](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt) for more answers to this as well as [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queer). you may also find [wikipedia's article on lgbt history interesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_history).  the term ""queer"" emerged both as an umbrella term for non-straight people as well as a rather specific (though varied) identity. there is a fair amount of history, which i'll cover briefly.   i'd like to start by saying, and i'm sure you're at least peripherally aware, that all of these terms are historically contingent. ""homosexual"" and indeed ""heterosexual"" were neologisms of the 1860s, coined by a karl-maria kertbeny and popularized by a psychiatrist named richard von kraft-ebbing. von kraft ebbing developed the foundation for much of how we currently view (and pathologize) sex and sexuality. he also coined the terms sadism and masochism. beyond von kraft-ebbings' clinical pathologization of people who had non-normative sexual identities, mainstream culture of the time referred to who we now consider transgendered people as ""fairies"", and who we now consider gay men as sodomites. there was a particular shift that occurred here which is important, where non-normative sexuality transferred over from being conceived of as morally wrong to being mental illness. often, it was both.      between the late 1960s to early 1980s, various (liberal) ""gay"" rights and (radical) ""gay"" liberation movements propagated around the united states and the world. many of the liberation movements had a much more prevalent anti-capitalist, anti heterosexist, anti-patriarchal and anti-racist ethos than the gay rights groups, who were (and still are) seen by many as assimilationist. the gay rights groups tended to center their demands around being accepted by the straight majority, and this acceptance being codified legally through various amendments and so forth. these folks became very visible: human rights campaign fund, lambda legal, and so on, were very successful at corralling funds into fighting for ""equality"" in terms of marriage, military service, and to be seen as essentially equal opposites of straight people. they're often made up of middle and upper class gays and lesbians, and don't as a whole have much of a critique of structural oppressions: rather, their focus is on symbolic ones. these are the folks responsible for the creation of the straight/gay binary, and it is from their political action that we've come to understand gays and straights as being monolithic, unchanging, resolute identities: it was central to their task of acceptance by the majority to reflect the majority's self conception.   on the other hand, liberation groups have fought to have a much broader understanding of gender and sexuality that doesn't have parameters or binaries- more, sexuality and gender are seen as continuums where people identify themselves, present and express various genders, or notions of a gender. if you look around, you'll see many different representations of masculinity echoed through various cultures and subcultures. moreover, these movements divorce gender from sex, and sexuality from gender: people are seen as male or female socialized/assigned-at-birth, which has more to do with how they present at any given point in their ontology than a biological factor such as chromosomal arrangements or genitalia. for example, women don't wear high heels because they have uteruses, they wear them because they are socialized that that is the acceptable footwear.  all of this goes into what is seen as ""queer"". queerness is a resistance culture and an identity based around sexuality and gender, against the policing of bodies, sexual habits, and gender presentations that is so commonplace in our society. people who identify as queer can be of any gender or sex, more than anything they typically recognize their sexuality and gender as fluid and not-easily confined to a monolithic label such as gay or straight. queers are not the same as bisexual, as bisexuality inherently only acknowledges two sexes; queer people recognize a multiplicity of sexes and genders. queerness is more easily relatable to pansexuality, though the two terms are not synonymous.   the liberation movements have remained much less visible, which makes sense given that we have a society structured around capitalism and heterosexuality. here is one example of a current manifestation of a queer liberation group called the radical homosexual agenda, based out of nyc:  if you listen to the human rights campaign or the liberal politicians, you’d think all queers wanted to sign their life away to uncle sam or get “married” and have kids. but queer liberation reaches way beyond these issues.      the queer liberation groups of the 60s and 70s had much broader social visions. they were anti-war, they fought for economic rights and agitated for free speech and a greater vision of democracy.      in the downsizing of our dreams that occurred during the last several decades, mainstream lgbtq groups have forgotten these connections. they’d rather feed queer soldiers to bush’s war than fight the military-industrial complex. they forget that, even more than marriage, the majority of queers also need affordable housing and health care. and this is convenient for these groups and politicians, since they’re underwritten by corporations whose very existences are threatened by steps towards economic equality and a more egalitarian democracy.",1,
251388,"they actually fit pretty well once you understand the original context. i'll leave out the ones that i have nothing to say on, since they fairly well stand on their own or have been worked to death.  first: ""thou shalt have no other gods before me"" *was* actually indicative of the fact that yhwh didn't really give a damn whether he was part of a pantheon or the sole recipient of worship, so long as he was primary. the early hebrews were polytheistic.  not going to touch the second one, though i think it has more to do with a presumption of seeing that which is unseen. the hebrews who worshiped the golden calf, after all, gave it the name of yhwh.  &gt; thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain; for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  this is simple contract enforcement. if you swore to do something, and swore by the name of yhwh, and didn't follow through, you were eternally fucked. dante took this into account when he buried oathbreakers in the ninth circle.  &gt; remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  the christians changed their day of worship to what we now call sunday to commemorate the resurrection. joseph smith was just an ignorant ass.  &gt; when i first wrote this down, i wrote murder but i double checked exodus 20 and it does say kill (at least it does in my lds scriptures app for my ipod.   ""murder"" fits the translation better. after all, the word ""kill"" is so nonspecific that it includes accidental killings that are explicitly not-condemned elsewhere. you cannot be executed, for instance, if your axehead flies off and kills a guy when you're out cutting wood. you don't even have to pay a *bot*.  only intentional slaying is covered.  &gt;  of course, the revised 10 commandments given later to moses stated that sexual intercourse was for marriage only and railed against gays saying ""a man shalt not lie with another man"".  that prohibition is in the section with religious prohibitions, such as not boiling the kid in its mother's milk, which was a fertility rite in other canaanite cultures. the lying ""with a man as one lies with a woman"" was a prohibition against homosexual temple prostitution. i think there's a straight-up prohibition against heterosexual temple whoring in there somewhere, too.   besides, a lot of that is levitical interpretation of the original ten commandments. it helps if you think of it as a religious constitution and the levites as the supreme court clan.  &gt; this is a good commandment though the ransackingof the canaanites and taking the land they were on might constitute stealing.  **or** the ancient israelites were looking to justify their genocide. they were human, too.  &gt; thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour's.  people rag on the treatment of women in this commandment, and i really don't get it. doesn't it make sense to group these things, since no matter what you end up using the genitive case?  it's just one of those things that doesn't need to be said because it's redundant and side-tracks from the discussion at hand. it's like running out into the middle of the street, shouting ""oh, no! bronze-age peoples were barbaric by modern standards!""  &gt; you're forbidden to think of something  nonono, the thinking prohibitions come later, with jesus. this can be seen as simply a condemnation of conspiring to deprive your neighbor of his shit.",0,
637008,"the book ""transgender history"" spends a few chapters on the subject. essentially when the gay &amp; lesbian movements first started up there was a lot of splintering that occurred. lesbian groups hated the drag queens of stone wall for example, because they viewed the drag queens' existence to be ""a mockery of all women.""  here's a snipped from the book... (this is when the anti-trans ideas in radical feminism really got started)  ""the fallout began in december 1972 when a trans woman named beth elliot was ousted from the daughters of bilitis, not because of any accusations against her but on the grounds that she wasn't ""really"" a woman; several other members resigned in protest over that decision. meanwhile elliot also served on the organizing committee of the west coast lesbian feminist conference, planned for april of 1973 in los angeles, and she had been asked to perform as a singer in the conference's entertainment program. the gutter dykes leafleted the conference to protest the presence there of a 'man' (elliot), and keynote speaker robin morgan, recently arrived from the east coast, hastily expanded her address to incorporate elements of the brewing controversy. all of her incorporation seem to have come from separatist material, and none from elliot and her supporters. morgan's speech titled ""'lesbianism and feminism: synonyms of contradictions?' was subsequently published in her memoir *going too far: the personal chronicle of a feminist*, and it was widely anthologized. more than twelve hundred women at the conference, which turned out to be the largest lesbian gathering to date- listened to the speech first hand. for many attendees, the controversy over beth elliot's participation in the west coast lesbian feminist conference was their first encounter with the 'transgender question,' and what transpired there would inform opinions nationwide.   'all hell broke loose that very first night, caused by the gatecrashing presence of a male transvestite who insisted that he was 1: an invited participant, 2: really a woman, and 3: at a heart a lesbian.' morgan wrote in the introductory notes to *going to far*. 'it was incredible that so many strong angry women should be divided by one smug male in granny glasses and an earth-mother gown.' in the 1973 speech itself, morgan asked her audience why some of them felt compelled to defend 'the obscenity of male transvestism' and to 'permit into our organizations... men who deliberately reemphasize gender roles, and who parody female oppression and suffering.' 'no,' she continued, displaying her inability to distinguish between male-to-female transexual life contexts and episodic gay drag or heterosexual cross-dressing: 'i will not call a male a she; thirty-two years of suffering in this androcentric society and of surviving, have earned me the title of woman; one walk down the street by a male transvestite, five minutes of his being hassled (which he may enjoy), and then he dares, he dares to think he understands our pain? no, in our mothers' names and in our own, we must not call him sister.'  morgan then went on to accuse elliot of 'leeching off women who have spent entire lives as women in women's bodies.' and ended her personal attack by declaiming 'i charge him as an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer- with the mentality of a rapist.' morgen then called upon the conference attendees to vote on ejecting elliot, saying 'you can let him into your workshops- or you can *deal* with him.' according to writers for the lesbian tide, more than two-thirds of those present voted to allow elliot to remain, but the antitransexual faction refused to accept the popular results and promised to disrupt the conference if their demands were not met. eventually, after much rancorous debate, beth elliot went on to perform but thereafter left the remainder of the conference.   conference members brought news of the elliot controversy back to women's communities across the country, and throughout the middle years of the 1970's, the 'transexual rapist' trope began to circulate in grassroots lesbian networks as the most extreme version of an antipathy toward transgender people rooted in the concepts of ""women identification"" and ""women-only space.""   the culmination of antitransgender discourse would later be consolidated into one grand narrative, written by janice g. raymond: *the transsexual empire: the making of the she-male.*",1,1

595415,"***for anyone who can't click through to the story (mobile or can't be bothered)***  .  **houston judge limits rights of gay father**  a houston judge entered an order on june 24 which prohibits a father from leaving his children alone with *any man* they aren’t related to “by blood or adoption.” because there was no allegation of abuse in the case, family law practitioners say the order is an unheard of infringement on the rights of parents and a judicial condemnation of the fact that the man, william flowers, is not only gay but married to his partner, jim evans.  william and jim were married on march 19 of last year in connecticut, one of seven states which recognize same-sex unions. it was a second marriage for both.  when william and his ex-wife divorced in 2004, they agreed that their three children would live with her. wanting to change the arrangement, william recently filed for custody in harris county. a jury found that she should keep the kids, though his regular visitations would continue. neither william nor his ex-wife alleged that the children had been abused or were in any danger of being abused.  following the trial, harris county associate judge charley e. prine, jr. issued a ruling which included an injunction applicable only to william. it prohibits him from leaving his children alone with any male to whom the kids are not related by “blood or adoption.” so if, for example, william wants to visit his mother in the hospital (where she’s been for several weeks), he can’t leave his kids at home with his husband. as written, the injunction also prohibits male doctors, teachers and pastors from being alone with the children.  attorneys who practice family law in texas point out that in cases of abuse, it is common for courts to prevent children from being alone with specific people. but those same lawyers say that they’ve never heard of a case in which a step-parent or long-term partner is permanently enjoined from being alone with his or her step-children when abuse is not even alleged, let alone proven. no lawyer consulted for this story has ever heard of an order which prohibits children from being left alone with an entire gender.  judge prine could have issued what family lawyers call a “morality clause,” which, during certain hours, prohibits the presence in the household of people with whom the parent is having a “dating or intimate relationship” or those to whom the parent is not related “by blood or marriage.” because texas does not recognize same-sex marriage and prohibits the state from recognizing unions performed elsewhere, lawyers acknowledge that had judge prine issued such an order, it would have forced jim to move out, at least while the children were around.  the primary mandate of family courts is to protect the best interest of the child. so why erect barriers to the functioning of william and jim’s family in the first place?  stereotypes, misconceptions, bigotry and fear of lesbians, gays and their families abound. there is, for example, a widespread belief held by many opponents of gay rights that homosexual men are more likely to molest children than heterosexuals. though the belief is utterly false and based on nothing but animus toward gays, extremists have combined scientific quackery and bigoted rhetoric to paint gays as pedophiliac sex junkies. a corollary and equally laughable belief — usually promoted by self-parodying hysterical bigots — holds that gays and lesbians engage in campaigns to recruit children into the “homosexual lifestyle.”  is it possible that judge prine believes that the children’s step-father or another gay man is more likely than a heterosexual to molest the kids or turn them into brainwashed zombie drag queens? because the case is still pending and citing the texas code of judicial conduct, judge prine declined to comment. but lawyers who practice family law in houston (and requested anonymity) described the order as patently anti-gay.  jennifer broussard, william’s ex-wife’s lawyer, doesn’t believe that the order was motivated by bigotry. she confirmed that no allegation of abuse or neglect was made during the trial but insists that even in cases in which abuse is not alleged, injunctions such as the one issued here are common. in this case, she said, it was appropriate to enter the injunction whether william’s new spouse’s name “was jim or jane.” though she said that in her more than two decades of practice she had seen such orders many times, she said finding specific examples would “take hours” and declined to do so. when asked whether there would be an appellate record of such orders, broussard speculated that because they are so common, they were unlikely to have ever been challenged and thus would be absent from the caselaw.  instead, broussard suggested that teresa waldrop, who is board certified in family law and a member the of the family law sections of the state bar of texas and houston bar association, would be likely to provide specific examples. in an interview, waldrop noted that while morality clauses are fairly common, she had never seen an injunction like this one.  waldrop suggested that austin family law attorney jennifer cochran might have greater insight. after being read the injunction, cochran said that not only had she never seen such an order, the provision is “just not reasonable.” the fact that william can’t leave the children alone with any man to whom they aren’t related by blood or adoption “strikes at the very heart of the fact that he’s gay…it’s judicial activism, legislating from the bench,” and has nothing to do with protecting the best interests of the children, said cochran.  william says he will appeal.",1,
650803,"essentially, if i have all my dates straight, it would mean that anatomically modern humans evolved somewhere in the middle east, and then migrated to africa and europe. as for the gap, there are probably 2 or 3 main causes.  1. if you're about to die, and you want to end up as a fossil skeleton the vast majority of resting places will not result in you being fossilized. conditions really have to be perfect, which is why you hear so much about cave sites having early modern human fossils. exposure to elements is low, and there's a possibility of being quickly covered by sediments that wont just dissolve bone. so if you're being buried out on a nice pasture on top of a hill that will probably erode in a couple thousand years expecting to enjoy your fossil-afterlife, good luck.  aside from that, even if you end up in a cave, there's always the possibility that you're going to get chewed up by some scavenger and scattered all over the place.   2 and 3 really boil down to a sound research plan and luck. you can't just excavate every cave in the middle east. and even if you do, you sure as hell will not be able to excavate every square foot of that cave.  time and money are very limiting factors in archaeology.   as for religious folks in archaeology. there are plenty. i know quite a few muslims and christians who dig. i don't know all their views on evolution, but i've never met an anthropologist/archaeologist who professed belief in creationism.",0,

as soon as the nazis assumed power in 1933, the zionists gained a visibly protected political status. after the reich-stag fire, the nazis crushed virtually all political opposition and closed 600 newspapers. but not the zionists nor their newspaper which was hawked from every street corner, and saw its circulation multiply five times to 38,000. zionism was ""the only separate political philosophy sanctioned by the third reich."" the zionist uniform was the only non-nazi uniform allowed in germany. same with their flag. hebrew was mandated in jewish schools. still german jews wanted to stay in germany ""even as second class citizens, even reviled and persecuted."" but the zionists scorned the german jews saying they deserved to be persecuted for wanting to assimilate.  then came the zionist funded holocaust  the older generations can vouch for it in germany, little bit different than what the main stream dissemination (media) will ever tell you, but none the less the truth  after ww2 the nazis/zionists scientific operations were moved from germany to the united states under operation paper-clip forming organisations like the cia and nasa etc and america became the new foreign military corporation for the rothschild league of bankers and the zionists new dog.  ................................................................................................  **the zionist media steers the american public like sheep into what ever paddock they want them on any issue**  moving the ideology of the people since 1915.  u.s. congressional record february 9, 1917, page 2947  mr. callaway: “in march, 1915, the j.p. morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the united states and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the united states"".  mr. callaway: “these 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. they found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. the 25 papers were agreed upon;

686716,"this reply is huge and thought out, so i'd like you to read it since i understand where you're coming from but want to engage in a conversation.  i'll try to supply tl;dr's to points in which i can do them justice, but please read the whole thing.  &gt;the more people who engage in homosexual acts, the more people are sinning.  the way i always understood the concept of sin is the example of ""crap brownies.""  it doesn't matter if you have the best brownies ever made, if you were aware before eating that even a small amount of dog crap was in the brownies, you'd have no interest in eating them-the same amount of disinterest as if it was made entirely out of crap.  granted, now that i'm older, i realize this doesn't take into consideration whether you stand to gain anything from eating these brownies, but that's besides the point for now.  in a similar manner, even the slightest sin makes you absolutely repulsive in the eyes of a sinless god which would make lying equally as detestable as homosexuality and murder.  this notion of one sin being greater than the other is a manmade concept we use to comfort ourselves when coming to grips with a god that is judgment.  &gt;&gt;tl;dr to god, you're either perfect or you're as sinful as the ""worst"" murderer  &gt;i think relationship should be based on love rather than lust.  that, i'd have to say, is an iffy one.  first, not every relationship in a person's life should be judged as, ""am i going to marry this person/spend the rest of my life with them?""  that puts an awful lot of pressure on your so from the beginning.  i was always under the impression that if god works in mysterious ways, than even the most lust-filled relationship you experience will shape you in some way to fulfill whatever is in god's plan for you.  i could go on and on, but if i do, you might get the wrong impression that i'm attacking you, so i'll save more elaboration on this point unless you ask me to continue.  &gt;&gt;tl;dr god works in mysterious ways and these relationships could shape you into who you're meant to be if you're meant to be in them.  &gt;when relationships are based in lust, more people get hurt  i get the feeling this is a generality not really based on experience or anecdote, but just something drawn from thin air.  i really don't mean to sound like i'm attacking you, but this is way too general for me to see any actual strength behind it.  if i had to apply a label to myself, i'd have to call myself bisexual.  i'm sure it might be difficult to believe considering the portrayal of non-heterosexual lifestyles on tv or within stereotypes, but ever since i hit puberty, i've known deep in my heart that i would love to be a dad.(edit: for clarification, i never saw any point to sleeping around or relationships without emotion.  that's all i've wanted for as long as i can remember)  i could be dirt poor and i would still do everything in my power to protect my child because i just know i'm built to love this little person with every inch of my being.  if i'm alone, i wouldn't want to put a child in that environment.  i'm sure certain people could take care of a child on their own, but i definitely want my child to grow up in a loving environment with two parents, regardless if one is a mother or not.  now, as a bisexual, i could indeed end up with a woman, but ponder the closeted gay man.  he lives a lie his whole life and marries a woman to appease those around him.  is an environment of dishonesty with fake love really a healthy place for a growing child?  &gt;&gt;tl;dr if the parents are loving, the child should flourish.  if a marriage is based on lies, what does that teach the child and is that really a better option?  &gt;the bonds between humans in society are weaker  i have yet to participate in a gay marriage or adoption, so i can't offer any anecdotal evidence supporting or denying this point from firsthand experience, but i did attend a service the week that massachusetts first legalized gay marriage.  i sat for an entire 2 hours listening to a pastor suggesting that gay marriage would weaken the country and would harm straight marriages.  as of then, i was probably in 6th or 7th grade and considered myself homosexual and i can't even express in words how it feels to be a labelled a villain at that age, which .  my good friend's lesbian mother also attended that service and left a few weeks later when, without her permission, they posted her name and ""struggle"" in a newsletter asking for prayer.  basically, my point is that if anything regarding marriage weakens societies bonds, it's the demonization of something you don't understand.  &gt;&gt;tl;dr telling someone they are weakening society(especially without supporting such a vague statement with anything concrete) simply weakens the bond between you and that person.  society is left unscathed  &gt;i believe every child should have a mother and a father.  i understand you ""believe"" it so you're not going to consider another side, but this isn't based on anything at all.  the concept of homosexuals adopting children is relatively new(or at least the mainstream coverage) so there isn't a definitive study for every single situation, but i did find a [study](http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1994480,00.html) that suggests that:  &gt;the authors found that children raised by lesbian mothers — whether the mother was partnered or single — scored very similarly to children raised by heterosexual parents on measures of development and social behavior. these findings were expected, the authors said; however, they were surprised to discover that children in lesbian homes scored higher than kids in straight families on some psychological measures of self-esteem and confidence, did better academically and were less likely to have behavioral problems, such as rule-breaking and aggression.  &gt;&gt;tl;dr lesbian parents are equal to heterosexual parents, even when there's only one lesbian mom.  the kids score equally in intelligence, but the lesbians' kids are better adapted.",1,

437185,"while bashing king, the newsletters had kind words for the former imperial wizard of the ku klux klan, david duke. in a passage titled ""the duke's victory,"" a newsletter celebrated duke's 44 percent showing in the 1990 louisiana republican senate primary. ""duke lost the election,"" it said, ""but he scared the blazes out of the establishment."" in 1991, a newsletter asked, ""is david duke's new prominence, despite his losing the gubernatorial election, good for anti-big government forces?"" the conclusion was that ""our priority should be to take the anti-government, anti-tax, anti-crime, anti-welfare loafers, anti-race privilege, anti-foreign meddling message of duke, and enclose it in a more consistent package of freedom."" duke is now returning the favor, telling me that, while he will not formally endorse any candidate, he has made information about ron paul available on his website.  like blacks, gays earn plenty of animus in paul's newsletters. they frequently quoted paul's ""old colleague,"" congressman william dannemeyer--who advocated quarantining people with aids--praising him for ""speak[ing] out fearlessly despite the organized power of the gay lobby."" in 1990, one newsletter mentioned a reporter from a gay magazine ""who certainly had an axe to grind, and that's not easy with a limp wrist."" in an item titled, ""the pink house?"" the author of a newsletter--again, presumably paul--complained about president george h.w. bush's decision to sign a hate crimes bill and invite ""the heads of homosexual lobbying groups to the white house for the ceremony,"" adding, ""i miss the closet."" ""homosexuals,"" it said, ""not to speak of the rest of society, were far better off when social pressure forced them to hide their activities."" when marvin liebman, a founder of the conservative young americans for freedom and a longtime political activist, announced that he was gay in the pages of national review, a paul newsletter implored, ""bring back the closet!"" surprisingly, one item expressed ambivalence about the contentious issue of gays in the military, but ultimately concluded, ""homosexuals, if admitted, should be put in a special category and not allowed in close physical contact with heterosexuals.""  the newsletters were particularly obsessed with aids, ""a politically protected disease thanks to payola and the influence of the homosexual lobby,"" and used it as a rhetorical club to beat gay people in general. in 1990, one newsletter approvingly quoted ""a well-known libertarian editor"" as saying, ""the act-up slogan, on stickers plastered all over manhattan, is 'silence = death.' but shouldn't it be 'sodomy = death'?"" readers were warned to avoid blood transfusions because gays were trying to ""poison the blood supply."" ""am i the only one sick of hearing about the 'rights' of aids carriers?"" a newsletter asked in 1990. that same year, citing a christian-right fringe publication, an item suggested that ""the aids patient"" should not be allowed to eat in restaurants and that ""aids can be transmitted by saliva,"" which is false. paul's newsletters advertised a book, surviving the aids plague--also based upon the casual-transmission thesis--and defended ""parents who worry about sending their healthy kids to school with aids victims."" commenting on a rise in aids infections, one newsletter said that ""gays in san francisco do not obey the dictates of good sense,"" adding: ""[t]hese men don't really see a reason to live past their fifties. they are not married, they have no children, and their lives are centered on new sexual partners."" also, ""they enjoy the attention and pity that comes with being sick.""  the rhetoric when it came to jews was little better. the newsletters display an obsession with israel; no other country is mentioned more often in the editions i saw, or with more vitriol. a 1987 issue of paul's investment letter called israel ""an aggressive, national socialist state,"" and a 1990 newsletter discussed the ""tens of thousands of well-placed friends of israel in all countries who are willing to wok [sic] for the mossad in their area of expertise."" of the 1993 world trade center bombing, a newsletter said, ""whether it was a setup by the israeli mossad, as a jewish friend of mine suspects, or was truly a retaliation by the islamic fundamentalists, matters little.""  paul's newsletters didn't just contain bigotry. they also contained paranoia--specifically, the brand of anti-government paranoia that festered among right-wing militia groups during the 1980s and '90s. indeed, the newsletters seemed to hint that armed revolution against the federal government would be justified. in january 1995, three months before right-wing militants bombed the murrah federal building in oklahoma city, a newsletter listed ""ten militia commandments,"" describing ""the 1,500 local militias now training to defend liberty"" as ""one of the most encouraging developments in america."" it warned militia members that they were ""possibly under batf [bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms] or other totalitarian federal surveillance"" and printed bits of advice from the sons of liberty, an anti-government militia based in alabama--among them, ""you can't kill a hydra by cutting off its head,"" ""keep the group size down,"" ""keep quiet and you're harder to find,"" ""leave no clues,"" ""avoid the phone as much as possible,"" and ""don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.""  the newsletters are chock-full of shopworn conspiracies, reflecting paul's obsession with the ""industrial-banking-political elite"" and promoting his distrust of a federally regulated monetary system utilizing paper bills. they contain frequent and bristling references to the bilderberg group, the trilateral commission, and the council on foreign relations--organizations that conspiracy theorists have long accused of seeking world domination. in 1978, a newsletter blamed david rockefeller, the trilateral commission, and ""fascist-oriented, international banking and business interests"" for the panama canal treaty, which it called ""one of the saddest events in the history of the united states."" a 1988 newsletter cited a doctor who believed that aids was created in a world health organization laboratory in fort detrick, maryland. in addition, ron paul &amp; associates sold a video about waco produced by ""patriotic indiana lawyer linda thompson""--as one of the newsletters called her--who maintained that waco was a conspiracy to kill atf agents who had previously worked for president clinton as bodyguards. as with many of the more outlandish theories the newsletters cited over the years, the video received a qualified endorsement: ""i can't vouch for every single judgment by the narrator, but the film does show the depths of government perfidy, and the national police's tricks and crimes,"" the newsletter said, adding, ""send your check for $24.95 to our houston office, or charge the tape to your credit card at 1-800-ron-paul.""  when i asked jesse benton, paul's campaign spokesman, about the newsletters, he said that, over the years, paul had granted ""various levels of approval"" to what appeared in his publications--ranging from ""no approval"" to instances where he ""actually wrote it himself."" after i read benton some of the more offensive passages, he said, ""a lot of [the newsletters] he did not see. most of the incendiary stuff, no."" he added that he was surprised to hear about the insults hurled at martin luther king, because ""ron thinks martin luther king is a hero.""",1,

984508,"well, if the atheists in question grew up in a place where it's unthinkable to not be christian (though catholics are okay - they'll burn in hell, but they're almost alright, as far as dirty heathens go), then it's a very hard struggle to be accepted when you say: ""i just don't believe in god"". it might even be hard to have the statement accepted - people will try to circumvent your opinions (of course you believe in god, you've just forgotten how to), they will try to argument against your personal beliefs, and these atheists will see these aspects in all christians they meet.  after fighting for a long time, it's difficult to meet new people, and not be on guard.  this is not entirely dissimilar to the behaviour of some gays of the old brigade, who were relentlessly attacked for so many years, that they can no longer relax about their sexuality, as the newer generations of gays can. these are the ones who bash heterosexuals, label them ""breeders"", and try to ""convert"" straight people to homosexuality.  basically, what i'm saying is: it's the fault of closeminded christians, and it can be made right by being openminded. always remember that they don't hate *you* - they hate someone who looks like you. if you show them that you're different, it'll show them that you're an alright person.  every hurled insult is a test, to see how you react. it's a strike back at the world who failed to recognize them as thinking, feeling individuals who chose to choose what to believe in.  i'm an atheist who grew up with parents who were part of the missionary movement, but when i was old enough to question praying at the table, it was no longer mandatory for me to do so, and my beliefs were at all times my own choice (as much as it is any kids' - i was also told about santa claus and the tooth fairy). i never went through the ""militant atheist""-phase, but i have full solidarity for those for whom it is important.  also, some atheists are just disphits. i'm certain that there are some who become atheists, *just* so they can look down on those who aren't just like there are vegetarians like that - for the most part, though, the kids are allright.  p.p.s. yeah, i think dawkins and hitchens should grow up, and stop attacking christians for being christians. the rebellious phase is not cool once your hair is white.",1,

632214,"&gt;i understand that, but i was taking it to a personal level. this is your kid being bullied. he didn't sign up to be a part of a revolution. if he takes the torch, i would be so proud, but that isn't his responsibility.  yes, and for exactly that reason i would support my child, whatever their decision may be. i wouldn't encourage them to be girly/boyish, nor would i discourage them. maybe they'll decide that despite being bullied, being yourself is the best thing to do. maybe they'll decide it isn't worth it. either decision is fine. but i wouldn't make that decision for them because it's not me being bullied, it's not my life, not my childhood.. i don't know if that's being overly idealistic, but i consider it to be the right thing to do.  &gt;there was a thread on reddit about a guy who was being harassed by his neighbors. someone asked him why he wasn't taking a stand, and he replied that he had a wife and two kids. taking a stand against bullies wasn't his first priority. i don't blame him, as i don't my uncle.  what kind of harassment was it, though? was he targeted, or his family? because that'd be a different situation altogether. one is changing yourself (or not), the other is changing someone else.  &gt;i'm an apologist to the extent that i feel that i can't personally change the system. i will do their best to lead by example, but i don't want to make a protest. you can say that the system sucks, but in truth, gays are quite comfortable. they have access to food, shelter, and relative luxury. am i saying their rights shouldn't be expanded and that they aren't being persecuted? nope, but i'm saying their persecution, i don't believe, is worth an atticus finch style fight where i risk the lives of my family as well. and this, i feel is true of many gays. you don't see gays rioting and molotoving authority because they think they are being so oppressed. they are comfortable enough. i'm not saying their situation is right, but i'm saying it's not at libya status yet.  well, it depends on where you live. in some places gay people go through hell and back. sometimes they're killed for being gay. many have been assaulted for being gay. in the majority of countries, their relationships are not recognized by the state. of course not every gay person is treated like a sub-human, but even so, if you get discriminated against just a tiny bit each and every day at some point it really gets to you. so i really can't fault anyone who openly and fervently fights for gay rights, nor will i condemn someone who makes their family a part of it.  &gt;i don't want to put my kid through pain if i can avoid it. it's not as if i'm condemning him. i'm pushing him towards more manly views. you might say this might as well be me condemning his ways, but i will make it clear to him the difference. i, being raised in the era of stupifying youth programs, realize that at an early age, i was mature enough to have some very serious talks. above the influence wasn't nearly as influential as the doctor who came to talk to us about the actual effects of tobacco and alcohol later.  no one wants to put their kids through pain, but no matter what you do, eventually they will go through it. it's a fact of life. i understand when parents want to minimize it, but a lot of them think of it in a really one-sided way. is being bullied painful? of course. is repressing your true self painful? of course it is. but how can you decide which is worse?  i'm not entirely sure where you're going with the youth programs here.  &gt;i would at the beginning. i come from a relatively blue leaning high school, and from the general consensus, people said that they were for homosexual rights. there was a lesbian couple a while back, and the couple literally became the talk of the school. this is inadvertent bullying. they were singled out, and it was not positive, let me tell you. the staring and the excited gossip, not necessarily bad gossip, was not fun (assuming i was in their shoes).  i'm sure that wasn't a nice experience for them. but hiding your relationship from the world isn't a nice experience either. you'll just have to decide which path you take for yourself.  &gt;to deny that bullying and social ostracization does not affect kids, for the majority, for the worse, i feel, is disingenuous.  as someone who has been the victim of both in the past, i concur. ;)  &gt;i would, in fact, try to lean my child towards being less openly gay if he could help it. once he reaches his 20s, i feel like he will have realized his true self.   i feel like i have to clear up some assumptions here. first, not all gays fit the stereotypes. i wouldn't be surprised if it was evenly split, in fact. just like there are heterosexual 'sissies' and 'tomboys', there are rough and tumble gay boys and sparkly princess lesbians. so unless you're talking about asking your son not to kiss so many boys in public, it's a bit of a weird argument.  secondly, almost all children know who they are and what they like at a really young age, and if they haven't realized it by the time puberty rolls around they definitely will then. it's like the argument that transgender children shouldn't transition because they might change their mind. if your son tells you that he fancies boys, that means he fancies boys; he may turn out to be bi, sure, but surely not straight. so i'm not sure what that 'true nature' is that you discover in your 20s. i'd have to yet discover it considering i'm 18..  &gt;i want to ensure him a childhood where he won't be made fun of in virtually every way until his peers reach maturity. i would make sure to tell him/her many times that i think it's okay. at the same time though, i would take indirect methods to try and push him to more manly things. buying him manly things would be an example. i wouldn't slap him and make him recite sports rules or anything barbaric like that though.  i don't think there's much of a difference between the 'barbaric' methods and what you say you would do, aside from the obvious child abuse that takes place in the former case. the idea is the same. the father who doesn't want this son to be a 'sissy boy' probably cares about him and doesn't want him to have a shit life. but does that excuse what he is doing? i think it's plain wrong to stifle your child's self-expression and identity. it's one of the most horrible things you can do to them as a parent. in my experience there is a world of difference between peers disapproving of you versus your parent doing so. and if you tell your kid 'it's okay to be gay' but at the same time ask him to 'tone it down', that would just make him resent you for being a hypocrite.  &gt;and again, i think this boils down to how much you want to see your child suffer for a cause you truly believe in. (tl;dr) trust me when i say i believe in the gay rights cause, but also trust me when i say that i would not want my kid to be seen as a gay for the exact same reasons why i, so fervently, support the gay rights movement.  in response to this, i redirect you to my first paragraph of this reply.  &gt;and i just have to add: i have never seen so few downvotes. i use res, and it's simply amazing. 18 upvotes and nary a downvote. reddiquette really is followed. it's amazing.  yay truereddit. =)",1,

317034,"let me clear something up, first. i firmly believe that homosexual relationships and hetero relationships both have equal validity and footing in a personal and social sense. sexuality is not black and white, therefore the factors the attract two humans together to form a loving relationship are many and varied. one should not derive all of their self-worth from their sexual identity/sexuality. nor should any couple gay or straight base the solidity of their personal relationships on over all public sentiment. my argument and position is a legal/technical/clinical one. homosexual couples enjoy a good portion of rights and benefits that heterosexual couples do. but not all. getting that last 10% of legal benefits is a struggle. i don't care if a church or other institution does not spiritually recognize the validity of a couple (interracial, homo, hetero,etc...). nomorenicksleft, we agree on 90% of this issue. when we approach that last 10%, the last hurdle to full legal recognition (not public acceptance or the church down the street) suddenly the separate-but-equal mode of thought springs up. or silly statements like this:  &gt; every lame argument you make boils down to ""give me approval""   read the above paragraph. it is not a matter of ""give me approval"" or validation. it is granting the last few legal rights that have been withheld. such rights and legal benefits can vary by state. massachusetts, great. the ""give me approval"" is a strawman and distracts from the rather boring legal heart of the matter. it makes the issue seem like a self esteem problem or a temper tantrum. and due to such fierce opposition from gay marriage opponents, maybe it has become that on the part of homosexuals.     &gt;if you're asking for the acceptance of the public... then they have the power to grant or deny that. it's really quite simple.   i agree with public acceptance. whether you accept something is an individual choice. except you said:  &gt;that is, since qualified potential spouses do not interest you, you want to be able to substitute in those who are not.  the phrase ""qualified potential spouses"" is what is of interest. is it a ""publically acceptable"" qps or a legally qualified ps? i submit to you there is a distinction. legislating who you can and can not marry is simply wrong and a violation of civil rights.    &gt;you raise a good point, it's exactly like this! and just like those unsatisfied customers, you whine for the same thing. but henry ford wasn't your slave to control. instead of doing for themselves and building their own cars, people bitched and insisted that he do it for them.  this is what makes my analogy stunningly elegant. first of all, if there is a demand for a product a company had better well make and sell it. you would not have to build a whole new car from scratch, as your argument clearly implies, because a customer wants it blue. denying all legal benefits to gay couples through marriage is like ford and the government saying you can't own a car because you want it to be blue. (or in the homosexual case, physiologically/psychologically/genetically require it to be blue.) instead you would get a bicycle. for 90% of situations, a bike and car are practically the same and have the same utility.    &gt;yes, you would. but it's not your restaurant. go build your own if you don't like this one  with respect to my restaurant analogy. building a new place is ridiculous just to be able to have onion rings with a meal and have equal soda access and seating ability.  consider what you wrote here: &gt;why don't you make your own institution? call it gaymarriage and be done with it. no one stops you from making up goofy rituals.  fabulous! and i am sure many gay couples do. by saying goofy rituals, you seem to imply that is a personal private matter. cool. i agree. you can stomp on wine bottles, fill vases full of sand, or what ever you want. in the end, the people who stomp on wine bottles and the people who fill a vase with sand get the same legal protections and benefits. there should not be a legal distinction between catholic marriage, islamic marriage, protestant marriage, jewish marriage, thai marriage, shinto marriage, gay marriage.   that is my argument. plain and simple. what if you applied the ""go make your own"" logic to catholics or hispanics or native americans?  i would fully support a legal separate institution called ""gaycivilunion"" if it had the exact legal protections/benefits (not caring about public opinion) as the current version of marriage. but why make it separate if it is the exact same?  nomorenicksleft, you seem to be a rational human being. but when the issue is pressed to that last hurdle, a psychological switch is made. it becomes a personal issue and not a legal matter. ""give me acceptance"" and ""public acceptance"" both switched meanings and implications. legal or personal? which is it?   and legally, as recognized by the supreme court, separate but equal is not equal. no matter how similar, it is not equal.",1,

[well, they do.](http://www.health.am/psy/more/mental-disorder-risk-higher-in-gay-bisexual-adults/)  &gt; in an analysis of 25 past studies on sexual orientation and mental health, uk researchers found that across the studies, gay, lesbian and bisexual adults were at least 50 percent more likely than heterosexuals to have a history of depression or an anxiety disorder.  &gt; they also have similarly elevated risk of alcohol problems or other forms of substance abuse, and were more than twice as likely as heterosexuals to have attempted suicide at some point in their lives. depression, drug use, suicide ... all are significantly higher in people with homosexuality.  you're going to say that ""well that's because of the current social stigmata""  ... sure, yeah.  let's accept that as the sole cause.  if we discover what causes and can alter homosexuality, what would be the most pragmatic solution?  parents wishing and hoping that the past several thousand years of human behavior and attitudes towards homsexuality will change and become loving and caring towards their gay child, or opt to do what is necessary for the child to become straight?  this isn't like finding out the child is left-handed and may be inconvenienced at times living in a world of utensils made for the right-handed.  it is finding out that the child will have a major life-impacting deviation that will significantly limit their available partners and how they are viewed and fit into society (regardless of how much you want society to change).  i know this will be unpopular with liberal leaning reddit, but it's the brutal truth.  it would be better for the child to change it.  just as it would be to, say, correct a cosmetic defect that (while not affecting their health directly) would cause them social problems due to how society reacts to it.",1,

619063,"hostofthehungarians has it pretty right.   if you make it unknown if you are looking to date or not, but also flirt and have fun with girls, i find that they put a lot more energy into it. if they know you want them, they don´t put as much into it, because they know you will come to them.   if you tell them straight up that you don´t want to date, they will either take it personally and get offended, or will think you are just a slut looking to get laid (maybe? :)  ).   if it´s unknown, and you are a bit standoffish but still flirty enough to keep their interest, they invest much more energy into the chase, and turns out well much more often.   wanting to have fun (and being able to keep a conversation going), as well as being somewhat attractive also helps, and depending on my level of sobriety i´m sometimes alright at that.   ooh! also, being a white guy travelling south america helps. the gringas (other travellers (mostly white girls)) like me because i know about the local culture, and have my own place (i have actually picked up a gringa by telling her that i know what it´s like to sleep in a 16 person dorm, and that i have my own queen sized bed, not a 5 minute taxi ride away). the locals on the other hand love that i am different (oooh, a white guy!), and am here for a few months (ooooh, maybe we can get a passport out of this guy!), and can speak some spanish. yeah, that also helps.   it gets a little meaningless sometimes, but other times i actually can connect with someone for a few days (or weeks), and that´s always awesome.",0,

it bears pointing out that i should be your low hanging fruit, the easy vote to get as opposed to, say, african-americans, latinos, or asians – and you’re not even speaking well to me. the reasons why ought to concern you deeply.  as a card-carrying white male i love expressing my opinion irrespective of whether people care to hear it, so let’s get started.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  science - one of the reasons my family is affluent is that my wife and i have a collective fifteen years of university education between us. i have a masters degree in science and technology policy, and my wife is a physician who holds degrees in medicine as well as cell and molecular biology. we are really quite unimpressed with congressional representatives such as todd akin and paul broun who actually serve on the house science committee and who believe, respectively, that rape does not cause pregnancy and that evolution and astrophysics are lies straight from satan’s butt cheeks. these are, sadly, only two of innumerable assaults that the republican party has made against hard science – with nothing to say of logic in general. please understand the unbearable tension this might create between us and your candidates.  climate - within just the past 18 months the following events have come to our attention: a record-breaking drought that sent temperatures over 100 degrees for weeks, killing half the corn in the midwest and half the trees on our suburban property – and – a hurricane that drowned not new orleans or tampa or north carolina but my native state of vermont. as an encore, a second hurricane drowned lower manhattan, new jersey and long island. the shouted views of decrepit mental fossil senator james inhofe of oklahoma that this is a fraud perpetrated on the american people by evil, conspiring climate scientists is belied by such events and is looking irresponsible to even the most skeptical.  healthcare - my wife and i are quite familiar with america’s healthcare system due to our professions, and having lived abroad extensively, also very aware of comparable systems. your party’s insistence on declaring the private u.s. healthcare system “the best in the world” fails nearly every factual measure available to any curious mind. we watch our country piss away 60% more expenditures than the next most expensive system (switzerland) for health outcomes that rival former soviet bloc nations. on a personal scale, my wife watches poor working people show up in emergency rooms with fourth-stage cancer because they were unable to afford primary care visits. i have watched countless small businesses unable to attract talented workers because of the outrageous and climbing cost of private insurance. and i watch european and asian businesses outpace american companies because they can attract that talent without asking people to risk bankruptcy and death. that you think this state of affairs is somehow preferable to “obamacare,” which you compared ludicrously to trotskyite russian communism, is a sign of deficient minds unfit to guide health policy in america.  war - nations do have to go to war sometimes, but that iraq thing was pretty bad, to put it mildly. somebody should have been, i dunno – fired for bad performance. aren’t you the party of good corporate managers or something? this topic could get 10,000 words on its own. let’s just leave it at: you guys suck at running wars.  deficits and debt - whenever the gop is out of power, it immediately appeals to the imagination of voters who remember the lyndon baines johnson (!) administration and claim that the republican alternative is the party of “cutting spending” and “reducing the deficit.” the only problem with your claim is that republican governments throughout my entire 38 year life (reagan, bush 41, bush 43) have failed to cut spending and deficit and debt even once. i hope you understand that your credibility suffers every time you promise one thing for three decades and do the exact opposite. egads – if you actually were the party of fiscal responsibility – you might win our votes despite your 13th century view of science!  gay marriage - as the child of baby boomers who got divorced (as was the fashion!) in the 80s and 90s, and for whom 50% of my friends had their homes broken by divorce in the critical years before age 18, i sure am unsympathetic to your caterwauling bullshit that “gays will destroy the sanctity of marriage.” perhaps if everyone in your generation didn’t take the period of 1978 – 1995 to start surreptitiously banging their neighbors and coworkers, only to abandon their kids because “they just weren’t happy,” i would take your defense of marriage more seriously. the institution of middle class suburban marriage was broken by the generation of aging white baby boomers who populate what is left of the republican party, so your defense is wrongheaded and disingenuous. and moreover, as someone who got called “faggot” about 127 times a day from the years 1985 through 1991 – guess what – i grew up to be pretty good friends with actual homosexuals, whose sexual orientation is usually the least significant thing about them. the republican perseveration on homosexuals as any sort of threat consigns them to history’s trough of intellectual pig dung.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  that’s quite enough for one essay, wouldn’t you say? now, given my initial description as a wealthy, hard-working, job creating, heterosexual, married suburban white male – doesn’t your current platform look woefully insufficient to the task of gaining my vote? this doesn’t even get into the demographic tensions that show that people of my exact profile are going away permanently in america. you can’t even win on what you perceive to be “home field advantage.”  uh oh, wait, i can already hear you through the web browser, dismissing all of my above points because that guy was never gonna be a republican anyhow, cuz he’s a librul who hates america and…  all right, let’s do one last point:  meanness- your party is really mean, mocking and demonizing everyone who does not follow you into the pits of hell. you constantly imply – as mitt romney did in his “47% speech” – that anybody who disagrees with you does so not by logic or moral conviction, but because they are shiftless, lazy parasites who want “free stuff” from “traditional americans.” wow, you guys managed to follow up a stunning electoral defeat with insulting the very people you wish to attract for a majority in the political system! brilliant! you are losing elections because being angry and defensive and just-plain-mean is more important than being smart and winning elections – and thus you deserve everything happening to you.  if you want to know exactly where you failed in 2012, and will continue to fail, here it is. look you assholes, i’m as traditional an american as it gets, and i do not “want free stuff.”  i am a taxpayer, and always have been. i got my first job – dragging bags of cow manure, horse feed and fertilizer around a farm store – when i was 12. i started my first company when i was 28. i have followed the vast majority of the rules set out for middle class white males (for good and for ill.) and if it weren’t bad enough that your policy positions are a complete clusterfuck for the reasons i lay out in great detail, you manage to follow up the whole exercise with insulting me, my wife, and my friends of every stripe who didn’t vote for your political party – all of whom are hard-working, taxpaying, job creating, law abiding, great americans of every color and creed.",1,1
257655,"marriage is a social institution that does not require reproduction to be recognized and valid. i think your assumptions about the rise and role of marriage are incorrect. that said, i think it's fine to discuss your question, which i understood to mean - does gay marriage directly or indirectly improve the species ability to reproduce and raise children?  since the rise of capitalism and industrialism, monogamous marriage has been encouraged due to its ability to promote a stable social landscape for conducting business. the shifts towards monogamy means more men have a reproductive future because the alpha males are no longer hoarding the women (as much). having kids makes men less aggressive/adventurous, more obedient - to the extent that the system they are in helps to support their family, even if they are barely getting by. in short, a worker with kids is more compliant and manipulable.  the problem in our culture is that our version of divorce enables serial-monogamy such that powerful males can occupy the the reproductive time of multiple females - resulting in a type of defacto polygyny, without the long term commitments of actual polygynist cultures. why does this matter, and what does it have to do with homosexuals?  again, marriage is just a contract for communicating social meaning and status. it's an idea, not an action or a thing. but it is an idea that socially validates the worth and value of the couple in question. it's basically a social endorsement of the union. it is therefore important that society endorse gay marriage because human beings are gay, just like other species have gay populations. gay marriage says that a gay relationship is a legitimate life to have. by legalizing gay marriage it will decrease the number of people who are mostly, but not exclusively gay from pursuing a heterosexual lifestyle out of convenience. for those lesbians who wish to get pregnant, a valid marriage will assist them, socially, in meeting that goal. for gay men who wish to adopt or go surrogate, same thing.   furthermore, gay marriage will help us to culturally appreciate that sex and marriage are not inherently reproductive pursuits. they are reasonably associated, but can exist independently. this is an important idea for straight people too - that they are not obligated to reproduce in order to live a meaningful and satisfying life. there are enough people on the planet. efforts to recognize and validate non-reproductive relationships, both gay and straight, should be encouraged. the goal is to have a higher percentage of parents who really want to be parents, instead of those who became parents by accident or sense if obligation.  not everyone, gay or straight, is a breeder, and that's a good thing for the species. for those who want to breed, gay or straight, marriage helps (socially, legally). for those that do not want to breed, gay or straight, recognition of their union (via marriage) as valid and equal, is important. it will help to enable people to live the life they want, to express their genes, and reduce significant cultural obligations. i also expect that it would indirectly strengthen straight marriage because non-exclusively gay people wouldn't get straight married nearly as much.  this has gotten too long to continue trying to tap out on a cell phone. will possibly edit / update of there is interest.",1,

227830,"well, for starters, i'm 22.  i think my first realization was pretty standard: middle school, around age 12 or so. i was essentially brand new to what it meant to be gay. there was absolutely no exposure to gay men where i live, no talks on the possibility of being gay, and frankly -- when i did begin to question it -- i often passed it off as being something to happen to 'other people, but never me.'  but it did happen. locker rooms. i cannot say i was attracted to any one guy in particular -- well, there was one guy who, despite only being about 13 or 14 had very well defined abs (and not just skinny-abs) -- but more attracted to the male body in general. it must have seemed creepy that, i who notoriously dressed and undressed first due to low self-esteem, would walk through the aisles and examine all the guys i pass by. i just loved looking, but i didn't know why.   i was watching an episode of degrassi: the next generation (is that what it's called?) where they featured an episode with a character who comes to the realization that he's gay and, to further make that point, they featured some hot shirtless guys playing basketball at the beginning. i loved watching that episode. that was my first real exposure to any possibility in being gay. so naturally, i was afraid. i was kind of a self-taught gay -- which will explain a lot later.  i tried telling myself that it wasn't possible, that i was simply mistaken. i hated the idea and refused to believe it. it didn't seem applicable. i pretended to be into girls and faked a girlfriend so my dad would stop bothering me about why i didn't have any girlfriends yet. i remember my hyper-christian 'friend' completely upset by one of our mutual friends coming out as bisexual. i remember giving her advice on how to change her into a 'normal' heterosexual woman again. i was so in denial about my own issues. to be honest, i didn't even fully label myself at that point. i believed deep down i was straight. i brainwashed myself into believing it so. being gay was the last thing i could ever see myself as being.  naturally this mentality is painful to endure; i became hateful towards myself and people in general. i became interested in cult-like subcultures, began hanging out with more nefarious individuals who celebrated being against the grain of society. it was like a family who i figured could share their own inner struggles with me. i never told them i liked guys, though. i couldn't.  it wasn't until late high school -- some 5 or 6 years later -- that i was even able to accept the label as 'gay.' it only helped to make me more sad and more angry. but high school was indeed an eye-opener: i saw so many hot guys. i learned to establish what kind of guys i was into, what i liked about them. i started viewing pornographic materials around freshman or sophomore year. i don't know precisely when all the labels and terminologies became commonplace for me to use as needed, but it was around the same time.   i began to see a difference in opinion about homosexuality: from the closed-mindedness of middle school to a slightly more liberal high school environment. and yet, ironically, i hung out mostly with homophobes and hyper-heterosexual types. it only helped to promote my confusion.   i found my first big crush: a beautiful, quiet boy named kevin. i didn't know him personally, i walked by him one day at school. i was struck. i searched my entire yearbook for his name. found his myspace, stalked him so bad. it's creepy looking back at it, but i was a self-taught gay man and i was desperate for friends and romance. and so we became friends through this process. he was an open-minded guy with a bright future ahead of him, i suppose he didn't mind my awkwardness that much. it was one of those crushes that hurt to think about. it hurt even more when i found out he got a girlfriend. i made a vow then: i would spend my entire life single, alone, and hopefully die as soon as possible so as to not feel this pain forever. this helped only in making me feel more self-deprecating and suicidal.  when i was 20, a sophomore in college or so, i finally gained the courage to say i was gay online without the fear of being discovered by my parents. it's true i was outrageously paranoid about being discovered. in my mind, admitting to my homosexual identity was the second closest thing to ruining my entire life. but i digress: i admitted i was gay online. first timidly and under fake account names, but i warmed up to being more open about it. i was shy about it until a very cute guy who i called olly insisted i tell the only other gay man i knew (alex) that i liked him. i suppose to some degree i was attracted to the idea of knowing there was another single gay man out there, but i didn't truly like him.   either way, to my surprise, alex said yes. i had my first online relationship. i got the chance to finally say 'i love you' to someone. it was nice, but it lacked the flowery feelings i know love is now. needless to say, alex and i didn't last. i won't go into the details about why we broke up, but i was the one to do the breaking-up and it was for good reason.  the next online guy who came along was james. he was, in my opinion, one of the hottest men i'd ever seen: extremely-blue eyes, very muscular physique, broad shoulders, dark hair. he was straight at first, and he would tell me about his ex-girlfriends. i knew i was attracted to him. he became more experimental in the way he would speak to me. eventually we were saying ""i love you"" (as friends) after every hour to every 30 minutes. it escalated quite quickly. finally he admitted that he would have sex with a man for $1000. that was my cue! i asked if he were bi, he admitted he might be. i told him i liked him. he liked me too. relationship #2 begins, an it lasted 8 months. that was my first true love, i suppose. i loved everything about him, except his tendency to get anxiety attacks and abandon me for a couple months. i never saw him in person, but i still admired him. until one day he left and just didn't come back. it was the most painful thing i had felt before. i had never before felt such deceit and heartache in all my life. at first i blamed myself for not being good enough, not doing enough for him. it would be months before i could admit that it was his mistake. i emailed him once after all was accepted to wish him a happy birthday. he replied saying that he tried to kill himself. i don't know if i believed that we would ever be together again, but the way i felt about him i figured it was worth a try. he left again without a word after about two days of reconnecting. i haven't heard from him since. i don't hate him, but i do wish things were different between us. i do wish he would have at least been my friend. he really did help me come to terms with my sexuality.  online-guy #'s 3 and 4 aren't worth mentioning: they essentially both used and abandoned me. i guess it's a learning experience if nothing else. i became very different after them, however. they kind of made me more open to the bad side of humanity.  so here i was, single for a month or two, feeling down on myself. i hadn't been single more than a couple weeks with online-boyfriends 1-4. i was playing on the gaymers minecraft server when a guy logged in named prinnydood333. burke. i don't know what it was about him, but i fell like a ton of bricks. i had to be closer to him. i skyped him, he was adorable. he was every thing i looked for in guys. i guess i lost my ability for discretion over the other guys, because i jumped right to it: ""burke, i like you.""   at first he was wary to go out with me because, quite honestly, it was very early and he felt the same types of insecurities that i did. but to my surprise, he would eventually ask me out. i said yes.   in may of this month, burke and i finally met. i got my first kiss, my first hug, i wrapped my arms around him at night. i told him i loved him. he was all the firsts that one can have in a relationship. i love him dearly. we are still together. we have our problems every now and then: i can be really hard to get along with, but we always find a way to work past it.   he is the first true reason i can verify that i'm gay. i've never felt this kind of elevated state of existence until he came along.   thanks for reading. i'm sorry this post is so enormous but maybe it rings relevant to someone out there. keep looking, guys, because he might come from unexpected places.  burke, if you're reading this, thanks for being mine :)",1,

576718,"&gt;try calling one of your woman friends manly, and see if she takes it as a compliment.   women are frequently ""complimented"" through comparisons with men because masculinity is stereotypically associated with positive traits: bravery, strength, ambition, etc. i've been complimented for taking an injury ""like a man,"" writing manly prose, being ballsy, etc. a thousand times. the only insult (un-intended) is that the speaker thinks that these positive qualities are somehow un-female.  indeed the only circumstance in which i would take manly as an intended slight would be if someone referred to my appearance as manly. and the insult still wouldn't be that they are calling me by the wrong category, but rather that they expect me to uphold some dumb gender stereotypes in order to be acknowledged as female! in other words, the insult would be sexist in nature - based on the assumption that women have to look or act a particular way or face social sanctions (same with calling a man girly).    &gt;these kinds of insults are always very superficial, and based off gender/ sexual-orientation stereotypes that may be unfair. this is true.   so, why do you argue that ""nobody"" has moral qualms calling men girly and women manly?  to my mind, using stereotypical insults is something that should be avoided, not defended.  &gt;but to assert that someone gives off traits associated with the opposite gender is an insult either way, and i don't think anyone considers them to be offensive.  i know *tons* of people who resent the use of gender-based insults.  mostly women, as it is femininity that has most of the negative baggage.  many women, when they hear one man call another man ""girly,"" recognize that the insult works because people hear girly and think ""weak, vain, shallow, etc.""  they know that the joke is on them: that a man is bad when he acts like a woman because acting like a woman is bad.  this is why women are often counseled not to ""make decisions like a woman"" or  ""manage like a woman"", ""drive like a woman"", why women are often referred to as a ""girly girl"" as an insult.    &gt;you can tell your male friend to quit being a little bitch, or to not be such a girl about something. the person slinging these insults might not come off as the most enlightened person ever, but they won't become a fucking pariah like the guy who makes the mistake of slipping up and calling his friend gay.  well, i sure wouldn't socialize with someone who made a habit of using ""being a little bitch"" or ""not be such a girl"" -- those are both classic sexist insults.  (and, if i had ever in my life heard a woman tell another woman to ""stop being a big man"" about something or ""not be such a boy"", i'd be shocked, because masculine personality characteristics are rarely used as an insult - in fact, i'm more likely to hear a woman compliment another woman for taking something difficult ""like a man"".  women can be sexist, too.)  &gt;obviously context and intent is important, but currently it seems like using the word gay or faggot in even the mildest way is considered offensive no matter what the context.  well, yeah.  there really is no context, so far as i can tell, in which a straight person calling another straight person ""gay"" or ""fag"" isn't either a) enforcing heteronormativity (that is, a statement that ""straight"" is the socially desirable state), b) enforcing sexist standards of masculinity (that is, a statement that ""acting gay"" is unmanly), or c) enforcing essential standards of heterosexuality (that is, a statement that gay people and straight people are essentially opposites and should look and behave in distinctive [i.e. stereotypical] ways).    i mean, if you honestly believe that homosexuality and heterosexuality are equally valid, that being homosexual isn't antithetical or masculinity, and that being homosexual doesn't always mean presenting yourself or behaving in a manner diametrically opposite to (or in competition with) the ways that heterosexual people present themselves and behave, then i don't honestly see what is even insulting about calling a straight person gay.  if someone told me i was acting like a lesbian (or a ""dyke"" or some other slur) i would take the insult as homophobic - that they think i'm part of a category with which they hold negative stereotypical associations.  but if that same person then clarified that they hold no stereotypical associations with lesbians and were literally just trying to insult me by suggesting that i am attracted to women rather than men, i'd just be fucking confused.  the insult becomes incomprehensible: akin to calling me a hindu or a kossack or any other social category with which i do not identify.",1,1

246259,"so, wait, what's offensive? calling someone that pretended to be in a heterosexual to get a heterosexual to take care of her a closeted lesbian...   i think i have presented ample evidence that she was indeed a lesbian...   and if she seriously hasn't figured it out herself yet, maybe she needs someone to show her a mirror.   maybe she'll be a lot happier when she finally gets it through her thick skull that a person who wants biological children, but also wants to fool around with girls on the side and is repulsed by any presence of depiction of male genetalia, is not heterosexual.  that's what she hated about porn. seeing the penetration. she didn't just think it was gross. she had a pathological disgust of heterosexual intercourse... except one day a month when she even admitted she was probably the most fertile...  i'm pretty sure that's not heterosexual.  if you are talking about me calling the lesbian that walked into an apartment i was paying for and tried to physically intimidate me into leaving so she could return to a (purportedly imagined, but it seemed pretty real to me) homosexual relationship with the my girlfriend...  then if there is a better word for it that bull dyke, i've never heard it. she was acting like a bull, and she looked like a man...  and seriously, if you knew the things she told our friends and her family (and therefor my family) that i did to her, you'd think that what i would say to her (but i never really will - the whole point of offmychest) , you'd thing i was letting her off easy.  she told my friends i was such a sex freak, that she was afraid if we had children i'd put them in danger...  because i watched an episode on bangbus (or something like that)...  once...  and because after 8 months of no sex, i asked her ""are we just not going to have sex any more."" it was a legitimate question, and i didn't just spring it in bed or in a late night attempt to guilt her into sex... i made her dinner and we discussed it... and two days later pat showed up and i got ran off...  the only flaw in her plan was that she was disgusted by heterosexual sex (although she hid it very well) that she couldn't stand to let a man touch her after she was done. so she'd get off so fast to get it over with and then push me away and go in the bathroom and cry, i never had a chance to impregnate her...  all of these odd things, i tried to talk to about in a good way. our mutual best friend was gay, he too agreed that she had something going on, and i discussed it with him before talking to her about any of it because i wanted to make sure i handled the situation delicately.  sometimes offensive language is appropriate. seriously, if she can't muster up the introspection to see that it was wrong to lead me along like she did, to take all my shit and money, to lie to people to cover up her own bad behavior... then maybe she needs to shocked into that realization...  in reality, i do feel really bad about the way our whole relationship went down. if after she kicked me out she had contacted me (she had no trouble showing off when she wanted to) and said ""i'm really sorry, i was confused. i'll call everybody and tell them that you are not a sexual predator."" then i could forgive her and move on and be civil.  i'm just using words that describe the actions that she took towards me.  i know lots of very nice masculine lesbians. i got a couple of great big hairy lesbian neighbors that are great people.  they don't act like bull dykes, so i don't call them bull dykes...",1,1

561090,"wow, it is nice to hear someone going through a fucked up situation that i can relate to. thank you for sharing your story. though obviously, i am sorry you have gone through a struggle with your sexuality.   i thought i would use your comment as a springboard to vent, as you might understand some of my frustration. also, i apologize for my bad language and the poor quality of my writing, i do hope you read it all.  if you were to ask me right now whether i was gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight, asexual, a pigeon fancier, or a lover of inanimate objects, i wouldn't have a fucking clue!  it is so fucking frustrating, i just want to fucking cry. anyway...  when i was a teenager i think i was a fairly 'normal' individual, i certainly fell in love with and had sexual attraction towards women. i was even horny for the fifty year old librarian that worked at my school, as well as all the usual girls etc. i suppose i did have one fleeting homosexual attraction, but it never entertained me that much. but perhaps i was in denial, at least this is what i wonder looking back now.  anyway, it turns out i have a rare illness that, in short, made me become weak, lose some of my mental faculties and have a low sex drive, which really kicked in when i was about 18, when my sexual experience was probably lower than normal anyway (my sex drive had always been lower due to this underlying problem, but it was at least existent before). the illness was very slow acting, so i just gradually declined and was able to carry on a 'normal' life for a while, then a restricted life for a couple of years, before having to live with my parents and give up work at the age of 28, because i was so disabled. thankfully, i have discovered the cause of my problems and i am slowly regaining my health now, so that is one hurdle surmounted.  anyway, my friends in my early 20s were fairly masculine - i guess due to my love of playing sports i had gravitated towards a more aggressive crowd. however, because i suddenly became tired all the time, miserable, constantly ill, and in other words 'weak', i found myself suddenly on the end of a shit-ton of abuse - yeah, my faith in humanity was somewhat shaken. thinking back now it was actually ridiculous, i was called a pussy, a wimp, a faggot, gay, a bitch, a big girl, a woman, a princess etc - constantly, all by people who were meant to be my friends. due to the mental confusion brought on by being sick i didn't really understand what was happening, and i didn't really have the tools to think rationally (i.e. just walk away from these people).   the major problem was that because i didn’t have any sex drive due to my illness, i couldn’t really claim that i was heterosexual, or gay, or anything (i think at one point i had three wanks in a year). this lead to me become paranoid (the loss of my mental faculties due to illness didn’t help either). suddenly, i thought that maybe i was gay, so i started checking out men, but not in the way i imagine a normal person would, rather i would neurotically check all the time whether i was attracted to them or not, and this made me anxious and nervous around men, so much so that i was having mini-panic attacks in the presence of men. and this felt somewhat like being aroused. the thing is i now have it in my head that i’m homosexual, so i get these strange feelings around men that are somewhere between arousal (because my heart is beating) and full on fucking terror. occasionally, when i forget about being neurotic i feel fine around men and become attracted to women.  but do i? i don’t know, because i have gone so far down this neurotic route that i have no idea who the fuck i am. i keep questioning whether i am making up being attracted to women, and have always been attracted to men, as i do experience some form of arousal around men, though it doesn’t seem particularly pleasurable (but maybe that is partly due to my anxiety about being gay). but then i think that surely it shouldn’t be so fucking hard to be sexually attracted to someone.  it is probable that i have some form of homosexual-ocd (it is a thing), but then i could just be gay and have not realized it for my first twenty years of life, and now my anxiety is hiding it. the thing is, that i suspect that what i am experiencing is some form of insane neuroticism brought on by bullying (i think i should drive home how intense the abuse i received was – it was ridiculously constant) from the fleeting reactions i have had to women. because what your post made me realize is that the only times i have become spontaneously erect and properly aroused is around women. for example, in an office i was working in a woman asked me to help her with tying part of her dress and a 'certain part of me' shot up like a space rocket because i was in such close proximity to her - and there have been a few incidents like this, where i have become supersonically aroused by women (which reminded me of your realization moment). however, i generally don’t experience too much attraction to women because i am having massive anxiety panic attacks about whether i am gay around them. sometimes, i will start checking out a girl and then i’ll have to look at men and experience my strange arousal that reassures me that i’m gay.  i would like to apologise for introducing another human to the cluster bomb of fuck that is my mind.  so, recently i started a treatment for my illness that has actually worked, and my sex drive has returned somewhat (still only small, but more than before). well, now things are getting interesting (actually, can i ask you a question if you are still reading – how do you feel when you watch gay porn? do you feel really aroused?), because fuck knows what is up with me. if i watch porn i generally only get aroused when there is a woman involved, lesbian porn seems average but decent, and i get properly charged up watching heterosexual porn – but here’s the catch, i tend to think i’m the woman, or ‘feel’ the actions of the man upon the woman, and probably get more aroused by the man in this scenario. however, gay porn is such a ‘meh’ for me, being intensely neurotic i do look at it to see whether i’m gay, but i don’t get hard or interested, and have to look at something else to ‘get my rocks off’. but if its heterosexual porn there is no denying that in my mind i’m the woman – what the fuck is going on. perhaps the lack of testosterone during my illness has actually changed my mind into a more feminine one (i’m just thinking out loud here). i am only a month and a half into my treatment, which is working on the physical side (e.g. i am going for short cycle rides now), so perhaps it will take a little longer for the sexual side to kick in – after all my ‘passive attractions to women’, which feel real as opposed to my neurotic weird feelings around men, have increased slightly over the last month.   anyway, i’m just thinking out loud, but surely thinking i’m the woman means i’m transgender, which i wouldn’t mind if i could just turn into a woman for sex, but generally i like scratching my balls and being a little bit oafish, so i want to remain a man. i do wonder if perhaps i am just imagining being the woman as a psychological mechanism for coping with my homosexuality. but then surely i would feel some arousal when watching homosexual porn, and also since i’ve started having a few sexual fantasies again, i do spend a lot of time ‘designing/imagining’ the woman i will eventually become during the sex scene, all while in an aroused state. plus i’ve started having lots of dreams about girls, basically soft porn, where i am definitely a man (perhaps my subconscious is less confused – did you have dreams about men when you were in denial?). again, i have to add that perhaps i am just trying to hide things from myself.  apart from this, i am actually quite positive at the moment thanks to my physical illness improving so much, which has also improved my memory and clarity of thought. it has just been nice this last month being able to be more active and see friends etc (while seeing friends i experienced the anxious arousal around men and definite, what feels like ‘good’ arousal to me, attraction to women – but then perhaps i am once again making this up because i am in denial, perhaps not though).  i guess what this boils to is whether i am gay and in denial which is causing anxiety, or anxious because i didn’t have a sex drive and was called gay by everyone and i’m really attracted to women – or even that i’m a life-male, sexual-transsexual…do those even exist? maybe i should wait a bit to see what happens during my physical recovery. to be honest, at the moment i don’t want to actually be sexual with anyone and would be happy being in an asexual relationship – perhaps this is an avenue i could explore, depending on how my recovery from illness goes. though what gender i would be asexual with is still a mystery!  well, that was fun!",1,1

825542,"hi - i'm in sydney, australia. regarding your questions and comments:  - yes so much of what obama stands for and wants to do is quite normative and uncontroversial to us, we can't imagine why americans wouldn't want that stuff too – you guys pay taxes, you should get stuff for return! like fair access to health care, better education, better infrastructure etc..  - and the clownish, utterly unsuitable-for-the-role way in which the republican candidates are portrayed in our media (and the european, asian, middle-eastern media we also access) makes the idea that enough americans would seriously consider electing them as president for it to be a genuine risk just unfathomable.  - but there are chamber effects within chamber effects that i must acknowledge that i'm a tertiary-educated professional, living in a pretty left-leaning part of a left-leaning city, working at a university! soliciting opinion from beyond our metaphorical mississippi, to use your analogy, i'm sure things would be quite different. - our media is similarly awash with biased, agenda-funded coverage about our local politics (like yours, its a two-party system, one hard right, once formerly centre-left, now really centre-right). in very simplistic terms, there's two main media conglomerates and they more or less back a party each. - (of course the domestic politics of other nations doesn't make news in the us unless it affects the us, but its the opposite for the rest of the world; we're greatly concerned about us politics, as decisions there affect us all with regards to wars, economics &amp; trade etc.) - likewise, our distraction/fringe issues are similar; currently the two big ones are a carbon tax (all tax bad!) and same-sex marriage recognition (two guys bad!), and they're to distract from similar social and infrastruture issues that are too big to fix in a limited election cycle. (check out [this quick clip](http://what-matters.sydney.edu.au/topic/better-economic-policy) on the stalemate of election cycle economics; part of a community outreach/awareness program we're doing about real-world impact work our uni and alumni do) - yes, awareness of what is happening in the 'rust belt', and those terrible/beautiful images of abandoned theatres and ballrooms from a bygone era in detroit escape the us domestic news bubble. is the rest of the world taking it as the very stark warning it should be for our economies? probably not. australia is currently experiencing a 'mining boom' driven by chinese demand, that will almost certainly end in a detroit-like way. - your last sentence epitomises so much of the issue, doesn't it? those who know enough to see the big issues and the mess we're in also know enough to see how intractable much of it is, and those who don't seek context or perspective get swept up in the dog-whistle politics of distraction issues. all you can do is keep voting (especially in a country like yours where it is voluntary) and keep sharing good information, and chip away at local/national/global cognitive dissonance!  **tl;dr** – we have the same problems but on a smaller scale, and we're all worried about the impact of us domestic politics on the rest of the world!  hope that reply was useful cheers, samsy",0,

651507,"the feminist wetlbanket is a weekly column where liz looks at popular culture from a feminist point of view... and then beats it down with her sharp words. this week, she gives you a closer look inside something near and dear to her: harry potter.  i should probably preface this by explaining the background of this project. when i was a women's studies student, i wrote a topic for an advanced upper division core course doing a feminist analysis of harry potter. while only 6 books were out at the time (and i only had a quarter - 10 weeks - to work on the project), i pursued it with full force. i'm actually in the process of applying to graduate school in the hopes of turning this small (it was 25 pages, so not that small) paper into a thesis or dissertation. with that said, please know that this project involved mass amounts of research and is still an unfinished work.  when i began this investigation/obsession, the last things i thought i would find were rape and gay bashing (among others) ... but i did. because this project was (is!) so intense, i have broken this up into several articles. this week? the rape of dolores umbridge.  it has been fairly well document in various interviews that j.k. rowling heavily researches almost everything - from names to creatures - that go into the series. nicolas flamel, from sorcerer’s stone, is a real person and the story she used draws greatly from his legend. many of rowling’s mythical creatures, names, and spells have a root in some legend, fairy tale, or story that she has borrowed from (something her critics are quick to point out). knowing this about rowling, the way she utilized the mythical half-man half-horse centaurs in order of the phoenix came as quite a shock.  according to centaur legend, they are not the docile, kind, and all-knowing creatures that rowling chose to portray them as. the first centaur was a production of rape, and this beginning defines the remainder of centaur legend (1, p59). when invited to a wedding, the centaurs “attempted to rape and abduct the bride and other women” (1, p63). centaurs were considered dangerous because they had “exaggerated masculinity” due to their “human male element being combined with the sexual potency of stallions, and thus they were characterized by violent lust” (1, p63). there were very few female/women centaurs to use as companions, and this was also blamed for their voracious sexual appetite.  in order of the phoenix, rowling creates dolores umbridge: the amazingly unlikable defense against the dark arts teacher who works for the minister of magic. umbridge searches unwaveringly for ways to discredit dumbledore and expel harry. when she threatens to perform an illegal curse on one of harry’s friends in order to get information about dumbledore’s whereabouts, hermione comes up with a plan to save them all: she’ll lead umbridge into the forest and let the centaurs take care of her. it is worth noting that hermione, a female character who is extremely intelligent and known for her book-ish tendencies, is most likely sending umbridge to this punishment knowingly. rowling has made a point of using hermione to provide the readers with information because she is considered to be very knowledgeable. it is worth arguing, then, that hermione would know the violent history of centaurs and took umbrdige into the forest knowing that she would suffer rape at the hands of a very violent group of half-men half-horses.  it is surprising that rowling, known for the intense research of things she puts into her books, would use centaurs to “punish” umbridge. some evidence provided by rowling helps to point us in the direction of discovering umbridge’s true punishment. umbridge’s usually neat appearance is changed in her hospital bed: her “mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed” (2, p849). despite lack of physical evidence, the students know something terrible has happened to her because of her physical and apparent mental states. when ron jokingly makes the sound of hoof beats, umbridge frantically sits up in her bed and looks for the source of the noise. her reaction to this sound and her shock like state are symptoms commonly experienced by rape victims (rainn). why rowling chose to punish umbridge this way when she could have used many other means is unknown. the rape of professor umbridge is perhaps one of the most horrifying instances of violence against women in the entire series.  next week? the stereotypes rowling uses, and how they can be blamed for the gay bashing of several not-so-masculine characters.  please note that this is a feminist reading of a text. it does not mean that i believe rowling intended for these things to happen. when a work is published, it becomes something that is up for interpretation by many different disciplines. a feminist reading of a text finds hidden meanings and reads against the grain - it does not say anything about the author's intentions.",1,

241008,"you did specifically mention other parts of the world, so here's my braindump about lgbt rights in south africa. mostly talking about legal rights here, and there's much more to say about the social side of things.  #first the bad (pre-1990s).  the crimes of ""sodomy"" and ""unnatural sexual acts"" were inherited from the common law, which in this case means the old-timey legal writers of 17th century holland, who couldn't even bring themselves to describe the acts they were condemning. the dutch settlers brought the roman-dutch law with them to south africa. over time, the sex laws, which originally prohibited everything except penis-in-vagina, were loosened as far as straight people were concerned, but not for gay men. as with the uk, lesbian sex was never prohibited.  in 1957 the government brought in a new law setting the age of consent at 16 ([immorality act 1957](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immorality_act,_1957)) and decided to apply it to gay male sex as well - even though it was already illegal at any age!  in 1966 the police broke up a big gay party in a suburb of johannesburg. public moral panic follows, ""think of the children"" etc. parliament held hearings, eventually passing a law ([immorality amendment act 1969](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immorality_amendment_act,_1969)) which bumped up the age of quasi-consent to 19 for gay men and introduced the bizarre [section 20a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_20a). known as the ""men at a party"" offence, it forbade any kind of sexually stimulating act between men if there were more than two people present. it also banned dildos - this was aimed at lesbians.  notice that this happened at much the same time as many western countries were getting rid of their sodomy laws. this is around the time at which the apartheid regime really started diverging from the west (in all sorts of things, not just gay rights). it is not entirely a coincidence that this was the same time period as the government started really cracking down on political dissent.  not much happened, legal-wise, for a few decades. gay organisations in south africa were, like pretty much everything else, mostly racially segregated until the 1980s and the white organisations were mostly ""apolitical"" towards apartheid. in 1984, [simon nkoli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simon_nkoli), who was an activist against apartheid and for gay rights, was tried for treason, and was held with a number of prominent anc leaders. through his influence during this time of imprisonment several of them changed their attitudes towards homosexuality. in 1988 he founded glow, the first non-racial lgbt group.  incidentally, in 1988 the government extended the age-of-consent discrimination to also affect lesbians.  #now the good stuff  in 1990 president de klerk suddenly announced an end to apartheid and the beginning of constitutional negotiations. by 1993 the various parties hashed out an [interim constitution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_african_constitution_of_1993). of particular relevance to lgbt rights is the equality clause, which prohibited the government from discriminating on the basis of sex, gender or sexual orientation. as far as we know, the anc was mostly to thank for this inclusion. after the free elections in 1994 new negotiations began to draw up a permanent constitution - a major lobbying effort was launched to keep the sexual orientation protection, and it ultimately got the support of everyone except the rabid-religious-right.  so the upshot of all this is, the constitution of south africa now has these [three incredibly important clauses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/section_nine_of_the_constitution_of_south_africa):  &gt;(3) the state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth. &gt; &gt;(4) no person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds in terms of subsection (3). national legislation must be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination. &gt; &gt;(5) discrimination on one or more of the grounds listed in subsection (3) is unfair unless it is established that the discrimination is fair.  the whole lgbt rights structure is based on this little bit of text. note that, while gender identity is not mentioned, the courts have made it clear that the nexus of sex, gender and sexual orientation covers gender identity.  so, what with the whole end-of-apartheid thing, the government was a little busy and didn't get around to repealing the sodomy laws. they weren't enforced, mind - even before 1994 judges were tossing out sodomy charges on the basis that they were ridiculous - but they stayed on the books. so in 1998 we had the first major court victory, *[national coalition for gay and lesbian equality v minister of justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_coalition_for_gay_and_lesbian_equality_v_minister_of_justice)*, which struck down the sodomy laws, retroactively to 1994.  the following year brought *[national coalition for gay and lesbian equality v minister of home affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_coalition_for_gay_and_lesbian_equality_v_minister_of_home_affairs)*, which legally recognised same-sex relationships for the first time - in this case for immigration purposes. this set off a string of cases extending other rights to ""same-sex life partners"" - *[satchwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satchwell_v_president_of_the_republic_of_south_africa)* (2002) for pension benefits, *[du toit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/du_toit_v_minister_of_welfare_and_population_development)*  (2002) for adoption, *[j and b](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j_v_director_general,_department_of_home_affairs)* (2003) for artificial insemination, and *[gory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gory_v_kolver_no)* (2006) for inheritance.  in this series of judgments, the judges of the constitutional court dropped more and more hints that parliament really needed to go ahead and legalise same-sex marriage. in 2002 a lesbian couple asked a court to force the government to recognise their marriage. because of some procedural fuckups, this case bounced around the courts for a few years, before finally reaching the constitutional court in 2005 as *[minister of home affairs v fourie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minister_of_home_affairs_v_fourie)*. the court handed down an unambiguous judgment that same-sex marriage must be legalised. there are so many quotable phrases in the judgment, but this is the one is particularly well-known:  &gt;the exclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and responsibilities of marriage, accordingly, is not a small and tangential inconvenience resulting from a few surviving relics of societal prejudice destined to evaporate like the morning dew. it represents a harsh if oblique statement by the law that same-sex couples are outsiders, and that their need for affirmation and protection of their intimate relations as human beings is somehow less than that of heterosexual couples.  the court gave parliament a year to fix the law, which meant a year of political shit. for some reason no-one cared about allowing gays to adopt children, or any of the other rights extended, but marriage brought out all the homophobes. at first the government tried to bring in uk-style civil partnerships, but *their own legal advisers* told them that ""separate but equal"" wouldn't cut it. the final result was the [civil union act 2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_union_act,_2006), which, despite the title, didn't introduce civil unions; it extended marriage to same-sex couples and (rather unnecessarily) introduced civil partnerships, identical to marriage except the name, for same- and opposite-sex couples.  meanwhile the [promotion of equality and prevention of unfair discrimination act 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/promotion_of_equality_and_prevention_of_unfair_discrimination_act,_2000) reinforced the constitutional ban on discrimination and added a prohibition of hate speech and intimidation on the basis of sexual orientation (and all sorts of other grounds).  in all this, the unequal age of consent remained; and technically a male couple could marry at 18 but sex would be illegal until they were 19! in 2007 the [sexual offences amendment act 2007](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/criminal_law_%28sexual_offences_and_related_matters%29_amendment_act,_2007) made the age 16 for everyone, and in 2008 the courts made it retroactive to 1994.  on the t side of lgbt, the [alteration of sex act 2003](alteration of sex description and sex status act, 2003) allows trans people to change their legal identification without surgery, although some medical treatment is still required.  today the legal fight is mostly done, and the focus of lgbt organisations is on social attitudes, education and support, and the prevention and prosecution of hate crimes.",1,

306312,"&gt;in all honesty, can someone explain homosexuality to me?  you know how straight dudes are sexually attracted to dudettes and not sexually attracted to other dudes? it's like that, only gay dudes are sexually attracted to other dudes, and not sexually attracted to dudettes.  &gt;they should be able to marry, have the same rights and stand for their own liberties but i need to know why?  pursuit of happiness without significantly harming others', i think  &gt;it might seem self important for me to ask but i honestly do not see homosexuality as anything more than a simple fetish.  if homosexuality is a fetish, so is heterosexuality.  &gt;this is coming from my experience with gays that one day just decided to prefer men.  i can almost promise you that's not what happened, and that what you're thinking of is men coming out of the closet after experiencing sexual attraction to other men for a long time prior. besides, even if someone *did* ""decide to prefer men"", this is very different from ""actually suddenly preferring men."" you can perform sexual acts with other men all you want, but you can't force yourself to like it if you're straight. i mean, try it- telling yourself to get hard thinking about sexing up another dude is much easier than actually having your autonomous nervous system respond to it. magic penis is something many men wish for, though, so if you succeed, tell the world.  &gt;how does this come about if its a prenatal determination?  people aren't born gay any more than they're born straight, but this doesn't mean it's not an inherent part of their personhood. a combination of nature and nurture is the most likely root of all sexualities- keep in mind that ""nurture"" does not always mean ""socialization"" or ""how one is raised""- it pertains to *every* external factor experienced from conception and every experience ever had- this can be anything from eating a carrot to getting kicked by a horse to being kissed by a girl to getting chickenpox. whatever the source or cause, sexuality is generally an inherent part of a person's personality and being, whether it arises at 8 years old or 20.  &gt;my main gripe is with bisexuals, how do they have a choice and not other gays?  imagine person x likes fruit, person y likes vegetables, and person z likes both fruit and vegetables. none of these people have a choice in what they *like*, they only have choices in what they choose to eat- the fact that person z likes both fruit and vegetables just works out well for them, because they now have twice the selection and could still enjoy whichever. unlike person x and person y. person x could *choose* to eat a vegetable, but he couldn't *choose* to like it. that's the difference in choice component between straights, bis, and gays.  &gt;is there like a scale or a point of no return for all gays?  no, but there is the kinsey scale, which you should google because it's a neat concept.  &gt;does it go from straight to bi curious to bisexual to homosexual to transgender?  ...no. for one thing, transgender has nothing to do with it. at all. the scale goes from ""very straight"" to ""very gay"" and all the stuff in between that could be called bisexuality in varying degrees.  &gt;i was once told that the average man is around 38% gay,and while i believed the gay guy was hitting on me, based on his reaction to my answer (i said: at least 62% of me still loves the ladies, majority wins) i had trouble believing something like that.  while pinning a number on it is unscientific, it is true that far more people are far less straight than many believe. most people, for instance, are not so straight that they wouldn't enjoy gay sex under any circumstances.  &gt;there's men in my life that i can say i love but i don't have any intention to kiss or have sex with them. there's girls in my life that i can hangout with or be around but i'd still picture them naked or be open to sexual advances.  congratulations! now you know roughly how lesbians feel. for the gay man experience, replace ""men"" with ""women.""  &gt;however i can look at another man and recognize his dashing good looks or his physique but i can't say i'm attracted to him, its just strange and silly to imagine treating a man like i would a woman or be treated like a woman, i'm guessing there's turns taken, i mean fair is fair right?  most gay men don't treat/want to be treated ""like a woman""; they're men, and they're having sex. what they want to do depends on what they feel like and what both consent to. some like penetrating more than penetration, some gay men never do either and sex amounts to mutual masturbation. keeping a tally isn't really normal procedure- i imagine it would really kill the mood, actually...  &gt;i was told once by a homosexual that he believed homosexuality was natures way of controlling the population.   this is one theory as to the evolutionary benefit of homosexuality- this is actually what happens in meerkats, where one male will have babies with a female, but the other males will gay up the place. since they don't have kids to look after, they take care of the first brother's litter in turn, and in this way there is enough food and care to ensure the survival of all from that litter rather than having 50 starving babies.  &gt;however entire cultures like ancient greeks and romans were openly engaged in sex with young boys oftentimes in favor of their own wives. im guessing its 'contagious'.  keyword ""young boys."" it's extremely important to distinguish between knowing, consenting adults and pederasty- child abuse is indeed contagious (in the sense that the abused children will often themselves grow up and abuse children in the same way they were abused, and ""grooming"" was involved in the abuse) and harmful. however, at the same time it wasn't the ""entire culture"", just a well-documented phenomenon, where consenting adults also engaged in homosexual activities; this is attributed not to ""omg everyone was gay"", just ""they were fine with gay sex, therefore more people who would have been attracted to members of the same sex anyway could do it without fear of being shamed or killed."" keep in mind, this included bisexuality; it wasn't as though every dude boning another dude in ancient greece was automatically ignoring helen of troy.  &gt;my more ignorant side would say that men who are gay are in a need for attention and extremely sensitive, sentimental and emotional and fall into a category that society has laid out for them, pretty much the 'nurture' side of the situation.  wow, that *would* be really ignorant. before your more ignorant side says it, i'll answer it for you: no.  &gt;to me the recent events involving the church and fundamentalist beliefs targeting gays seem unfair but i justify their ignorance. hear me out, i think they're like me, completely oblivious to the homosexual lifestyle but they're infinitely less tolerant.   their ignorance isn't justified, but it's understandable why they would *be* ignorant. at least you're far more courteous.  &gt;i mean i think comparing the gay rights movement to the civil rights movement is ridiculous, gays were never slaves or taken from their home. while there is attacks on gays and there's no wide acceptance of their practices, saying that it parallels to being prosecuted for the color of your skin is absurd. its more like the women's right movement but to a lesser degree, again, i believe that they should have the right to do what makes them happy, i just think that there's comparisons out there that seem cartoonish like when people say gays marrying would lead to marrying animals(which to me is ridiculous because there's no mutual consent).  civil rights are civil rights, none are exactly like the others but yes, comparisons can be made and it's not a stretch to reach them. all are prosecuted for an inherent part of their personhood, all three categories are disproportionately victims of employment, housing, and legal discrimination, all have histories of extreme violence compared to the overall population (one could argue that there is less instance of women being killed solely for being women, actually, whereas being killed solely for being gay is still a legitimate social concern) and are disproportionately victims of such *based* on that one aspect of themselves. no one is saying ""gays have it as bad as blacks had it""- they are saying ""this is like the discrimination that occurred at x time in x place to x people during the civil rights movement for african-americans"", usually in an attempt to predict what social changes or major events in the movement will happen next.",1,

""dysfunctional"" individuals, who represent about 10% of homosexual men, are still ""in the closet"" and thus may deny their sexual orientation. about 16% of homosexual men are ""asexual"", having only occasional encounters since they are not highly sexually active, and about one third of homosexual men cannot be classified into any distinct category since they may go through several different lifestyles.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1876122/pdf/canmedaj01409-0056.pdf  &gt;  a far-ranging study of homosexual men published in 1978 revealed that 75 percent of self-identified, white, gay men admitted to having sex with more than 100 different males in their lifetime: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250- 499; 15 percent claimed 500-999; and 28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners.  alan p. bell and martin s. weinberg, homosexualities: a study of diversity among men and women, p. 308, table 7, new york: simon and schuster, 1978.  http://factsaboutyouth.com/posts/promiscuity/  &gt;sexually transmitted diseases (stds) have been increasing among gay and bisexual men. recent increases in syphilis cases have been documented across the country. in 2008, men who have sex with men (msm) accounted for 63% of primary and secondary syphilis cases in the united states. msm often are diagnosed with other bacterial stds, including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections.  &gt; gay and bisexual men can be infected with hpv (human papillomavirus), the most common std in the united states. some types of hpv cause genital and anal warts and some can lead to the development of anal and oral cancer. men who have sex with men are 17 times more likely to develop anal cancer than heterosexual men. men who are hiv-positive are even more likely than those who are uninfected to develop anal cancer. see primary and secondary syphilis—reported cases, 2008, by sexual orientation.  http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/std.htm  &gt; more than half of gay men will encounter an issue with chemical dependency or addiction over the course of their lifetimes.  &gt; the rate of methamphetamines addiction among gay and lesbian individuals occurs at an alarmingly high rate – in fact, the gay community is 40 percent more likely than the general population to engage in meth use.  &gt; according to a 1992 california survey, nearly one in three lesbian or bisexual women in san francisco bay area had engaged in drug use, with more than 14 percent of women surveyed becoming the victims of violence while intoxicated.  &gt; lgbt teenagers are nearly 200 percent more likely than straight teens to use illicit substances such as drugs or alcohol, according to a university of pittsburgh medical center study.  &gt; in 2000, a study of heterosexual and homosexual couples found that gay and lesbian couples engaged in drug use at a rate of 10 percent, as opposed to 7.6 percent for their straight counterparts.  &gt; among a study of australian lgbt individuals, nearly one in five respondents engaged in weekly marijuana use, with more than seven percent engaging in daily use of the drug.  &gt; the u.s. department of health and social services reports that nearly 30 percent of gay and lesbian individuals experience problem drinking, alcohol dependency or alcoholism.  http://lgbtdrugrehab.com/addiction-treatment-statistics",1,

796750,"hey everyone, thank you so much for your support in responding to this. i'd like to share the letter i wrote to my friend in response. i hope he reads it.. it is kinda long lol. thanks everyone! &lt;3  ""dear friend,  i don't believe, but i know that i personally did not choose to be gay. from a young age, i knew that i was different from my friends - from around 6th grade, when i saw a guy that i thought was attractive, it made my heart skip a beat although i did not know what that meant at that time.   finally realizing that i was gay in high school, i was ashamed of it. i knew it was not really accepted in korean society so i tried to hide my so called 'gay' side. however, people at our high school proceeded to call me fruitcake - a derogatory term for calling homosexuals like faggot. it hurt when people no longer called me alex but referred to me as fruitcake, especially because i did not want to be gay and was doing all i can to try to be straight. bullying took a toll during my high school life at high school  - people hit me, called me names in derogatory ways, and over ten girls refused to go to snowball or prom with me since they thought i was gay. i was severely depressed - to the point that i wanted to jump off a building and kill myself. i had no one to talk to and i felt unsafe and alone. i couldn't tell my parents, friends, or teachers in fear of backlash. my life at high school  was the most disempowering and debilitating moment of my life. going on the top of my apartment and looking down at the parking lot below, i thought about a lot of things. what’s wrong with me? why am i different? why can’t i just be accepted? i would let out a huge sigh and looked up at the sky hoping for an answer, amidst high school junior and senior year stress – which got me to an all-time low.   all my life, up to my second year of college, i tried all i could to change myself so that i could be attracted to girls. i went on countless dates with girls in college – korean girls, white girls, asian girls, latino girls. my mom set me up for dates with daughters of my mom’s friends. i viewed countless k-pop girl group videos, lee hyori, and all the sexy icons i could think of. i even tried looking at straight porn in hopes i would be attracted to the girls and become straight. but i didn’t feel anything. and as hard as i tried, i couldn’t change it. i prayed to god every night asking for help, asking to change me into a straight person so my parents would not be ashamed of me and would be able to see grandchildren. it really hurt, because i hated myself – there is nothing worse than you yourself hating yourself.   and after countless attempts to change my sexual orientation for eight years, i eventually decided to stop trying to change myself and instead embrace myself for who i am. and ever since, i have been so much happier. for the first time in my life, i felt what acceptance was like. moving every year till high school, i had no consistent group of friends – and at high school you and andy were really the only people i could call a ‘friend’. but i never felt truly accepted because i had to hide a part of myself from you and i felt so fake and horrible. but at that time i had no choice but to hide it.   you see, why would i choose to be gay and go through all this suffering? why would anyone choose to be harassed, called names, hit, to the verge of suicide? why would anyone choose this path? i tried literally everything i could think of – but it doesn’t work because i was born this way – whether you believe it or not. and all the gay people i know (which is a lot) – speaking from personal experience, have never chosen their sexual orientation. while i cannot say no gay person chose to be gay, i can say from personal experience, and meeting hundreds of gay people, i have yet to find a single person that chose to be gay.  if you truly think it is a choice, i’d like you to tell me when you chose to be heterosexual. was it when you were six months old? was it in third grade? please tell me. i’d like to know so if i have kids or end up becoming a teacher, i can tell my students to choose the easier path.   you also say, ”i have read studies where depending on how a child was raised, it could lead to certain sexual preferences in the child and this comes down to an issue of nurture vs nature.” so i pose the question, if it was the way they were raised and the environment in which they were raised then shouldn’t the environment be blamed? shouldn’t you blame my parents for making me gay and take away their rights instead? after all, i am just a victim of this environment and loving parents that made me gay right? why blame the victim when it is the environment that made them that way? i don’t see why then, they cannot be tolerated as they had no deciding power in deciding the family they were raised in, or the schools they went to.   to talk about chick fil a, which i will now refer to as cfa, they don’t just “hold a corporate opinion,” as you say. they donated millions of dollars to the southern poverty law center (which is actively politically anti-gay), and many other anti-gay political organizations.   cfa funds the family research council: which is a conservative christian group who lobbies against gay people saying they are pedophiles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_research_council cfa also funds exodus international: which diagnoses homosexuality as a disease, and seeks to cure people like myself of it. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exodus_international . and many many more. http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2011/11/01/chick-fil-gave-nearly-2m-antigay-groups-just-2009   cfa’s acts are not acceptance nor tolerance. that is the underlying issue of the cfa and sadly it is heavily overlooked. also, i am certainly not a pedophile nor diseased – i never sexually abused any child nor did i contaminate other people with whatever disease exodus is talking about.  also, there is no such thing as a ‘homosexual lifestyle’. the very classification of gay men and women into one ‘lifestyle’ group is demeaning and insulting. it’s like saying all heterosexual men and women have a ‘lifestyle’ that is all the same. homosexuals are just as diverse as the heterosexuals – there are asian, white, black, latinos, muslims, christians, buddhists, catholics, atheists, vegetarians, hippies, rich ceos (like apple’s tim cook), singers (like ricky martin), leaders (like alexander the great), artists (like leonardo da vinci), and intellectuals like (ralph waldo emerson). and to say that we as homosexuals are asking people to accept our 'lifestyle' is stupid because we don't all live the same way – we are all unique and different just as anybody else.   and if you haven’t noticed, being gay in america is no easy thing. no one would choose to be gay in america. there is a very real existence of a 'gay tax' . gay couples pay, on average, $140,000 more in their lifetime because they are absent the rights, benefits, protections, and responsibilities afforded to straight couples after signing a simple, $35 marriage license. (http://money.cnn.com/2011/12/26/pf/taxes/gay_marriage_taxes/index.htm) also, you are fighting to protect a belief, whereas gay americans are fighting to protect and secure their relationships, families, households, and physical well-being. it is gay men and women who are being physically bashed and killed.  here are a few examples: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/27/charlie-rogers-nebraska-lesbian-anti-gay-hate-crime-victim_n_1710294.html http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-07-18/news/32734422_1_east-baltimore-gas-station-crime-gunman http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/18/mississippi-gay-couple-homophobic-vandalism-_n_1684314.html the vast majority of adversity christians face in america is not because of their religious beliefs, but because they attempt and often succeed in creating laws that literally force others to live by their beliefs as cfa is doing by funding anti-gay political organizations.  on another point, those who are advocating for gay marriage are not trying to stop straight people from getting married. if you are against gay marriage, then don’t marry a guy – simple as that. and whatever happens in someone’s love life and bedrooms is for their personal lives alone. you don’t have to accept a gay couple – just like you don’t accept muslims – but to deny them rights that everyone else is entitled to – such as a right to marry or get government tax benefits as a couple – is discrimination against a large population of people. why don’t we just deny muslims the right to marry too? how bout black people? hmm.. i wonder how the public will react…  that being said.. the mayor’s statement did stand in opposition to chick-fil-a opening a store in boston. he said he would do everything he can to block them – but he as a mayor alone cannot make those decisions. it’s ultimately up to the city council to approve or deny permits to chick-fil-a. these permits can be issued or denied based on zoning and various criteria, but not based on the political views of the ceo. chick-fil-a does not discriminate in hiring or service, so there's no valid argument for blocking the restaurant. do people have the right to boycott and voice their opinion about this issue? yes  do people have the right to backlash against the mayor’s statement? yes of course.   he has a right to voice his opinion publicly and urge them to reconsider is a right in this supposedly ‘free country’. he said ““i urge you to back out of your plans to locate in boston.” but he did not say he won’t allow them permits or business. many have misunderstood his letter and backlash occurred from people like yourself – which is valid and perfectly reasonable. but, the mayor clarified saying “i can’t do that (stop cfa from opening stores) – “that would be an interference to his rights to go there”.",1,1
336258,"abstract:  &gt; jeremy bentham's eighteenth-century writings on the law of marriage addressed contemporary enlightenment debates on marriage. these debates concerned the secularisation of marriage, natural law, and distinctions between law and morals and between nature and culture. bentham drafted a law of marriage based on the principle of utility and on the proposition that men and women were equal. bentham's utilitarian views of sexual relations are made particularly clear in his writings on wives and mistresses, and in his radical suggestions for short-term marriage.  **relevant [/r/historyofideas](/r/historyofideas) search: [love, sex and marriage](http://www.reddit.com/r/historyofideas/search?q=%28love+or+lover+or+lovers+or+marry+or+romance+or+sex+or+sexual+or+sexuality+or+sexy+or+gay+or+gays+or+lesbian+or+lesbians+or+lgbt+or+homosexual+or+homosexuality+or+heterosexuality+or+bisexuality+or+homosexual+or+heterosexual+or+bisexual+or+family+or+marriage+or+concubinage+or+matrimony+or+married+or+friendship+or+friends+or+friend+or+valentine+or+valentine%27s+or+valentines%29+reddit%3ahistoryofideas&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new) - [bentham](http://www.reddit.com/r/historyofideas/search?q=%28bentham+or+benthamite+or+felicific+or+benthamism+or+%22principles+of+morals+and+legislation%22+or+panopticon%29+reddit%3ahistoryofideas&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on)**",1,

133042,"the main problem for me is terrible character design, and an unwillingness of developers to have openly gay characters who feel very 'real' in their games. certain gay characters can be awkwardly shoe-horned into games, especially those that rely on stereotypes and tropes in order to get their sexual identity across, but this is usually because of poor character design.  i think homosexuals and other minorities are vastly underrepresented in games, and i think it's important that game designers spend enough time with each and every character in order to make them feel fully fleshed out. if they're adding a gay character just to 'balance the books' then it's a bad thing, but i don't think the answer to that is them excluding that characters sexuality from the story, i think the answer to that is better character development, instead of deleting a characters sexuality totally.  i think games also suffer vastly from relying on homosexual stereotypes in order to get a characters sexuality across, whereas a straight character usually has some lines of dialogue, a cut-scene with flirting in it, or a love interest, to get across their heterosexuality.  i think the mgs series dealt with homosexuality well (vamp in sons of liberty was bisexual iirc, and in mgs3 we had the volgin and raikov dynamic (and raiden cameo to boot!) which i thought was great because in both instances the sexuality of the characters was expressed in one or two lines and not dwelt on again. in mgs3 it goes even further and shows an outward (though humorous) display of homosexuality when volgin grabs raikov's testicles to make sure it's really his lover.  me3 really missed the mark for me in terms of all relationships, including homosexual ones, because it still basically equated to 'say the right thing to get into x's pants', which, although better than the previous attempts in rpg's, was still a little hollow to me.  there's also the mass-marketing to straight, young, white, heterosexual males which i think plays a part in the development of characters. but i remember reading about the sims 3 controversy where in order to have a homosexual character you had to 'convert' them to homosexuality. and only after doing that could the rest of your town/street contain homosexual characters by default.  (copied and pasted from a sims 3 forum):  &gt;in the unmodded game, the way homosexuality works in the sims 3 is this:   &gt;if you never direct a sim to use a romantic social with another sim of the same sex, there will be no autonomous gay relationships in your town.   &gt;once you use a romantic social with a same-sex sim, your town is marked ""gay friendly"" and you will get autonomous gay relationships.   &gt;so, if you don't want any gay couples, you can already do that. just don't use any same-sex romantic socials.   &gt;beyond that, if you want to control the proportion of same-sex couples, yeah, you need a mod. i believe twallan's story progression has a setting for it. if you don't want to go that far, you can use his supercomputer mod to get demographic information and modify the relationship panels of individual sims.   which to me is ridiculous.  there has also been, of course, a big history of the western games industry censoring japanese games in regards to homosexuality and trans* issues, (copied from wiki):  &gt;although sega allowed lgbt themes and characters in games sold for its home console systems, sega often chose to tone down or erase lgbt characters when porting asian games to american markets. in phantasy star ii, a musician's homosexuality was edited so that the only acknowledgment of his sexual orientation was the fact that he charged all male characters less money for his music lessons.[2] in 1992, when final fight was released for the sega cd and vendetta was released for the sega genesis, minor transgender and homosexual enemies were censored.[3] likewise, sega's streets of rage 3 removed a gay villain wearing village people attire and transformed a transsexual villain into a man with long hair. it is unclear whether lgbt censorship was part of an overall censorship policy or the voluntary decision of a developer.  &gt;in 1994, sega of america would make various changes to the beat 'em up streets of rage 3 from its original japanese counterpart called bare knuckle 3. among the changes was the removal of the boss named ash (with a straight character named shiva replacing him) whose homosexuality was explicitly established by the ""village people"" attire that he wore. ash was taken out of the western edition of the game, but remained a playable character with the aid of the game genie. thus, sega unintentionally became the first major video game company in the west to give the player the option of choosing a gay character.  &gt;the street fighter character zangief has long been thought of as being homosexual, although this was disputed in capcom fighting evolution, where it was stated that he had a girlfriend, although the game is non-canon. the street fighter character eagle, who appears in the original street fighter as well as in capcom vs. snk 2, has however been confirmed to be gay, as a tribute to queen singer freddie mercury, although several of eagle's quotes obviously displaying his orientation were censored in the north american version of the game. in the more recent super street fighter iv, the prologue of the fighter abel hints that his character may be homosexual due to ""settling down"" with a fellow french mercenary. also from super street fighter iv, juri han is hinted at possibly being a lesbian. it is especially evidenced in chun-li and cammy's rival cutscenes where juri seems to flirt with them before proceeding to try and kill them. when her official profile was first released, it also mentioned she loves large breasts.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_themes_in_video_games",1,

848087,"i don't think the film was as concerned about curing brandon (fassbender) as it was about studying him. there are aspects of the movie that seem too familiar to the characters, for instance, brandon's impatience with his sister's neediness (side note: she is not addicted to sex, but guilty of an addiction to attention and will often vie for sympathy in order to attain it). it seems like it's happened numerous times before; most well explained by brandon blatantly ignoring her calls in the beginning, and also his criticisms of her at the end. aside from that, i like your points but i have some rebuttals in mind:   1. you are perhaps right about the waiter. i didn't see it as anything but something to add cuts in the scene's pace. it worked, it established that they were in this realistic setting, and it was a nice dabble of humor. i didn't think it was something to be condemned (but not praised either). it was just *there*.   2. the reason why he does cocaine is because he *knows* he can't get it up for a girl he finds himself emotionally attracted to. again, another familiar problem to him--showing just how deep these issues trouble brandon. it's a great angle to pursue primarily because sex addiction is the least condemned (*especially* if you're a man) so brandon had let it grow so large and consume so much of him.    3. the gay club is the result of him needing something right then and there and that was the only thing that was available (which he did feel very wrongly about so he sought the threesome with the prostitutes). he had just gotten his ass handed to him after trying to seduce a biker's girlfriend (to which he was within an inch of fucking). but his irritability because of his lack of sex in the past weeks combined with the guilt he feels for his anger towards his fragile sister caused by that irritability puts him on a self destructive path. you are correct that he is being self destructive, which he is doing so through the manner of sex.     4. the suicide scene i am trying to decipher myself. i can't remember all the details (i didn't care for it too much when i was watching it). from what i remember she was not in a bathtub but rather was just slumped over the toilet (?). anyway, if she was not in the bathtub, it's possible she knew her blood would clot so it could be that it was a desperate ploy at grabbing sympathy, or even, more maliciously, she is interested in scolding brandon through her actions. if she was in a bathtub, then i'd guess she is likely clinically depressed and earlier in the night brandon had torn down the final part of her she put up to protect herself. siblings have an uncanny ability to rise the most extreme emotions out of you (so i have found to be the case with me and my sisters).   5. the singing scene was long, but it was passionate and if you think about it with the idea of his very conflicted feelings about his sister, it became much more powerful. at that point in time he is annoyed (as she occupies his private space), he feels empathy for her (as she very likely has a troubled past) and he loves her, she is his sister and flesh and blood. that song she sings is a little ironic in nature and bittersweet for *both* of them. the city of new york probably has not been kind to either of them, and her stay there, brandon knows, will not be the best for her. and truthfully, i found it just beautiful despite all that.     bear in mind these are just my thoughts on the film. i did find that it dragged a little bit but that's also because my expectations in pacing have grown to become a little unfair (too many action films.) overall, though, i felt it was superior to most films released this year (perhaps even the best) and what i enjoyed about it was that it seemingly had a clear focus and a simple layout and spent all of its time studying and molding it's characters without being heavy-handed or trite. i thought it had a lot of class and (to me) felt entirely natural.",1,

510219,"&gt;stay home, decorate, keep on cranking your neighbors' property values and being trashy straight girls' lifestyle accessory. you know....assimilate.  i think that's part of the problem. the idea that “you either scream ‘loud and proud’ at pride and prance around in gilded underwear or you become a straight girl’s accessory.” it’s not one or the other. “assimilation” is a scare-word. you can be a proud gay man without announcing your pride to the world. in 2012, you can be a proud, open gay man without being a pride float. and you can be gay without being an interior designer and going shoe shopping every weekend with your female friends. i actually find it somewhat insulting to say you can’t embrace your identity as a proud gay man and you succumb to some sort of straight-societal oppression if you don’t embrace every aspect of pride. ignoring these kinds of concerns, or condemning those who have them by saying “[they don’t] have the courage to be public about who they are,” just contributes to the problem.   the media vastly misrepresents pride. that’s the problem. when you read an article or see coverage from a mainstream news source, you see [this]( http://images.wikia.com/wikiality/images/d/d6/gay_pride_parade.jpg) and [this](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110426054602/uncyclopedia/images/2/21/gay-pride-parade_jpg_250x1000_q85.jpg), not [this](http://i.imgur.com/cbjtn.jpg) and [this](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/51/177798648_417125a2e7_z.jpg). in fact, you almost have to know what to look for to find those latter images. i’d like to quote [depfox](http://gayfamilyvalues.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-does-pride-month-mean-to-you.html):  &gt; it's a testament to the power of these images that even someone who has never been to a parade will have some familiarity with them. they paint a collective picture of one giant mardi gras-like party stocked with shirtless go-go bois on floats, scantily clad  lesbians on loud motorcycles, drag queens in two story tall heels, and rainbows and glitter flying everywhere.  &gt; now...everyone will have their own opinions about what pride celebrations mean. for some, it is simply a celebration. for others it may be a mind blowing first peak at a gay life. and there are those who have criticised (sic) it as being more about selling high priced alcoholic beverages and rainbow covered swag than about promoting gay rights. some see it as a sideshow complete with rainbow colored clowns... and we all know about the crowd that condemn it as an act of ""celebrating sin"" and view it as an example of ""the homosexual lifestyle""...as if we run around in speedo's and balloon costumes everyday.  &gt; …  &gt; by the time i was old enough to go to a parade on my own, i was taking with me a truckload of  and stereotypes. i may have been out and already had my ideas about gay people challenged somewhat by then but one of the feelings i remember vividly feeling was fear. these were the ""bad people"" that my momma warned me about right? and here i was in the thick of it.i was with my very first boyfriend and a good female friend and i was out in the big bad world on my own. it was terrifying and exhilarating all at once.  &gt;what i experienced on that day is forever engraved in my memory because it shattered those preconceived notions of what it meant to be gay. it wasn't because there weren't men wearing nothing but a pair of chaps...or drag queens...or topless lesbians...the sex was there but so was much more. there were couples who had been together longer for decades(something i thought impossible at the time), there were gay seniors and veterans, churchs (sic) and schools marched, and yes...there were gay families. it was all more than i imagined it would be and i began to understand the incredible spectrum of the lgbt life and why it is symbolised (sic) with a rainbow. i sorta grew up in that moment. it was about life and all the people in it...and i had finally found my place....oh, and a hearty love for furry guys...lol. but beyond the spectacle, i had no idea of the meaning or history of a pride parade.  the gay community has changed since the days of stonewall. we face new, different struggles. the changes that have occurred in the gay community aren’t “assimilation into ‘straight culture’” because there isn’t just one way to “be gay.” being gay does not mean being on the sexual fringe or blurring the lines of gender norms. there are plenty of people who are and do, and they are just as free to express their identity as those of us who aren’t and don’t are. today the “white picket fence” and the “heteronormative” (god i *hate* that word) gay man isn’t an insult to the struggles the gay community has faced in the past: he is a testament to those struggles. he is free to live his life as he wishes because the trail was blazed by those who couldn’t or didn’t “blend into the background” per se. i would argue that the gay man who wants to live in a quiet house in the suburbs with his husband and two kids probably would have lived that life in 1970. except that “husband” would have been a “wife.” today he can live proud by living the way he wishes to live. i can say with near-certainty that if i had grown up several decades earlier, i would have never come out. i would have lived an incomplete life and i very likely would have married a woman. but today i live as a proud, open, gay man.   as the gay community and the concept of gay identity changes, so does pride. pride was important back then and it’s important today, but because the openly gay populous has changed and the struggles we face are different, pride is also different. unfortunately, pride has retained its image as a festival of hedonism. to some, it still is that. but to most, it’s something very different. changing the image of pride is a challenge i believe we should take on ourselves. the gay community should bring the less “flashy” aspects of pride into the spotlight to *show* the world – and other gay people – that op’s image doesn’t reflect reality anymore. pride is “our celebration of the fact that we are still alive and being ourselves despite many decades' attempts to snuff us out,” and as such, its image should reflect modern gay culture. a great many gay people are scared away from pride because they believe that it can’t represent them. and that is an incredibly unfortunate thing.",1,

679635,"i wanted to post this from a friend of mine.  i'm more interested in seeing what anti-gay supporters think of the article though.    ""so chick-fil-a has been in a lot of controversy recently.  their president dan cathy has attracted anger from many for condemning gay marriage, causing many to say that a boycott is necessary to punish the chain.  however, wouldn't it be more effective to simply change dan cathy's mind?  chick-fil-a makes great food and it'd be a shame for anyone not to eat there anymore.  but how does one change his views?  his views are religious in nature.  the bible has several verses which specifically denounce homosexuality.  notably the story of sodom and gomorrah, and some rules in the old testament to ancient jewish tribes.  therefore, if something's in the bible and you're religious then it must be true, no questions asked, or else you're engaging in religious discrimination!  however, consider the story of galileo and the catholic church.  he was locked up for revealing that the earth revolved around the sun- why?  because he contradicted the bible.  ""the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved."" ""the lord set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved."" ""and the sun rises and sets and returns to its place.""  there, in the bible.  that's why the catholic church went after him and locked him up because he was seen as a heretic.  years later, the scientific fact of our planet revolving around the sun has emerged as accepted by all, including the catholic church itself.  why the discrepancy?  some stories in the bible are allegorical- ie, if god did indeed make it, he didn't intend it to be a scientific textbook.  or else they can be seen as the invention of ancient men of power in control of translating/approving bible verses.  but what does that have to do with gays?  it's easy.  studies shown of gays show a strong genetic link regarding homosexuality.  if two identical twin siblings grow up together and one is gay, the other is 50% more likely to be gay.  if they live apart, the other is 43% likely to also be gay.  i don't have the exact stats but this also applies to regular siblings as well to a lesser percentage. (somewhere in the 20s i believe)  it's been a few years since i studied this in my old psychology class but i remember it well so i'm surprised it's not brought up more often in debates.  now, that being sad, there's still not a lot we understand about homosexuality.  such as given that (for blatantly obvious reasons) gays and lesbians produce less children then straights do, why does this trait keep manifesting itself?  well, science will have an answer for that in the next few decades.  nevertheless, the statistics regarding homosexuality in family members suggests that homosexuality is indeed genetic.  and not a rare genetic abberation like somebody with elephantitis, but something very common.  that being said, well, the bible still says that homosexuality is wrong.... correct?  it does but, again, it also states that the sun revolves around the earth.  not even pat robertson believes that.  so if someone like pat robertson can admit something in the bible's been proven false, can't he do the same for something else as well?  furthermore, we have to look at scientific understanding of the creation of life- an egg meeting a sperm cell.  centuries ago in europe, people believed that every sperm sample produced by a male was a potential baby.  therefore, wasting sperm - be it through masturbation or different forms of sex incapable of conceiving a child- was equated as being nearly as evil as murder.  today we understand that the body constantly produces sperm samples and that a wasted sperm sample is not the moral equivalent of a murdered baby.  not even the most right-wing fundamentalists like, say, pat robertson literally believe that.  however, if one did hold to that belief (as many in ancient europe did) then guess what?  that meant that, to them, homosexuality was evil and an abomination.  a chronic masturbator was basically just as evil as that idiot who shot up a batman movie while calling himself the joker.  thus, that explains why the condemnation and disgust of homosexuality emerged and why the constantly retranslated, revised and different books/stories approved by the church authorities bible would include verses denouncing homosexuality as they reflected the societies of those times.  so if god did hate gays, why would he enable homosexuality to be passed down genetically in so many abundant cases among heterosexual couples?  what that means is that he probably doesn't hate gays and that, like the verses in the bible about the sun revolving around the earth, those bible verses shouldn't be taken too literally.  anyway, i doubt dan cathy will ever read this but if he does then i hope this is one culture war that he'll retire from and stop fighting.  between massive droughts/crop failures at home and billions in trade deficits going overseas to china, and the neverending wars in the east, we have more important things to worry about in america then scientific superstitions from the past.""",1,
917609,"it may seem like i'm a pansy, but one of the worst experiences of my life was finding a dead dog.   i was about fifteen and had just gotten a co2 powered air-soft gun.  i was heading out one morning in the summer to go put some 6mm holes in some shit.   as i was walking through the alley behind my house, i smelled this terrible, rancid smell.   i began investigating, and saw, out of the corner of my eye, a huge, furry, wriggling mass.   as i approached it, what must've been 100 flies erupted off of the surface of what i quickly figured out was a black garbage bag.   it was moving slightly. like the type of movement you see in your left forearm when you scratch your right shoulder.   i quickly grabbed a sharp stick and cut the bag open where the movement was.   the bag slit open and revealed a handful of maggots over some matted, brown hair and a vomit-inducing stench.   i ran home and called 911.

750760,"you've got a couple different things confused.  ""tg community"" isn't one group. *transgender* is a broad term covering anyone whose gender identity (who they are) or expression (how they present themselves to the world) are considered socially atypical.  *transsexual* is a more specific term. it refers to people, like this miss universe contestant, whose gender identity differs from their anatomical sex at birth. e.g., someone who is neurologically and psychologically a woman, but at birth looked like an infant male. or someone neurologically and psychologically a man, but who appeared female at birth.  the category of ""transgender"" includes transsexual people, but it also includes a lot of other people. any man considered ""feminine"" enough to be noticed for it, any woman who is ""butch"" enough that she's considered atypical, could be called transgender. most transgender people are not transexual.  that said, no, the majority of gender-variant people are not gay. the most visible (to the heterosexual, cisgender population) transgender people are drag kings and drag queens. they are performers - people of varying gender identities and expressions, who entertain by putting on shows through the lense of gender performance.  transgender and gay people are associated with each other, largely because of historical affiliation. being gay is itself a form of gender-variance, and in the not too recent past transgender and gay people were both arrested by the same vice squads, beaten by the same thugs, institutionalized by the same doctors, etc.   and drag shows are associated with queer social scenes, because even now the general population doesn't really differentiate between gender variance in one's mannerisms and fashion choices, and gender variance in one's sexual and romantic partners. a man seen as ""feminine"" will be assumed to be gay, even if he primarily desires women. butch women will be assumed to be lesbian. heterosexuals who are self-conscious about being mistaken for gay or lesbian aren't as likely to be publicly visible as ""feminine"" men/""masculine"" women.   they aren't as likely to become performers, and have a lot of pressure to keep their gender variance hidden in their daily life. people who are gay, or who don't care if people think they're gay, don't have that pressure. so they're going to be a lot more visible.  transsexual people are a distinct category. being a trans woman or a trans man is not a matter of performance, or mannerisms, or fashion choice, or sexual desire. a trans woman is simply a woman, who by chance of fate appeared male at birth. a trans man is a man, who appeared female at birth. this is a physical condition.  nobody transitions (changes from living as one gender to living as another) to ""attract a compatable mate."" people transition because a man can't have a functional or happy life if he's constantly being mistaken for a woman, and a woman will not be happy or functional if she's constantly mistaken for a man.  and transsexual people have as much variety in both sexual orientation and gender expression as anyone else. a trans woman is a woman - and not all women are either heterosexual or conventionally feminine. a trans woman may be a butch lesbian who prefers work boots to makeup. trans men are men, and not all men are straight or ""masculine."" a trans man may be gay and a glitter fairy.",1,

all marriages between a white person and a negro or between a white person and a person of negro descent to the third generation inclusive are, hereby, forever prohibited.  this amendment remained a part of the constitution until a new constitution was adopted 96 years later. in 2012, something like this is so ridiculous and backwards. how the fuck could an amendment like this be a part of a state’s *constitution*? who has that kind of say? who can make that kind of rule? well in 1875 it was apparently completely reasonable. right now nc is incorporating another “amendment one” into their constitution stating that:  &gt; marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state. this section does not prohibit a private party from entering into contracts with another private party; nor does this section prohibit courts from adjudicating the rights of private parties pursuant to such contracts.  which says a lot more than “no same-sex marriage”: it actually really screws over opposite-sex couples in non-marriage domestic partnerships and, perhaps more importantly, the children of those couples.  the second thing that happened on tuesday was that my home state, colorado, failed to pass an initiative legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples. granted, this isn’t nearly as bad or impactful as what happened in nc, but, to me at least, it just added insult to injury. the initiative in colorado was filibustered by the house republicans. after all these months i can’t listen to any more “justifications” for shit like this. it’s just a big “**fuck you**” to every non-heterosexual american citizen. none of this “think of the children,” “gay couples cannot have children, and thus the economic value of having gay marriages is diminished in comparison to straight marriages (be they monogamous or polygamous)” ([from here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/tcw5j/are_there_any_nonreligious_arguments_against/)) bullshit. marriage isn’t about children. if it were, the pressing issue wouldn’t be same-sex marriage, it would be opposite-sex couples who not reproduce (how *dare* they!?). after all the news on tuesday i was pretty crushed. why do they hate us so much? what the fuck is this shit? i “celebrated” by going out and getting really drunk at a gay bar with one of my straight friends. tuesday was not a good day for us.  this week hasn’t been all bad, though. on wednesday, president obama mad an official announcement in support of same-sex marriage. this is huge. this is historic. and he’s doing it for all the right reasons. in an official press release, the president said:  &gt; what i've come to realize is that for loving, same-sex couples, the denial of marriage equality means that, in their eyes and the eyes of their children, they are still considered less than full citizens.  &gt;even at my own dinner table, when i look at sasha and malia, who have friends whose parents are same-sex couples, i know it wouldn't dawn on them that their friends' parents should be treated differently.  i pay my taxes. i follow the rules. i stop at stop signs even when there’s no crosstraffic. yet in this country i am still a second-class citizen. i can’t help but be reminded of this [lovely discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/republican/comments/psgx4/why_are_so_many_republicans_against/c3sbigl?context=3) i had a few months ago. the perspective i’ve always had on homophobes and people who do not support equality is that they will be remembered as the racists and bigots of history: they will be forgotten. someday all of us will be able to stand proud – no different from any other american citizen – with every right and privilege straight people have. unfortunately, today is not that day. there are places where we enjoy *more* rights and acceptance in this country, but with things like doma on the books and the general social atmosphere in many places, we are not true equals yet. *yet*.  i do believe that within ten years we will have earned full legal equality in this country. the federal government will declare things like nc’s amendment one unconstitutional and we will finally be able to walk around outside, knowing that the law is on our side. but things will be far from perfect. the social atmosphere in this country will change much more slowly than the political atmosphere. look at many places in the south: racism still abounds. it’s clearly not universal, but it exists. and it exists on a nontrivial level. the day i will be able to marry my boyfriend i still won’t be able to hold his hand in many parts of this country, and that, bromos, will take significantly more effort to change. i feel that we, as /r/gaybros, are doing a fantastic job of promoting change by showing that gays are not an archetype. we are a diverse community simply brought together by our attraction. this is perfectly illustrated by the fact that there is a “gay group” for nearly everything. unfortunately our fight may never be over, but by never giving up and continuing to fight for what we know is right, we will continue to make progress.  even if you don’t believe in the “institution of marriage,” do not want to get married yourself, or do not want children, it is very important that you stand up for your gay brothers and sisters who *do* want those things. just as no one is *forcing* marriage on you, just like no one is *forcing* same-sex marriage on heterosexuals. my monogamous, hopefully someday-marriage does not preclude any other gay person from living any other life. the fact that i want the “husband, kids, and white picket fence” does not mean that everyone else needs those things. but please don’t think that the fact that you might not want them gives you the right to deny them to me. this is something that has really come to bother me lately: all of the stupid infighting within the gay community over issues like this. i remember someone posting to /r/ainbow (or maybe it was even when i was still reading /r/lgbt) about how the gay community has “lost its identity” and how we used to have a rich culture in the days of stonewall that is becoming lost as we “integrate” ourselves into the mainstream community. this is absolute bullshit. our “rich culture” was one of fear, grids, and secrecy out of necessity, not diversity.  this election will be very important. if you are an american citizen, register to vote. the fact that the nc amendment this was passed with a 16% voter turnout is disgusting. the citizens of north carolina who chose not to participate in our democratic process should be ashamed of themselves. /r/gaybros isn’t telling you what or who to vote for, but we [or at least i] are[/am] telling you that you *need to vote*. no one is saying you should be a single-issue voter, but you really need to consider how important *this* issue is. i will be voting for obama because he has proven himself to be an effective leader and, quite frankly, he has recently demonstrated that he has the potential to be the best thing that has happened to our community in years. in the next four years, things have the potential to get either a lot better or a lot worse in this country. we’ve made a lot of progress. let’s keep that trend going.",1,

129254,"in case anybody is confused, i wrote this   myself  homosexuality is romantic or sexual attraction or behavior between members of the same sex or gender. as a sexual orientation, homosexuality refers to ""an enduring pattern of or disposition to experience sexual, affectionate, or romantic attractions"" primarily or exclusively to people of the same sex; ""it also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, behaviors expressing them, and membership in a community of others who share them.""[1][2] homosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation, along with bisexuality and heterosexuality, within the heterosexual-homosexual continuum (with asexuality sometimes considered the fourth). scientific and medical understanding is that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather a complex interplay of biological and environmental factors.[1][3] while some religious organizations hold the view that homosexual activity is unnatural or dysfunctional,[4] research shows that homosexuality is an example of normal variation in human sexuality and is not in and of itself a source of negative psychological effects.[1] prejudice and discrimination against homosexual and bisexual people, however, have been shown to cause psychological harm.[5] the most common terms for homosexual people are lesbian for women and gay for men, though gay is also used to refer generally to homosexual men and women. the number of people who identify as gay or lesbian—and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences—are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons.[6] in the modern west, according to major studies, 1% to 3% of the population is homosexual, while 2% to 13% have had some form of same-sex sexual contact within their lifetime.[7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] in a 2006 study, 20% of respondents anonymously reported some homosexual feelings, although 2-3% identified themselves as homosexual.[18] homosexual behavior is also widely observed in animals.[19][20][21][22][23] many gay and lesbian people are in committed same-sex relationships, though only recently have census forms and political conditions facilitated their visibility and enumeration.[24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] these relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects.[2] homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred.[33] since the end of the 19th century, there has been a movement towards increased visibility, recognition and legal rights for homosexual people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, and equal access to health care. contents  [hide]  1 etymology 2 history 2.1 africa 2.2 americas 2.3 east asia 2.4

online articles 14 external links etymology  main article: terminology of homosexuality   zephyrus and hyacinthus attic red-figure cup from tarquinia, 480 bc (boston museum of fine arts) the word homosexual is a greek and latin hybrid with the first element derived from greek ὁμός homos, 'same' (not related to the latin homo, 'man', as in homo sapiens), thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex, including lesbianism.[34] gay generally refers to male homosexuality, but may be used in a broader sense to refer to all lgbt people. in the context of sexuality, lesbian refers only to female homosexuality. the word ""lesbian"" is derived from the name of the greek island lesbos, where the poet sappho wrote largely about her emotional relationships with young women.[35][36] many modern style guides in the u.s. recommend against using homosexual as a noun, instead using gay man or lesbian.[37] similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of homosexual as it has a negative, clinical history and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative connotation.[37] gay and lesbian are the most common alternatives. the first letters are frequently combined to create the initialism lgbt (sometimes written as glbt), in which b and t refer to bisexual and transgender people. the first known appearance of homosexual in print is found in an 1869 german pamphlet by the austrian-born novelist karl-maria kertbeny, published anonymously,[38] arguing against a prussian anti-sodomy law.[39][40] in 1879, gustav jager used kertbeny's terms in his book, discovery of the soul (1880).[40] in 1886, richard von krafft-ebing used the terms homosexual and heterosexual in his book psychopathia sexualis, probably borrowing them from jager. krafft-ebing's book was so popular among both layman and doctors that the terms ""heterosexual"" and ""homosexual"" became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation.[40][41] as such, the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th-century tradition of personality taxonomy.  although early writers also used the adjective homosexual to refer to any single-sex context (such as an all-girls' school), today the term is used exclusively in reference to sexual attraction, activity, and orientation. the term homosocial is now used to describe single-sex contexts that are not specifically sexual. there is also a word referring to same-sex love, homophilia. some synonyms for same-sex attraction or sexual activity include men who have sex with men or msm (used in the medical community when specifically discussing sexual activity) and homoerotic (referring to works of art). pejorative terms in english include queer, faggot, fairy, poof, and homo. beginning in the 1990s, some of these have been reclaimed as positive words by gay men and lesbians, as in the usage of queer studies, queer theory, and even the popular american television program queer eye for the straight guy. the word homo occurs in many other languages without the pejorative connotations it has in english. as with ethnic slurs and racial slurs, however, the misuse of these terms can still be highly offensive; the range of acceptable use depends on the context and speaker. conversely, gay, a word originally embraced by homosexual men and women as a positive, affirmative term (as in gay liberation and gay rights), has come into widespread pejorative use among young people. history  main articles: lgbt history and timeline of lgbt history societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death. in a detailed compilation of historical and ethnographic materials of preindustrial cultures, ""strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon.""[42] in cultures influenced by abrahamic religions, the law and the church established sodomy as a transgression against divine law or a crime against nature. the condemnation of anal sex between males, however, predates christian belief. it was frequent in ancient greece; ""unnatural"" can be traced back to plato.[43] many historical figures, including socrates, lord byron, edward ii, and hadrian,[44] have had terms such as gay or bisexual applied to them; some scholars, such as michel foucault, have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary construction of sexuality foreign to their times,[45] though others challenge this.[46] a common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the middle ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. john boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient greek writings by plato,[47] which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.   khnumhotep and niankhkhnum.

721227,"*bayswater*      famous for its paddington train station, this area is a good bet for affordable accommodation that's close to the tranquility of hyde park and kensington gardens.  *belgravia*      belgravia is to the south-west of buckingham palace. it is known for its expensive hotels and is considered by the rich to be a desirable place to live. there are many embassies are in the area. belgravia is generally quiet and is a great area to walk around and admire the georgian houses. there are also a number of exclusive shops, restaurants and attractive pubs.  *bloomsbury*      bloomsbury is london's literary district. this district, a world within itself, is bound roughly by euston road to the north, gower street to the west, and clerkenwell to the east. it is, among other things, the academic heart of london.  *camden*      shoppers and people-watchers flock from far away to crowd the streets and chill out at camden market. good cafes and clubs make camden much more than a great market area.  *canary wharf*, on the isle of dogs, is the heart of *docklands*. this 28-hectare (69-acre) site is dominated by a 240m-high (787-ft.) tower, which is the tallest building in the united kingdom, and was designed by césar pelli. the piazza of the tower is lined with shops and restaurants.       *chelsea*      once a center of innovation in the 19th century when the area was a veritable victorian artists' colony, the beatles and the rolling stones lived in the neighborhood that has since lost in youth culture and settled into a small town atmosphere in the midst of the huge city. chelsea is famous for the king's road for the bohemian sixties and punks in the 1970s. it's a wealthy area like kensington and knightsbridge.  *city of london (the square mile)*      the first settlement of roman conquerors, the city is now the soul of the world's financial markets. modern structures like the lloyd's building may outnumber ancient buildings such as the bank of england and the old bailey but the city also holds the sacred st. paul's cathedral, old spitalfields market, and leadenhall market and the modern museum of london and barbican centre.  *clerkenwell*      this neighborhood, north and a bit west of the city, was the site of london's first hospital and is the home of several early churches. st. bartholomew-the-great, built in 1123, still stands as london's oldest church and the best example of large-scale norman building in the city. in the 18th century, clerkenwell declined into a muck-filled cattle yard, home to cheap gin distilleries. during a 19th-century revival, john stuart mill's london patriotic club moved here in 1872, and william morris's socialist press called clerkenwell home in the 1890s -- lenin worked here editing iskra. the neighborhood again fell into disrepair but has recently been reinvented by the moneyed and groovy. a handful of hot restaurants and clubs have sprung up, and art galleries line st. john's square and the border of clerkenwell green. lest you think the whole area has become trendy, know that trucks still rumble into smithfield market throughout the night, unloading thousands of beef carcasses.  *covent garden*      covent garden's piazza has daily open-air entertainment. the 18th century iron and glass fruit and vegetable market has gracefully evolved into fashion boutiques and other up-market stores. stroll down long acre, floral street and the cobbled neal street or visit the royal opera house. neal's yard is the center for healthy food and alternative therapies.  *docklands*      in 1981, in the most ambitious scheme of its kind in europe, the london docklands development corporation (lddc) was formed to redevelop wapping, the isle of dogs, the royal docks, and surrey docks. the area is bordered roughly by tower bridge to the west and london city airport and the royal docks to the east.  *the east end*      traditionally, this was one of london's poorest districts, nearly bombed out of existence during world war ii. the east end extends east from the city walls, encompassing stepney, bow, poplar, west ham, canning town, and other districts.      these days, many immigrants to london make their homes in the east end. london is pushing eastward. today you'll find lots of trendy bars, clubs, restaurants, and boutiques or vintage clothing outlets here. much of the fashionable life is found around hoxton square and its peripheries, such as shoreditch and the northern half of brick lane. there is an array of contemporary galleries in the area.  attractions you may want to visit if you're in the area include st. clement danes church, the temple of mithras, and sir christopher wren's monument to the great fire of 1666.  *greenwich*      known by most as the center of greenwich mean time at zero degrees longitude, come visit the national maritime museum, the imposing old royal naval college, cutty sark, and greenwich park.  *hampstead*      thick with literary history, you'll find homes of poets, playwrights and actors of past and present marked by endless blue plaques (to show where someone famous once lived). spend an afternoon in kenwood house or wake a stroll on hampstead heath to feel like you're worlds away from the hustle and bustle of london.  *holborn*      the old borough of holborn (ho-burn), which abuts the city southeast of bloomsbury, encompasses the heart of legal london -- this is where you'll find the city's barristers, solicitors, and law clerks.  *islington*      this corner of north london has 'upper street' - a long road of boutique stores and numerous restaurants and bars. there's also camden passage antique shops near angel tube.  *kensington*      kensington is a fashionable residential area on the south side of kensington gardens and kensington palace. there are still enough attractions to support a good selection of hotels, pubs, b&amp;bs, cafes, and restaurants. south kensington has the 'big three' museums: v&amp;a, natural history museum and the science museum.  *king's cross*      long a seedy area in the heart of london, king's cross is facing a massive regeneration program. millions of pounds are going into its decaying infrastructure. the area is still far from chic, but was given renewed importance with the arrival of eurostar, the channel tunnel rail link coming into st. pancras instead of waterloo. because of this change in venue, it's estimated that some 50 million passengers will pass through king's cross annually. six tubes now convene underneath king's cross station, and it is the number-one connection hub enabling visitors to get to and from gatwick and heathrow airports.  *knightsbridge*      one of the priciest and most exclusive areas in london known for upscale shops and restaurants. the stores are luxurious and the homes extravagant so walking through this area is a pleasure. spend a couple hours exploring harrods and then stop into one of the many restaurants or cafes to relax your sore feet.  *mayfair*       the most upscale neighborhood in central london, mayfair is home to elegant hotels for affluent foreigners and many impressive 18th century residences for people of fabulous wealth, plus the us embassy in london. discover first-class shopping at exclusive shops along bond street.  *notting hill*       come explore the retro shops, cafe life, designer boutiques, and antique stalls of portobello road market. the year-round spot where the young, artsy folks live and hang out, and if you're here in august, this hip district is taken over by the world famous notting hill carnival which brings a caribbean flavor to the streets.  *soho*       soho fuses the trendy and grungy to create a hip neighborhood that lives a vibrant double life. still a red light district, it also provides a respectable drinking and dining area. soho is a confusing grid of streets crammed with restaurants. it's a great place to visit, but you probably won't want to stay here  *south bank*       just across from westminster, don't miss the london eye (a gigantic wheel offering unrivaled views of the city) and the newly-refurbished royal festival hall which is part of the south bank centre. see the skateboarders under the royal festival hall and visit the south bank book market under waterloo bridge. loads of free entertainment every summer: music, theater and performances.  *southwark*       shakespeare still appears at the famous globe theatre while tate modern boasts a shining cultural program. stroll the riverside to lambeth palace, the official residence of the archbishop of canterbury or pay homage to cricket at the oval.  *westminster*      the british empire, and once the world, was ruled from whitehall. royalty, government, and monumental london come together in the shadows of big ben and the houses of parliament. walk near the kings and queens buried in westminster abbey and take your own quiet stroll through st. james's park and green park. westminster also encompasses victoria, an area that takes its name from bustling victoria station, ""the gateway to the continent."" many b&amp;bs and hotels have sprouted up here because of the neighborhood's proximity to the rail station. victoria is cheap and convenient if you don't mind the noise and crowds.  welfare recipients occupy many hotels along belgrave road. if you've arrived without a hotel reservation, you'll find the pickings better on the streets off belgrave road.",0,

[emph. mine]  these criteria for some sort of meaningful change is pretty poor. someone could be mostly attracted to men but still quite into women, and end up self-reporting as mostly into women but still quite attracted to men and fall well within these criteria for meaningful straightification.  &gt;forty-three percent of the 200 participants learned about the study from ex-gay religious ministries and 23% from the national association for research and therapy of homosexuality, a group of mental health professionals and lay people who defend the right of gay men and lesbians to receive sexual reorientation therapy.  this strikes me as like selecting patients from the *i believe that accupuncture cures teh cancer newsletter*.  anyway, they show a change unsurprisingly, but i'm not sure what that even means. there is no control group and the study is poorly designed. if you wanted to find out does reorientation therapy work and to what degree this is not how you would do it. it might be interpreted to provide some evidence that sexuality is not totally rigid and changes somewhat through time, but i'm not sure who is supposed to be arguing against that.  handedness is a congenital trait established before we are born. children can be forced to use the opposite hand but that doesn't really mean that handedness is not biological or innate to large degree.",1,

473249,"i agree.  i think it's a media-based/culturally generated thing; the idea of a woman as an independent, dominant, sexual being, intimately interacting with another female does essentially buy-in to the fantasies of many men, and even some straight women. in theory, and in popular culture, lesbianism is depicted as being super sensual, practiced by beautiful women with other beautiful women. (think porno; tila tequila and tv; the 'l' word)  of course we have famous lesbian figures like k.d lang for example who don't exactly fit into the hot, busty, domineering hollywood concept of a sellable lesbian.  looking at it from the male-angle, one could go old school an give some credit to deeply entrenched gender roles and stereotypes that apply to men. he's strong, he's the provider, he's a virile life giving source and the family's protector. i think whether we like it or not, women are essentially and stereotypically built up to be the more weak and submissive sex- so two women engaging in sexual relations seems more harmless;; there's no dick in the equation so even though there may be sexual paraphernalia &amp; so on, conceptually, the whole thing seems more harmless and from a superficial, glamorous porno p.o.v, sexier. women are physically sexier than men. the breasts, the curves, the gentle features.     then we think of male homosexual interaction; sodomy is a taboo topic, even condemned in religious texts; people may practice it, both gay &amp; straight, but it's definitely taboo and in essence, much less sellable to the wider, primarily heterosexual society. it's generally more graphic, more confronting, and less glamorous that lesbian intercourse; (think back to how it was represented in brokeback mountain). so my point is, gay sex is significantly less sellable to the primarily hetero populace than lesbianism is, the idea of lesbian interaction is less threatening to the heterosexual mind.",1,

863444,"&gt; what would your solution be to the king/queen issue?  already suggested one! if you're having the popularity contest, elect people irrespective of gender (there's a compelling argument in terms of bi and genderqueer etc., people's identities). you're avoiding the point here though: you're criticising gay/bi people for not accommodating straight people when straight people aren't making accommodations for gay/bi people. it's a double standard.  &gt; i'm honestly not sure what you mean by heteronormative.  with gay/bi people at a prom, the mostly likely to run into this are *lesbians* if one wants to turn up in a tuxedo. whilst you're arguing that it's the school system as a whole that's the problem, that doesn't mean the prom's not a straight pride event, it just means that the scale of the problem is bigger than the prom.  (roughly, heteronormativity is the expectation that 'you have a penis therefore you are a man there you like women therefore will get married to one, have children and be the principle breadwinner and protector' (or similar for women). that's not to say all straight people perfectly adhere to it, but it should be fairly obvious how many events, including a prom fit into that framework.)  &gt; i felt that by avoiding a heterosexual couple, they were proving the point that ""yeah, we don't need homosexual couples at standard proms because we can do our own thing to be recognized.""  having to have your own prom to have representation really strongly sends the message that the 'standard prom' *does not* include you. why would you go to the effort and expense otherwise? specifically going out and picking a heterosexual couple would send messages like 'homosexuals agree that they should accommodate us [straight people], therefore, we don't have to do anything'.   &gt; i wasn't around pre-stonewall. i don't know what it used to be like.  nor was i, but we've got recorded history, so we don't actually need to have been there to gain familiarity with the topic.  &gt; just because an event doesn't have rainbows and have ""gay pride"" in the name, it doesn't mean it is a straight-themed event.  nor does having rainbows mean that it's 'gay-themed'. however, an event where there's an expectation that people come as male/female couples and specifically defines it's representative couple as male/female *is* straight themed, especially if that type of event has a history of excluding lgbt+ people.  &gt; i don't see the difference between the person who marks as different in a negative way, and the person who marks us as different in a positive way.  this is nonsense. just as there's a big difference between getting a job promotion and getting fired, there's a big difference between being marked as different for positive reasons rather than for negative reasons. what's muddying the waters are your examples. for instance, ""oh, that person is gay, awesome i love gay people let's go get a picture gay pride yeah!"" is actually negative - you're being marked in a way that objectifies you.  &gt; i don't join ""white male club""s. most people would counter that argument by saying that society is a white male club -- and maybe it's because i'm a white male and lack the perspective, but i don't see how i belong to a special club.   life is just smoother as a cis white male. if you go for a job, you're probably pretty close to the person who they imagined doing the role. everyone else has the additional hurdle of showing they're the type of person that'd fit in that role. this issue applies to almost every aspect of your life. you're just so saturated in it that you can't see it, in the same way that you don't see air unless you're underwater (at which point the water/air interface is obvious). i think your own privilege as a white   &gt; if there was such a thing as a ""straight pride event"" i don't really see any gay people showing up to that either.  i've already argued that there blatantly is, however, if you want a really egarious example, try the new york st. patrick's day parade. are you seriously suggesting that gay people don't turn up to that?  &gt; who else is going to try to change what is considered ""normal""? isn't that on us?  why should it just be us? we're probably going to have to for the most part, but that doesn't make it right.  you've assumed the aim is to be normal, rather than, *stopping the abuse*. you might argue that being 'normal' would stop the abuse, but the fundamental basis behind 'normal' is a nasty one. by arguing that by becoming normal gay/bi people won't be abused, you're implicitly accepting that it's ok that people who aren't presently considered 'normal' are abused. a better goal would be to get people to stop hating on people because of race, because of gender or because they're not able or willing to interact with society in the way that you believe they should.  &gt; if we stop clarifying our sexuality, then maybe heterosexuals would stop clarifying their sexuality.  given i learnt what gay was due to heterosexual people clarifying their sexuality (via 'no homo' and the like), i don't believe this is true. also, the social dynamics of 'i'm gay' are quite different from those around 'i'm straight', but mostly, i have no idea how gay people are going to seen as a normal part of society if people aren't aware that they're gay? only being visible when you're with your partner, and you're holding hands really reduces the number of apparent gay people, is completely impossible for bi people and discounts people who don't like public displays of affection.  &gt; there are more heterosexual people than homosexual people.  actually, there's a fair few studies that suggest that more people have homosexual fantasises than don't! hell, gay and bi people being solicited on the basis that 'because i'm straight, it'll just be sex' isn't exactly uncommon.",1,

i love my children. i love my friends, my brother. heck, i even love my mother-in-law. should we call these relationships marriage, too?” (2008)            “i’m worried when many people will stand up and say, ‘well whatever the generals want.’ i’m not too sure that we haven’t indoctrinated the officer corps in this country that they can actually see straight to make the right decisions.” (on repealing don’t ask, don’t tell)  (2011)            on gay adoption: “a lesbian woman came up to me and said, ‘why are you denying me my right?’ i said, ‘well, because it’s not a right.’ it’s a privilege that society recognizes because society sees intrinsic value to that relationship over any other relationship.” (2011)            “i certainly would not approve of [a bill moving through the california legislature compels the state to add gay history to the state education curriculum], but there’s a logical consequence to the courts injecting themselves in creating rights and people attaching their legislative ideas to those rights that in some respects could logically flow from that. so i’m not surprised.” (on teaching lgbt history in schools) (2011)            “i would argue, this right to privacy … doesn’t exist in my opinion in the united states constitution, this right that was created, it was created in griswold — griswold was the contraceptive case — and abortion. and now we’re just extending it out. and the further you extend it out, the more you — this freedom actually intervenes and affects the family. you say, well, it’s my individual freedom. yes, but it destroys the basic unit of our society because it condones behavior that’s antithetical to strong healthy families. whether it’s polygamy, whether it’s adultery, where it’s sodomy, all of those things, are antithetical to a healthy, stable, traditional family.” (2003)            “ i have no problem with homosexuality. i have a problem with homosexual acts. as i would with acts of other, what i would consider to be, acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. and that includes a variety of different acts, not just homosexual. i have nothing, absolutely nothing against anyone who’s homosexual. if that’s their orientation, then i accept that. and i have no problem with someone who has other orientations. the question is, do you act upon those orientations? so it’s not the person, it’s the person’s actions. and you have to separate the person from their actions.” (2003)            “in this case, what we’re talking about, basically, is priests who were having sexual relations with post-pubescent men. we’re not talking about priests with 3-year-olds, or 5-year-olds. we’re talking about a basic homosexual relationship.” (on the catholic church’s international pedophile priests scandal, in which, for decades, priests have sexually assaulted, molested, and raped young boys and girls.)

852491,"the reason why there are no good reasons for homosexuality being harmful is because homosexuality **isn't** harmful. it's just a variant of human sexuality.  as far as i've read (and believe me, i read a lot on this topic), islam hasn't given any logical reason for forbidding homosexuality. it's basically ""allah says it, that settles it"" situation.  the reasons i can think of as to why homosexuality was outlawed in islam because:  1. muhammad thought (and people still think) that gay people are actually attracted to people of the opposite gender but have sex with people of the same gender out of desperation &amp; lust.  this is not true. homosexuals are naturally attracted to members of the same gender, it comes naturally to them. homosexual behaviour isn't unnatural, it's even found in animals:  http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/23/20718.aspx  and do you think somebody as handsome as matt bomer would have a problem finding a woman if he were indeed straight?  http://media-cache-ec3.pinterest.com/upload/126663808239868612_rcifdj44_c.jpg   2. muhammad thought homosexual relationships are just about sex even though in reality they're much more than that. a gay or lesbian couple are two people who are in love, who love each other in the same way you would love your husband/wife and they have sex to express their affection for each other just like you would. they don't harm anybody yet islam wants them to be punished simply for something they can't control.  3. homosexuality isn't as common as being straight &amp; the fact that people were so intolerant back then must have made it even more difficult for a gay person to come out and educate other about his feelings.  4. muhammad also thought anal sex was bad &amp; unclean. umm, clean the anus properly then.  5. the culture islam tries to promote is a culture that demonizes sex.  it goes as far as to limit the sex acts you can engage in with your spouse. you're not allowed to have anal sex with your wife, you're not allowed to touch yourself, you're not even allowed to look at a non-mahram woman whose head is uncovered. it's no surprise this religion displays utter ignorance of same-sex love.  and about that ""interest of the family"" point you mentioned, how can any person claim these people are not a family:  http://www.assyriancupid.com/images/gallery/lesbian2.png  http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m52r0y1gis1r9aj4qo1_500.jpg  http://deescib.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/lesbian-parents.jpg   http://10thousandcouples.com/upload/1090/news/barrie_and_tony_drewitt-barlow.jpg   http://www.examiner.com/images/blog/wysiwyg/image/lesbians(5).jpg   http://anotsodifferentview.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tumblr_liqogfdpxx1qewl7p.jpg?w=620   they are two people who are in love with each other, they are in a committed relationship, they live under the same roof and take care of each others' needs, they have sexual relations and they are parents of their children. what else constitutes a family?  if any moron tries to claim that they're not a family because the child only has the genes from one of the parent (e.g. the blonde mom), you punch them right on their ugly face.  take this example: if a woman who has a daughter from a previous marriage marries a man who has no children, then they're not a family too if we use the moron's logic because hey, the daughter doesn't have the genes of her stepfather. the fact is they are a family, even an infertile couple are a family.  another pathetic argument some people use is ""homosexuality causes aids"". let me make it absolutely clear: gay sex does not magically make hiv viruses. hiv is an evolved form of siv (simian immunodeficiency virus) that jumped from chimpanzees to humans when people in africa hunted siv-infected chimps for bushmeat. to learn more:   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_hiv/aids#section_1  and nowadays, hiv is being spread more by heterosexuals. having unprotected sex &amp; not getting tested is to blame, not the *kind* of sex you have.  i know i went a little off-topic up there but i just wanted to assure you that being gay is a-okay :) besides, a religion whose prophet had sex with a 9-year old girl &amp; who thought raping married women captured through war is okay (sahih muslim 8:29:3432, quran 4:24) should not be your moral compass. all people deserve to live their life with the person they love regardless of gender :)",1,

354996,"the secular argument for gay marriage that i came up with the last time this arose ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/s9y5x/i_have_to_write_a_speech_on_why_gay_marriage/), i think - warning, it is /r/gaybros, so mind the naked fratboys, i assure you they don't bite unless you ask nicely). i'll try to re-create my argument from there for you, if you don't want to wander into the deeps of the lgbt subreddits. (spoiler alert: i'm gay, so it is something that's kinda close to my heart).  &gt;the original (stonewall-era) lgbt activists were apparently pretty anti-establishment, including marriage. conservatives initially reacted and said that the whole lifestyle was immoral, predicated on the fact that they couldn't get married. then we called their bluff and we've been fighting about it ever since.  &gt;so you could go back and fight that battle from the other side - marriage is a flawed, socially constructed institution whose traditions have become corrupted and inaccurately reflect the complexities of modern life - for gay people as well as straight people. moreover, the ""life cycle"" of gay men and lesbian women are different from the typical courses taken by straight couples - there are extra hurdles (coming out, legal issues, discrimination), familial complications (including more people getting disowned or disinherited) and serious social stigma. creating an alternative system, given those problems, would hypothetically enable institutions that were more sensitive to the needs and desires of lgbt citizens than applying the ""one-size-fits-all"" system of marriage.  i don't think there's a moral stance without religion that can persuasively say that a committed, loving couple in the modern era should not have the right to acknowledge or strengthen their relationship. given that, you need *something* to acknowledge it for gay people - straights have this lovely, fucked-up, archaic institution that was originally meant to transfer ownership of women and ensure paternity for aristocratic succession. those aren't really issues for gay men or lesbians (or for heterosexuals, but i digress since we're talking about lgbt marriage at the moment).   so instead of all the legal rights that straight couples get, you could take the necessary ones - tax provisions, visitation rights, shared insurance and pension benefits, considerations for the bereaved, etc., etc. - and then create a few *new* rights tuned to the needs of same-sex couples. for example, greater access to fertility treatments and adoption proceedings, streamlined procedures for the same, extra protections against discrimination, or preferred access to medical health professionals (something that affects lgbt subgroups in higher proportions than others - usually a result of the trauma of coming to terms with atypical sexuality at a sensitive age). then you wind up with two (or more, if you want to extend this logic and make separate arrangements for gay men and lesbians) institutions: traditional heterosexual marriage, and lgbt unions, each with a different set of responsibilities, rights, and privileges.   practically, this would never happen. the opposition to lgbt rights is wrapped up in religious language and driven largely by bigotry justified by the same. no biblical scholar will take a legal judgement from leviticus at face value and apply it to the modern world without damning themselves for hypocrisy, but when it comes to repressing people they don't like for reasons they'd rather not confront, out comes the old testament (or the hadith, or what have you). china, which is a nominally secular state, doesn't acknowledge homosexual relationships, but societal rejection of homosexuality is a relatively new phenomenon (by chinese standards, at least) because it was apparently imported with islamic, christian, and western religious and ideological movements. ([wiki source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexuality_in_china)) the main opposition to same-sex marriage there is lineage-related (made more important by the one-child policy) because families want to see their names continued, etc, etc.   apologies for walls of text and excessive parentheses. i wax verbose while i'm killing time before i need to leave for work. here's the tl;dr for the lazy.  **tl;dr:** marriage is kinda fucked up anyway and doesn't serve its original purpose for straight people, much less gay people. make a separate institution that's actually tuned to the needs of gay couples, because marriage is inappropriate or inferior in comparison.",1,
805769,"and, in the movies that op is referring to, girl-kissing-girl scenes *are* overwhelmingly benefitting some man, somewhere, i.e. the men in the audience. it's amazing how many movies are seemingly targeted towards straight men, even self-proclaimed chick flicks. there are obviously several exceptions, but the party line is to make any lesbian tendencies non-threatening to straight men, either by having the girl end up with a guy in the end, by having the girls very heterosexual-looking (i.e. they look straight and stereotypically ""hot"") and not a huge part of the plot, or often by killing them in the course of the plot.  guys, on the other hand. if you can find guys with homosexual leanings in mainstream movies, then they almost always must die, or else be so  de-sexualized and trivialized they become less of a man and more of a neutered character or a pet (i.e. sassy gay friend for a straight woman). and even then you are very unlikely to see any gay kisses on screen, let alone sex scenes. again, anything to make these characters completely non-threatening.",1,

198308,"&gt;can you prove to me that hanafis do not distinguish between adultery and homosexuality?  as i thought, you don't have any proof so you try and put the onus on me. you made the claim, back it up with actual proof.   ----------------------------------------- &gt;hanafis follow the logic that to come under the category of hadd, it needs to be explicitly mentioned. since they are not in the quran in that way (although they are mentioned, such as in prophet lut's (as) case, it is not expressly stated in the same way that adultery is), they have concluded that it cannot be punishable in that way.  [here is a hanafi source clearly stating the punishment for homosexuality with hadith.](http://www.islam.tc/cgi-bin/askimam/ask.pl?q=3056&amp;act=view)\  the quran is also very explicit as to what was done to these people. they were destroyed and buried in one of the worst possible punishments mentioned in the quran.  with regards to a hadith, the source also provides this hadith :  ""since such type of behaviour was previously totally unknown to the arab  people, there is no record of any such incident having occurred during the  time of rasulullah (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) or that he was faced with a  case of this nature. however, it has been confirmed that rasulullah  (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) said,   '**kill the one who sodomizes and the one to who lets it be done to him.'**  (tirmizi) ""  -------------------------------------------------- &gt;fine, you want a reason apart from it being a 'punishment from god'? a lack of safe sex being practiced. rape. drugs. people having multiple partners and not having regular sti checks. there are many, many reasons. but being gay is not one of them.  i can really see you are not an honest person by this comment. since when were homosexuals, greater rape victims and drug users than heterosexuals? ofcourse you don't have any proof to back this up either. [i quote](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070913132930.htm)  ""the results showed that for the straight us population to experience an epidemic of hiv infection as great as that of gay men, they would need to average almost five unprotected sexual partners every year.""  ""gay men are therefore far more susceptible to the spread of the virus through the population, even with the same numbers of unprotected sexual partners.""  even the science community admit that homosexuals are far more likely to contract aids than heterosexuals.  ---------------------------------------- &gt;but it still exists amongst muslims. you said:  not as much as the rest of the world, and the primary cause is promiscuity which is against islam. it has nothing to do with homosexuality.   ------------------------------------------ &gt;and we're not 'saved' from it. that's why i pointed out the middle east and north africa. it doesn't matter if they have the lowest or the highest statistics for hiv and aids, muslims can still be infected, and it may have nothing to do with 'following sharia'.  where did i say muslims can't contract the disease? i said we are saved from homosexuality and in essence should be safe if muslims adhered to the laws of shariah. ofcourse you won't want admit that, but try and paint my point by saying muslims won't get aids.  ------------------------------------------ &gt;what if someone was raped and contracted it? would you say that it was caused because... they deserved it? that they were not following islam?  is the topic rape and aids, or about homosexuality? why are you trying to deviate from the topic?  ---------------------------------------- &gt;the three prominent 'high risk' groups are msm relations, injecting drug users, and people who receive blood products.  i have already shown proof, that msm out numbers all the others with msm being 61% of population. drug users and blood transfusions are very low.  ----------------------------------------- &gt;have you looked at the statistics for the uk? in 2003-4 the number of people with hiv and aids who got it from heterosexual activity was double that of those who got it from homosexual activity. currently the numbers have decreased and the two are now equal.  source needed. just because you say it, it doesn't make it true.  ---------------------------------------------------- &gt;you really need to learn what 'shariah' is. it's not this big book of laws that you seem to assume that it is.  you can't even provide proof of the claims you made regarding the hanaif fiq and you want to question my understanding of the shariah? you don't want to admit what the medical industry admits to regarding homosexuals and the higher rates at which they contract aids and you want to question my understand of shariah?  --------------------------------------------------- &gt;&gt;lastly, that aids statistic still doesn't take away the overwhelming evidence that shows the far greater risk of contraction for homosexuals which is clearly evidence by the 61%. &gt;so? where are you going with this point?  if homosexuality is such a good act, then why are their own bodies telling them that it's worst, much worst for them than being heterosexual?",1,

698870,"do you have any better explanation? at least it is an approach that excludes any personal factors which is a much more neutral approach from a sociological standpoint. also just as every human behaviour is rooted in mechanisms that can be explained in neurosicence so does every social norm come from evolutionary traits being used in practice. it is hard to falsify because even when the particular set of circumstances was wrong the general idea is by definition correct. **we are what we are because we evolved this way.** it might be vague for the purpose of explanation but is hardly ever wrong. also testing evolution among anything bigger than bacteria is practically impossible  also since there tends to be more deviation among males in terms of sexuality and reproduction lesbians ""not working out"" more often than gay males or straight couples can be evolution trying to correct an obvious dead end. the evolutionary purpose of a female is to reproduce successfully and that involves a lot of things while the purpose of a male is just to shoot the sperm in. lesbians are really unsuccessful from that standpoint while gay men really do not do all that bad.  the problem with arguing evolutionary approach is that social sciences are awfully politicized and reqularly quite un-scientific. therefore pushing bullshit ideological explanations requires battling anything that gives out the wrong flavour even remotely. this is why there is such resistance to adopting that approach. how on earth can you negotiate feminist and gender ""science"" with the fact that the purpose of a female is to have children and reproduce, reproduce, reproduce...  edit: what i meant by excluding personal factors is that if we were to focus on psychology (because that is essentially what it boils down to) then that would mean that lesbians are statistically meaner, less responsible or mature individuals. while that might actually be correct in the case that those individuals would  be ""lesbians"" by ""choice"" while being essentially bisexual but repressive towards heterosexual intercourse - which then might be the result of something damaging (like abuse etc) i think it is simply much easier and less controversial to start with the premise that we are reproductive machines that are ""fine"" tuned to reproduce sexually and lesbians are simply not imitating that well enough.  homosexuality is - from biological standpoint - a very simple deviation that does not override a larger set of reflexes, morphology etc. it is much easier for a gay male to ""cheat"" the reproductive instinct. for a woman it is very hard.    and so i have an idea on how to test it - by examining lesbian couples without children of their own, adopted children, and biological children - including by both females and just one. if my hypothesis is correct - couples that share offspring should exhibit less negative traits than those without kids and couples with both females having children should have less issues than those where a male-female dichotomy is imitated in reproductive roles. at least in a very simplistic description.",1,

388874,"if it's from intimate relationships, why does so much of it match, word for word, the wlc article?  i'm not attacking your position because it's conservative. i'm attacking it because it's wrong, and encourages prejudice.  your claim about the life expectancy of lgbt people comes from a fundamentalist reading obituaries in gay newspapers and extrapolating freely. from the splc article you didn't bother to read:  &gt;on the basis of the same obituaries, cameron also claimed that gay men are 18 times more likely to die in car accidents than heterosexuals, 22 times more likely to die of heart attacks than whites, and 11 times more likely than blacks to die of the same cause. he also concluded that lesbians are 487 times more likely to die of murder, suicide, or accidents than straight women.  does that sound like good research to you? because your boy schmidt accepted it without question.  your numbers about sti infection rates come from patients at sti clinics - hardly a representative sample. it's like saying 100% of teenagers are pregnant because every teenager you saw in the maternity ward was. i may not have a degree in sociology, but i'm pretty sure that's not how that's done. if you want, i'll ask a sociologist.  &gt;75% of homosexual men have more than 100 sexual partners during their lifetime  the number of partners a person has in their life is none of your business. i have a lot of sexual partners, and it can't stop me from getting married. hell, if my wife consents, i can even keep sleeping with new people *after i'm married*.  &gt;only 8% of homosexual men and 7% of homosexual women ever have relationships lasting more than three years  you know, those relationships might last a bit longer if they could, like, get married. i, too, have never had a relationship that's lasted more than 3 years. does that mean i can't get married?  &gt;male homosexuals average over 20 partners a year  so?  &gt;homosexuals in general are three times as likely to be problem drinkers as the general population  &gt;studies show that 47% of male homosexuals have a history of alcohol abuse and 51% have a history of drug abuse.  &gt;there is a direct correlation between the number of partners and the amount of drugs consumed.  &gt;40% of homosexual men have a history of major depression.  &gt;that compares with only 3% for men in general  &gt;similarly 37% of female homosexuals have a history of depression homosexuals are three times as likely to contemplate suicide as the general population  &gt;in fact homosexual men have an attempted suicide rate six times that of heterosexual men, and homosexual women attempt suicide twice as often as heterosexual women  every claim you've listed here can be attributed to the effects of homophobia and persecution on gsm communities - assuming they're true. this was pointed out to schmidt, and he ignored it and the psychologists who've done the research into the matter.  &gt;studies show that homosexuals are much more likely to be pedophiles than heterosexual men  this persistent myth has never been true. the 'studies' you refer to are small, poorly sampled, and conducted by people with a clear bias. you can read a treatment of the matter from a scientific perspective here:  http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html  you'll notice a large bibliography for that article if you bother to click the link.  &gt;homosexual activity, 80% of which is carried out by men, is very destructive, resulting eventually in such problems as prostate damage, ulcers and ruptures, and chronic incontinence and diarrhea.  you never answered: by 'homosexual activity', do you mean anal sex?  &gt;75% of homosexual men carry one or more sexually transmitted diseases, wholly apart from aids  it's difficult to check this fact without knowing what you mean by 'sexually transmitted diseases' - persistent infections only, incidental, or just any bug you get from bumping uglies. that being said, the cdc provides a more nuanced, informative, and accurate set of numbers, which you can read here:  http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/msm.htm  &gt;perhaps the most shocking and frightening statistic is that, leaving aside those who die from aids, the life expectancy for a homosexual male is about 45 years of age. forty five!!!! if you include aids (39% of men) it is 39!!!!!!!!!!!!!  here's a study looking at the life expectancy of msms (men who have sex with men - including gay and bisexual) who actually have hiv:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22089374  their numbers? between 75 and 71.5 years depending on how early the virus is detected, a loss of 7-10.5 years from the average. your numbers are 20 years old, and they were lies then.   this is why i'm attacking your position. it's wrong and harmful. find another justification for your bigotry.",1,

607160,"&gt;the majority of transitions remain straight white males who have a twisted cock response to clothing labeled ""girls"" or ""womens"". males known as autogynephiles or as i call them, female fetishizers. males who fetishize the patriarchal male gaze constructed idea ""woman/femininity"".  &gt;female fetishizers carry out transvestism to the nth degree in search for greater and greater sexual highs.  &gt;the medical community didnt invest in sex changes until the kinsey reports of (1948) and (1953) which concluded at least 10% of the population was homosexual and 37% of males had had a homosexual experience.  so trans women are actually men who want to have the patriarchy to oppress them, and they were given the idea by the patriarchy so that the patriarchy could get money from trans women.   9/11 truthers might be more sane than that.  &gt;the trans politic was created by straight white males-female fetishizers-using politics to further their pornographic urgers, not so dissimilar to nambla's political pedophilia via the gay and lesbian platform.   a political agenda was started by trans women, to allow them to become trans, which makes them like nambla. i guess that's sorta true, in the same way that the democratic party is like nambla because they both have a political agenda.  &gt;gay males who transition do so out of internalized homophobia, usually within a hyper masculine minority culture amid the larger white culture.  &gt;since gay white male popularity and large media visibility, gay white male transitions have drastically decreased to near nonexistence.   what? gay men transition into trans women to have sex with men because they don't feel masculine enough as a man? i'm pretty sure that you can't transition if your issue is insecurity about gender roles. you need some actual dysphoria in there.  &gt;in quantity, lesbian transition was largely unheard of until the backlash against feminism rode its trojan horse-queer theory-into academia and then the lesbian community.  &gt;a huge phase of feminist backlash is hyper-femininity.  &gt;not until hyper-femininity began reaching new undreamed of heights did dykes begin transitioning in numbers.   so trans men are actually lesbians and the only reason trans men transition is because of the backlash against feminism. i don't even know what that means.  &gt;transitioning children has been rare due to the lack of legal medical grounds to do so.  children who want to transition are a really awkward scenario, because children change their mind all the fucking time. the whole point of years of therapy pre transition is to make sure that the person won't change their mind post transition. as the child matures, they may not want to have actually transitioned, and that's an irrecoverable position.  &gt;since the recent publication of the dsm5 which includes transitioning children, the trans kid phenomena has skyrocketed.   &gt;trans kids are considered children who do not sport the gender straight jacket.  &gt;trans kids if left alone will grow up in most cases to be healthy gay and lesbian adults.  &gt;homophobic parents are transitioning their children rather than have a gay son or lesbian daughter.  &gt;transitioning children is an overt attempt to eradicate gays and lesbians in their youth.  this is batshit. parents who don't want gay or lesbian children would never let their child transition. they'd probably beat the shit out of them instead.  outside of that, how do parents come up with 'let's force my kid to transition!'? if it's an overt attempt to destroy lesbian and gay children's identities, then who is pushing that as an agenda? it's not the liberal media, and i can't think of any sort of group who would actually want to push that as an agenda. even if there was, as children grow up they begin to be able to talk about their abuse as children, and someone being pushed/forced into transition by their parents would be pretty big news.  &gt;transition is the only treatment for modern mental illness that barbarically removes or rearranges healthy body parts for its cure.  isn't there a mental illness where a person believes that their limbs aren't their own, and the solution is amputation? therapy and drugs don't work, they'll just grab a chainsaw and cut off their leg.  that's probably not a mental illness though, so whatever.  &gt;the gid/gi diagnoses requires the patient be suffering from dysphoria (severe uncomfortableness with the body or how the body is viewed by society).  absolutely.  &gt;female fetishizers who make up most transitions never suffer from dysphoria.  &gt;all females suffer from varying degrees of dysphoria.  &gt;yet lesbians remain the prime females receiving transition as a cure for their dysphoria.  men who want to be women because their bodies as men keeps them from being able to be oppressed by men don't suffer from dysphoria, which the author defined as being uncomfortable with how the body is viewed by society. society is, as far as the author is concerned, patriarchy, so this makes no sense.   however, women wanting to transition due to their dysphoria as women is wrong, because although all women have dysphoria, trans men are actually lesbians and lesbian dysphoria isn't the right type of dysphoria to transition.  &gt;transition has never cured anyone of their dysphoria.  if we've defined all trans women/'female fetishizers' as not having dysphoria and all trans men as not having the right type of dysphoria, this does make sense. rather odd that anyone who transitions doesn't have dysphoria, and dysphoria is required to transition though.  &gt;dysphoria relief from transition is temporary.  &gt;dysphoria increases over time post transition.  i can't even. no one who transitions has dysphoria, but transitioning relieves dysphoria for a time before creating even more dysphoria, despite the person making an informed choice about themselves beforehand.  &gt;outside of transition, no therapy has been used to ease dysphoria or attempt to cure it.  no one ever used shock therapy/beating the trans away? that's fairly surprising.  &gt;cis is an organic chemistry term trans persons use misogynistically to attack primarily feminist and separate themselves from non transitioners.  i see cis getting used to hate on *anyone* who doesn't transition, not just women. that's not misogyny.  &gt;because the trans identity is self created, i.e weak, trans persons cannot fathom critical analysis of any kind.  does this mean that subscribing to the patriarchy makes you smarter, since that isn't a self created identity? fuck yeah, i'm gonna go oppress women now and get my phd.  &gt;the foundation for transition is misogyny, and misogyny is the foundation for homophobia.  the foundation for hating men or women who don't want to have heterosexual sex is hating women. the apple of homophobia *is* the orange of misogyny. i understand now.  &gt;transphobia does not exist.  9/11 truthers are more sane than this.  &gt;trans persons attacked or murdered are done so because of homophobia and the foundation of homophobia-misogyny.  the author seems to hate trans people, and i'm going to *seriously* doubt that the author considers themselves homophobic or misogynistic.  &gt;transition flourished because female fetishizers for decades have used the gay and lesbian political platform to advance their fetishes and inline with the leaders of the straight white homophobic medical community, hampered and out right destroyed gay and lesbian advancement and lives.  transition flourished when the general populace stopped killing other people simply for being different. also, how have advancements in trans rights destroyed advancements in gay and lesbian rights?

928492,"&gt;so... you're afraid that somehow more people will become gay if the government allows it? is that really it?  no, i explained that there are problems beyond just ""people becoming gay"". but that is a real problem that people like to claim is absurd, but isn't. there are many people out there who have cravings for attention and hero worship in excess of the revulsion at the idea of same-sex intercourse.  &gt;as far as i am aware, there are no arguments against same-sex marriage that do not boil down to ""i just don't like it.""  and there is no basis to allow it other than ""i think it's just as good as heterosexual marriage"". is that a better basis for legislation?  as i wrote in the linked article:  &gt;""gay rights"" activists want marriage because they want the validation, they want the state to say gay couples are just as good as straight couples. gay marriage opponents don't want that message to be sent because they don't believe it. they believe that homosexuality and/or homosexual relationships are damaging to societal cohesion and that the state should not promote or endorse things that cause damage to the general welfare.  &gt;that is the whole crux of the entire issue. you may recognize it as bearing certain social components that don't fluctuate easily, so like other ""hot button"" social issues, we will probably be in contention over these points for the foreseeable future.  all law is this way. it boils down to ""i think this will damage society in a way that is so expensive, it should be illegal -- that social expense shouldn't be thrust upon everyone else because of one person's [or in this case, two persons'] bad choices"". some people disagree, and the system of governance determines whose beliefs should become law.  the lord has outlined for us in d&amp;c 134 a few critical principles for governance, which are:  1. protection of life 2. right and control of property 3. freedom of conscience  if a government doesn't protect all of these, it cannot exist in peace. i interpret this primarily to mean that unless an argument can be made that something threatens on a macro scale either the protection of life or the right and control of property, freedom of conscience should be left as the default setting. it places the burden upon the petitioner to show that one or more of the fundamental principles is breached by allowing a certain occurrence without legal reprimand.  most of the things you listed have historically been illegal, and an argument in compliance with d&amp;c 134 can be made to justify said illegality. it is possible we no longer believe that ""shopping on sunday"" constitutes a macro-level threat to life or the right and control of property, and that it therefore should not be illegal. such are debates to be held on the floor of the legislature. i agree in principle that we don't have to legislate every religious feeling or belief we have, and that in fact mormonism discourages doing so.  gay marriage strikes right at the core of the first principle, protection of life. homosexuality corrupts the fountains of life, spreads disease, lawlessness, and immorality, and deprives its participants of both children and basic decency. gay marriage entrenches homosexuality as a cultural hallmark, gives awards to its practitioners, and denigrates the fundamental roles of male-female duality, child-bearing, and child-rearing. it is a bad, bad thing, that is not worth the social cost. again, marriage is not, and has never been, a mere love certificate.  fortunately for us, this debate is moot as the prophets have indicated that gay marriage should not be legalized. they, in fact, cite such alterations as part of the catalyst for the apocalypse in *the family*, which is consistent with scriptural accounts of destroyed societies, particularly sodom.  i suggest you prayerfully seek confirmation of and conformance with the apostles' teachings. i also suggest you read the faq i linked.",1,

533895,"may i assume that, given your handle, that you are a christian, and likely catholic? that might help in determining your worldview.  &gt;well it is marital benefits and sanctification. i think both are important for society.  why is *sanctification* important for the purposes of a purely legal consideration? marriage equality is predicated on the notion of equal civil liberties; it is distinct from desiring religious imprimatur, largely because the marital benefits do not hinge on whether a church blesses the union or not. as there are increasing numbers of heterosexual couples obtaining marriages outside of religion's umbrella, it does not seem the lack of sanctification is important to them--or their view of society, and yet they benefit greatly from the legal benefits that come with marriage.  do you believe their unions should not be considered marriages?  &gt;we have laws that prevent a parent from marrying a child, laws against a sibling marrying another sibling, laws against people marrying multiple people  i believe it is entirely damaging to your case for you to compare homosexual relationships to incest and polygamy; not only do you, however unintentionally, slander a whole class of people, you *also* paper over the vast differences in nature of the relationship. in the case of the former, the incest taboo largely comes out of the fact that children arising from the relationship are dramatically at greater risk for having debilitating genetic conditions, and in the latter, the right being requested is *not* for multiple partners, but a single, monogamous relationship to be respected and granted equal rights.  additionally, those marriages *have* been sanctified and given legal rights in the past; in the case of incest, largely within the aristocracy, and in the latter, in many cultures.  &gt;laws against men marrying other men  actually, in many cases, there *aren't* laws that prohibit this; there are just no legal protections for it, and no legal rights attached to it. it is only in recent memory that these laws have come into being, largely by the actions of people with bigotry to prevent equal recognition and to deny rights to a minority.  &gt;if you don't mind i'm just going to consider the men marrying men case for typing convenience.  i actually do mind; many of your arguments in previous responses have been catered to one specfic gender, and ignore women. the desire to marry one's significant other is not limited just to gay men, but to gay women as well. you have not given any satisfactory answers to the points i brought up involving them.  &gt;the definition of marriage in most cultures and all western cultures (annoyingly redundant, i know) has always been a union between those of opposite sex. so, to begin with, homosexuals were never precluded from this social convention. it strictly never applied to them.  if it never applied to them, what is the problem with expanding the definition? there are many things that have ""traditionally"" been restricted to one group and not another, and yet as time has gone on, the definition has been expanded. the concept of citizenship, for instance; or of suffrage. the definition of what it is to be an adult, and a child; the definition of love.  just because it did not apply to something previously does not mean that it cannot now apply to new things.  &gt;this is more of an issue of privacy, but i still hold that marriage has always been about having children. one's fertility is an entirely private matter.  it has not. in modern civilization, at least until the industrial era and beyond, the entire point of marriage was to maintain property rights within the same clan. this is why there was such importance on patrilineal descent; a father passes his surname to his son, whereas his daughters are traded away for dowries. a son was automatically given rights a daughter was not; the right to own and the right to inherit. it was considered a tragedy when no children were born into a family, *not* because it was about raising children, but because then alternate means of retaining control of the property had to be found.  the nuclear family, which you so vaunt, was neither a common familial structure nor a useful one until the industrial revolution; often, multiple generations would live in the same houses, primarily to manage the land (if landed) or work the land (if not). more hands would increase productivity. this pattern continues to exist in many other cultures, not exclusively western, until urbanization and industrialization hit. because land is at such a premium in urban areas, and (relatively) livable wages can be earned without multiple generations within a single household, the nuclear family became more prevalent.  regardless. if, however, a marriage is about having children and one's fertility is an entirely private matter, what is problematic about two gay men or two lesbians marrying and adopting children? the question of fertility, as you state, is private; obviously, one man cannot impregnate another, nor can a woman impregnate her wife, but they are still fully capable of rearing children.  &gt;only considering m.m., but w.w. would obviously lack the father figure. you understand.  and yet numerous studies have shown that the determining factor is not a maternal and paternal figure, but two or more deeply invested individuals in a child's raising.  &gt;because you are not looking into someone's eyes and wanting more than anything to bring someone into this world who is both you and your one true love.  have you experienced love between two men or two women? i find your beliefs on what gay men or gay women feel for each other highly suspect, because you presume much and yet know very little. what accounts for the desire of so many gay couples to adopt and raise children, if not the utter and total desire of wanting to have a child between themselves to care for, and to bond with in a familial setting?  it is, you understand, very difficult for anybody to take your arguments seriously when you continue to presume much without any knowledge.  &gt;rape is found in every species, but i would consider rape an unnatural sexual outlet. same with pedophilia (found in other species) and infanticide.  i find it disturbing that you are comparing a consensual, loving relationship to rape, pedophilia, and infanticide. statistics also point out that most rapists, pedophiles, and child-abusers are straight, and not just due to sheer numbers, but also as a proportion. should we compare all straight people to them, then?  you gain nothing from this line of argument, as it leads to charges of bigotry and homophobia, which are not conducive to actual discussion.  you still have not answered my question: ""what definition of 'natural sexual outlet' are you applying here?""  &gt;you know, greek soldiers used to have a ridiculous amount of homosexual sex because from the ages 14-35 or so they were conscripted into the army. did it just so happen that, from the ages 14-35, 99% of greeks were homosexual, and then magically after the age of 35 they went home and married a woman?  sexuality in such extreme circumstances cannot be compared to sexuality in circumstances with low stress. there is a high incidence of prison rape; should we then assume that prisoners are primarily homosexuals?  &gt;there's a lot to it. i wouldn't dare suppose that i could know the answer.  please, continue--you already presume to know a lot of answers given your responses.  &gt;mercury has been shown to cause homosexuality in birds. there could be a similar mechanism that affects humans.  it seems to me that you are not actually current on the research being done in this field. at the moment, research points to two major factors: genetics and epigenetics. while there is no ""gay gene"", it is suggested that there are clusters of genes which increase the likelihood of homosexuality. add to that hormonal differences during pregnancy, depending on environmental conditions such as number of male siblings.  your mercury hypothesis does not seem likely, as there have been numerous studies about both identical and fraternal twins that have one child be homosexual, and the other heterosexual.  &gt;i was not. love without sex? how categorically different... thanks for the correction though.  i did not say those relationships did not have *sex*. it seems that you focus on the sexual act being only that of a penetrative act done by genitalia. if that's the case, it's a physical impossibility for lesbians to have sex, and yet they somehow manage. to be vulgar, are handjobs not a sexual act? frottage?  you have also not explained your assertion as to why male+male sex is necessarily, ostensibly, non-monogamous.  &gt;if free tampons for women were a right, it wouldn't necessarily be a right for men. if men had the right to join the army, it didn't use to be the case that women had the right, too. even within marriage there are rules. even with owning property there are rules.  generally, with these restrictions, they are either based on physical impossibilities/difficulties, or actual societal harm.  you have not made the case that marriage equality leads to a societal harm.",1,

i'd venture to guess that as babies at least pretty much everyone was shown some variety of affection. and you're also wrong about intimacy - homosexual couples can be just as if not more intimate than any heterosexual couple. two people who love each other are two people who love each other. and while your virginity until marriage is quite irrelevant, i'll engage you anyway. you never had to repress your sexuality. you were in a hetero friendly world in which pretty much everyone would've found it acceptable if you had sex before marriage. you also shouldn't apply that standard to everyone since a large amount of people have sex before marriage. no one called you disordered or an abomination due to your sexuality. homosexual people do deal with that and it is quite damaging. and here you go again with more hasty generalizations - homosexual people do not desire to screw every man that walks. you are right about one thing. homosexuals who suffer from depression due to their sexuality do have other issues than just their sexuality. those issues are the people who demonize them for things that they have no control over.   now let's have a talk about genetics. not true at all. you act as if society is entirely homosexual and that there are absolutely no hetero couples to reproduce. and for the record, there are straight couples who don't reproduce either. i don't know why lack of ability to reproduce suddenly becomes a problem when homosexuals are involved. in addition, you have a flawed understanding of genetics when it pertains to humans. evolution is a slow process, and due to medical advances, we suck at following the rules of natural selection in the ways that they should be. i'll even assume for a second that you're right that homosexuality is a genetic accident. guess what? so is cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure etc. they haven't evolved out because there's no need for them to because they can be fixed or at least controlled via medicine. for homosexuality it's even easier for it to not disappear as there are other members of society to reproduce. for more evidence, read [this](http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/homosexuality-within-the-wildlife/) . every single species that has sexual interaction has some sort of homosexual relations in a portion of their population. you don't see the homosexual members of said species going extinct because homosexuals exist. also, even separate from the issue of reproduction, you act as if there aren't enough kids without parents in the world who could use a family to grow up in who could benefit via a homosexual couple adopting them. or that there aren't methods of fertilization so that a homosexual could have a kid via fertilization into a lesbian couple or a gay couple getting a surrogate mother. in addition, there's another problem with your argument. if you think that homosexuality should be rejected on the basis that it's a genetic mutation then that means that other genetic mutations like i don't know, cerebral palsy, autism, etc should be rejected to based on their being mutations. obviously, rejection on that basis is a bad standard.    2) it's a question of intervention. you have a right to partake or not partake in what you want to as long as it does not interfere in someone else's ability to partake in what they want to. this makes a lot of sense when it comes to law. for example, your killing someone interferes with their ability to partake in life. however, a gay couple getting married does not interfere in your right to get married nor does it interfere with your right to go to church or your right to live out your christian values in your life.   law is an objective version of someone's subjective morality. that's why enforcement of law and law itself is such a fluid thing. wrong isn't wrong. wrong is what someone thinks is wrong. morality is based upon whatever a society thinks is acceptable at the time. i'd recommend reading some of foucault's genealogies here especially the ones where he traces mental illness. it speaks a lot as to how what is deemed acceptable in society is extremely fluid.   gender and sexuality are fluid. sex is static (in most cases). you are a male because of your sexual organs. you are not a male because you watch football on sundays, play catch with your son and refuse to go shopping with your wife. gender roles are an incredibly bad idea. any man has an equal ability to do ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" things as any woman does. in the case of sexual attraction, look up the kinsey test. sexuality is a spectrum and no one is 100% straight or 100% gay. and i have no idea why you're using judgement words such as acting ""weird"". it's not weird for a guy to act feminine or vice-versa. it's entirely natural and like most things, it operates in degrees anywhere between small things like a guy knitting or something to a person's personality being wholly unsuited for the body that they're in (assuming conventional gender roles of course)  3) i'm trying to get you to tell me that. you still haven't given me a single reason of why a homosexual marriage can't be exactly as full, fruitful, and complete as a hetero marriage. and as far as the father-mother thing, you're making the same assumption that gender roles existing actually makes sense. as said in the previous point, they don't. and sorry, you're incorrect, there are tons of divorces who are long time believers and are not new to apologetics. that is simply how society functions.  as far as the idea of laws, i'm well aware of that opinion. the point is that if it's impossible to keep people righteous, and following god's law is a desire that comes internally, them it's entirely fruitless to try to force god's law upon other people. and i'm also well aware of the idea of fulfilling the law. problem is we aren't the hebrew nation anymore. the moral law is christian law, and everyone is not christian. you are free to follow it. i will not and the legal system should not intervene in my ability to reject it. i'm also aware on the concept of sin. i had a catholic education. the same point comes - you strive for those things. other people do not. because you strive for them does not mean that everyone else should.   and that question is extremely extremely loaded. last i checked it wasn't doing people a service out of unconditional love to deny people marriage, reject them based on something they can't control, and interfere with their living their personal lives.  4) and here's one place where we actually agree. i don't know why the article an issue with that.",1,
442822,"well, i should probably first list my beliefs, as they are not the ""typical"" christian views.  * humans do not have an immortal soul that is separate from the body.  this is not an idea that expressed in the bible.  in fact, dualism (the idea that humans are comprised of multiple entities, i.e. body and soul) stems more from greek philosophy and platonism/neo-platonism than the bible.  * as such, i don't believe in hell as a place of eternal punishment.  i subscribe to the view called ""annihilationism,"" which argues that hell is permanent death with no afterlife.  i would say it is similar to what many atheists believe happens when one dies.  the ""fires of hell"" do what fires do--they burn up and consume (figuratively speaking...there is no literal hellfire).  * there is an afterlife/heaven, but only for those who have been given the gift eternal life/immortality.  christians believe this is given upon belief in jesus christ.  summed up in a famous verse, john 3:16, ""for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.""  * heaven is unity with god.  truth be told, not a lot of definite detail is given about heaven.  much is said in metaphor and prophetic imagery.  i think this is because heaven will be a radically different experience than our earthly one.  paul described the difference as being like a seed planted in the ground--the fruit that eventually comes from it looks a lot different than the seed. (1 corinthians 15, paraphrased)  this said, i believe heaven is where we are perfected and united with god.  i imagine it like droplets of rain falling into the ocean: heaven is union.  granted, that last part is my own imagination's speculation.  and so to answer your questions...  to exist beyond this life, one needs to believe in jesus.  he is the only means of gaining immortality, as he as achieved victory over death, as evidenced by his own resurrection from the dead.  (i could get into more details about why jesus is needed and why god can't just give everyone immortality, if you would like.  it has to do with that perfection part i mentioned in bullet 4.)",0,
846361,"1) they are incorrect. enforcing gender norms would be if you actively attempted to keep the hetero-normative society as is. if you continued to keep patriarchal viewpoints and use bullying to keep people in their places. you wearing typical clothing for men does not ""enforce"" anything. as an individual the best thing you can do to break gender norms is to not put people down for their choices, to call out active bullying when you see it, and to support politicians who would fight for gender equality.   what clothing you wear is not an issue. that's like telling a modern day feminist that ""you can't shave your armpits because that's a gender norm!"" and? i'm not ruining feminism for the entire world if i shave my armpits. i *am* helping feminism when i donate to charities for women, volunteer, vote with women's issues in mind, and actively help as many women across the globe.  2) this is fucking stupid also. not everyone has to be ""a unique snowflake"" for them to ""be who you truly are"". i'm bisexual and a huge participant in my gsa at uni and i'm still just myself. i still like all the things i usually like regardless of my sexuality. honestly this has even become an issue in the lgbt community.   many in the community say we should organize parades and rallies where we just wear our regular civilian clothing or work uniforms to show people we are just like them. if you are truly into drag and you are really happy when you perform then that makes me happy. i love to see someone with a passion, no matter what it is. i myself am a very quiet individual, but i still really love when others are happy. as long as you're supportive of the drag community they just need to chill the fuck out.  3) this is also fucking stupid. homosexual is not a derogatory term. heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, etc. are all the proper terms for someones sexual orientation. also, back to that stupid ""guys"" thing... what the hell? they are like those stupid people who are like, ""i'll burn my bra to support women!"" no. if you really want to help then donate money or volunteer or campaign for women's issues. nit picking at stupid little shit like that is completely pointless and just makes you look like an overly self righteous douchebag.   4) if it is verbal bullying then people must tell the proper authorities. teachers, professors, employers, etc. if the bullying is physical the best course of action is to attempt to leave the situation as quickly as possible. as long as they only hurt you and you **did not** hurt them back then the police have a more clear picture that the other person assaulted you. if you fight back and you **both** are injured then the police have a ""he said, she said"" situation which is nearly impossible to resolve legally.  if for whatever reason you can't get away from your assailant then knowing self defense would be best. most self defense courses simply teach you how to make your assailant unable to attack you, but not actually harm them. so that's always another good course to take.  5) you need to speak to who is in charge about this one. ask about how they decide who gets what with their particular major. just talk to them about it, but do so in a calm, unaggressive tone.   6) the whole ""hive mind"" thing is fucking stupid also. honestly, they aren't as ""open minded"" and ""free thinking"" as they believe they are if they can't understand that not everyone in the lgbt community is the same. not everyone in the lgbt community looks like they just jumped out of queer as folk or the l word. we aren't walking stereotypes that all love musicals, drag, broadway, west hollywood, san fransisco, fashion, bravo channel or for lesbians a bunch of butch, man hating, flannel wearing, football loving dykes...  honestly they seem seriously confused about what a gay straight alliance is about. it is about overcoming minor differences to support the lgbt community and bring about meaningful change. nit picking about ""you don't like drag!"" and ""you aren't sucking obama's dick 24/7!"" or ""you aren't artistic and free thinking enough to be gay!"" you should look for a less circlejerk gsa if you can. try to work it out if you can, but if you can't just leave and find another group.",1,1

754753,"there's absolutely no shame in being afraid of crossdressing openly -it's a practice that at best is often responded to with confusion and at worst with scorn and harassment. most people in your position would do no different, it's a tough situation to be in. how you want to deal with this situation and become more comfortable with it is up to you, but here are a couple of suggestions that you might consider:  * wear women's underwear under your clothes. while you'll have to be more careful about who sees your laundry, it's otherwise a safe way of exploring your interest without having to explain yourself to others  * crosdress fully but only in the privacy of your own home/room. this is the safest option but also probably the least satisfactory, though it would give you the freedom to dress fully in women's clothing.  * gradually and casually incorporate more feminine clothes and accessories into your style. if someone calls you out on wearing girly clothes, confidently say that you pick your clothes based on what you like, not what other people tell you to like. regarding most things related to demeanor and such, if you act confident and don't make a big deal out of it, other people won't see it as a big deal - or at least, they'll respect your confidence.   * most colleges have an lgbt society, find yours and join it. get to know other people in the society and whenever you're comfortable, come out as a crossdresser. out of all the people you'll meet in college, the ones in an lgbt society are the least likely to judge you for it.   by the way, i'd like to point out that i've met multiple guys who wear women's clothing - some because they prefer it to men's clothing, some for entertainment (yep, i go to college with a drag queen) and some because it actually fits them better than guy's clothes. it's not all that unusual really, and nothing to be ashamed about.  also, i'd like to add that as a heterosexual girl, i find crossdressing guys really attractive. don't know what orientation you are but regardless, you needn't fret that you won't ever find a girl/guy/other who doesn't treat crossdressing as a dealbreaker, it may take some time but you'll find someone who appreciates you, girls' clothes and all :)",1,

633987,"(cont) why is this significant? lets go talmud here for a sec,  sanhedrin 54a as a reference to anal sex,  and then this proves it all, http://www.jewishmosaic.org/torah/show_torah/18  [quote] the task was especially difficult because there is little controversy in the rabbinic tradition on the meaning of leviticus 18:22. while it is translated in various ways, the basic meaning has always seemed pretty clear: ""and with a male you shall not lie the lyings of a woman, it is an abomination."" the only difficult phrase is mishkeve isha (usually parsed as ""the lyings of a woman""), because the phrase appears nowhere else in the bible. a similar phrase, the lying of a male (mishkav zachar), appears in numbers 31:18 and is understood to mean what women experience in intercourse, i.e. penile penetration. consequently, mishkeve isha is what men experience in intercourse, that is, penile engulfment. if so, then the verse prohibits a man from lying with a male in such a way that his penis is engulfed in the other man""s body. and where is a man penetrable? here the rabbis make use of the fact that the word lyings is in the plural form. the lyings of a woman are plural because she may be penetrated vaginally or anally. a man, missing the vagina, is singly penetrable anally. consequently, for millennia the tradition understood that leviticus 18:22 prohibited anal intercourse between men and leviticus 20:13 reiterated and punished the crime with death by stoning.  by far the most intriguing element of the puzzle is the fact that lesbian relations are totally unaddressed in the torah. the only explanation of this lacuna is that the torah is utterly uninterested in ""homosexuality"" per se. the sameness of the sex (homo=same) that so dominates contemporary thought in regard to homosexuality is missing here. instead, there is something about anal sex between men that is at the center of the biblical concern. of course the obvious question is just this: why does the torah consider anal sex between men to be such a problem?{/quote]  1, so the verse condemns penetration, aka anal sex. if it condemned homosexuality it would say sexual relations as did the previous verses against incest and bestiality, leviticus 18:22/20:13 and the verse against sex during menstration though are specific with detail, for example menstration verse doesn't say ""don't have sex with women"", it says don't have sex during menstration, likewise this verse says don't have anal sex with another man.  yhwh would've either said sexual relations, have mentioned lesbianism(as in the condemnation of bestiality yhwh told women also not to do it), and  anal sex is is detrimental to anyone(not just homosexuals, look up women who did porn and have to sadly wear a diaper), it's no good so either this reason is why it's condemned or it was condemned for cultural reasons and is no longer sin(for example leviticus isn't all universal moral laws, it does contain dietry and sacrifice laws for israel only(don't eat pork, etc which were for israelites only), contrary to false doctrine, we are under law, we aren't under israel laws like circumision, look up new perspective on paul, this is what was argued, old testament god even tells us he'd rather have mercy than sacrifice in isaiah 1 and hosea 6:6)  all leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 condemn is anal sex, at most, if not then temple prostitution.  that's why kjv(don't like this translation by the way) renders it,  leviticus 18:22 thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.  leviticus 20:13 if a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.  as with womankind/as he lieth with a woman as proven means anal sex, which is cool as this probably means yhwh either assumes one is already gay or doesn't care, he just says, no anal sex.  leviticus 18:22 doesn't mean homosexuality or homosexual behavior in general, it was a condemnation of anal sex, in order for my opponent to be valid he must refute every single point given.  now   1,whoever claims that anal sex is ok is in the wrong, homosexuality isn't wrong, however anal sex(no matter what your orientation) is, factually and scientifically wrong, it's harmful, http://www.wwu.edu/chw/ask_the_doc/post/1-1000/0599.htm  http://www.webmd.com/sex/anal-sex-health-concerns  if you still insist on anal sex then your arguing for something proven to harm and something that most people who are homosexual don't even do,  to that i don't know what to say, all i can say is that yhwh prohibits anal sex for any orientation(straight people can have anal sex with another male) and that its wrong(scientifically, medically etc) and what your arguing has nothing to do with  homosexuality, it's just a messed up sexual act. now i agree one is bigoted or uneducated in the bible for being against homosexuality but to say one is bigoted for being against anal sex is like saying someone is bigoted for telling another not mess with an cut or infection , it's disgusting and harmful.  2, whoever says ""since anal sex is prohibited, all homosexuality is prohibited"" is wrong as well  1, anal sex isn't a homosexual act, even straight people can have male to male anal sex  2, if one specific sexual act condemns the whole sexual orientation and other forms of sex, then according that faulty logic, all heterosexual sex is condemned because heterosexual sex during a womans menstruation is condemned(leviticus 18:19  straight sex during menstruation doesn't prohibit all straight sex, likewise male to male(straight or gay) anal sex doesn't prohibit for example male-to-male oral sex, as that is never prohibited.  there you go folks, no where in old law is homosexuality prohibited. yhwh(the father, and the son, and the holy spirit) bless you to truth.  homosexuality isn't a sin, now you know, if you disagree with this, then all you do is put forth an agenda against christianity, this is called the ""lets say christianity says homosexuality is a sin, so ""atheist"" look justified"" movement, because if christianity doesn't condemn homosexuality, then ""atheism"" is fucked. christianity doesn't condemn homosexuality, it ain't a sin, therefore ""atheism"" cannot say anything against christianity, and ""atheism"" is fucked because alot of gay-""atheist"" will now convert, gaychristian101.com  6, yes homosexuality is among animals, this scientifically disproves ""darwinism"". natural selection and any other sect of ""macro-evolution"" as homosexuality would decrease the species or if someone manage to exist would be immoral, homosexuality proves yhwh exists and disproves ""atheism"" scientifically  7, i agree, scientifically and biblically homosexuality isn't a sin, however in the un-scientific fairy tales of ""macro-evolution"" it would be, thank yhwh that ""macro-evolution"" is a fairy, as yhwh(the father, and the son, and the holy spirit) created us.",1,

rice, i lifted the m60 into position .. mist had spread across the paddy fields, a group was moving out of the village in the dark and thru the mist, finding their way with torches and candles,   **i leveled the gun, it fires at a cyclic rate of five hundred and sixty rounds per minute, i had twelve hundred rounds in a waterproof rucksack, each fifth round tracer, kept clean and free of dust.**

up with our position in the cemetery,   &gt;a couple of times they lined up with the sights, then i had them broadside on as they tracked toward my position, i could see about seven lights, and as they drew closer saw some were lower down and closer to the ground than others, as though the person holding the torch had short legs.  &gt;from about fifty meters downrange, they got onto a bund that brought them walking in a line directly toward my machine gun, and into the field of fire from both banks of claymores, for about twenty meters till they turned onto another bund, their lights dimming in the mist as they zigzagged toward the hills.  **next day there is a hell of a problem, another o group and some officer says, ""..you must have seen them,"" i tell him i saw them alright, he says well why didn’t you fire,**  &gt;i told him that i much preferred they went their way unmolested, they get long faced because it was an operation organized by the americans, johnny vann was in charge

402066,"i am from new england (may or not specify state)  coming out as gay is a lot harder than coming out as an atheist. i'm not exactly what you would consider the typical gay guy, but i am definitely not heterosexual. i was out as an atheist as early as middle school. i had gone to church camp since 4th grade and continued to go until i was 17 years old (counselor on and off for a few years following), although i was an atheist then. i didn't explicitly state that i was an atheist at the camp, but anywhere else it was definitely known, especially in my school. some people didn't like what i had to say obviously, but there are no common derogatory labels for an atheist here.   on the other hand, faggot, homo, cocksucker etc. were very commonly used, even by family. so you just always got this sense that homosexuality is really a negative, unspeakable thing. i am turning 23 in a week or two, and i've only come out to a handful of people as not being straight (very recently i may add), 4 of whom are [somewhat] important in my life. my mom died when i was young, my dad's common law wife is... well, there is no word negative enough to describe her, but the reason i state this is because i never had that mom figure to confide my non heterosexuality in. my dad doesnt hate gay people but his actions have said more than his words.  for example, he basically stated our country would fall apart under a gay president (bashing my gay uncles in the process, going so far as to use their names in the example). we were on vacation in florida one time while he had a tradeshow to attend, and we purposely left a hotel because there were too many gay men there. my father complained and i remember getting all these little stuffed animals (like happy meal toys) from the hotel. as you can probably guess, i'm not out to him, yet. but he's known my atheism since i was in middle school, and he was very secular himself.  tl;dr - homo, faggot, cocksucker used more frequently as insult vs ""non believer!""  so it's easier to deal with being out as an atheist, vs as a homosexual.  if you have any questions, feel free to ask.",1,1

(paraphrasing) ""i've experienced loss. you can't numb yourself with drugs and alcohol. you have to feel it.""  i'm not trying to correct you i just wanted to add to what you said. obviously don thinks he is in control of his emotions while numb, but he's really not. that's the whole reason why he does it.   it is also very accurate to have don's behavoir so repetitive. i understand myeslf when you are traumatized your life revolves around the trauma. everything you do reminds you of the trauma. you find yourself doing things simply because they were learned in the moment of your trauma. the more emotional you are and the more adrenaline you have the easier it is to learn. that's why it's so hard to change. your brain's neurons carve out pathways and you have to almost literally reprogram your brain. your brain just wants to do what you did yesterday, and the day before that and the day before that. it doesn't care about what's best for you and it rarely self-actualizes because it takes hard work. most people don't even become self-aware they're doing it, much like don.    i love the comparison to women's liberation. it's so true. men of that time period couldn't see beyond whore or madonna. actually, i think that's the same problem with lgtb rights. i think the whole reason for girly gay stereotypes is becuase men can't understand homosexuality. they can't understand that two men would be together because traditionally a man and a woman are together. so in order to understand they stereotype gay men as girly, effeminate, and into fashion and of course they talk with a lisp. or they have to cope with the lack of control and understanding with stereotypes like dragqueens which exist as entertainment and humour. gay couples are something that needs to have a woman and a man, or ridiculed by dressing up as woman. for better or for worse a lot of gay people just embrace the campy stereotypes. but the side effect from that is that people who don't fit the girly stereotype feel left out because they are osmewhere in the middle. but instead of you know destroying stereotypes and conceptions of what it means to be gay they started their own countercultures which is just as bad as the extreme stereotypical people. now instead of man and woman, it's bear and twink. you either have to be a big fat hairy man or a skinny 20 year old twink. if you're anything inbetween you can't go to a gay bar or a gay bear bar.  it's so bad that i feel ashamed that i like beards because i am a gay and i should like feminine men because the straight people who lived before me were heterosexual. and then if i go to the other side of it i'm not fat or hairy enough to fit in the counterculture because it's based entirely on bodytypes.  im sorry i went on quite a tangent there. the point is that when people don't fit into the previous generations traditional roles things get needlessly complicated. everything has to be extremely binary. it's really stupid and i think it's a big problem with north american culture. women's rights and lgbt were and are a big part of it. we haven't come as far as we think we have, which i think is the point of mad men.",1,

502470,"damn! finally, something i'm fairly expert in, but i don't have my reference in front of me. george chauncey's *gay new york* answers this question in greater depth than i could while i'm at work; wait till i get home, and i'll flesh this response out with quotes from his work.  **part 1**  gay as a term for homosexual only came into use once people started conceptualizing of sexuality as a singular category. prior to the 1920s, there was a fairly fascinating split on two different axes: first, a split between the way working class and middle class society viewed men who slept with men, and second, a split between how the men in either society viewed their actions. within the working class, there were three well-understood categories of men who slept with men:  1. fairies. these were men who slept only with other men, and were willing to be the receptive partner. they were (fairly) easily identifiable by certain modes of dress (eg., red ties, green suits, a colorful feather in one's hat). they also tended either to naturally exhibit or purposefully adopt feminine habits. according to chauncey's research, some men who were fairies did not actually desire to behave ""femininely""; however, at the time, that was literally the only way in which one could be identified as clearly interested in men, and therefore the only way in which one could attract a masculine partner (more on this later). pre-wwi concepts of sexuality would be very foreign to most westerners today. at the time, and particularly within the working class, your gender presentation was what counted, not your sexual actions. fairies, therefore, were considered a third sex; men who for whatever reason, had a female mind and female characteristics. this concept allowed masculine men to be the penetrative partner with fairies with practically no fear of societal shame, as they were still performing a masculine vs. feminine sexual act with a person who was not of the same sex. i'm going to stop emphasizing this now, but this was a very working-class mode of thinking; the middle class was quite a bit touchier about men who slept with men.   2. queers. this category would arise in conjunction with changing views on the nature of sexuality. queer men were men who wanted to be able to define their attraction as being primarily to men without having to give up a masculine or manly status; that is, they did not want to be boxed into a feminine presentation simply to attract men. the idea was quite revolutionary at the time, as it meant divorcing gendered presentation from sexual behavior.   3. trade/rough trade. this is probably the most confusing category for the modern reader to understand. trade men were considered by everyone to be ""normal"" (what we might call ""straight""). these were usually men in the most masculine of trades -- sailors, soldiers, bricklayers, etc. these men were often known to be quite violent and thuggish, and were acknowledged as sleeping with fairies for sexual gratification. it was generally understood that a man's sexual drive was uncontrollably powerful, and that it needed to be relieved no matter the circumstances; furthermore, female working class partners were generally understood to be for the purpose of procreation; marriage for love or serious attraction was not a true concept yet. therefore, it was expected that many, if not most working class men (particularly italian immigrants) would be trade; that is, retain their masculinity, but be open to the advances of and, in many cases, experience a strong connection to, fairies (who were not considered men due to their feminine presentation). trade were highly coveted by fairies and queers; the ability to seduce a ""normal"" man was a credit to the fairy in question. furthermore, the raw masculinity of trade was highly attractive, and considered the gold standard for a sexual partner.  to summarize so far: the concepts of homosexuality and heterosexuality as we know them did not exist prior to the the 1920s, and were not truly fleshed out until the mid-20th century. gender presentation was what mattered; as long as a man remained the penetrative, masculine partner, he could be considered ""normal,"" or queer at the very least.  will continue into your actual question of when the word gay became linked to homosexuality shortly. sorry for getting carried away!  **part 2**  edit: continuing on! so, the next question becomes: when and why did the concept of sexuality as a static identity arise?   prior to the 1920s-1940s, gendered circles were strictly policed; by this, i mean that there was nowhere near the amount of mixed-sex societal mingling that happens today. women, particularly in new york immigrant communities, were closely guarded by their families until marriage, at which point they would be confined to the home, sometimes partaking in social events with other married women. the public sphere was, for the most part, entirely male. men had only male friends, and women, only women. as society began to become more sex-integrated, many men, particularly in the middle-class, felt that the male sphere was being threatened, and that their masculinity was under assault. in addition to this, an office environment was rapidly becoming the standard workplace for the middle-class man; the difference between the perceived masculinity of he and his working-class counterpart was becoming ever starker.   chauncey argues that this middle-class male insecurity regarding a) the integration of women into the public sphere and b) the loss of job-related masculinity resulted in a new policing of appropriate male behavior. interestingly, and as a total aside, this is what resulted in a sudden fascination with bodybuilding and strength training, which had not to that point been a popular hobby; many men felt the need to emphasize their difference from women in whatever way possible, so becoming highly muscular was an obvious choice. digression aside, chauncey describes middle-class men of the time as seemingly having ""decided"" that the way in which they could retain a perception of themselves as masculine was through touting their solely-women attraction. in essence, if they couldn't be masculine through their jobs, and they couldn't be masculine by excluding women from the public sphere, they could at least distinguish themselves by eschewing the traditional concept of sexuality and enforcing a rigid adherence to opposite-sexed sex.  this, notably, was rather slow to catch on in working-class circles, perhaps because working-class men still felt secure in their masculinity. i would note again, because there is really no way to overstate this, the incredibly all-consuming importance of gendered presentation prior to the mid-20th century. as long as a man could be seen as ""not a woman,"" he could do whatever he liked sexually. it was femininity that was abhorrent, not a particular sexual act. it seems somewhat ridiculous now to suggest that sexuality as an identity arose because of a middle-class macho insecurity, but the pressure to distinguish oneself as anything but feminine was far more extreme than that of which most of us can possibly conceptualize. i would argue that femininity is still widely disdained, by both men and women; but, as evidenced by the fact that a masculine man could sleep with as many men as he liked and be considered ""normal,"" the importance of a masculine presentation in this period was critical to a degree unheard of today.  to summarize: the concept of sexuality as an identity, rather than as an action, did not come into vogue until the 1920s-1930s at the earliest. it was hurried along, in part, by a middle-class male insecurity regarding the dissolution of traditional gender roles.  **part 3**  so when did the word ""gay"" become widely used to describe this new concept of sexuality?   the word itself had acquired an air of immorality as early as the 1600s; a ""gay woman"" was a prostitute, and a ""gay house"" a brothel. accordingly, the mutation of gay to mean homosexual was, in many ways, simply an extension of the already-present implication of a carefree, uninhibited, somewhat lascivious person or thing. such usage is documented as early as the 1920s.  accordingly, there was a truly fascinating period in which those in the know could describe themselves as gay, or inform others about gay parties or events, and fly completely under the radar of ""normal"" people. a passage from a 1922 book by gertrude stein illustrates this point quite nicely: ""they were ...gay, they learned little things that are things in being gay, ... they were quite regularly gay."" linda wagner-martin says that the portrait ""featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history.'"" the 1938 movie *bringing up baby* is the first film to feature the word gay with sexual connotations; cary grant, when questioned as to why he is clad in a woman's coat (his being at the cleaner's), responds, ""because i just went *gay* all of a sudden!"" while the filmmakers were certainly aware of the underground connotations of the word at the time, the general public was not, and understood grant to mean that he was being frivolous.   by the wwii era, queer men were widely-seen as frivolous, fastidiously dressed, and overall campy. as i noted above, this view arose specifically because men who wanted to be identified (fairies) had no option but to become at least moderately flamboyant, as there was no other way to find or form a community at the time, with at least some fairies having been quoted as not altogether enjoying the role they had to adopt; nonetheless, the fairies were the only non-""normal"" men that society viewed as being homosexual, so homosexuality in general was understood to be a flamboyant, feminine thing. with this view of homosexual men being extremely firmly entrenched, ""gay"" was an obvious choice for a word that didn't have the derogatory connotations of ""queer,"" nor the excessively clinical sound of ""homosexual."" still, the word was not universally understood to mean ""homosexual"" until well past mid-century; as late as 1970, the first episode of the mary tyler moore show has one character unironically describing a woman as ""young and gay.""    ***   well, this answer got somewhat out of hand. i hope i've at least answered your initial question, and i do intend to flesh this response out with quotes from my source when i get home.     **edit** for all the people who have expressed interest in my post, i highly recommend reading george chauncey's *gay new york: gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world 1890-1940.* as i mentioned in a comment below, the field of gay and lesbian history remains practically empty, and chauncey's book stands as one in a select group of outstanding scholarship on the subject.  i would also recommend *boots of leather, slippers of gold: the history of a lesbian community*, by madeline davis. it is, in my opinion, one of only truly historical works yet done on lesbian communities, and it is also outstanding. joan nestle is another author to check out for lesbian history. i've been stalking this board for a while hoping that gay questions would start popping up; hopefully this will spark some interest, because i'd love to get some flair going here and really be able to open people's minds!  finally, i feel that at this point, ""fleshing out"" this post with direct quotes from my source would make the initial post far too long; if anyone has questions about specific points, feel free to ask, and i will go into far greater depth!",1,

740990,"i was just about to go to bed, and i finally got a comment! thank you.  i did not know that galileo insisted that he had proven scripture wrong. that's definitely not kosher.  re: natural law. my understanding is that nature presents us with ethical recommendations. catholic teaching sees that heterosexual unions can result in new life and homosexual unions cannot, and concludes that homosexual unions violate natural law. my claim was that homosexual unions exist in a large variety of animals, even insects, and that life scientists have come to understand homosexual orientation as an alternate biological process. so isn't it equally reasonable to conclude that homosexual acts are naturally legal as well, especially considering how difficult and ultimately fruitless and damaging it is to try to reverse homosexual orientation? (some gay people are driven to suicide because they feel like they should change but can't.) suffering does not seem like it should be the result of adherence to natural law.  re: scripture. that article does contain that appeal to jesus's silence on sexual orientation in the gospel, but the meat of the article focused on those verses of scripture which can be used to condemn homosexuality, namely: lev. 18:22, lev. 20:13, rom. 1:26-27, 1 cor. 6:9, 1 tim. 1:10. the challenges made to the application of these verses are linguistic and ideological, i.e. that the concept of sexual orientation arose very recently and is projected by modern readers onto our ancient scriptures. the condemnation of homosexual actions is not new, but our understanding of people as homosexuals and heterosexuals is. gen. 19 is sometimes used to condemn homosexuality, but most mature readers of genesis see the sins of sodom as greed, suspicion, and a lack of hospitality for strangers. it also brings up some current theological debate concerning the centurion's servant that jesus heals in matt. 8 and luke 7. we know from historical record that homosexual unions were encouraged in the greek and roman military, because the state saw them as a form of unit cohesion. apparently the word translated as ""servant"" (gk: pais), -may- have implied that they were lovers.  **edit**: this is where commentary about scripture and church law stop, and i apparently spend paragraphs straightening out the contents of three sentences. i apologize if it seems like a rant.  the last quote was a bit of a disappointment. yes, gay men are men. they come in all shapes and sizes. some of them are very sloppy, and some are very tidy. some are effeminate, and some are very manly. some even vote republican. ... but i find that much of what marc says after that is false. #askagayman  some gay people do dress like crap, but many of them pay very careful attention to the way they dress. it's more of a stereotype to say that gay men are more concerned with their image than straight men. gay men concerned most with their social and dating life tend to have fashionable hair and clothes. gay men concerned with professionalism are often clean-cut and carry a conservative demeanor. gay people fresh out of college and in love with academia, like me, wear t-shirts and shorts and are often not visually distinguishable from our straight counterparts until we speak or move our wrists. (sometimes, not even then.)  i'm not sure which godawful decisions marc may have been referring to. i'm a vegetarian, and if i decide to eat beef, i usually think it's a godawful decision by the time i go to bed, because i get indigestion.  gay people -do- have a much more difficult time than straight people. we face disapproval from our families, religious institutions, and/or friends. in 29 of the united states, including my state, [it is currently legal to fire an employee because you found out he is gay](http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/employment-non-discrimination-act). the supreme court didn't rule sodomy laws--laws imposing a jail sentence for people caught in the act of private, adult, consensual homosexual sex--were unconstitutional until 2003 (*lawrence v. texas*). (my state threw out its sodomy law the previous year.) taken all at once, we have a very, very heavy burden. with the exceptions of undocumented immigrants and the unborn, we have more civil rights denied to us than any other social demographic.  these social pressures help explain higher rates of depression, substance abuse, and lower life expectancy. correlation does not imply causation. if heterosexual people were subject to the same amount of stress, they might find themselves increasingly depressed, abusing drugs, and with lower life expectancies. [here's a scientific study that claims to have found that anxiety (+248.2%), mood disorder (+36.6%), and alcohol abuse (+41.9%) significantly increased in lgbt populations living in states that passed anti-gay legislation in 2004.](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/ajph.2009.168815)  final counter-point: though male homosexual sex is riskier in principle than any other kind of sex for hiv transmission, the demographic with the lowest risk (and the least risky sex, due to lack of penetration and limited exchange of fluids) are lesbian women. if that statistic should encourage men to be heterosexual, it should also encourage women to be lesbians. it nullifies itself. granted, saving yourself for your married partner is the very best way to prevent contraction of hiv and other stis, but that is universally true for heterosexual and homosexual people.  conclusion: it seems likely that gay people are modern samaritans.  in spite of all this, many of the many gay people i know get along just fine and lead happy, productive lives. the ones with accepting families tend to be happier than ones with parents and siblings who do not approve. (two relatives of mine, one of them my own mother, told me that i'm going to hell this past week. they're baptist, so they think i'm going to hell for being catholic, too. it's a frequent topic.)  = = =  the church does say that, while standing its ground on the sinful nature of homosexual acts, that homosexual people should be treated as equals, with the human dignity that all humans deserve, but i'm not aware of any church efforts to alleviate any of these social stressors. in the drastic case of the ugandan bill which would make homosexuality punishable by death (giving a prison sentence of 14 years to people who knowingly protected a homosexual person), [the head of the ugandan church did denounce the bill as violating christian values, but pope emeritus benedict did not mention it in his meeting with the ugandan prime minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uganda_anti-homosexuality_bill#religious_and_human_rights_organizations), even though the practical application of the bill would involve a witch hunt culminating in genocide. (the [witch hunt](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/africa/28uganda.html?_r=0) has actually been going on for years already. a sobering reality is that uganda started this frenzy to rid its country of gay people after [three american evangelical preachers went there in 2009 to preach against the ""gay agenda.""](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/world/africa/04uganda.html))  once again, i apologize if any of this offends any reader or seems like an attack against the church. i did not mean it that way. understand my frustration, though, because there are very real discriminatory practices levied against lgbt people all over the world, and our church often ignored or contributed to them, speaking out against them very rarely and often not with enough force.",1,

976154,"okay so. i think, pun intended, that bi erasure cuts both ways. (not with equal intensity though.)   obviously, i don't need to argue to you that bi erasure is overall a harmful ideological standard that encourages a binary view of sexuality at the expense of those who identify differently or between or outside the binary altogether. and ""positive discrimination"" (e.g. ""all asians are really good at math!"") is still problematic. but if i were bi, i don't think i'd exactly be lamenting the fact that the go-to insults in general seem to focus on homosexuality specifically. like, you'd never hear ""that's so bi,"" you know? and it's not even just fag, which i'd probably tolerate a bit more easily if it exited in a linguistic vacuum.   but no. it's ""homo"" and ""so gay"" too, along with ""cocksucker"" (technically a gender-neutral pejorative, but in my experience i've heard it almost exclusively directed from and to men) and ""dyke"" (which has to some extent been reclaimed by its target group but which also clearly singles out female homosexuals all the same, at least to the best of my knowledge). it's [fruit](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fruit) and [flamer](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=poof) and [poof](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=poof). it gets exhausting and disheartening to hear your sexual identity used in (literally) so many words as a way to put another down. gay people might get a disproportionate amount of social and cultural attention by non-gsms, but the downside is that we're constantly on the front lines of the collective punchline that is non-heteronormative sexuality.   i don't mean to imply that it hurts any less to be the recipient of a pejorative like ""fag"" while not technically identifying as gay. but i do think it might hurt in a somewhat different way. no, the backwater hick who shouts it at you probably doesn't care that you identify as a b as opposed to a g. but a vast majority of the insults refer in not-so-subtle terms to the g, or to the idea of g-ness (i.e. homosexuality). the grass is always greener, i know, but i can't imagine wanting to take on that much cultural baggage. i'd much rather have my sexuality be ignored by the public at large than made the catch-all term for ""alternative sexualities"" (or, as in the case of ""fag"" and ""that's so gay,"" the catch-all term or anything undesirable). better to hide in the shadows than be burned by the spotlight, i guess you could say.   so maybe part of my problem is that i have trouble parsing, say, a bi person's reclamation of ""fag"" as sincere; i interpret it the way i usually do, as (another) insult towards gay people. perhaps i also have trouble seeing why a bi person would even *want* to reclaim a term like ""fag."" i know plenty of bi people are in same-sex relationships, and i know they face their own unique set of unfortunate prejudices that i haven't had to handle. but damn, at least you've had the option of appearing ""normal"" and still being romantically/sexually into it, ya know? i've *never* known what it's like to go on a date without worrying (even if only slightly) about being called a fag or otherwise mistreated because i'm holding his hand or resting my head on his shoulder on some unassuming park bench or otherwise broadcasting my fagginess to the world. think about that; think about how warped your view of dating and pda would be if you'd *never* been able to blend in with the heteronormative majority, or been able to see your real-life relationships reflected in popular media, or not ha to worry about being uninvited from a ""friend's"" party because he found out you're a homo and clearly you're just gonna make him and all the other guys there feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. not that a bi or pan or otherwise queer-but-not-necessarily-""gay"" person *doesn't* go through these things--sometimes they, along with other gay people, face these instances of prejudice to a far more severe degree than i've experienced even, i reckon--but as a gay person, i don't feel like i get a reprieve from all that. i can't opt out of dealing with this shit, if i'm being emotionally honest with myself. i realize the gs and ls have many privileges over our queer counterparts within ""the lgbt community,"" but i think this is a privilege that non-homosexual people do often experience, and i hope it doesn't sound too much like i'm trying to play oppression olympics or whatever.  therefore, i suppose it's difficult for me to examine the reclamation of a word like ""fag"" with any reliable level of objectivity; i've never had the luxury of being able to turn off my anxiety over being the target of that word and its ilk. i'd like to think it shouldn't matter what others think of me, but we both know that would be a lie. so maybe i am actually arguing that it might in some instances hurt less for a non-gay person to be the recipient of these terms. i can't speak for anyone else so i can't make that call, but that seems like it could be the bias i'm working through.  even as i type that out, more questions arise. for instance: is this less an issue of sexual orientation and more an issue of gender presentation? does the presence of biphobic terminology (e.g. ""fence-sitters,"" closet cases) in some ways represent a net *gain* for public visibility of bisexuality, in that at least it acknowledges that sexuality instead of shunning the option completely? do pejoratives stuffed with such toxic connotations continue to engender discriminatory environments even after having been reclaimed or otherwise redirected?   oh jeez. this comment was lengthier and even more rambling than i'd originally intended it to be. i don't even know if i'm still ""arguing"" something here, but this is on my mind now to an even greater degree than it was before today (before i first saw this thread). i won't be offended if you don't read all this tripe. maybe i'm just feeling a bit lonelier than usual today and needed to vent, sort of like when old ladies call 911 just to be able to talk to someone else if only or a few hurried moments.   or maybe i just need to chill out and not be such an op.",1,1

583717,"actually turning her into a lesbian happened under the victorians. the ancient greeks speak of her routinely as a heterosexual.  but a single comment got modern people into the ""sappho is gay"" fad. and that comment is based on a misunderstanding as well.   the comment was by maxmus of tyre and it was that ""sappho had the same relationship with her students as socrates had with his.""  modern people are divided over whether socrates was gay at all. but the fact is: he had a wife and children. (his fights with his wife xanthippe were famous.) remember: socrates was forced to commit suicide by the state. after that, his reputation was savaged. so his enemies, after a certain point, claimed he was gay [which was illegal in greece at the time], while those who actually knew him say that he was heterosexual. (xenophon, who would later become a general and is one of only two people who wrote about socrates (and directly knew him), said that socrates was straight.)  remember: in the ancient world, it was routine to want to re-make your enemy's image when he couldn't defend himself any longer. julius caesar, likewise, was called a homosexual--but only by his political enemies. there was a reddit thread recently about thomas jefferson (in a presidential election) accusing john adams of being a hermaphrodite (in the same tradition). [it was in the ""today i learned"" subreddit.]  so you can't look back into the past and say, ""hey, john adams was called a hermaphrodite. it totally must be true!""  you have to consider the source, and the circumstances.  likewise with socrates. you can't look back over the people who killed him and hated him, and say, ""they totally said that his wife was a beard, and he was a gay! it absolutely, positively must be true!""  no, we have to be more critical. see who's launching the accusations. and see those who aren't.  in any case . . .  depending on your view of socrates, you'll interpret the idea of ""socratic love"" one way or another. to antiquity ""socratic love"" was the equivalent of what we today call ""platonic love"". it meant ""love without a sexual element"". but if you are hellbent on believing socrates' enemies and convinced that they body forth only truth, then you'll interpret ""socratic love"" as homosexual love. and you'll change his relationship with his students from one of enlightenment to one of a ""debauched gay bath house.""  (that's how his enemies wanted it remembered--despite the fact that not a single one of his students was ever molested by him. ask xenophon.)  and that circles back to the issue of sappho. because her girl's academy was compared to socrates'. if you hold with socrates being a mere pedophile, then sappho (whose school was compared to his) must certainly have had an inappropriate relationship with her students. but if you hold with xenophon's view of socrates' school (as a place of learning and a place of questioning the state), then sappho's school was merely about intellectual discipline and rigorous academic achievement.  * footnote: it's interesting how homophobia has been used by the state to discredit people after their deaths. the technique survives up to the present day. a modern example is roger casement. he was one of the first human rights advocates back in 19th century england. he would campaign for the rights of repressed people in peru, and all over the world. one of the groups he championed were the irish. casement (who was irish) had great sympathy for the irish independence movement). after he was executed by the british for treason, the ministry of propaganda created a series of fake diaries purporting to show that casement (a man with a sterling reputation) was really a depraved homosexual. this was used to quell international outrage at his execution. (it would later come out that casement was never homosexual and that the diaries ""found"" by british intelligence were complete forgeries. . . .  but this is the kind of stuff that state's do when they kill you and want to deflect criticism. the method is sort of like: ""it's okay if we murdered this respected individual. he was a deviant, anyway.""  suffice to say, this technique has been employed since the time of ancient mesopotamia. the egyptians used it to savage their enemies. socrates was no different in greece. in reality his political enemies were outraged that he was teaching his students to question the state and to think critically about war. this couldn't be abided. so they killed him. afterward--if you follow the logic of character assassination--they had to equate his pacificism not with intelligence but with weakness and homosexuality. that way, the youth could continue to be funneled into the war machine (secure in the belief that war was a ""manly virtue"").",1,

692477,"christians who think lgbtq lives and families are a problem and those who don't have very different ideas on what scripture says, what it means, and how it is most appropriately applied to daily life. very few of the commonly cited passages actually refer to same gender romantic/sexual relations at all; neither ancient greek nor hebrew had any equivalent word. most of those lists including ""homosexuals"" among evil-doers are dubious translations of an ambiguous word that literally means ""soft."" 150 years ago most english translations rendered that word as ""masturbator.""  the remaining handful are the story of sodom, the infamous levitical passages, and paul. for sodom, ezekiel helpfully lists their sins - *""‘now this was the sin of your sister sodom: she and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy""* (16:49). notice the lack of sexual transgressions. and how their punishment came after assaulting divine agents disguised as strangers - a common trope in ancient mediterranean mythology, where hospitality to strangers was one of the most important social values.  the levitical passages regarding m/m sex come in context of both purity laws, and the babylonian exile. purity laws governed food, blood, and semen entering and leaving the body. these substances were powerful and dangerous; food sustained life, blood was life, semen created life. in ancient minds, the threat of using these things *wrong* was terrifying.  they were extremely concerned with maintaining divinely ordained categories. that's why cross-breeding was forbidden; create a mule and you've created an animal god never intended, threatening the balance of the universe. too much disruption and the crystal dome of the sky could crack and the eternal waters of the universe would wash away humanity.  in ancient minds, semen + blood = baby. we know two men can't make a baby, but that wasn't clear 500bce. genesis 6 describes human hybrids, giants created when divine beings had sex with mortal women just before the the flood. if a horse and a donkey can make a mule, and a divine being and a woman can make a giant, what might the semen of one man and the blood of another create? finding out could destroy the world. best to avoid the possibility.  and in context of the babylonian exile, levitical authors saw the babylonian aristocratic practice of keeping male sex slaves as a pregnancy-free substitute for women. pregnancy was dangerous, wives were valuable, and female sex slaves risked bastards. they created a system of sexual slavery resembling a modern prison bitch; primarily heterosexual men with no access to women, who force less powerful men to take their place.  that's what it meant to lie with a man ""as if he were a woman;"" to make him your slave, and rape him. the levitical authors horror is like that of men whose only experience with m/m sex has been brutal prison rape. they are literally homophobic - terrified of gay sex. that's understandable, but not really applicable outside a context of slavery and rape.  in paul's letters, the only relevant passages are 1 corinthians 6:9, 1 timothy 1:9-10, and romans 1:21-27. corinthians and timothy are of [**very dubious translation**](https://christiangays.com/articles/anita10.shtml). romans 1 is describing gay desire and sex not as the sin itself, but as the *punishment* for ""idolatry"". this is probably quite literal - some roman mystery cults were rumored to engage in sacred orgies of varying gender configurations. paul is holding up gay sex as a *threat* - worship roman gods, and you'll be obliged to have gay sex in honor of bacchus. he's clearly not a fan, but this also isn't particularly relevant outside of obligatory orgies in honor of roman gods.  and for the record, i don't think my perspective is really as unusual as it's common assumed.   there are a [**lot of lgbtq affirming denominations**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt-affirming_christian_denominations); episcopalians, united church of christ, presbyterians, united church of canada, lutherans, liberal quakers, etc. church of england is struggling but is moving rapidly towards full integration. and the [**united church of christ**](http://www.ucc.org/lgbt/lgbt-history-timeline.html) was years ahead of the episcopal church; the first ucc statement in support of the rights and dignity of gay people was in april of 1969, two and a half months *before* stonewall.  and there are even more denominations that are officially neutral or even hostile but have many [**welcoming and affirming individual congregations**](http://www.gaychurch.org/find_a_church/find_a_church.htm). gaychurch.org has over 7000 in their directory, and that's just the ones who have registered with them; there are many more.   i majored in theology at a very queer school, and have known divinity and theology students at mcgill and union theological in new york. mcgill and union are on the progressive side of things, but neither is particularly radical, and the atmosphere was overwhelmingly welcoming. for the most part, the full inclusion and equality of lgbtq people could be taken for granted as obvious. outside these community of divinity students, it's been very rare for me to find this attitude except in lgbtq-specific spaces.  the perception that the dignity and rights of lgbtq people are incompatible with christianity is a myth. a significant and growing number of christian religious leaders and devout lay people are seeing the defense of the legal rights, social dignity and spiritual worth of lgbtq people and families as part of their spiritual duty to pursue social justice. and faith groups are one of the [**biggest**](http://blog.silive.com/gaylesbianlife/2009/06/large_06-09-staten-island-parade-2.jpg) [**contingents**](http://i564.photobucket.com/albums/ss90/benlarzelere/clc%20pride%202012/clc_pride2012.jpg) [**in**](http://static1.demotix.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/a_scale_large/400-6/photos/1288527139-lgbt-pride-on-parade-in-taipei_492546.jpg) [**lgbtq**](http://www.dioceseny.org/system/doc/file_name/production/945/lgbt1.jpg) [**pride**](http://www.prawnworks.net/dscn0082.jpg) [**events**](http://uccportland.org/sites/default/files/pride%20banner%20group.jpg). even within officially hostile denominations there [**are**](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-hl--yh4xt9c/tgpmsmzqali/aaaaaaaaq5o/6ef54tdw8wk/s400/gaypride2011-18.jpg) [**splinter**](http://www.thestranger.com/binary/91f2/1340582027-mormons_marraige_equality.jpg) [**groups**](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/17/21856216_d28f5e8222.jpg).",1,

469769,"[continued from previous comment]  all of these ideas would appear racist under definition four, but definition three allows them because the social justice movement rarely counts itself in the oppressor class in the same way they would count somebody who disagrees with them. they also do not count these ideas as negative or hateful. by reconstructing and monopolizing their definitions, the social justice'es can effectively be racist while wielding the word as little more than a method of gaining high ground in a debate. ironically, this makes the word meaningless and sets the conversation back quite a bit.  now as to the words invented to add layers to a discussion that was otherwise simple. this also ties into the prioritization of language reconstruction by social justice advocates so as to alter language into a deodorized and unoffensive communication as minutely and confusingly as possible. i would like to implement various ideas from ludwig wittgenstein (in *italics*) regarding language as they help me greatly in illustrating my point. they are taken from *""philosophical investigations""* if you are interested in reading the whole thing.  *do not be troubled by the fact that languages (2) and (8) consist only of orders. if you want to say that this shews them to be incomplete, ask yourself whether our language is complete;---whether it was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesimal calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so to speak, suburbs of our language. (and how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?)our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses*     now the application of this to social justice rhetoric may not be immediately visible, however it lends itself to understanding that the complexities of language cannot be so easily deodorized and reinvented. the jargon of the social justice movement is often implemented without a firm understanding of existing language constructs which leads to a discourse that does less to constructively escape from existing linguistic structures implemented by an oppressive system and more to needlessly delineate existing language constructs in order to derive a level of contention and needlessly slow any actual constructive discourse.  *think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a ruler, a   glue-pot, glue, nails and screw.---the functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these   objects. (and in both cases there are similarities.)  of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. for their application is not presented to us so clearly. especially when we are doing philosophy!*  now comes the issue with the often vacuous linguistic theories surrounding the creation of various words within social justice theory. as stated, words are tools and as such must have function. they function to convey meaning, so it is counter productive to continually invent a new language while constantly obfuscating the existing one. take feminist theory, the word ""patriarchy"" has as many definitions as there are feminists to define it, but it is used as a method of ending the conversation.   in syllogism form:  this issue is relevant/irrelevant when considering the patriarchy.  patriarchy.  therefore this issue is relevant/irrelevant.   however, the lack of a continuous and useful definition of patriarchy leaves a logical dead zone in the syllogism. the validity and therefore soundness is dependent on an effective wild card, which could even be construed as a criticism of language in general. the inability of the word to maintain meaning prohibits logical arguments and therefore discussion. humorously, the lack of discussion is often blamed on the patriarchy. this is not a time for humor however.  *it is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle.---or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. and innumerable others.-----and to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.*  this is perhaps the most important point from which to view this issue with jargon. language is dynamic and difficult to constrain long enough even to study. words constantly and subtly change meaning which leaves the bulwark approach to in the dust; or, more often to evolve into a separate and confusing sub-language that must be deciphered before any discussion can begin. this is compounded by, as stated, the varying definitions.   note the language used by the lgbtq movement (so you won't say i am picking on feminism) regarding the legitimacy of the terms homosexual and heterosexual. one contingent claims that the terms are indicative of a mental and or physical disorder and should therefore be banned. other contingents see no problem with them. also discrepancies as to the legitimacy of referring to a lesbian as ""gay"" or if that is strictly male. who could forget the use of ""cis"" to denote a non-transgender individual rather than normal? any prospective ally or uninitiated queer is quite literally assaulted with new words when they attempt to learn about the movement. who benefits from this except the exceptionally pedantic, the moralists, or the professional offendees?  to tie all of this back into my original point about apathy and social justice, i think a historical perspective can shed some light on the issue. the original abolitionists refused to allow the participation of black people, claiming to only work ""for"", but never ""with"". the original equalist movement refused the admission of women and minorities. in fact, it could be said that most original social justice was little more than half hearted activism from affluent white men; oh how times have changed! (now women are in on it too!) in truth, the most effective blows against racism (and all bigotry) have been dealt by inclusive, grass roots organizations that sought to unite communities and teach understanding. or raiding harper's fairy actually did a lot of good, but also increased the violence. i would be remissed to not point out that the best movements were populist, maybe proletariat even.  these lessons have been all but ignored and it seems modern day social justice is nothing more than an elitist fetish constructed in the name of self-aggrandizing divisiveness. it's positive messages cloaked in layers of purely academic theory that bases itself on other theories rather than empirical evidence, removing its real-world component. the only ciphers seem to be academicians whose questionable objectivity stains the subject as a whole.  all of this together serves only to drive people away and make them apathetic. which, as i stated earlier in reference to dr. king, is the real problem. what's the old adage? evil prevails when good men do nothing. that is really the long and short of it.   tl;dr: most whites weren't actively racist, they just didn't care. this caused more problems and the social justice movement has lost sight of that. the sjm has also significantly degraded over time and needs to move out of the way of newer, community based movements.",1,
758327,"this is a copy/paste from a post i made recently to someone asking about a run and gun smg class. =]  **weapon - chicom cqb**  * i just want to point out that basically any smg works. just use whatever you feel you're best with. i do prefer the chicom cqb and the msmc. you might hate them (many people i know don't like the chicom). just go with what you feel you're best with.  &gt;attatchments;  * i always run **fast mags** and **laser sight**. i usually play hardcore though, so in core, switching the **fast mags** for the **silencer** would probably prove helpful. but this is mostly up to you. the laser sight is absolutely one of the best attachments for the smg's, as you're running around so much most of your kills will be from the hip. and **fast mags** are fairly self explanatory. reload reload reload!   **perk 1 - hardline.**  * the point here is just to get scorestreaks faster, obviously. i usually run uav, vsat and swarm. i can get them fairly regularly with this setup.  * optionally i would run lightweight. obviously moving fast is the point, getting up in peoples faces before they realise what's happening. no fall damage is great as well.  **perk 2 - scavenger**  * mostly for regaining the equipment (which i'll mention later), but also, never having to rely on other peoples weapons is great. usually i'll be working towards camos so i don't like running out of ammo. but this is **mostly** for equipment gathering.  * alternatives; fast hands and cold blooded. i, personally, don't find toughness all that useful when running because you'll be so close that the flinch will hardly matter. maybe at range it's good, but apart from that, don't bother with it. fast hands can be very helpful if you're not running scavenger as you may want to pick up someone else's weapon just in case you run low on ammo. and cold blooded is fairly self explanatory.   **perk 3 - dexterity and engineer**  * this is where scavenger and the tacticals come in. first, engineer. i use this for two reasons. firstly, enemy equipment glows red through walls, awesome. when you run past betties or claymores, engineer will cause them to be on a delayed trigger (two seconds i believe) so you can run right by them and kill the camper before he even hears his equipment tick. secondly, i run emp grenades, so throwing an emp even slightly close to equipment like sentries, guardians or whatever else is great. you can pretty much cross map an emp at a sentry and it'll go down. 100% best perk. (remember, this is all counting towards your streak! hardline &lt;3)  * and now, secondly, dexterity. i find that whenever i take this off, i miss it. it's great for hardcore especially because this (depending on the weapon) will basically half the time it takes to go from sprinting to be ready to fire. those split seconds count in hardcore. as smgs are great for hipfiring, this is incredibly helpful. but i mostly use this for the mantle speed. being able to climb objects faster is so great for getting the drop on people. i love it too much to leave it behind.  **equipment - bouncing betty and emp grenade**  * the bouncing betty is just there for fun really. you could either swap this for another emp grenade or whatever else you feel you might want to take instead. put it in corners when you spawn. if you hear it go off whether it gets a kill or not, you can scavenge more. so that's great! potentially free kills for your streak.  * i basically went through the reason for running emp grenade earlier. it's so helpful for rushing that i basically find it to be essential to my kit now. i wouldn't trade it for anything else.   **wildcard - perk 3 greed**  * this should be obvious as you can see i use two ""perk 3"" items. so yeah, that's all for that.  **score streaks - uav / vsat / swarm**  * i shouldn't have to say much about the uav. use it, it'll help you and your entire team get your higher score streak faster and safer. keep on the move.  * generally i can almost guarantee that i'll get a vsat every game. sometimes not, we aren't super soldiers. but if you can get the vsat, pretty much any score streak after it is fairly easy to get. vsat gives way too much map control (especially so in hardcore) that i never run without it. it's my first perm unlock.  i run and gun a lot. though i play hardcore almost exclusively. i do switch to core ffa sometimes and these classes work for me in both situations. and that basically sums up my smg classes. i don't stray far from this model at all. it works for me. hope this little essay helps. xd",0,

(examples: a negative stereotype is that african americans are criminals, a positive stereotype is that asians do well in academics. both are stereotypes and can be hurtful.)  these are the most common stereotypes i come into contact with...  **1. bisexuals are sluts:** not true. i am sexually attracted to males and females. i would consider dating a male or a female and being romantically involved with them. this doesn't mean i sleep with every single person who gives me the time of day. regardless of a person's sexuality, everyone has the potential to sleep with as many people as they wish.  **2. bisexual women only do it to turn men on:** i. hate. this. stereotype. i am generally more attracted to women than i am am men, so when i am dating a woman i am doing so because i genuinely love her company, not so i can be the subject of someone's sexual fantasy i don't know. also, how disrespectful is that to your significant other? i could never imagine hurting my girlfriend in that way. that is so emotionally manipulative to use a person like that just to attract another person.  this stereotype often seems to come from the porn industry. the ""lesbian porn"" that exists is *not* marketed towards actual lesbian or bisexual women. it is marketed to straight men as a sexual fantasy. it isn't correct to assume what is viewed in porn is what reality looks like.  **3. bisexuals are indecisive or confused:** this idea often comes from the notion that someone has known an individual who called themselves bisexual and later changed their mind. this is a small percentage of the total bisexual population and shouldn't be considered the ""norm"". i have seen the idea even in the lgbt community and have heard people claim that, ""bisexuals just need to make up their minds."" or that they're just doing it so they can benefit from being ""half straight"".   as a bisexual person this is so hurtful. while certain stereotypes are simply annoying and frustrating, this one actually makes me feel alone. it's not like because i am bisexual i have 100% of the privileges of a straight person and 100% of the privileges of the lgbt community. it's more like i'm not straight enough for the straight community and i'm not gay enough for the gay community. you feel like you are never enough of anything for anyone...  basically, at times i will feel more alone than anyone can understand. i have no definite community that i belong to 100% of the time. although, now i am very much involved in the lgbt community and have now made many wonderful friends who love me for me, which is what everyone deserves.   **4. bisexuality is a phase:** i kind of blame the creation and spread of this stereotype to certain people. i will admit there do exist women who will get drunk enough to make out with a girl or do similar things for attention. there are groups of middle school girls who call themselves bisexual just to feel ""unique"" or ""different"". there are groups of homosexual men and women who will call themselves bisexual as a stepping stone to coming out as fully gay or lesbian.  that being said... for the majority of bisexuals i know this is not a phase. i don't stop being bisexual just because i am in a heterosexual relationship and i don't become lesbian from being in a homosexual relationship. my sexuality is completely independent of who i am with at the time. sexuality is a deep rooted fact of someone's personal identity and can't be altered by an immediate event like who you are dating.  **5. bisexuals are not monogamous:** this somewhat relates back to the stereotype of bisexuals being promiscuous and is completely untrue. bisexuals can be monogamous or poly-amorous just like anyone else. saying an entire group of people all believe or practice something is generally really untrue. that would be like saying all heterosexual people like the color green. just because a group shares a sexuality doesn't mean they share *anything* else.  now that we have covered important stereotypes...  &gt; but it doesn't do anything for me because i know they're not attracted to me as a male, but to each other as females.  what you are describing is homosexual females, lesbians. a bisexual woman can be attracted to a male or a female. also, lesbian women do not have relationships with each other for male attention. again, don't confuse pornography with reality.  &gt; i think i find it threatening to my sense of worth because as a straight male my options are limited to only half the population.  if you are a straight male you are *already* limited to half the population, the female half that is. again, bisexual women are attracted to men and women so they might date you.  &gt; 1.there are many films with gay protagonists. its quite acceptable, and becoming more accepted. since im not gay it doesn't affect me, but hey, good for them.  ""many films""? how many films with gay protagonists can you actually list? i watch lgbt films and documentaries quite frequently, for obvious reasons, and can tell you that it is a *very* narrow collection of films. it is becoming more accepted, but it is far from being seen as equal.  also, it does affect you. homophobia can and does harm heterosexual people, anyone who is a friend, coworker, or family member who is lgbt is affected, and any of your future children who might be lgbt are affected.   &gt; 2. many married women that i know of speak of a desire to be with another woman. they wouldn't talk about it openly if it wasn't ok or a tabboo subject.  discussion doesn't mean it isn't taboo. if i were to be married to a man i would still be attracted to women also. so these women could simply be bisexual women who are married to men (heterosexual marriage i assume).  &gt; 3. bisexuals can in theory enjoy both worlds of the gender spectrum as they are attracted to both.   addressed this above under stereotype #3. please re-read as needed.  &gt; i guess i assume women have more of a choice in their sexuality and wont be shamed for it like gay men seem to be, on account of their attractiveness   one, no has a ""choice"" in their sexuality. two, homosexual men are shamed for their sexuality for a similar reason as bisexual women are fantasized. gender roles.  it all relates back to how we culturally view gender. bisexual women are a sexual fantasy of many heterosexual men because of their love of lesbian pornography. so women are fantasized into sexual roles by heterosexual men. homosexual men are often shamed and abused because of how men are viewed in society. for a man to be with another man is considered ""not masculine"" and ""wrong"". the stereotype for men is that they are to pursue women and be sexually active. a homosexual male deviates from this stereotype and is therefore made to feel ashamed of it.  essentially how the entire lgbt community is viewed and stereotyped boils down a lot to gender roles in the us. lesbian and bisexual women are sexual fantasizes and gay men are very negatively viewed because they deviate from traditional male roles.  i hope this summed it up clearly.   if you have further questions just ask. i can provide further information and sources on request.  edit: grammar",1,
297392,"i'm copy and pasting this because the formatting is all weird on the website for me, to help anyone who has the same problem.  margaret thatcher's anti-gay legislation drew the lesbian and gay communities together. photograph: peter marshall/alamy are lesbians from mars and gay men from venus? or are the two groups bound together like close and loving siblings, having separate interests and lives but loving each other just the same?  this is one of the questions i am asking during the course of writing my book on the state of the gay nation. survey results so far have found that on some issues, such as whether we are ""born that way"" or not, and on the causes and consequences of anti-gay bigotry, we are miles apart, but on others we agree. some interviews with prominent members of the lesbian and gay community have ended with an admission that, in the words of one life-long gay activist, ""we are like chalk and cheese but shoved together by the homophobes.""  our history is a little like elizabeth taylor and richard burton in that we regularly break up and have terrible fights but can't seem to leave each other for good. in the heyday of the gay liberation front, in the early 70s, the majority of lesbians walked out in protest at the sexism of some of the gay men who took a pivotal role. this kickstarted autonomous lesbian liberation campaigns and even separate pride marches for a time in the early 80s.  in the mid 80s the aids pandemic brought the most grotesque anti-gay prejudice out in the open. i recall people telling me not to share a cup with a gay man, or even use the same bathroom in case i became infected, and heard numerous comments about how gay men were responsible for the ""gay plague"" because they had ""unnatural"" sex and were ""promiscuous"". many lesbians put previous bad feeling behind them and rallied to support their gay brothers. new alliances were built and a sense of community followed. however, there were rumblings from some of the sisters about how gay men failed to support them against sexism, and some resentment that, once again, the specific needs of lesbians, such as having children removed in custody battles because they were in same-sex relationships, were being ignored.  then came the introduction, by the thatcher government, which was hell-bent on reviving traditional ""family values"", of the first anti-gay legislation in britain since 1885, section 28. it was also the first time lesbians and gay men had been legislated against as one group. our bond was again strengthened as we fought this pernicious legislation. but it was not to last. in 1994 a piece entitled dicks &amp; dykes divided? was published in mx magazine, a glossy commercial freesheet. the peg for the piece was complaints by some gay men that there was a women-only tent at the pride march that year. the complainants could not envisage why lesbians would ever want autonomous space.  since then a truce has developed, and the phrase ""lesbian and gay"" has all but become one word. some would argue that a liberalism has overtaken the radical edge of the movement with no room for feminist militancy or separatism in this now rather hegemonic community.  but the fact remains that gay men and lesbians appear to have little in common except for being vulnerable to bigotry and discrimination. our social scenes are very different, and lesbians are more likely to be coerced into heterosexuality and straight marriage than men. punishment rapes of lesbians do not just happen in africa, and there are far fewer positive lesbian role models in the media than there are of gay men.  having said that, more gay men are choosing to become parents, so maybe the bond between them and their lesbian sisters will be further strengthened at the school gates. it is hard to deny, however, that we are, in some respects, worlds apart  to fill out the survey that will inform julie bindel's book straight expectations, [go here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/straightexpectations2) if you identify as heterosexual, and [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=izvjil9zrhysdhodrt6zoilxak6pob%2bggcc1ufibkbq%3d) if you identify as other than heterosexual",1,1

606280,"here is an article i found about the issue.  it seems to sum op that homosexuality isn't really a big theme in the bible and that the passages that refer to it are not referring to homosexuality.  also, the bible shouldn't be our moral code in the 21st century.  everyone should be able to choose what they want to do as informed adults and be abe to do it.  link: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-lose/what-does-the-bible-reall_b_990444.html  excerpt (most of the article)  old testament narrative  there are two passages that refer to homosexual behavior that are set in larger narratives. that is, they are part of a story, not a legal or moral code. each deals with the threat of homosexual rape. the more famous of the two comes from the story of sodom and gomorrah found in genesis 19:1-11. lot, abraham's nephew, is staying in sodom when he is visited by angels. men from the city come and demand that they be allowed to have sex with lot's guests. lot refuses and when he is threatened by the townspeople the angels he has hosted protect him. a similar story occurs in judges 19:16-30 (minus angels and with a grislier outcome).  there is broad consensus among scholars on both the left and the right (except for the very most conservative) that these passages have nothing to do with homosexuality per se, but rather with hospitality and justice. that is, both scenes represent hosts protecting their guests from severe humiliation and outrageous injustice. some other parts of the bible interpret these passages just this way. ezekiel, for instance, refers to the sin of sodom not in terms of sexual immorality but rather justice: ""this was the guilt of your sister sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy"" (16:49).  the holiness code of leviticus  there are two verses in the book of leviticus that refer to homosexual behavior. the first reads, ""you shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination"" (18:22). while the second goes even further: ""if a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death; their blood is upon them"" (20:13). again, there is considerable agreement that both of these passages are portions of what is commonly called the holiness code, a set of rules and regulations spanning chapters 17-26 that are intended to set israel apart from the egyptians they fled and the canaanites they were now living among. (there is also overwhelming agreement, thankfully, that however one feels about homosexuality, the death penalty is an extreme and unwarranted response!)  there is considerable debate, however, about three matters. 1) do these passages refer to consensual homosexual practice (and whether that was even a recognized option in the ancient world), or do they describe the cultic practice of israel's neighbors and adversaries? 2) are these regulations contingent because they derive from particular challenges and situations the israelites faced at that time (the importance of procreation, for instance, given that israel was a nomadic people dependent on increasing its population for survival), or do they intend to establish universal sexual norms? and 3) even if these regulations were normative for israelites, do they continue to be for christians given how many other levitical codes are contradicted later in the new testament or have historically been ignored by christians.  new testament ethics  the three passages in question read as follows:  romans 1:26-27: ""for this reason god gave them up to degrading passions. their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another. men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.""  1 corinthians 6:9-11: ""do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god? do not be deceived! fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards, revilers, robbers -- none of these will inherit the kingdom of god. and this is what some of you used to be. but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and in the spirit of our god.""  1 timothy 1:9-11: ""this means understanding that the law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless and disobedient, for the godless and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their father or mother, for murderers, fornicators, sodomites, slave-traders, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god, which he entrusted to me.""  there is considerable debate on at least two questions about these passages. 1) do they refer to consensual homosexual practice, to cultic prostitution or to male pederasty (where an adult male has sex with a younger boy, either as a coming of age ritual or on a commercial basis)? 2) are the new testament authors pointing to specific behavior they have witnessed, or are they using a common ""catalogue of complaints"" against gentiles (as there are similar complaints in other first-century jewish writings about gentiles)?  of these verses, the romans passage is often cited as a ""lynch pin"" text because the apostle paul seems to make his argument on the basis of the natural order (""natural"" vs. ""unnatural"" passions). but at another place paul uses nature to justify his position on the proper length of men's and women's hair and the need for women to wear head coverings (1 corinthians 11:2-16). as it turns out, arguing from nature was a common rhetorical device in paul's day, employed by many contemporaries of the apostle, and was similar to saying today, ""the conventional wisdom is...""  four basic views  most christians i have talked to fall into one of four groups regarding these verses, depending on how they address two questions. the first we've named directly at several points already: do the passages refer to anything like the phenomena of life-long, monogamous or mutually consensual same-gendered relationships that we know of today? (it's worth noting that the word ""homosexual"" was not present in the ancient world but was instead invented in the 19th century.) the second issue we've only alluded to: whether or not the passages refer to the phenomenon we are describing today, are we bound to ethical determinations made by persons living in vastly different cultures and times and whose understanding of the world and of god's activity was shaped and limited by their own cultural viewpoints.  depending on how you answer those two critical questions, you will likely fall into one of our groups. 1. the passages in question refer to homosexual practice in all times and cultures and so universally prohibit such practice.  2. the passages do not refer to homosexuality as we know it today and so cannot be seen as prohibiting it. other passages therefore need to inform our discussions about sexuality in general and homosexual relationships in particular.  3. the passages may or may not refer to homosexuality as we know it, but they -- and the larger witness of scripture -- imply a view of nature and creation that supports sexual relationship and union only between man and woman, and so homosexual practice is prohibited.  4. the passages may or may not refer to homosexuality as we know it, but they -- and all of scripture -- are conditioned by the cultural and historical realities of the authors and so offer an incomplete and insufficient understanding of creation and nature and so cannot be used to prohibit homosexual practice today. rather, one needs to read the larger biblical witness to discern god's hopes for caring, mutually supportive relationships, whether heterosexual or homosexual. as is often the case, one's larger theological or ideological commitments greatly influence how one reads these seven verses. the first and third positions, for instance, reflect a more conservative view and make it difficult to find anything but condemnation in the bible for homosexual practice. the second and forth, in contrast, invite a more progressive interpretation of the verses in common and open the way to supporting homosexual relationships as several major mainline church bodies have done.  for those christians who look to the bible for moral guidance, two additional questions may be worth considering. first, do you see yourself represented fairly in one of the four groups above? second, can you imagine that someone holding one of the other three positions is also a faithful christian who loves god and neighbor and searches the scripture for guidance in these matters, even if that difference puts you at odds on this matter? how professing christians answer these questions will greatly determine future discourse on these matters and, more importantly, how they interact with persons who are gay or lesbian.",1,

847203,"ok, that pastor *really* needs to learn about the return key on his keyboard.  let's see... where to begin.  ah!  &gt;i am amazed at how quickly and subtly the flood of rationale has came that “if i am not for same-sex marriage” that i must a) hate homosexuals b) be unintelligent or c) both  ok, perhaps ""hate"" is too strong a word.  would ""desire to see their rights restricted because they aren't like you"" be more to your liking?  &gt;would i be any more correct to assume that those who are for same sex marriage a) hate heterosexuals b) are unintelligent or c)both?   ridiculous assertion, i'm starting to think b) was accurate in last question.  this would only apply if those who are for same sex marriage were also opposed to heterosexual marriage.   &gt; many, have asked “what would you do if one of your children were gay?” this is posed as if to be some “aha” or “gotcha” question. to me, it isn’t that at all. if one of my children were to tell my wife and i that they were gay, it would never dissolve my love or care for them. the news would never shut my door to their visits, bind my arms to their hugs, or silence my prayers for their lives. i still would be firm in my convictions, and would make sure that they know that i believe that they are making error in their life choices.  first, anyone who thinks being gay is a choice is either deluded or perhaps deep in the closet.  i do not know of any straight man or woman who is straight because they chose not to be gay.  our gender identity is a part of us as much as our lungs, our hearts and our brains.  second, i fail to see how you can say ""love"" at the same time as ""deny you basic human rights"" and not have an aneurysm.  &gt;biblically, marriage is not a gray issue. it is one of the first planks driven into the design of civilization from the beginning.   leviticus, right?  shall we break down all the things that are forbidden in leviticus?  all the things that people do today and nobody gets all bent out of shape about?  mixed fabrics?  shrimp cocktail?  leviticus either applies or no longer applies, but if you're cherry picking the ones you choose to enforce, then it isn't your god's will you're enforcing, it's your own.  &gt; after god created male and female, his first command to them was “to be fruitful and multiply”. this has been the command that has allowed mankind to fill the earth.  1. there's 7 billion of us, i think we've got enough fruit.  at what point will god say ""whoa there!  stop multiplying!""  we're running out of resources.  2. this also apparently invalidates any marriage where either partner is sterile (like myself), or where neither wants kids, or where either is over the age where kids are likely.    &gt;i do not believe that homosexuals should be abused or mistreated, and neither should people of faith.  not abused, just reduced to second class citizens with less rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as you yourself enjoy.  &gt; i am not full of hatred, i am not unintelligent, and i am a person who believes in the preservation of traditional marriage  why do we *all* have to abide by *your* idea of traditional marriage?  marriage predates christianity, and marriage has had many forms along the way.  it used to be the sale of a woman to another family.  it has been a political tool.  it has been a punishment for being a rape victim.  i could go on and on.  so why do you feel that the law of the land should enforce what *you* think of as traditional marriage at the expense of others?  why not let them decide on their own what tradition means?  you say you're not full of hate, but you are no stranger to cruelty.  denying someone else the chance to marry the one they love is cruel.  &gt; after the dust settles in d.c., we will still be americans.  see, this is the one that really chaps my ass.  being anti-civil rights may be ""holy"" to you.  but i do not understand how anyone who calls themselves an american can look at their neighbor and say ""yeah, i don't think that *you* should have the same rights that *i* enjoy.""  i just can't wrap my head around it.  &gt;honestly, find your standing with god, then speak with his heart  i do not share your religion.  keep it out of my marriage.",1,
141941,"warning: long meandering personal opinion from tired person.  one theory that people might want to look at on the topic of drag is that of david halperin in the book *how to be gay*.  he basically says that drag isn't so much a mockery of the feminine as an identification of the social perception of feminine tragedy as melodramatic. drag queens aren't so much a parody of women as certain types of feminine archetypes taken to an extreme.  halperin gives an example of the fire island italian widows. these are mediterranean gay men who appropriate the dress and behaviour of italian widow women, dressing in black dresses and performing a mourning ritual for partners who died from aids.  &gt; the effect of their masquerade was not to devalue the social performance of widowhood or to dismiss the reality of the pain it dramatizes—which would have completely defeated the point of reperforming it—but to reclaim it, figuratively and ironically, for themselves. the fire island italian widows might be guilty of cultural theft, but not callous enjoyment of female suffering. they could well be accused of lacking proper respect for actual italian widows.  and indeed their act was disrespectful. but not because it expressed contempt for widows in particular, or for women in general, or for the pain of widowhood, but because it implied a principled disrespect for all socially constructed and asymmetrical gender polarities, for the cultural prestige that accrues to those who embody them, and for all social performances that demand to be taken straight—and that are the privileged domain of those with the authority to impose such demands on others. the ultimate thrust was to challenge the monopoly of dignity held by those whose mourning is endowed with authenticity and, to that extent, with immunity to devaluation and derision.  &gt; *no real italian widows were harmed during the making of this performance.* instead, those real widows furnished a model, a metaphor, an image, a role, that could serve as a kind of *proxy* for a gay male mediterranean widowhood under performative construction—a widowhood that was itself, necessarily and agonizingly, both outlandish and valid, facetious and all too real.  in the case of the italian widows, i think part of the point of it is that one of the huge pain points for gay men in the early era of aids was that unlike when one partner in a long-term heterosexual relationship loses another, it's socially considered to not really be a loss. straight family members had dismissed gay men's lovers as ""pals"" or ""friends"" (i have a friend who considered the fact that his partner's death certificate listed him only as ""friend"" to be essentially the last fuck you). as halperin points out, this exaggerated public grief in the form of the widow performance was a subversive way to prod society into seeing the true horror that aids had inflicted, and the true reality of the relationships that had been cut short.  i think drag can be good and bad. bad drag can be misogynistic, racist and so on. drag does come from an era where unlike now, the difference between gay and trans was a lot less clear. we have an understanding now where we don't hastily conflate transvestites/cross-dressers, drag queens, binary transitioning trans people, genderqueer/non-binary people, and gay/lesbian/bi people. before gay liberation, butch and femme roles were more strictly enforced than now. that connection between sexual orientation and gender difference has been severed and that's very probably a good thing.  i think another part of it is that unlike blackface, it comes from a position of resistance against oppression. drag partly came from an attempt to reappropriate the insults being hurled at gay people. well, if they say we are girly men, sissy, effeminate... let's not disappoint them, let's be girlier, sissier and more effeminate than people could ever dream of. because there's nothing wrong with that. they say we're ""genderbenders"", okay, so what if we are? rather than pretend otherwise, let the show go on. there is power in that: rather than letting the homophobic majority push them around, the queens of old said ""no, let the show go on"".  i feel uncomfortable about drag in some ways. i enjoy some drag that makes me feel uneasy and i can't put my finger on why.",1,

323377,"hey there. thanks for the thoughtful reply. i am quickly discovering how ignorant i am, so i appreciate the insights.   &gt;first off, there are in fact studies that show there is a genetic component to homosexuality (this is actually a bit of an oversimplification and if you'd like i can find the more detailed stuff).   this is the very first time i have ever heard of this and i’d like you to share where you heard/read this.   &gt;your religion has absolutely no right to influence laws that affect people who don't believe in your religion.   this is true. and though what i wrote may not reflect this, i do agree with you. however, my opinions can affect how i vote on different issues. discount my opinions and i might as well not vote at all.   &gt;your opinion, which like your religion, really shouldn't have any real impact here.   my opinion shouldn’t have an impact? not sure if i should read into that further, but for the sake of learning something i will not.   &gt;then why are straight people so very dedicated to trying to protect it? why do you care if gay people want to go into this?  i care because i don’t understand why they would want to. it sounds like so much responsibility that even heterosexual couples have issues with it (case in point: i come from a broken, heterosexual household myself). perhaps my bias comes from a saying i heard once: “if you support gay marriage, you support gays” which… i don’t know which side of the fence i sit on that at the moment. i mean i have family members who are very much gay and vocal and active about their gayness, but i have not rejected them because of their sexual orientation (despite their repeated rudeness about the matter).   &gt;the fact is that marriage comes with a whole bunch of legal benefits and protections that currently gay couples do not have access to. married people pay lower taxes, and no... their healthcare options are generally better than single peoples. and i really don't understand your point about the responsibilities. for some people it's worth it.  oh, alright. that makes sense. so what are these legal benefits and protections that you speak of? seriously, no one has given me a straight answer (no pun intended) beyond just that. “oh we’re lobbying for our right to get married!”… and what else? healthcare? last i heard healthcare was in the pits in america and has yet to improve, despite recent laws being passed to that end.  &gt;this is not true at all. again, there have been studies done, and this is simply not true. in fact, lesbian couples have significantly lower levels of child abuse than strait couples. i have read several reports about it being true. i can find those sources if you’d like. also, i’d like to read the reports about lesbian couples being less abusive. fair trade, i think.  &gt;so first off... you are making a sweeping generalization after admitting that a bunch of them don't do the thing you're accusing them of. thats a little weird. secondly, you're coming across as a little hypocritical because you're in fact terribly offended by all of this stuff and are saying that these people dont deserve equal rights. and thirdly, yeah, some of them are pretty sensitive... it's probably something to do with growing up in a culture that is actively oppressing them.  the first sweeping generalization… yeah, that was sort of a pathetic effort say, “look, not all gay people are bad, but the few that are complete jerkwads make the rest of the community look awful”. i suppose i was/am still a bit offended because i don’t yet understand the reason behind why some people believe it to be totally okay to be gay and others don’t. because you’ve put aside religion and you’ve put aside science… what else is there to disagree on? or agree on?   &gt;in this case, it kind of does. a bunch of the arguments that you've put are in fact, factually incorrect and your opinion is based on an inherent bias and misconceptions. tie that to the fact that you're arguing against equal rights and yeah... it comes out as pretty wrong.  well that’s sort of why i’m in cmv so that those misconceptions can be corrected. bias? yeah, i am biased. i’ll admit it. i am 100% biased. that comes from my upbringing, which i’ve already admitted wasn’t that great. but i am willing to listen to the other side and consider a few points. otherwise i wouldn’t have bothered to post here.   &gt;in this case, it kind of does. a bunch of the arguments that you've put are in fact, factually incorrect and your opinion is based on an inherent bias and misconceptions. tie that to the fact that you're arguing against equal rights and yeah... it comes out as pretty wrong.  again, i’d like to see these facts that you claim are correct before you jump to saying that my facts are wrong and before i believe you.   &gt;this may be the most interesting part of this. you're arguing against equality because women are also treated unequally.   it just seems that with the recent hype of gays lobbying for their rights, women and their rights have been completely overlooked by the media.   &gt; why not fight for everyones equality?   a valid point. but again, that comes down to uprooting deep preconceived notions and accepting something widely that most people haven’t accepted yet.   &gt;i bet, if you were more open minded, you could get a bunch of gay guys who would absolutely fight for your rights as well. most of the gay folks i know are all about equality for everyone, and take women's rights issues very seriously as well. often, being oppressed makes you more aware of the oppression of others.  you’re probably right; i have been amazed at how vocal those guys can be.  cool. this was interesting. again, i’d like to read some of those reports you made reference to before i believe some of your points. other than that, great discussion.",1,

361621,"ok, i'm going to try to cover as much ground as i can quickly, and if there's something you want me to elaborate on, i can. also, my area of focus is 20th century lgbt history, so i can't go into a huge amount of detail on earlier stuff.   biggest thing to keep in mind when studying homosexuality in the past is that homosexual/homoromantic acts existed, but the idea that someone was ""gay"" or ""straight"" did not exist.   in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century homosexual culture was quite prominent in places. george chaucey's ""gay new york"" did a great job of showing how there was a tremendous urban gay male world. lots of men were having sex with other men, without anyone much thinking it strange. the understanding of the relationship between gender and sexuality was very different from how we understand it today. instead of one having a distinct gender identity and a sexual orientation, one's sexuality was understood to be an extension of one's gender. so a man desired a woman because he was a man, and a woman desired a man because she was a woman. same sex attraction was understood to  be the product of gender inversion. so the effeminate gay man desired men because his gender was inverted, and he was closer to a woman than a man. in this respect, the effeminate gay man ( known as a fairy, or later pansy) was considered to be interchangeable with a female prostitute. a man could engage in sex with one of these men without raising any eyebrows, if he took the ""active"" (ie penetrative) role.   homosexual culture became less tolerated by the mainstream in the 30's and 40's. by the 50's it was very difficult to be gay in america. gay men and lesbians were the subject of government witch hunts, and were thrown out of government jobs in what came to be called the lavender scare. during this time two major organizations - the mattachine society and daughters of bilitis - formed what we now call the homophile movement. it was an early gay and lesbian movement (mattachine was a mixed group, dob was for lesbians) centered on basic rights and freedoms for gays and lesbians.   at the same time, gay bar culture (which had been ""a thing"" for a long while) was under attack. the bars were often the only place for working class lesbians and gay men to congregate and socialize, and were thus very popular. however, the police raided them often and arrested their patrons. finally, in 1969 during a raid at the stonewall inn in new york, people fought back. the stonewall uprising began the start of the modern gay and lesbian movement.   suddenly gay men and lesbians were everywhere. at first, they tried to work together in groups like the gay activist alliance, but tensions ran high. lesbians were frustrated with the misogyny of gay men, and gay men were frustrated with the perceived ""sex-negative"" attitudes of some lesbians. during the 70's gay men and lesbians worked in mostly separate movements. gay men created vibrate gay communities and a flourishing gay culture in large cities. they rejected heterosexual norms and embraced the sexual revolution. lesbians worked within feminist movements to create female spaces.   in 1981 the first cases of a rare cancer were reported in clusters of gay men. the strange disease perplexed doctors, researchers, and gay men. the illness went by many names - the 4h disease (after the four original risk groups - haitians, hemophiliacs, heroin users, and homosexuals), the saint's disease (after a popular gay disco in nyc) and grid (gay-related immune deficiency) - until the acronym aids was finally agreed upon. the government was mostly indifferent to the plight of gay men, and little was done. gay men and lesbians worked together to create service organizations to help people with aids, and in 1987 the aids coalition to unleash power (act up) was formed to fight back against government indifference. act up took over wall street and the fda, shut down a major church service, and organized many protests to bring awareness of aids issues. i'm going to stop here, as i'm having trouble typing in bed (i had hip surgery a few days ago) but i'm very happy to elaborate on anything, particularly lesbian history, aids, and act up. i've barely scratched the surface here, there's so much to be said about lgbt history.     edit on sources:    gay new york: gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world 1890-1940 by george chauncey   odd girls and twilight lovers: a history of lesbian life in twentieth-century america by lillian faderman   moving politics: emotion and act up's fight against aids by deborah b. gould",1,

""offensive to many here"", surely that is a wall that should be broken down then? homosexuality was, and still is to an extent, offensive to people. people have to be comfortable around people of other lifestyles, especially so when those lifestyles are not a choice.   &gt; 2) if you must slow dance, be as inconspicuous as possible.  a slow dance is hardly an eye catching scenario, unless everyone else is tearing up the dance floor, so to say.   &gt;3) do not gawk or stare at lesbians or gay men, especially bull dykes or drag queens. we are not your entertainment.  that's a fair point, though it could have been worded better. a passing glance at someone blatantly throwing gender stereotypes to the wind how ever is curiosity and acceptable, but actually staring is just rude.   &gt;4) if you cannot comfortably deal with someone of the same sex making a pass at you, get out.  fair does.  &gt;5) do not flaunt your heterosexuality. be discreet. risk being mistaken for a lezzie or a homo.  well, you are in a gay club after all, but you shouldn't be discouraged from showing affection for people of the opposite gender, and you certainly shouldn't sit quietly in the corner. everyone's there to have fun, so as long as you don't start disrupting other peoples fun where's the harm?  &gt;6) if you feel these rules are unfair, go fight homophobia in straight clubs, or [leave]  i don't really know what to say to this, some of the rules are perfectly valid and the occasional one, well, those regarding ""don't be hetero"" are frankly moronic. personally, i think the idea of a gay club is broken, i understand the purpose and reasoning, and think it is a good idea to an extent, but by refusing heterosexuals the ability  to be comfortable in the environment, and by refusing homosexuals the ability to be comfortable in an ordinary club you inevitably create a schism, which leads to oppression.   rather than acknowledging the differences, i feel the objective should be to say ""fuck the differences, just have fun and don't be a dick.""  i've gotta say though, the title to this post is incredibly eye-grabby ""look at me, they're being morons"".",1,1

407769,"i appreciate the honest feedback, but i have objections:  while being morally good and helping other humans are admirable goals, i don't think they should govern everything we do. evidently, we should avoid actively harmful activities. we should also strive to help others. but our entire existence should not be geared towards furthering humanity specifically because humanity isn't all material--love and fulfilling relationships are, of course, a part of it.  homosexuality is not a choice. i'm not sure if you agree with this statement, but most psychologists and psychiatrists do.   i'll name the characters in my hypothetical situation because it's easier (for me) to keep them straight. joan is a lesbian. if she decides to marry adam for whatever reason, she is defying her own nature and resigning herself to misery or at least a less fulfilling life than she could otherwise have. meanwhile, she may very well be deceiving adam, and is certainly holding *him* back from the fulfilling and mutually loving relationship he could have had.  on a slightly different note, producing children is hardly the world's problems right now. if there were five hundred humans left, it would definitely be selfish for gay people not to reproduce. however, as things are, society is not hurt by a few more non-breeders, especially as some gay couples want to adopt, which is definitely admirable; to put it in economic terms, there's more supply than demand in that area, so they are probably actually doing more good than if they were conceiving (even if   gay culture is a rather different matter. i'm writing this assuming you mean loud, outrageous, adam lambert-style gay culture, and not, say, the ""good cooking and well-made clothing"" culture or whatever. it definitely is a rather physical, instantaneous gratification kind of thing. however, it's a culture, not a product of homosexuality. most gay and bisexual people i know aren't particularly involved in ""gay culture,"" and neither are most middle-aged and older homosexuals. in many cases, the all-out gay culture is an aspect of teenage and young-adult rebellion (and many of these people have a lot to rebel against.) it's really not that different from the less-unified ""culture"" of heterosexuals of the same age: hanging out in bars, drinking, one-night stands.   then there's the whole pride element, and honestly, i think that's a product of oppression. i rather like it. it's a refusal to be ashamed of something people are saying you should be ashamed of because it's a part of you. it's festive. it's friendly. it's also not an every day thing--it's like getting excited over new year's or the fourth of july. many of the people who march lead perfectly normal lives every other day of the year--some happily married, some lonely, some constantly failing at successful relationships and some not even looking. wasteful cultures aside, being gay is just a hell of a lot like being straight--at least for those gay people i know, and for many famous gay people.",1,

416675,"&gt; this may be my ignorance in genetics coming out, but why would it matter if females that are off springs of the homosexual male in question, if these off springs will never come into fruition?   we haven't found all of the causes of homosexuality yet, but we do have clues pointing to possible causes, as well as reasons why it wouldn't be a maladaptation. here's a couple of examples.  a) it's not genetic. diethylstilbestrol (des) was given to pregnant women between the 1940s and 70s because it reduced the odds of miscarriage. but they stopped because there was a significant spike in the number of daughters born to these patients who were homosexual. **tl;dr:** dyke in a pill? maybe it's pre-natal chemistry and des is only one of many chemicals that can trigger it.  (a mnemonic and free joke for your sitcom screenplay: introduce a lesbian couple and say ""this is di and ethyl, still best of 'ol friends."")  b) it is genetic, but it may have incomplete penetrance, or is epistatic with another gene, or only produces homosexuality when it's (pun warning...) *homo*zygous for a particular allele, while a *hetero*zygous combination (a ""gay"" allele and a ""straight"" allele) gives you a non-homosexual offspring.   okay, whip out mendel's first law: the parents get three straight/bi children who'll pass on their genes for every one child who's gay.   those three non-homosexual children will *not only* pass on all of their parents' genes, they'll also pass on *all of the homosexual child's genes, too*. as j.b.s. haldane once explained the mathematics of kin selection: ""i would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins.""  if homosexuals increase the odds of their straight/bi siblings reproducing, then the allele has paid for itself. it may even be the case that the ""gay allele"" in an heterosexual (the other half of a protein pathway wasn't there, perhaps) confers an individual benefit. disease resistance, perhaps.   if evolution selects for sickle-cell anemia because it yields two siblings who are immune to malaria, then it could select for homosexuality according to the same mathematics.  c) it's *epigenetic*, and occurs when environmental conditions are just right. central bearded dragon lizards in australia will undergo a spontaneous sex change from male to female while still in the egg if temperatures get high enough. the offspring of certain plants will shift to a different blooming cycle if the parents were exposed to extreme cold.    evolution has prepared these traits and given them a special fuse-plug called methylation, which can be triggered by environmental factors. too much testosterone in the air from macho males bringing the village to the brink of catastrophic war? poof!

389784,"i think drag is in a weird place at the moment precisely because gay culture is at a weird place. here in britain, we have a conservative government giving gay people the right to get married. gay culture has heavily influenced the mainstream—there are things that 5 or 10 or 20 years ago, straight people wouldn't understand which they now do because of the mainstreaming of gay culture.  drag feels slightly out of place because the very political programme of liberation that gay people have fought has been so successful. back before stonewall and gay liberation movements, most people's understandings of gay people relied on some kind of stereotype of gender variance. in the 70s, gay and lesbian culture fought back against the assumption—gay men who wanted to proudly say ""i'm a man who loves men, i'm not a man who wants to become a woman"", and lesbians saying the equivalent.  the identities around that have changed: it used to be the case that gender non-conformity led one into the gay world, and men who didn't think of themselves as male ended up in the gay community. but over the last 40 years, the evolution of trans identity has siphoned away the gender non-conformists. there's nothing necessarily wrong with that: if someone has gender dysphoria and finds that a trans identity and perhaps hormones and surgery are the way to live their life, more power to them. there's a few interesting problems there: because of the fluidity of trans as an identity, you have some trans people claiming drag queens as early pioneering trans people, and others disclaiming them as awful misogynistic parodies of women's lives, or of the trans experience. a cynic might suggest that drag queens become trans when it is politically useful (maybe when they are [being beaten up](http://www.queerty.com/drag-performer-viciously-attacked-as-crowd-watches-and-encourages-fight-20130624/)), and they get dismissed as a horrible appropriating misogynistic shitbag when they aren't politically useful. either way, the identification with gender non-conformity with being gay has been cut away, but drag still staggers on—in big hair and bigger stilettos.  is there bad drag culture? problematic drag queens? sure. but i think there's something of value in drag culture. the way i understand it is as a certain level of pride in difference. drag queens take all the things that society thinks—or perhaps thought (maybe we are slowly stepping into a new era of enlightened tolerance)—about homosexuality and they **own the shit out of it**.  at its best, drag culture isn't mocking women—although there are individual women who are impersonated as part of a drag performance—but instead mocking the social standards that women (and men by extension) are expected to live up to.  david halperin has a very moving section in his book where he discusses the fire island italian drag widows. these are men who lost their partners to aids, and who dressed up in the clothes of mourning italian widows. i think part of the motivation behind this—and halperin writes about this—is that these men knew that heterosexual society would not take their loss seriously. the structures of the state and the attitudes of society would treat their partners as disposable (hell, the reaction to the aids crisis *shows* society considered gay victims disposable—the only pitiable aids victim was an ""innocent"" straight one), and their grief and loss as unimportant. you want to mock my grief? get the fuck in line, i'm going to mock it first. society was going to treat their loss as unimportant and their reaction would only be interpreted by mainstream society as a bad parody of actual suffering—because suffering is what happens to real people, and only straight people are real people in that sort of view of the world.  i think there is a difference between the top-end celebrity drag queens—the rupaul's drag race sort of drag—and ""everyday"" drag queens who work in bars and clubs. the queens who end up having a mainstream straight following often lose the political bite of some of the drag queens you'll find working the bars and clubs. there's misogynistic drag acts and the world would be better off without that. but i think the better drag queens mock some of the pretensions and seriousness of heterosexual culture—and a good thing too.  halperin's book on gay culture sort of acknowledges that there's some difficulty in drag queen culture. it does come from the privileged perspective of men, even if as a medium, drag can be used to express the discontent and—during the aids crisis—utter horror and abjection that gay men felt.  i heard an interview recently with panti bliss about [the speech they gave about homophobia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxayhuzwnl0). when asked why they did the speech in drag, they said there was something ""shamanistic"" about performing in drag. it throws people off their guard and people don't really know how to respond. there's something to that too: precisely because they think the drag queen is a figure of fun—because of the sublimated background sexism that a lot of people have—when they start talking about something serious, it penetrates their consciousness in a different way than if it was just a guy standing up on stage.  drag culture makes me uncomfortable precisely because it is subversive, edgy, very risky kind of comedy that juggles a whole stack of live grenades. i want drag that's not misogynistic, but i don't want it to go away.",1,

555162,"&gt;lesbians might have been expected to be more promiscuous than heterosexual women, since they had no pregnancy to fear, and on the classic theories, would have been inclined to play out a “male sex role.” but research by michael bailey and david schmitt found that lesbians are inclined toward even less promiscuous lives than heterosexual women.  this is from an article you posted to me, that i finally had time to indulge. so by your own source lesbians are not proven more promiscuous than straight women. i am not going to respond to your other two posted links. their bias is obvious and their completely untrustworthy sources. i am not going to pour over every footnote to make sure they haven't misrepresented something nor am i going to verify the validity of each individual source. if there is valid, useful information to be sifted from the clusterfuck of bias inherent in your links, post those original sources instead.   &gt;the mean number of male sexual partners msm reported in the previous year fell significantly from 2.9 to 2.3 between the two surveys (p = 0.035) and was more marked in men under 24 years old (mean 2.9 to 2.1 partners, p = 0.027). the number of partners also fell in men aged 35 to 44 from 3.0 to 2.2, though this was not quite statistically significant (p = 0.07).  source: http://www.aidsmap.com/consistent-decline-in-partner-numbers-in-us-gay-men-in-last-decade-but-no-change-in-condom-use/page/2635086/  notice the original study cited and it's up to date information. promiscuity is falling as homosexuality becomes more excepted and less taboo, also as gay marriage increases in availability. it has also taken place post aids. the fact of falling promiscuity under these circumstances should quite handily defeat your assertion that 30 years old data is still relevant. the age gays lived in 30 years ago was completely different and how they were forced to live isn't how people live anymore. consider the tiny fraction of gay men back then that would be comfortable or safe having a long-term partner. they would risk their lives and reputation. so to fulfill sexual desires they would have to engage in fleeting sexual encounters. today much less stigma exists and gay men are free to have long term relationships with little risk.   from you about the onset of the aids crisis beginning in the 80s: &gt;this is an hypothesis. do you have studies to justify this hypothesis?  it's not a hypothesis. it is a simple fact. are you really not familiar with the 80's being the first decade of widespread aids panic and understanding. i've posted a timeline anyway:  http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/aids-timeline/  so promiscuity among gays is pretty obviously more due to gender than sexuality. men like sex and if they're getting it from other men it is easier. women are more picky about sex and if straight men have to get it from women it is much harder. unfortunately i've yet to find an article or study that actually compares straight and gay sexual partners over a lifetime. even your original stats from the 70s don't compare directly. so it is difficult.  but all of this is irrelevant. there is no point to argue how promiscuous gays are since the point of this cmv begins with gays being accepted. the question before us is is bisexuality a matter of choice. so feel free to refute me for a final time but i'm done being off track. good day and have a terrific weekend!",1,

668465,"for me, the quality of the writing was the biggest selling point for me. (meaning the actual writing itself, sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph). fantasy/sci-fi, as a genre tends to contain a lot of sub-par writers. having someone that elevates the genre is something that many fans cherish.       most of the issues you complained about are big picture things (plot stricture mostly). it's possible that the plot, action, setting, or characters just don't appeal to you. if that is case, you are simply not going to enjoy the book that much no matter how good other elements of it are. of course, a good writer can make a story enjoyable even when the subject matter doesn't appeal to you and a bad writer can ruin a story you would otherwise enjoy.     back to my point about the writing though, if you really enjoy both good writing and the subject matter from the fantasy genre, there aren't many books were you can find both (rothfuss, guy gavriel kay, &amp; r scott bakker come to mind, but they are definitely in the minority). personally, whenever i come across a fantasy novel where i can actually quote multiple lines, that is something i cherish (and tend to recommend quite exuberantly). and, there's a lot of good lines from the name of the wind.  i put two here just to make the point. the first is the one from the end of chapter one (and it was that chapter and this quote that really sold me on the book) ""the waystone was his, just as the third silence was his. this was appropriate, as it was the greatest silence of the three, wrapping the others inside itself. it was deep and wide as autumn’s ending. it was heavy as a great river-smooth stone. it was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.""  then there's this one, which paints a picture of the scene so well that i can't think of a way to improve it: ""it slowly began to dawn on me that i had been staring at her for an impossible amount of time. lost in my thoughts, lost in the sight of her. but her face didn't look offended or amused. it almost looked as if she were studying the lines of my face, almost as if she were waiting.  i wanted to take her hand. i wanted to brush her cheek with my fingertips. i wanted to tell her that she was the first beautiful thing that i had seen in three years. the sight of her yawning to the back of her hand was enough to drive the breath from me. how i sometimes lost the sense of her words in the sweet fluting of her voice. i wanted to say that if she were with me then somehow nothing could ever be wrong for me again.  in that breathless second i almost asked her. i felt the question boiling up from my chest. i remember drawing a breath then hesitating--what could i say? come away with me? stay with me? come to the university? no. sudden certainty tightened in my chest like a cold fist. what could i ask her? what could i offer? nothing. anything i said would sound foolish, a child's fantasy.  i closed my mouth and looked across the water. inches away, denna did the same. i could feel the heat of her. she smelled like road dust, and honey, and the smell the air holds seconds before a heavy summer rain.  neither of us spoke. i closed my eyes. the closeness of her was the sweetest, sharpest thing i had ever known.""",0,

554798,"i just wanted to complicate the picture a little bit.  human sexuality is multidimensional. what i mean is that it includes our sexual orientation, identity, and behaviors. these do not always hang together in consistent ways.  we normally lump together all three of these dimensions under the label sexual orientation. orientation is mainly about who we are attracted to and feel sexual urges toward. (i believe this is what /u/kicker7955 was referring to.) am i attracted to other people of the same sex as me? different sex? there is some evidence that there is a biological basis for sexual orientation -- but most research also concludes that it is not 100% biologically determined.   the picture gets more complicated when you consider identity and behavior separately from orientation. identity is what we *consider* ourselves -- am i straight? gay? bi? not sexual at all? something else? sexual identity is how we think about our self in terms of what our sexual orientation means. since it entails us making sense of the world and ourselves, it is highly dependent on culture. for example, in our modern culture, there are categories ""straight"" and ""gay"" which don't just describe who we are attracted to. they refer to the cultural categories of *types of people*. if you go back a few hundred years, there was really no such thing as ""heterosexual"" or ""homosexual"" people -- everyone was presumed heterosexual, and people whose urges and behaviors caused them to engage in same-sex sex were sodomites or sinners or deviants of some sort.  but that gets me to behaviors. regardless of who you are attracted to, and how you identify yourself (""i am attracted to people of the same sex as me. that makes me a terrible sinner in god's eyes!"" -- or -- ""i am attracted to people of a different sex than me. that makes me a heterosexual person.""), there is also the behavioral component. what kind of sex acts do you actually engage in? it may seem surprising, but throughout history, marriage wasn't really about love or sexual fulfillment. it was about reproduction of family structures. so way back in the day, , a person might have had strong (biologically-based) sexual urges toward other people of the same sex. but they were still married and had sex with their opposite-sex partners and produced offspring.  even today, behaviors are not always consistent with identity and orientation. for example, there are actually a lot of ""straight"" men (identity) who are attracted to women (orientation) who nonetheless engage in what is colloquially known as msm behavior (men who have sex with men). this sometimes happens in environments where men are sequestered from women (military, prison, priesthood).   similarly, lots of men identify as ""straight"" but are actually attracted to other men (homosexual orientation) even though their sexual behaviors are exclusively with women. for example, men who are married their whole lives with children and a family and never stray from their wives, but nonetheless in their old age come out as ""gay."" what's that all about? i actually spoke to someone like this once and he told me that he liked to watch straight porn and fantasize that he was the woman in the scene; and he would then take this fantasy into his own bedroom life while having sex with his wife. seems really inconsistent to me, but who am i to judge, right?  like i said, human sexuality is one of the most complex topics. i would say that there is definitely a biological component to it. but the way that biology plays out into actual behavior is definitely mediated by society and there's no way to avoid that. similarly, culture plays a huge role in taking these biological impulses and socially-acceptable sexual practices and putting those all together into a set of sexual identities that help us to make sense out of who we are. but those aren't ""biologically determined"" since after anthropologists have discovered many alternative sexual identities that we don't have in the west.   hope this answer is helpful, although i can see how this type of complication can be extremely unhelpful if you're looking for a ""general consensus"" answer to your question!",1,

[here's a celibate gay christian on the label](http://spiritualfriendship.org/2013/02/01/once-more-on-the-label-gay-christian/):   &gt;“gay” in current parlance doesn’t necessarily refer to sexual behavior; it can just as easily refer to one’s sexual orientation and say nothing, one way or the other, about how one is choosing to express that orientation. so, whereas “stealing christian” certainly denotes the behavior of stealing, “gay christian” may simply refer to the erotic inclinations of the christian who claims that identity and leave open the question of whether he or she is sexually active with members of his or her own sex. ...  &gt;this brings me to a second response to the question, “have you given up hope?” on the contrary, calling oneself a “celibate gay christian” may be a way of expressing, not giving up, hope—but expressing it in a way that doesn’t link that hope to orientation change. claiming the label “celibate gay christian” means, for me, recognizing my homosexual orientation as a kind of “thorn in the flesh.” when the apostle paul used that phrase in his correspondence with the corinthian church, he made clear that his “thorn” was indeed an unwelcome source of pain (2 corinthians 12:7).   being *straight* doesn't make you any less likely to be proclivative to sexual sin than being *gay* does-- even from a conservative christian sexual ethic. ---  theologian stephen r. holmes has made this point beautifully in [""queer hippo: musings on human sexuality""](http://steverholmes.org.uk/blog/?p=593) where he says:  &gt;this is important: too much **conservative christian ethics concerning human sexuality assumes that there is a norm – heterosexual monogamy – that is accessible and livable by the generality of people. the scriptures deny this straightforwardly, of course (‘if it is like that, it is better not to marry!’ – mt. 19:10)**, but conservative christian commentators are not, unfortunately, always very interested in what the scriptures actually say. and **too much liberal christian ethics concerning human sexuality assumes that there are a certain limited number of norms – including faithful and exclusive gay and lesbian relationships – that between them are accessible and livable by the generality of people. the scriptures deny this straightforwardly, of course**, but liberal christian commentators are not, unfortunately, always very interested in what the scriptures actually say.  &gt;as augustine taught clearly, echoing the scriptures, and the almost-united witness of the christian tradition, any sexual discipline – including heterosexual monogamy – is a practice of ascesis, which calls those who embrace it to deny and redirect their desires in order to conform them to the gospel. heterosexual monogamy, like celibacy, is not normal or easy for anyone; it is an accepted discipline that requires the constant and rigorous disciplining and denial of personal desires to be lived out even remotely adequately. any adequately christian form of gay or lesbian relationship would not be normal or easy for anyone either; it too would be an accepted discipline that requires the constant and rigorous disciplining and denial of personal desires to be lived out even remotely adequately.  &gt;is heterosexual monogamy normal? no. augustine and foucault can agree on that. are faithful and committed gay and lesbian relationships normal? no. augustine and foucault can agree on that also. in hippo, nothing is normal, and everything is queer.  does everyone have the same challenges? ---  no.  should christians have ultimate allegiance in christ? ---  yes.  does that mean descriptive parts of my identity cannot be used? ---  no.  when people *mention* they're gay, it's considered something different from the norm as specifically bent toward sin. they're not-- not anymore than straight folk. it's just *seems* like a specially pronounced ""identity"" because it is not assumed.  folks assume you're straight (as well as nearly everyone) and so those proclivities to straight sexual sin are easier to gloss over.  i'm interning for the summer. i'm a queer christian working at a church. and i'm more conservative than my boss on sexuality. i don't believe the church should bless it. the wife of the pastor, who is hosting me, asked me on a car ride ""so do you have a girlfriend?"" *assuming,* as many people do, that i'm straight.   then, when i honestly answered no, she said, ""oh we'll have to fix that"" in a friendly southern drawl, and laughed.  am i angry about this? no.   i didn't say ""i'm not straight and not really sure about the whole 'dating women thing.' sorry"" because i don't know her well enough and didn't want to have that conversation. also, part of me knows it may be viewed negatively with my job by some in the church (even if she would've been fine). it may even have been seen as ""making my identity about my sexuality""--**just like you fear**.   was it? no. no it isn't. it just *seems* that way because of our assumptions culturally.  christians of all types of sexuality will feel much more in the same boat once this cultural trend starts to change. they will recognize we all have different struggles, sexual and otherwise, and are all oriented ""queerly"" -- god's call is not natural for us in a fallen world and that includes the most ""straight as an arrow"" good ole' boy and the most ""pure"" southern belle.   we're all sinners in need of healing and saving grace who will not ultimately be changed the way we should until the resurrection. until them, we try to lay down our passions and conform them to the will of christ through discipleship.",1,

648784,"&gt; asheron's call  i was looking for this. i played ac back in the early 2000s. if i remember right, it was the ""platinum scarab glitch"" that was at fault for wrecking ac's currency, the pyreal. a patch introduced a bug in the game that allowed players to purchase platinum scarabs (an important component in spellcasting, which pretty much everyone did), for next to nothing and then sell them back to vendors for massive profit. this mimicked printing tons of money, and it destroyed the currency. the devs fixed the bug but didn't rollback the servers, so all that ill-gotten money was still floating around.  it's probably important to note that mmos are a little different from real life economies in that you can kill monsters and basically create money (looting them and selling to npcs). so, in order to avoid inflation the game developers have to find ways to suck that money back out of the players' hands. unlike wow (which has a lot of these things, e.g. pay an npc 10,000 gold for something), ac didn't really have this mechanism. pyreals circulated between players for years without exiting the economy.   when i quit years later, the pyreal was still almost worthless. the closest thing ac had to currency at that time was bags of salvage (again, something everyone used). scarabs were still valuable as well, but a large portion of ac was a barter economy - trade me your set of chainmail leggings and i'll trade you this helmet, etc. nothing was nearly as good of a value storeholder as, say, the usd.",0,

[in your words: being a gay teenager in ireland](http://www.thejournal.ie/wp-admin/post.php?post=1323781&amp;amp;action=edit) [in your words: being a gay teacher in ireland](http://www.thejournal.ie/gay-teachers-homophobia-1319137-feb2014/)  here, we look at the historic and current experiences of men and women across the island. there were some theme running through many of the stories, such as those who have not been subject to violent discrimination describing themselves as 'lucky' and the power of subtle homophobia.  the majority also stressed that their daily struggles with homophobia would be eased if the state recognised their individual choices in law by allowing for same-sex marriage.  ## sam  ""my main experience of homophobic assault was after i came out. around four years ago, i was in rick's burger at the end of george's street. i was with a friend and we were chatting to a guy with his girlfriend. somehow the topic of being gay came up. at this point, i had no fear of people knowing i was gay. the guy was interested to know what it was all about. he seemed intriguted.  after around ten minutes, without any form of provocation, a guy -- a friend of the other man -- came over and punched me in the side of the head. he said, ""stop spreading your gay shit around."" i was stunned. actually everyone in the café was stunned. i didn't react. i was in shock. his friend apologised and said he didn't mean this to happen. they left shortly afterwards.""  ## keith  &gt;   i never experienced it physically. although when young and insecure, i was painfully aware of how name calling and physical abuse would be used on others who had behaviours based on stereotypes. when closeted, my family and friends spoke negatively of and made fun of homosexuals. this really hurt and delayed my coming out. when i did come out, i was informed by many that i couldn't be gay because i didn't act like 'them'!  i grew up in a working class area and somehow a relationship developed with my best mate and later love of my life. he was a very talented footballer and very masculine, like myself. we both worked as apprentices in the building trade. he couldn't handle the negative stereotypes and society judging him and looking down upon him for being gay. eventually, he had enough of all that and hung himself. his 12-year-old brother found his body.     ## pat o'donnell  as a gay man in his 40s, this is the homophobia i have faced in my life. in no particular order:   name calling and physical attack in a catholic-run school while the principal ignored my complaints and told me to act more like a man; having a friend punched in the face and his nose broken when set upon by thugs shouting 'fucking faggot' outside a local chipper; having my nephew being told in school by a priest that homosexuality was wrong and he should pray for me; having my sexuality as a topic of discussion in the workplace; having people assume i like shipping and fashion as i am gay; being dropped from my local gaa team when i came out; being told gay people are not suitable for sport; being told i do not appear 'very gay'; not being allowed to see a sick partner after an accident in a catholic-run hospital as i was not next of kin (the family had to approve first); being told that my career prospects would be damaged by being out as gay; people linking homosexuality with paedophilia in my presence; having media articles discussing how to make me a lesser citizen of ireland; being told i am lucky to live in a society that allows homosexuality; being put at the 'gay' table at weddings; being asked how i know for certain i am gay if i have not been with a woman; not being able to donate blood despite having full health checks; being asked to stop coaching kids in gaa after i came out; having females say, 'i want a gay best friend' or 'i feel safe with you'; being stopped going into a normal bar by bouncers saying, 'you guys should go to your own places'; being asked always if i really booked a double room; being asked if i thought about getting a cure.  ## maria   [image](http://f3.thejournal.ie/media/2014/02/vote-for-same-sex-marriages-in-ireland-3-630x419.jpg)   image: maria and her partner denise outside the gaiety in 2012.   ""the worst experience for me is that we have pretty much stopped going out in my home town as a couple. why?  the evening always starts wonderfully. a few pints; friendly, chatty conversations with other locals and so on. but as the night continues (and people have more to drink), it will inevitably end in one or several of the following ways:   but are you really lesbians? bet you have never had a real man? let me buy you some shots! come outside with me (on your own) someone starts touching me or my girlfriend inappropriately ah ye fucking dykes/faggots/whores when you turn a young male down.  i am not making this stuff up, many a great night has ended with frustration, anger, sadness that it has to turn out this way, conversation nearly always eventually turns to our sexuality, our relationship and some people get very personal, very rude and ask very intimate questions that certainly i was never asked as a 'straight' person. they feel they can take liberties, maybe touch us up, cop a feel and be able to shrug it off.  thankfully, of course, it is certainly not all bad and i do think ireland is changing, as a parent, as a neighbour, as an employee i can honestly say i have never experienced any negative experiences to my face, i know some people talk behind our backs but sure you get that in small towns anyway.  my seven-year-old was playing with his lego last week and the queen was getting married to the blue ninja. in attendance at this lego wedding were the black and red ninja who were, according to my 'lil man, 'a gay couple and in love'. i love that kids can be so accepting, so why can't the rest of us follow their example.  ## anonymous  &gt;   my experience could probably be described as more than just homophobia. from the years 2000 to 2002, aged 18 to 20, i attended 'pray away the gay' counselling in dublin.  looking back, i was quite distressed at the time and voluntarily sought it out. i was suffering from a lot of uncertainty, anxiety, guilt and shame around my sexual orientation. i felt damned. i was desperate not to be gay. this avenue offered me a way out.  i approached a local catholic priest who suggested i go and see a therapist. i refused to go see someone who would just tell me to accept my sexuality. eventually, through the priest, i got in touch with a christian counsellor linked to an evangelical protestant church in the locality.  there, very vulnerable and still at a young age, i was exposed to dangerous and twisted ideas that were imported straight from the 'ex-gay' or reparative therapy movement in the us -- which is still support by much of the fundamentalist christian right over there. it's hard to believe this was in the dublin area, in the early years of this century. during the celtic tiger.  needless to say, i didn't manage (thankfully!) to change my sexual orientation. today, i'm a happy out and proud gay man, though still somewhat scarred by that experience, which was deeply rooted in homophobia and ignorance. i hope this stuff is not still going on in ireland.     ## anonymous  ""my story, i feel, will be from a different vantage point to most others who will contribute to this article. i observe and absorb the mistreatment of the lgbt community from the relatively safe purgatory of the closet. i have not yet been able to rise from the ashes like the soaring phoenix. instead, i am lying in wait for that opportune moment when i can finally shed the shackles of my own oppressive silence.  although i am not 'out', that is not to say i have not endured my share of homophobia. from the beginning of puberty and the commencement of sexual awareness, i have known that i was, am and shall always be gay. however, many of my peers seemed to catch on to this fact simultaneously. they had decided my sexuality before i was fully able to come to terms with it myself. from that point on, i felt my sexual orientation was under a magnifying glass.  most had decided i was gay, yet i had been deprived of my coming out moment and the se  ----------------------------------- *posted by a bot because thejournal.ie pushes an android app on mobile users.*",1,1

691734,"&gt;really? you sure you want to go there? ok let's do, i can show you the difference between a african americans genome and a caucasians, i can show you the difference between a woman and a mans genome.  no one suggested you couldn't.  but am i intolerant if say that mistreating mentally disabled persons is bigotry?  what of the elderly?  neither of these are genomic origin.  they just are as they are, whether by time,  injury, or in some cases i'll admit genetic defects as the cause which can be classified.  however,  none of this matters...  &gt; can you show me the difference on a physical level between a gay and a straight?~~no~~[yes]? i didn't think so. reason is, that it is a choice!! you wanna bang a guy and be a guy?  so your premise here is that racial differences are genetic and you're suggesting that homosexuality is a choice? i'm sorry, regardless of what your ignorant parents or whomever taught you wrong say, that's not the case.  no more than you've chosen to be attracted to women.  in fact their are neurological differences in the processing of visual stimuli between heterosexual and homosexuals ([1](http://postcog.ucd.ie/files/1890.pdf)).  at what point in your life did you sit down and say i'm going to choose to be attracted to women and not men.   chances are if you did that, because you have an underlying attraction to men that you're disregarding to permit the idea of making a choice, well,  you're gay.  i didn't make a choice to be straight, i'm attracted to women,  there is nothing i could do or attempt that would make me be attracted to men.  i simply cannot contemplate the male form as being attractive in any physically or emotionally arousing manner.  that's because, that is how it's always been since i was conceived.   homosexuals differ, only in that their idea of attraction is to that of the same gender,  the idea of being with a woman,  is about as appetizing as you attempting to force yourself to be attracted to men.  there are many different shades to this non-binary gradient however.  some people find both equally attractive,  some may find both genders sexually arousing while feeling the emotional attraction to but one.  you'll also find that their are structural differences in the brain of homosexuals that are similar to those in the opposite gender ([2](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080617151845.htm)).  this shouldn't be much of a surprise to anyone realizing that our brain in all its glory,  is built for us by the mix of genetic material from our parents and that, aside from substance abuse or serious traumas, there is little we can do to change the formative guide of genetics on our brain.  homosexuals are homosexual because heterosexuals are heterosexual.     if you like,  you can easily take it upon yourself to prove to me that it is a choice to be homosexual.   for one hour, become homosexual, actually find yourself attracted to other men,  show me that this choice is one that we are free to make as people and not built into our brains.   here's a hint for ya,  you won't be able to do it (unless you really are gay and just denying it).   the world species do not rely on choice to procreate, they do so because millions of years have set the attraction of opposite genders as the primary sexual preference (but not the only) ([3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_mammals_displaying_homosexual_behavior) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_birds_displaying_homosexual_behavior).   so yeah.  it's not choice. think what you will,  but you're wrong unless you understand that.   &gt; i can choose to do a lot of things but i can't claim "" oh it's how i'm made"" you and people like you are an abomination. i don't go around flaunting my sexuality but gays and dykes do. it's not fair treatment it's you guys trying to shove your beliefs down our throats.   you can choose a lot of things, yeah?  did you choose to be heterosexual?  i really would love to hear this....  and i'm an abomination?  me and my type?  what...heterosexuals who fully support the rights of other humans as i myself am granted? if that's an abomination, let it be so.   as a heterosexual, i was made this way,  i did not choose to be heterosexual.  i assure you that.   no one is shoving ""their"" beliefs down anyone's throats.   the reason it is such a loud roar is that they're actively being oppressed and mistreated by the system in place.  it is not your opinion to disallow homosexuals to marry,  it is a law that goes against all common sense. you make excuse after excuse,  but the reality is, you are a bigot.   &gt; i don't go around flaunting my sexuality but gays and dykes do.   do you hold your girlfriend's hand in public?  ever kissed her goodbye?  ever told her you loved her in front of other people?  when you marry, will it be a grandiose wedding with a grand number in attendance lauding your marriage?  this is no different from what homosexual couples would do.  that's hardly flaunting,  it's quite the same as what we as heterosexual couples do.   &gt;it's not fair treatment it's you guys trying to shove your beliefs down our throats. than to claim that i'm not tolerant, you're right i am not tolerant of gays, trannys, bisexuals or lesbians.  not fair treatment?  what beliefs?  it is not a belief that every human should be afforded the same rights as any other regardless of which class they represent,  whether racial, sexual orientation,  hair color, or otherwise.   i full and well claim you're intolerant,  but the better word is bigot, no better than those white power monkeys who run around with the flag of ihren führer von lues draped over their shoulder.  intolerance,  ignorance,  bigotry,  whatever name you call it, you're fulfilling the role.   &gt;you think you are impervious to any claim against your beliefs. i am here to tell you, you aren't. i am drawing a line in the sand and saying these actions are an atrocity to mankind. i am so tired of you guys wanting to make a wrong decisions than skew the line of good and bad, to justify your actions.   that line you've drawn with your ignorance, no one gives a shit.  you'll lose this effort against the rights of those who are your equal (i know you don't like to consider homosexuals your equal,  but too damn bad buddy).   what you do is bad. regardless of how you wish to frame it.  you use false and unsupported ""facts"" to, as you said,  skew your own view of things so it seems logical,  even in the face of the illogical nature of itself.  you're pathetic, weak minded,  and you are the real atrocity against human kind,  masquerading as a civilized person, you're nothing of relevance, nor are your ideals.   &gt;why should we be tolerant if this? i bet you are pro choice too right? drive a prius or subaru, dress in fancy clothes and have never taken a step back to look at this for what it is, a grotesque action that we shouldn't tolerate. you and yours should just crawl back into the hole you came from and stay there.  i drive a suzuki, actually.  you're also right,  i'm very much pro-choice.  women should have the right to choose what they do with their bodies,  not you, not others.  it is their own right.  yet, you wish to take away this choice,  while suggesting at the same time the false choice of homosexuality.  i think you're lost as to what choice means and to whom it applies.  but that's not unexpected,  you don't seem all to bright.  as for my clothes,  they're fairly nice.  mostly tees and jeans.  i do have a rather large amount of saints branded shirts though,  i consider them fancy.     as for the hole i came out,  it's the whole world.  you're the minority here,  the last of the ignorant bigots who will finally have to come to terms with the fact that your grotesque violations of others civil rights will be no more.     &gt;p.s what we did to the african americans was wrong but i bet you don't feel as strongly about that as i do.  i don't know.  i'd feel strongly about it were it actively happening,  though at this point i consider it a lesson learned by society that civil rights are for all persons, regardless of any label or class granted.  my adopted brother is rather black,  i don't really think of that much though,  he's just my brother and has been for 25 of my 34 years.  if it was something we had to contend with daily,  i'd be standing to let him have my seat on the bus,  and do what i could to help them, no less than i would for the rights of homosexuals to be treated just as everyone else is.  i'd not say i'm racist, i have no concerns about others or their genetic heritage, they're just people.    as for you being black and that meaning fuck all to this discussion,  it doesn't.  you're still a bigot.  it' gives an even brighter shine to your ignorance since, given what african-americans and other blacks around the world have had to go through,  that you aren't sympathetic to the plight of underrepresented and mistreated people.  p.s. supporting links are found with the numbers next to the relevant statement.   also,  you're an intolerant bigot, a horrible example of a the worst of society.  want real piece to ruffle your feathers?

[this one](http://pamshouseblend.firedoglake.com/2013/04/12/tony-perkins-accidentally-proves-that-the-family-research-council-is-a-hate-group-2/) is great, because of the following quote, by the president of the frc, mr. perkins himself:  &gt;50% of suicides can be attributed to homosexuals.  &gt;about 50% of the women on death row are lesbians.  &gt;there is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, known as the north american man and boy love association (nambla). this is a child molesting homosexual group whose cry is “sex before 8 before it’s too late.” this group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades across the united states.  &gt;many homosexuals admit that they are pedophiles: “the love between men and boys is at the foundation of homosexuality.”  &gt;homosexuals live unhealthy lifestyles, and have historically accounted for the bulk of syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis b, the “gay bowel syndrome” (which attacks the intestinal tract), tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus.  &gt;homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident.  this is absolute, pure, and utter bullshit. the guy is not only pulling statistics out of thin air, he's also right out inventing crazy shit on the stop. nambla for example has pretty much disbanded and is being [rejected](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_american_man/boy_love_association#relations_with_lgbt_organizations) by the lgbtq groups by and large, and that was 30 years ago.   now imagine someone saying the same thing about blacks or jews, and try and tell me it's not hate speech.  &gt;no i am a heartless libertarian. all i care is that they have the same freedoms that everyone else does,   the thing is, they *don't* have the same rights as heterosexual people, through many different states.   &gt;how they are treated by others is not of my concern. i don't treat them that way.  very christian of you.  &gt;there is always an xyz, it's a bs redundancy.   that there is an xyz is a redundancy, that you commit a crime explicitly *because* of xyz is quite another. a man gets killed during a random shootout is not the same thing as shooters specifically targeting dark-skinned people. i honestly don't understand why you are having trouble with this. do you deny that people who have been beaten *because they were gay*, would not have been beaten if they had been straight?  &gt;no i still would call it bs. in the 1850s america was very anti-catholic, there was even an anti-catholic political party the nativist or know nothing party. they committed propaganda against catholics in the same manner you are accusing the frc of doing the same today with the lbgts. i would still call it ignorant propaganda, not hate crimes.  it's not ignorant when you have been informed that you are misrepresenting the facts, it becomes hate speech when you know you are not telling the truth, when you know you are distorting facts, when you know you are lying through your teeth, but you keep doing it anyways year after year after year. that's not ignorance, that's deliberate hate speech.  i'm truly sorry to hear about the american anti-catholic attitude. while the insults and insinuations are different between anti-catholicism and anti-lgbtq sentiments (duh), i don't understand why you would think it ok to have people incite hatred, which in turn increases violent acts, against catholics of the time.  &gt;being fired from your job for being gay is discriminatory but it is not a hate crime.  you are entirely right, firing someone is far from a criminal offence. it is discriminatory, we both agree on that, and would we also agree that hate speech spewed by the frc does nothing to reduce, and in fact increases, such instances of discrimination, and that discrimination is a bad thing?  &gt;show me where someone was convicted of a ""hate crime"" and they said the frc incited them to do so?

[this one is also pretty good](http://www.truthwinsout.org/pressrelease/2012/08/28265/) if you look at the bottom of the page.  unless you have some guy commit a crime, actually get caught, then publicly admit that the frc incited him to do it, you're not really going to be able to demonstrate any kind of link between the two. what you *can* demonstrate, is an increase in hate towards a minority will also increase violent actions towards that minority. and really, what else can it be but hate when you say things like gays being brutal murderers responsible for spreading disease and raping children?  &gt;but you are are hate group then even if there is only one in your group. it could be said you are indicting hatred towards christianity.  the difference being that i'm not saying anything against christians, i am explaining that i have issues with theology. in this particular case, i couldn't care less that the frc were christian, muslim, hindu, or atheist, their hate speech against lgbtq people (distorting facts, making stuff up, deliberately lying, etc) is more than enough to show that they are worthy only of contempt and to be pushed to the fringes of society.",1,

560070,"&gt;not exactly the way you think you are. you use circular reasoning to validate scripture with itself. you try to validate a passage with that very passage, which holds no more support than something anybody would write saying that god said something. the gospels are the only stories that corroborate each other.  the gospels are no different in that respect - you are using them (the bible) to validate itself. the bible does prove itself to be accurate throughout the scriptures not just the gospels so i'm pretty sure you are using a poor understanding of scripture.    - it is not circular to use matthew to prove genesis (matthew 19:3–6, cf. genesis 1:27, 2:24), paul to prove luke (1 timothy 5:18, cf. luke 10:7) or peter to prove paul (2 peter 3:15–16).   - it is also not circular to use jesus’ clear statements to prove the bible. his statements such as, ‘scripture cannot be broken’ (john 10:35) and the repeated ‘it is written … ’ show that for jesus, what scripture said is what god said. indeed, jesus defended many of the doctrines that skeptics love to scoff at (see quote below). even without accepting scripture as the authority, many liberal theologians believe that there is overwhelming historical evidence that christ affirmed biblical inerrancy, although they disagree with him. yet jesus proved his credentials beyond doubt by rising from the dead (cf. acts 17:31). this independent historical evidence breaks the circle.   ------------------------------------------------  jesus affirmed the reality (historicity) of the following people and events, the targets of your skeptical and inaccurate comments:  -    matthew 19:3–6, mark 10:5–9—god created adam and eve as the first man and woman, ‘from the beginning of creation’, and this was the basis for marriage.  -    luke 11:51—abel.  -    matthew 24:37–39—noah and the flood (luke 17:26–27).  -   john 8:56–58—abraham.  -   matthew 10:15; 11:23–24 (luke 10:12)—sodom and gomorrah.  -   luke 17:28–32—lot (and wife!).  -    matthew 8:11—abraham, isaac and jacob (luke 13:28).   -   john 6:31, 49, 58—manna from heaven.  -   john 3:14—moses and the bronze serpent.  -   matthew 12:39–41—jonah and the great sea creature (vs. 42—queen of sheba).  -   luke 16:31 and john 5:46–47—moses as inspired author of the pentateuch.  -   matthew 24:15—daniel the prophet as author of the book of daniel (citing daniel 9:27).     ------------------------------------------------  honestly you don't understand what you are saying and are only causing more confusion when you conveniently throw out books of the bible because you don't understand them.   &gt;we have therapies and stuff for people that have mental issues that don't let them feel things. regardless, we couldn't just let someone murder, but homosexuality doesn't harm anyone, so this entire thing is moot.  since you equate the actions of those ""mental issues"" to homosexuality, maybe homosexuality is a mental issue itself or a genetic flaw either way it's your own personal opinion that homosexuality harms no one. in defining words, context determines the meaning. likewise, the context of homosexual acts is equally important. the pro-homosexual community wants to separate the act from the deleterious effects. it is like saying that the behavior of jumping doesn't harm anyone. well, that depends. jumping in your living room shouldn't harm you, but jumping near the edge of a cliff can.   behaviors always have contexts and homosexual activity is in the context of 1) a redefinition of sexual morals, and 2) its accompanying promiscuity. when you redefine sexual morals in a far more loose manner, consequences follow - such as an increase in promiscuity and disease.  2% of u.s. population is gay yet it accounts for 61% of hiv infection:  ""men who have sex with men remain the group most heavily affected by new hiv infections. while cdc estimates that msm represent only 2 percent of the u.s. population, they accounted for the majority (61 percent; 29,300) of all new hiv infections in 2009. young msm (ages 13 to 29) were most severely affected, representing more than one quarter of all new hiv infections nationally (27 percent; 12,900 in 2009).""  (center for disease control, cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/hivincidencepressrelease.html)   ""in their study of the sexual profiles of 2,583 older homosexuals published in journal of sex research, paul van de ven et al. found that ""the modal range for number of sexual partners ever [of homosexuals] was 101–500."" in addition, 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent had between 501 and 1000 partners. a further 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent reported having had more than 1000 lifetime sexual partners. paul van de ven et al., ""a comparative demographic and sexual profile of older homosexually active men,"" journal of sex research 34 (1997): 354."" (see more statistics on promiscuity at http://www.carm.org/statistics-homosexual-promiscuity)  homosexuality and reduced lifespan is also something else you might want to take a look at, it goes counter to your personal beliefs on that subject.   if homosexual sexuality does not harm anyone, then why are the statistics for homosexual aids percentages so much higher than the heterosexual population? again, there is a connection between the redefinition of sexual morals, the increase of promiscuity due to that redefinition, and the proliferation of disease due to the promiscuous behavior. as i said earlier, actions always have contexts. why would reality ever be a mute point?  &gt;jesus never told us to read anything, actually. we chose what to put in there after and decided it was good to read it.   considering the bible is a repository of jesus' words the need to read the bible should be obvious. actually since jesus is the word of god ""logos"" who created both ot and greek scriptures,   jesus said (in the gospels) that taking in the knowledge of god meant everlasting life he obviously approved of the ot because he used them to teach yet you know better... and somwhow this makes homosexuality acceptable?   taking in the knowledge - today there's only one way to do that..read the bible.   &gt;i never said it was genetic. i said it wasn't a choice. i believe it comes from something with the paternal figure in life, but that doesn't make it a choice. environmental things still affect personality permanently. gay people do not choose and they would be very angry at you to hear this stuff.  gay people do choose and there are ex-gays that say so, not just i. ""the paternal figure in life?"" does this apply to pedophiles, those that might choose small farm animals      homosexuality isn't treated any differently then say, adultery is, they are not looked down on nor should they be hated or abused, but like all category of sinning or sinners, it's those ""practicing sin"" that we are not to associate with. if you want to get married to someone of the same sex no christian has the right to stop you as long as caesars laws permit - that doesn't override laws that god has put into place. we don't judge it but we can see where it leads when talking about having a good or any relationship with god. if you are intentionally disobedient there is no relationship you can have with god.   what religion are you practicing again (serious question)?",1,

665228,"&gt; providing a basic plan for understanding this entire discussion of homosexuality is the theology of creation we find in genesis  okay, let's just take the entire genesis creation story into account here for a second. the argument that genesis contradicts same-sex relationships is logically invalid and unstable, for several reasons.  1. it is a logical fallacy in which one attempts to argue that because god provides one certain circumstance as the ""ideal union,"" everything else is wrong or sinful. in genesis, god joins a man and a woman in the first holy marriage. these two people had never met before, had never had sex, and had never experienced other human beings before. the whole argument here that you use is that because god has illustrated the ideal marriage for us (one that does not include homosexuality), all others are invalid or wrong. so, in the case of genesis, based on what you have said and used as evidence for your argument, we can safely assume that because god has shown us the perfect union, all others are wrong. you're right, it does include homosexuality, because adam and eve were not a gay couple. but let's take it further than just sexual orientation: because of the story of adam and eve, i believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, both of whom never have formed romantic attractions with other people before. because of the story of adam and eve, i find relationships between people of different races to be contrary to god's natural order and design. because of the story of adam and eve, i find relationships between two elderly people to be morally depraved and disordered. because of the story of adam and eve, i find relationships involving a woman who has not been made out of the rib of her fiancé to be of grave error and contrary to god's plan for humanity!        ...        do you see how horrible this argument is, logically?  2. it is not valid because god said that this partner he made for adam was suitable for *him.* in 2 genesis 18, it reads: the lord god said, “it is not good for the man to be alone. i will make a helper suitable for him.” so, if you argue that adam and eve is the depiction of all ideal relationships - that perfect, natural, wholesome, man-on-woman relationship - you run into some problems if given 2 genesis 18.   &gt; thus, in genesis 19:1-11, the deterioration due to sin continues in the story of the men of sodom. there can be no doubt of the moral judgement made there against homosexual relations.  well, actually, there's lots of doubt for that. ezekiel 16:49-50 actually tells us what sins sodom and gomorrah committed: 'now this was the sin of your sister sodom: she and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. they were haughty and did detestable things before me. therefore i did away with them as you have seen.'   &gt; in leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, in the course of describing the conditions necessary for belonging to the chosen people, the author excludes from the people of god those who behave in a homosexual fashion.  first of all, it's a good thing i'm not ethnically jewish, because in acts 15, the council of jerusalem agreed in 49 a.d. that gentiles would not be held accountable for jewish laws and customs!  secondly, do you have an objective method of weeding out the leviticus pieces against homosexuality from leviticus as a whole? if so, i'd love to hear it. as i'm sure you're aware, leviticus bans other things, such as failing to include salt in sacrificial offerings, touching unclean animals, pork, shrimp, mixed fabrics, and the most ironic of all: drinking alcohol in places of worship! the bible even describes the prohibition of alcohol in churches and temples as ""a lasting ordinance for the generations to come."" oops!  my point is not merely that there are a whole bunch of other things that leviticus bans that we do not follow today, but also that even if you make a point to say, ""well, we may not stone people or kill people over these things, but the fact that they're prohibited at all means they're bad!"" then we can just apply that to the prohibition of pork, or maybe alcohol in church. so, as you can see, leviticus does not offer any meaningful resistance to same-sex relationships.   &gt; ...in i cor 6:9, he proposes the same doctrine and lists those who behave in a homosexual fashion among those who shall not enter the kingdom of god.  first of all, the original greek word for effeminate is malakoi, which refers to lazy, degenerate, or spineless people, not gay people. the ""homosexual"" part comes from arsenokoitai. the original meaning of this word is pretty much lost, because it's that uncommon in the bible. so, how do we know what it really means? well, we can at least know what it *doesn't* mean - john chrysostom and clement of alexandria, christian theologians who wrote about homosexuality, never use this word when they discuss homosexuality; only when quoting this particular passage from corinthians. this suggests that the word did not refer to homosexuality. so, why not choose a word that explicitly means ""same-sex relations,"" not just some obscure word that's too challenging to translate? perhaps arsenokoitai meant male-male *domination* or rape, as naas did to adam. another way to take it is to mean a cross between male prostitution and thievery, as perhaps suggested by corinthians, or maybe a cross between fornication and slave traders in 1 timothy 1:10? rather than condemning monogamous, consensual same-sex relationships, paul condemns only lust-related same-sex behaviors. do we even know that he condemned them at least not just because they were not of clean heart, but also because they were both men? of course not.    &gt; in romans 1:18-32, still building on the moral traditions of his forebears, but in the new context of the confrontation between christianity and the pagan society of his day, paul uses homosexual behaviour as an example of the blindness which has overcome humankind.  exactly. just because paul uses instances of homosexual behavior to *reinforce* the idea of changing from nature to un-nature, as the idolaters did when they rejected god, does that mean he is condemning homosexuality? no. it's vague, in this regard. we know that, at least, he is very clear in condemning rejection of nature for the unnatural - and we do know that for straight people, homosexuality is unnatural! and we also know that for gay people, heterosexuality is unnatural! this is consistent with the view that we must embrace what is natural for ourselves, something that paul may not have intended. but hey, it's an interpretation, and do we know that paul intended for homosexuality to be condemned in his writing? no.   &gt; in addition to scripture we have tradition, natural law, and moral theology all of which provide further evidence of the sinful nature of homosexual acts.  all of which are based on *scripture*, of which there is a grave lack in regards to same-sex monogamous relationships. i have demonstrated how scripture does not condemn loving, monogamous, and consensual same-sex relationships.  &gt; a person who thinks homosexual acts are not sinful has issues of scholarship and authority. scholarship in the context of poor exegesis of scripture, ignorance of natural law, and a lack of understanding in the area of moral theology. authority, in the fact that all the faithful are to give religious assent to the church on matters of faith and morals (lumen gentium 25) and the failure to recognize the authority of god.  and a person who thinks modern homosexuality, *as we now understand it*, is prohibited by scripture has problems with logically-following statements and historical context. as i said, scripture-wise, we only have the scraps i dissected earlier to go on, in regards to homosexual relationships.   and anyway, are all catholics required to believe in every single thing the church says or does? no, not really. to say that all catholics are bound to the dogma of the church is to reject personal development of religious beliefs. and why not challenge the church on issues that you don't necessarily agree with? the church has changed many times over the past 2,000 years. to say that it can't be presented with new information, study, and opinion is to not only say that the church is the exact same as it was when it was first conceived, but that the church is in entire agreement - many clergymen and faithful catholics disagree with the church's official position on homosexuality! [a recent poll](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us03082013.pdf) shows that about 54% of american catholics support same-sex marriage, while the same poll shows that 52% of american catholics believe that the church is out-of-touch with the views of catholics in america today. so, really, it's not just that the church is the supreme head of catholics - it's that the *people*, the *laymen*, are the ones who are the driving force of the church. i think what you said also demonstrates an underestimation of who really leads the church.  &gt; they close the sexual act to the gift of life  as i'm sure you have heard, so do the elderly and the infertile.   you quote lots of official-sounding documents on this subject. all of these demonstrate nothing more than opinions or beliefs, not objective fact. i have put popular excerpts of the bible to condemn same-sex relationships up to scrutiny, and have found none of them are relevant to our modern understanding of same-sex relationships, and, in fact, are quite vague. tradition, or the want to uphold legacies, does not justify ignorance of scripture in light of context.  the ""biblical arguments"" used to oppose same-sex relationships are unsatisfying and ignorant to academic analysis of scripture. monogamous and consensual same-sex relationships are not contrary to natural law, disordered, or sinful, in the christian religion. why? because the bible doesn't say they are.",1,

i'm actually asking you. if your answer is norway, then maybe there are some advantages to being in a western democracy with protections for workers and a welfare state.    &gt;there is still a near-universal demand for products and services with robust safety standards and excellent customer service, and there are plenty of companies that provide that today.   no there isn't. do you know how many people buy things made in sweatshops?

they don't. so there is no dent in reputation, there is no boycott, there is no loss of profit. your arguments seem to hinge on the completely false idea that people have perfect access to what companies do all the time, every day, everywhere.   &gt;right, and who wants to buy a product that has killed other people?   i sure don't. can you tell me exactly which ones those are? no? you mean the company didn't tell you it did something unsafe that might have killed someone?   &gt;does the absence of state prevent private regulatory agencies from forming?   no, but it does provide a playing ripe for them to be bribed. you know that already exists right? companies paying for fake ""certification"" from shell companies they form to provide certifications. here's one example of something similar http://venturevillage.eu/safe-harbour-false-claims-europe that took me 10 seconds to look up.  funny thing, companies lie to make themselves look better in order to deceive their clients/customers.   &gt;governments rarely give a shit about their reputation, because they don't need to convince people to give them money.   yes, they do. not money, but stuff. the world is pretty flat. governments trade resources with each other and corporations and cooperate on any number of levels. if i have a shitty reputation no one will trade or cooperate with me. read your game theory and international relations.   &gt;unlike companies, the can just take money from you.  no, they really can't. i mean the state can to a certain extent. but any government running the state knows that there is only certain things they can do, so much money they can take, while in power or else risk either a revolt or being voted out.   moreover, they can only take money from you if you have money. this means they have to have companies in their borders that will hire people. whether or not these companies move here or there *is a function, in part, of the reputation of the country*. if you blow a lot of people up for no reason or spy on companies in your borders, then companies will leave and go someplace else, then your people will have fewer jobs and then you'll have less money. consequences from reputation. just like companies. just like companies it is imperfect. countries get away with things the same way companies get away with things. but this also means countries need to compete for better reputations in order to increase their tax base. this isn't voodoo economics, i'm not just making this up. this is all pretty straightforward international relations/economics stuff.    &gt;businesses are slaves to the demands of the consumer, while individuals and businesses are slaves to the demands of the state.   so all of democracy is a lie? seriously. i want you to tell me if you think every election since the beginning of democracy was a complete fabrication. because if so i can go now because i'm talking to a crazy person and if not then it's pretty obvious who is in control of the state.   &gt;it's also hard to assume that competitors won't try to point out the fact that their competitor's products are harming people more than theirs.  oh, i'm sure they will. and then this company will lie and say the other company is doing the poisoning...etc. until no one knows what to think. since no one knows what to think, they'll just shop wherever and nothing about their actions will regulate the market.   &gt;holy shit, and you assume that governments are these perfect institutions that magically prevent people from harming themselves with evil capitalist products.  not perfect at all. sometimes they do horrible things. i think, on the whole (not your incredibly biased analysis) they've done more good things than bad and are, generally, headed in the direction of more human welfare and rights. i also think roughly the same thing about companies. you, on the other hand have a completely skewed version of states in your head and an idealized, oversimplified picture of how markets work.",0,

(i'd just finished a paper i had to write on that precise topic when i responded to you last time.) as i said, the social pressures that make people want to identify one way or another do not interest me in this case, because there's nothing objective about group identities based on supposedly shared subjectivity (i.e. dubious empathy) which is actually just a reaction to other people's attitudes.  i don't give a shit about pride. it wouldn't exist without unnatural levels of hate; it is not a natural feature of anyone's identity. it is a false god that we will not need forever, but we will *always* need a healthy, realistic view of human sexual needs. and sex research isn't getting us *one inch* closer to that understanding.  again, how can straight men have so many more sexual partners than straight women? what about the fact that so few people these days consider anything *but* penetrative sex to be ""sex""? ([e.g.](http://www2.unb.ca/~byers/projects/randall_&amp;_byers.pdf)) this is simple self-deception on a scale that even the cleverest surveys and interviews cannot account for or even grasp. (indeed, the family guy ""ear sex"" episode is so true to life that it should give any sexologist an anxiety disorder.)  you have no idea how vastly you underestimate people's capacity to lie *to themselves* about anything that doesn't fit with their self-identities. i know this because i'm a human being capable of self-reflection and know that i myself do it all the time. you pretend to have a sophisticated view of *my* memories (calling them pseudo-memories, which might be nice to know since i had anxiety attacks over them throughout my adolescence and still can't speak to some of my childhood friends), yet you think that memories are any more reliable among large groups of people? how does this bit of psycho-social alchemy work, precisely? because you believe in the ""science of sensitivity""? sorry, i believe in the science of reality.  you honestly think all this bad science is helping to normalize anything? you think it helps anyone but the status quo? honey, no, it's ""safe"" sex research; politically expedient intellectual dishonesty designed to assure conservatives that everyone won't suddenly become gay if homosexuality comes to be seen as every bit as normal as heterosexuality (which it is throughout the animal kingdom—funny that we should be so inexplicably different). i highly doubt that the ""scientists"" doing it are truly as psychologically naïve as they let on. they know what sorts of questions to ask in order to avoid overturning paradigms that are comforting to abrahamic sensibilities. (oh, no, there are no bisexuals, go back to sleep. don't worry, you can't be gay if you're not a flaming queen. no, removing social stigmas will by no means vastly affect how people identify.) but it's short-sighted in the extreme, and in the meantime we have everyone assuming it's ""perfectly natural"" that gays should have a pathetically small (not to mention simply pathetic) pool of potential partners compared to the ""normals"".  we have ""scientists"" saying this in the pages of scientific american mind today, and it's no different than what they said in the 60s. (""note how albert delicately pats his hair, and adjusts his collar. his movements are **not characteristic of a real boy**."") i should be content with having an order of magnitude fewer options than most others; and *how dare i* complain if most of them are not my type because they're too feminine. clearly i haven't tried hard enough to be sexually attracted to fashionistas who want desperately to keep their emaciated 15-year-old bodies and have nothing in common with me. so i do not deny that these stereotypes are ""real"", but they *are* self-fulfilling prophecies nearly a century in the making.  we *do* need anecdotes, intuitive reasoning, purely ethical arguments for treating people considerately and not with arbitrary cruelty. these are the things that are real to people, and that's good sense: nothing that's real to the individual exists on the scope which social scientists study; it exists only on the level of individual, interpersonal interactions, and is *corrupted* through our current understanding of social organizations. it's just *stupid* to think that we can rely on ""data"" to teach us our ethical responsibilities towards others, and that is how we have started using sex research. it won't give you what you want in the long run; mark my words: if you think you can break harmful stereotypes with all these studies, you will be sorely disappointed and succeed only in keeping the stereotypes around for longer than they otherwise would have been. this is just one reason we need, at the very least, a massive downsizing in social research.  in short, it is short-sighted in the extreme to use the temporary political climate justify research that falsely alleges to discover fixed truths about human nature. it's more harmful than homophobia, or biphobia, or transphobia. it frustrates the principle of impartiality (absolutely required in all sound ethical systems), even as it seeks to provide ""empirical support"" for this principle.",1,
577976,"how are scientists grasping at straws, but you aren't?  if your theory of evolution is correct, why do qualified evolutionary psychologists disagree? hmmm....    http://www.livescience.com/2623-gays-dont-extinct.html  &gt;new research may shed light on how homosexuality has survived in the gene pool.  &gt;homosexuality in males may be caused in part by genes that can increase fertility in females, according to a new study.  &gt;the findings may help solve the puzzle of why, if homosexuality is hereditary, it hasn't already disappeared from the gene pool, since gay people are less likely to reproduce than heterosexuals.  &gt;a team of researchers found that some female relatives of gay men tend to have more children than average. the scientists used a computer model to explain how two genes passed on through the maternal line could produce this effect.  &gt;in 2004 the researchers studied about 200 italian families and found that the mothers, maternal aunts and maternal grandmothers of gay men are more fecund, or fruitful, than average. recently, they tried to explain their findings with a number of genetic models, and found one that fit the bill.  &gt;this is the first time that a model fits all our empirical data,"" said andrea camperio-ciani, an **evolutionary psychologist** at the university of padova in italy who led the study. ""these genes work in a sexually antagonistic way — that means that when they're represented in a female, they increase fecundity , and when they're represented in a male, they decrease fecundity. it's a trait that benefits one sex at the cost of the other.""   &gt; if this scenario turns out to be true, it could help explain the seeming paradox of hereditary homosexuality. since gay people are less likely to reproduce than heterosexuals, many experts have wondered why, if homosexuality is caused by genetic factors, it wouldn't have been eliminated from the gene pool already.  &gt;but if the same genes create both homosexuality in men and increased fertility in women, then any losses in offspring that come about from the males would be made up for by the females of the family.  &gt;""sexually antagonistic selection is an old idea by richard dawkins, but this has never been proven in humans,"" camperio-ciani told livescience.   &gt;""there are a large quantity of these traits found in insects, for example, and recently in deer sexually antagonistic traits have been discovered, showing that high-ranking males produce rather unsuccessful daughters. we found that sexually antagonistic selection is operating also in our species, and we found it in a very important trait, which is homosexuality.""   &gt;""i think this is an example where the results of scientific research can have important social implications,"" camperio-ciani said. ""**you have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say it's against nature because it doesn't lead to reproduction. we found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund.**""   it seems your ""facts"" about evolution aren't actually supported by evolutionary psychologists at the moment. don't you just hate it when that happens?    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-26089486  &gt;since the early 1990s, researchers have shown that homosexuality is more common in brothers and relatives on the same maternal line, and a genetic factor is taken to be the cause. also relevant - although in no way proof - is research identifying physical differences in the brains of adult straight and gay people, and a dizzying array of homosexual behaviour in animals.   &gt;we know that women tend to like more feminine behavioural features and facial features in their men”  &gt;but since gay and lesbian people have fewer children than straight people, a problem arises.  &gt;""this is a paradox from an evolutionary perspective,"" says paul vasey from the university of lethbridge in canada. ""how can a trait like male homosexuality, which has a genetic component, persist over evolutionary time if the individuals that carry the genes associated with that trait are not reproducing?""  &gt;scientists don't know the answer to this darwinian puzzle, but there are several theories. it's possible that different mechanisms may be at work in different people. most of the theories relate to research on male homosexuality. the evolution of lesbianism is relatively understudied - it may work in a similar way or be completely different   &gt;the allele - or group of genes - that sometimes codes for homosexual orientation may at other times have a strong reproductive benefit. this would compensate for gay people's lack of reproduction and ensure the continuation of the trait, as non-gay carriers of the gene pass it down.  &gt;there are two or more ways this might happen. one possibility is that the allele confers a psychological trait that makes straight men more attractive to women, or straight women more attractive to men.   &gt;""we know that women tend to like more feminine behavioural features and facial features in their men, and that might be associated with things like good parenting skills or greater empathy,"" says qazi rahman, co-author of born gay; the psychobiology of sex orientation. therefore, the theory goes, a low ""dose"" of these alleles enhances the carrier's chances of reproductive success. every now and then a family member receives a larger dose that affects his or her sexual orientation, but the allele still has an overall reproductive advantage.   see also:  http://www.shaktitechnology.com/gaybrain.htm  http://www.livescience.com/7056-mom-genetics-produce-gay-sons.html  http://www.livescience.com/6106-gay-uncles-pass-genes.html  http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/finding-the-switch?page=2  http://www.livescience.com/2094-homosexuality-turned-fruit-flies.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kin_selection  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homosexual_behavior_in_animals  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biology_and_sexual_orientation   when it comes to theories on evolution, i'm going to go with the qualified evolutionary psychologist as apposed to the random neo nazi homophobe on the internet who has an infants education and understanding of the subject.  probably the wisest choice when it comes to seeking credible knowledge, wouldn't you agree?    now of course in my quest for credible knowledge i'm always open to new studies, sources or reading material so here's how it's going to go down: unless you can provide me with some sources or studies to back up your quaint little ""theory"" of evolution, i'm going to go with the evolutionary scientists on this one.   if you insist your authority is worth as much or more than that of the qualified evolutionary scientists, i'm afraid i'll have to ask to see your credentials and qualifications, otherwise your opinion and ""theory"" is worthless in comparison and based on pure assumption and elementary understanding of evolution, biology and kin selection.   we don't want people accepting nonfactual information off the internet as fundamental truth now, do we?  i'm sure if your ""theory"" is such an undeniable ""fact"" you won't have any trouble finding us some more studies and sources to sink our teeth into to back it up. be a dear and fetch some for us, will you?   so!  to recap:  &gt;thinking something sounds right because it supports your emotional opinion despite **absolutely no scientific basis** doesn't make it a theory. homosexuality does not serve a purpose. it is a form of evolutionary dysfunction. that is also not a theory(because it is a fact).   as you can see,  i've provided a ""theory"" with actual scientific backing which contradicts and undermines your ""theory"" and your ""facts"" on this matter.   so unless you can counter this post with your own sources or studies to back up your ""theory"" and your ""facts"" from equally qualified experts, we are clearly done here.   have a nice day now! :)",1,

529732,"let's handle this point by point.   1. i'm a straight man and ""wasn't supposed to see"" any form of sexuality at 12, but guess what, puberty happens. i found things that turned me on and kept searching for them, consequences be damned.  2. me too. moderation though, because addiction will ruin your life.  3. that's very short term. i can't advise you on this from lack of experience, but the odds of being able to do that without jail or injury are as slim as becoming a pro athlete.   4. welcome to puberty. replace ""gay"" with any other sexual preference or fetish and you're just like anyone else with internet access at your age.  5. i can't give recommendations on how to deal with your sexuality, as i'm hetero and fit into the nice status quo without judgement. however, i can guarantee there are tons of groups where you can discuss, confide, debate, and get advice on how you're feeling about your orientation. maybe you can't convince yourself because of societal pressure, maybe it's family, and maybe you're something between heterosexual and homosexual. http://sexetc.org may be a good resource to check out, as well as http://www.dailystrength.org/c/gay-lesbian-teens/support-group and your school counselor. pro-tip:  don't mention anything besides your sexuality to a school appointed counselor, as they're required to report any red flags regarding anything potentially illegal. source:  spent a lot of time with a school counselor  6. find people to support you through this. i've been fat, got better, got depressed and fat again, and am coming back into the ""trying to be in shape"" phase. the easiest way to do it is to find people who will support you and encourage you. they can be people you know in person, internet friends, people you bump into at whatever workout facility you have, etc. reddit has several exercise/motivation subreddits to help.  7. don't worry about the number of friends. the quality of friends you currently have is what's important. i get along with almost everyone i meet, and i only have two friends that i'm still in contact from high school. they've introduced me to other friends that i get along with better now than some of the people i always spent time with at school.  8. me too, and it's because i'm not alpha male and i don't like sports/lifting/other macho stuff.  9. see number 8  10. this isn't a confession. lots of people smoked weed at my school and i grew up in the middle of nowhere. some turned out fine, others became burnouts. again, things can be okay in moderation, but addiction is worse than you understand until you get there and it's too late.  11. ""love"" the way you love your family members, or ""love"" as in you want to spend the rest of your life with her?  learn the difference and then also consider that puberty is a terrible time to evaluate reality.   this isn't a judgement on your age, it's a brutal understanding of how hormones make your feelings go to extremes. it's a lot like how two-year-olds throw temper tantrums over things like not being allowed another bowl of cereal or missing an episode of a cartoon. it seems ridiculous to you now, but think about something that really upset you when you were five or six years old. once you make it through puberty, you'll realize how it's a terrible drug trip that made everything more intense than it was.   anyone who's made it through puberty can tell you that no matter how high/stoned/drunk/whatever they got in their lives, their judgement was never as skewed as it was when they were adapting from child to adult.  you shouldn't hold back your feelings or passion, but you should have multiple contingency plans in place in the event that things don't go the way you hoped. being disappointed is a lot easier when you have steps you can still follow.  12. (listed as ""12"") again, this is just puberty. from a statistic i'm pulling completely from memory over 15 years ago, this happens like every 90 minutes when you're in puberty. two options: oversized shirts and taping your dick to your leg. they're equally expensive, so you just have to decide on pain versus bad fashion.  13. (listed as ""13"") for the millionth time, puberty. you're gonna go through weird stuff, you're gonna feel weird, and you're gonna try weird stuff. shaving your pubes isn't any more weird than getting a different hair cut or changing your wardrobe.  it seems very stressful and scary now, but once you hit your 20s, you can always go ""yeah, puberty was a bitch"" and just laugh it off. i know how far away that seems, but after high school, most people don't care about anything that happened during school. the people who do care never leave their hometown, marry people from their hometown, stay in their hometown, never form thoughts of their own, and never get anything that wasn't handed to them. there are people who may give you crap through school and then go on to do greater things with their lives, and every one of those people i've ever known has apologized to the people they've wronged because they became decent human beings.  lastly, understand that you're in the golden age of support systems right now. no matter what you're into or how you feel or how you identify yourself as a person, you have immediate access to a global network of people who run the entire gamut of sexualities, identities, genders, addictions, fetishes, hobbies, and any other grouping you could possible imagine. i've seen groups dedicated to erotic fantasies about princess peach, fanfiction about jaime and adam from mythbusters, softcore-only sexual encounters, and everything in between. hell, one of my friends from point number seven likes to wear a $2000 dinosaur costume and have sex with other people regardless of their gender or orientation, so long as they're in dinosaur costumes.  the point is, you are absolutely not alone in how you feel or what you're into. more importantly than that, there are even more people who won't judge you for how you feel or what you're into, regardless of their feelings or into-it-ness of whatever perspective, orientation, political preference, favorite punk band, or feeling of who the most arousing teletubby is.  just understand that most people on the internet, including myself, will go for the lulz because it's entertaining to them before they go to support you. any group that doesn't immediately try to help can be ignored as worthless and a sign to find others who are willing to listen.  **tl;dr:  people are assholes, puberty sucks, you're not nearly as weird as you think you are, your issues are all natural, and there are millions of people on the internet who will support you no matter which freak flag you fly**  edit: typos, grammar, phone-to-computer conversion",1,
360941,"&gt;they don't, though. our country started with ""all men are created equal"" and ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"". nowhere did it say that any one group could define marriage. along the way came the civil rights act which gave, to quote president kennedy, ""all americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments""  that doesn't give people the right to marry anyone.  the declaration of independence speaks of the [consent of the governed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consent_of_the_governed), that a government's legitimacy only comes from the people. which matters more: the people's consent, or the majority opinion of the 9 unelected people with life tenure comprising the supreme court?  writing ""all men are created equal"" they were clearly referring to white male landowners -- not slaves or women or indians -- who all couldn't vote then.  writing ""all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights..."" is a rejection of the divine right of kings, suggesting certain rights are god-given to all men, not only a king (so they don't have to obey a king).  in the us people vote for legislators, who write &amp; pass laws, &amp; laws can define things. one might point out that the judicial branch has the power to [review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/judicial_review_in_the_united_states) laws -- even though the constitution does not explicitly delegate that power to the courts, &amp; the 10th amendment reserves to the states (and the people) the powers not delegated to the federal government. but that's another topic.  if the us was founded on equality, then the civil rights act of 1964 (which outlawed discrimination based on race, religion, or gender) wouldn't have been needed. (and it doesn't mention sexual orientation.)  i don't think many in the us are denying gays entrance to businesses. many people think gay marriage is immoral (or at least makes no sense from a biological standpoint) &amp; vote accordingly, and businesspeople don't want to participate in gay weddings. as a catholic, jfk would have opposed gay marriage.  gay marriage proponents have cited the 14th amendment. but lino graglia wrote ""the [14th amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourteenth_amendment_to_the_united_states_constitution) was written after the civil war to provide a national guarantee of basic civil rights to blacks."" and it didn't authorize congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations. but it's so vague that anyone could argue some law (or every law) is ""denying"" them ""liberty"" as a citizen. he wrote, ""the problem is that the supreme court justices have made the due process and equal protection clauses empty vessels into which they can pour any meaning. this converts the clauses into simple transferences of policy-making power from elected legislators to the justices, authorizing a court majority to remove any policy issue from the ordinary political process and assign it to themselves for decision. this fundamentally changes the system of government created by the constitution."" he wrote ""if a constitutional amendment could be adopted reconfining the 14th amendment to that purpose or, better still, expanding it to a general prohibition of all official racial discrimination, the court's free-hand remaking of domestic social policy for the nation would largely come to an end.""  &gt;but otherwise, a heterosexual cake is identical to a homosexual cake  the events are different. people don't want to take part in an event they morally object to. like asking a jain to bring a vegetarian dish to a bbq, they would object to the event itself. like asking a cake shop to provide a cake for a child wedding.  &gt;a law that directly conflicts with the civil rights act for something as specific and trivial as wedding cakes and flowers will be overturned by the first judge who sees a case  the civil rights act doesn't mention sexual orientation.  &gt;bringing it up with regard to homosexual marriage is a textbook red herring  not if the issue is the alleged lack of discrimination in the us. people clearly think some forms of discrimination (age discrimination) are okay &amp; lawful, even necessary to uphold societal norms. how can one argue discrimination based on age is right but that discrimination based on sexual orientation is wrong (since age is not a choice, minors are citizens, and if people are born with their sexual orientation then every gay adult was once a gay child)? they're arguing minors are not mentally competent enough to get married (but one might argue gays aren't mentally competent either). a gay minor can't get married, so wanting to get married is not enough, some other standard has to be met. (one might say marriage requires consent -- but then ignore the lack of consent from state voters regarding gay marriage.)  about minors, one might say ""it's not discrimination, it's protection."" (so two lesbians teens who want to get married are denied for their ""protection."") but if discrimination is accepted if it's cast as protection, then one could argue that gays are not being ""discriminated"" against, they are being ""protected"", or that marriage or social norms are being ""protected"" by delimiting who (or what) can &amp; can't get married.  &gt;there is no protected class of people called ""people not currently wearing shoes"". so long as it does not violate the spirit of our civil rights, people are free to refuse service to anyone. they can have dress codes  adults have more rights than minors. people wearing shirts or shoes can engage in more business than people who aren't. people argue people are born with their sexual orientation (even though it can be fluid). but people are also born without shirt or shoes. everyone was ""born that way"" but refusing service to people based on that is seen as lawful, as upholding community norms. (one might say people choose to not wear clothes, but if people are born that way, then they choose to wear clothing. is it ""discrimination"" to refuse service to naked people, who were ""born that way""?)  the 14th amendment is so vague that one could argue that dress codes are ""discriminatory"" and ""denying"" them ""liberty."" the problem is that people are stretching the word ""liberty"" to mean whatever they want to do, but that the law restricts.  &gt;it only feels like religion is being attacked because members of any given religious group feel that they are disproportionately important in the grand scheme of things  in the grand scheme of things, heterosexual reproduction is what makes human life possible (""our posterity"" that the constitution speaks of). it's the lgbt community that feels they are disproportionately important, that their idea of marriage takes precedence over the rights of voters or lawmakers to define marriage.  regarding any one group defining marriage: do [9 million people](http://www.hrc.org/press-releases/entry/significant-changes-on-tax-day-for-same-sex-couples-after-victories-at-the) have the right to define marriage for all 311 million people in the us? does ""any one group"" mean the 9 people in the supreme court?  &gt;violence, death threats, verbal abuse (mostly from people ""practicing religious freedom""). it's only been 11 years since they were even allowed to legally have sexual intercourse with their partners  nowadays, i think death threats are more likely against businesses that refuse to take part in gay weddings, than against gays. or at people who speak against homosexuality (as if they don't have free speech).  if people had obeyed anti-sodomy laws, less gay men would have died in the aids epidemic.  &gt;we're already seeing polygamy taboos wearing down. popular current tv shows like big love and sister wives showed the normal side of polygamy. people fighting for homosexual marriage are finding that many of their arguments apply to polygamy as well  i don't think big love was intended to normalize polygamy (or respect religious freedom). the head writers of the show were two gay guys, and a gay ex-mormon, and a woman who joined in season 3, and it showed parts of the lds church's temple ceremony (even though the family on the show are mormon fundamentalists and even though the lds church officially discontinued polygamy in 1890 -- although maybe they assumed the ceremony is the same). the lds church has distanced itself from polygamy (since they haven't endorsed it in over a century, in order for utah to become a state). and they won't fight for the rights of polygamists to marry. the writers of big love clearly had a bone to pick with mormonism, since the show is set in a suburb of salt lake city, the headquarters of the lds church.  conservatives who have argued that gay marriage would lead to polygamous marriage and incestous marriage have been right (because all of the arguments based on the 14th amendment used to overturn state bans on gay marriage also apply to polygamous marriage and incestous marriage, and if one considers *citizens*, even child marriage).  &gt;politicians are more concerned with being reelected than being right. judges have the same biases as normal people--putting on a robe doesn't make them moral, they were appointed because they know the law and enforced it in a way that agreed with whomever it was who appointed them  politicians are concerned with appearing ""politically correct"" and not angering the vocal lgbt community (or their conservative base, whichever group their election relies more on).  judges also act on precedence. and in the us, the precedence for non-traditional marriage (such as polygamy) has been to outlaw it for over 150 years based on the moral inclinations of congress. anti-bigamy laws (since 1862) haven't been found to violate the 14th amendment (since 1868) because the latter was always about racial discrimination.",1,
905112,"being annoyed about the more flamboyant members of our community is a fairly common reaction after coming out. it seems to usually be connected to the fear that because i am gay, and that flamer over there is gay, then ""normal"" people that see me will think i'm the same as them, i.e. fear of being lumped in with people that i don't want to be associated with. (note i used first person singular in the above so as to not appear accusatory to op.) most people that have grown out of this annoyance acknowledge that there was some internalized homophobia involved.    **why of they behave that way.** welp, of course you'd have to ask them, but a likely replay is that it's because ""that's who they are"" that they're ""expressing themselves"", and of course we have no reason to doubt this. in some cases, yes, there are some people that seem to have a flair for extreme fashion statements, and spend quite a bit of time and money on their hobby. some even make it their life's work (with varying degrees of success).    i know op is young, and clearly has no deep knowledge of lgbt history. how could he? it's been filtered out of the curriculum, you have to make some kind of an effort to discover that alexander the great was gay (although it should be noted that colin firth's role as *alexander* did show close physical relations with both hephastion and [the persian boy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_persian_boy)). dig a little deeper to find that [berdaches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/two-spirit) were quite common in north america before the europeans arrived. it's fairly well-known that authors like oscar wilde and walt witman were gay, but not too many know about [henry james](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_james) or [john cheever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_cheever). indeed, cheever's wiki-page (the previous link) doesn't mention it at all, although [excerpts from his journals](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1991/01/28/1991_01_28_028_tny_cards_000358420), posthumously published in *the new yorker* make clear that he more than ""dabbled"". op is likely too young to have seen [angels in america](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/angels_in_america_%28tv_miniseries%29), let alone recognize the [roy cohn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roy_cohn) character (he was a lead lawyer for the mccarthy commission) and appreciate the level of hypocrisy and self hatred necessary to have lived the life he did. and it's hard, now, in the 21st century, to comprehend the courage of the [drag queens and others that first fought back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stonewall_riots#open_rebellion) at stonewall. *will and grace* is now seen as merely another syndicated sitcom, but it was not that long ago that there were no openly lgbt people anywhere in the media. even liberace was widely believed to be straight (""such a good son""), and no one had any idea about james dean being bisexual, or rock hudson being gay.    and it's only after looking for [lgbt authors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_lgbt_writers) that anyone is likely to read the works of [james baldwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_baldwin_%28writer%29) or watch harvey fiersten's [*torch song trilogy*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096289/) or be at all interested in quentin crisp's [*the naked civil servant*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ymbgf0mde8). these are part of our common history, but it takes some effort to find them, perhaps even a little courage to check them out of the library.    but when one does make that effort, it's clear that self-hatred and self-repression led many of our fore-bearers to have horrible lives, and it was only the people that were ""true to themselves"" that had any kind of satisfaction in their lives. also, after looking at our history, we recognize the immense influence that drag-culture has had on lgbt history in general, and that some of the more flamboyant people showed incredible courage and integrity in their lives.    so why do they behave that way. years of living a lie, suppressing every action that might be seen as ""queer"", getting hair cuts and choosing clothes to ""fit in"", carefully enunciating so the telltale lisp is never heard, all these things are discarded after coming out. most people need a little time to adjust to their newly felt freedoms. some people have to keep saying ""i'm gay"" over and over again, simply because it's hard for them to believe that they are actually saying those words.   &gt; it's come to my attention that a handful of gay people are a little bit too gay.    welp, thanks for the head up. yes, some people do feel that their sexuality is the most important aspect of their personality. but op is not talking about the flamers or the activists among us. no, it's the ""predatory gay"", that propositions almost every man he sees, and op thinks it's because even though they ""know"" the guy is straight, they're ""convinced the straight person will love it"". first: how do they ""know"" the guy is straight op? because of how he behaves? where he is? what he's drinking? who he's talking to? yes, those are all indicators, but some of the most manly men i know are gay, drink beer, play pool, drive a truck, and all that jazz. so the ""predatory gay"" is to assume that, unless a guy is known to be gay, he is straight by default? piffle. second. clearly op has never given a guy the best blow job of his life, never had an inexperienced guy say ""i had no idea it could feel like that"", or ""let's do that again"". i think perhaps more than a few of the ""predatory gay"" guys have heard that more than a few times, and with a little too much to drink they find the courage to approach someone they think might be convinced to give it a try, someone likely to say something of the sort later in the evening. and of course there's the whole ""forbidden fruit"" thing; it's a fairly common human trait to want the thing that you cannot have. i think it's possible that some ""predatory gays"" might find fellow cocksuckers slightly disgusting, telling themselves they want a ""real man"" who would never ""do that"". then there are those that simply like a challenge.    but are these ""predatory gay"" men ""too gay""? welp, they appear to be dick hounds from what's described, and op is clearly not comfortable being seen as anything like them, ready to drop to his knees for a chance at the d, but this isn't being ""too gay"". it's acting slutty, and a fair proportion of lgbt people go through such a phase after coming out. imho this likely happens less often to people courageous enough to come out in their teens, when they have innocent (sexless) dates, holding hands in a movie theatre or playing footsies under the table.   &gt; gay bars, gay pride, and all this shit    again, it's a matter of our history. gay bars exist now (at least in north america) mostly since it's easier to meet other lgbt people there. we're something like 5% of the population (world wide, and in round figures), so a regular bar, if it had a representative cross-section, out of a hundred people, 50 would be men, and 2 would be gay, so there's only one other gay guy. those are not good odds.    gay bars/restaurants/businesses also exist now, in north america, because some in our community prefer to give our money to other lgbt people. and in my experience, gay-owned businesses are better run, and it's nice to feel you can be yourself without worry that you'll be forced to defend something you did/wore/said (assuming of course that you're not just being as asshole).    gay pride originated as a direct response to the ""shame"" rhetoric from the right wing, which really took off after the onset of the aids epidemic (""god's judgement for shameful behaviour""). this was not an uncommon view in reagan's america. similar to what's happening in russia now (after reporting as assault at a police station, one young man said he was asked ""what did he expect? you're gay"") many people saw people with aids as getting what they deserved. rejecting that stigma, refusing to see how-we-like-to-have-sex as an abomination worthy of divine retribution, requires pride in who you are as a human being, that you are completely okay the way you are, that being gay is not a mental condition, that it's not contagious, and there's nothing inherently shameful about it at all.    yes, some pride celebrations are over the top. it's also become very commercialized, often a week long mardi-gras-ish series of raves and parties, with alcohol flowing freely and ""party drugs"" aplenty. it's important to realize that there's no international pride organization that oversees these events, there isn't even a national, state/province or municipal ""officially sanctioned"" organization with agreed on procedures and standards. each and every pride event makes up its own rules. as some of these get older, they've evolved into more family friendly events, with the sex themed stuff inside the clubs. yes, there are obvious exceptions: the castro, weho, etc.    so, op, if you don't like the way your local pride is handled, it's up to you to get out there and change it. (but a word of advise: don't go in with the approach that ""you're all hurting our cause, we need to assimilate, to blend in"" because that won;t go well at all.)    &gt;  i don't blame a single person for hating gay people now that i've seen first-hand how absurd some of the antics are.    wow. it's tempting to go godwin on this (i mean, have you heard of pink triangles op?) but i'll just recommend that op watch [bent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_f1esw7za) -- link is to the sex scene, no nudity, no actual contact, amazing scene.    and this self-hatred at these ""ridiculous antics"" is something you would be well advised to watch. self-harm often follows self-hatred.   tldr you're young, find out about our history, try not to judge others",1,
552367,"heh, i knew it was going to be asked. i suppose more downvotes for giving some honest truth about the matter won't be a problem, will it?     first off, the definition of marriage has long stood as a man and a woman forming (more or less) a legal contract to share property and interests, power of attorney, etc. it was designed to form a safe, civil way to procreate. a legal obligation for a man and woman to stay together and raise their children together. the very nature of trying to change that definition, beyond how some people want to think it's purely religious, is trying to call a dog a cat because they both should be able to have the same rights.          homosexuality is well known to carry many problems (i promise this comes back to marriage). hiv is almost exclusively msm (men who have sex with men) transmitted today, even though gay men make up a tiny percentage of the population. anal sex is well known to be much more risky than any other form of sex (yes, including unprotected vaginal), which can explain some of the high rates. drug use, multiple partners (many gay men who are married have agreements to an open relationship), and other factors help to round out the explanation of high hiv transmission rates. there's a reason blood donation facilities immediately rule out homosexual men. it's not blind discrimination. it's knowing that a random black woman, for instance, is far less likely to have hiv than a random gay man.          going back to drug use, pnp (party and play) is a common term used in gay communities. another thing that at least scares people, but is not as common is so-called ""bug catching."" bug catching groups, where people try to purposely get as many stds as they can from others, are almost exclusive gay.          pedophilia. while it's true that most pedophiles are straight men, it ignores that a disproportionate number of gay men are pedophiles and also ignores that straight men prefer little girls, offsetting the information about boys that are molested. james rennie, larry brinkin, and many other prominent gay men who are leaders in the gay community have been caught in pedophile rings (often very quietly, getting little attention in the media). obviously not all gay men are pedophiles, but whether you want to believe there is a difference or not, it's plenty of a reason in many people's minds to be concerned. it certainly doesn't help that gay rights groups are pressuring the boy scouts to include openly gay scout masters, want to lower the age of consent (or abolish it in some cases), push for gay-straight alliances in schools all the way to elementary school level across the country, and provide brochures and other information teaching minors how to have homosexual sex and locations where they can meet others (including those their age and those who are much older).          another topic that's been largely up in the air, but multiple studies are showing it to be at least partially true (and we could spend all day discussing reasons why) is that gay couples raise children to be gay at higher rates than heterosexual couples. similarly, children of gay parents are seen to have higher incidents of mental issues and social problems. not here to discuss why and how, just laying it out there.          so this all comes back to marriage now. with that picture above painted, again whether you believe it or not, how comfortable are you thinking about homosexuals adopting children? after all, either they are coming from broken homes that they created and dragging their kids with them to a same sex step parent, or they're adopting the child if they have children. for most people, with this information, there's going to be hesitation, if not a wider range of emotions about it.          there's more reasons, but i think that is a good set of examples of why a person would have any issue. i'm expecting a lot of people to call me a bigot for this (which is funny because i'm neither stating my position, nor am i showing any ignorance about the topic). i just hope this helps show others that not a single one of these is religious based, but are pretty damned good reasons to hold a grudge about the matter.          and if you're still in a position that it's all stupid, consider that for most people, ""equality"" is virtually the only argument ever given for supporting homosexual marriage. it makes you wonder how incestuous couples should feel or others that have been marginalized. incestuous couples, including adult, consenting couples, are looking at 20 years to life in 39 states in the us. they can't even let anyone know they're having an intimate relationship together, much less whisper the idea of marriage. polygamy is illegal in all 50 states (there are some who do have an illegal polygamous relationship, often in states like utah. funny enough there is one legally recognized polygamous relationship in the us: a trio of lesbians in massachusetts).          i tried to keep this post neutral and not inject my own views. i purposely didn't link anything because i'd rather someone do their own research on these matters than just take my word for it (it's like a pro-marijuana person posting articles from norml, imho).          edit: look at all those downvotes. naturally reddit users want to live in a world where homosexuality is completely okay, but the reality is starkly different. i suppose i can't be surprised when so many here will do anything to put on blinders about the matter when there's plenty of science to back me up. bigotry is alive and well in this thread and it hurts to see so much refusal to the truth about the matter.          if you don't want an answer, don't ask for one.",1,
596138,"it's important because it's one of the last arenas where we have visibility. it may not matter to straight people, but it matters to the gay people in sports who don't have someone like them to look up to who is currently succeeding in the sports world while being open. the media grabs a hold of it because it's still newsworthy. there are still many people who get up in arms about gay people being visible, just think about the whole debacle that one million moms tried to cause after a honey maid commercial featured a gay couple. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/one-million-moms-honey-maid_n_5110638.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices  many people who think that by coming out, we're ""announcing our sexual preferences"" are often quick to rush straight to sex when it comes to gay people in the abstract. often times people don't think about the emotional component when it comes to attraction, and they also don't consider how simple actions and statements essentially, to use a common and overused phrase with discussion about homosexuality, ""shove their (heterosexual) lifestyle down our throats"" (things as simple as holding an opposite sex partner's hand in public or referencing your spouse in anyway, things that often times result in gay couples receiving demonizing stares, people feeling the need to tell us how ""sick"" we are, and some people beating us up).  we're still not at a point in this country where gay people can just live their lives in the limelight or in the open in general without being judged, criticized, or vilified by a significant portion of the population for simply trying to live our lives. we're not at a point where we don't assume someone is heterosexual until proven otherwise. until then, those who come out are doing a service for the gay and lesbian people who will grow up and look to them as inspiration to feel as though they don't have to choose between staying in the closet and playing sports, in regards to the sports thing. for coming out in general, lgbt youth always want to find role models just like them that they can look to. some may have that in the form of personal acquaintances, but others don't.",1,
334280,"this is an almost infinitely complex question, and one that i don't think really has a satisfying answer. however, i can provide some context to your question that i think will be helpful.  first off, let's ask the question 'what do we mean by ""gay?""' 'who is gay and who is not gay, in a historical sense?' ""gay"" as an identity category, doesn't really exist before the 1940's-ish. even ""homosexual"" doesn't really exist before the late 1800's. just like everything else in history, notions of sex, sexuality, and identity have been constantly changing over time. some interesting things started to happen around the turn of the last century that put the groundwork for today's notions of homosexuality into motion.  people started to think about their sexuality as a part of their identity, as opposed to simply something that a person did. in the past (in a very broad, general sense) what role you played in a (male) same-sex encounter was the discerning factor, not whether or not you had them. the ""active"" or penetrative partner was considered to be the ""man's"" role; men who took this role, regardless of the gender of their partner, were ""normal"" ""masculine"" men. the ""passive"" or receptive partner could take different forms. he might be a younger man/adolescent boy (who might well grow up to take the active role in his adult sexual encounters) or he could be a ""fairy"" or ""pansy"" - an adult male who adopted a feminized persona (a ""flaming queen,"" if you will.) fairies/pansies were considered effectively the same as women (particularly female prostitutes. in early 20th century america, it was considered quite normal to seek out the ""services"" of a fairy, especially in the case of fellatio, which female prostitutes were often unwilling to perform.   as i said earlier, this dichotomy starts to shift around the turn of the century (although it was gradual; different, even conflicting notions often coexisted.) a group of men (largely middle-class) started to identify as ""homosexual"" or ""queer"" (very different from the 1990's definition of queer (which is itself different from today's definition of the word, but that's a discussion for another day.)) these men centered their identity around their attraction to other *men,* not around their role in sex, or around their gender identity (fairies often rationalized their attraction to men based on their feminine gender identity.) this new identity category helped create another identity category - the heterosexual. over the course of the first few decades of the 20th century this dichotomy of ""gay"" and ""straight"" became the norm (""gay"" takes over as the preferred term roughly around the 1940's.)   with that context in place, i'm going to attempt to actually answer your question.   understanding the change in sexual identity categories is very important. in order for there to be a homosexual rights movement, homosexuals had to exist, and exist in a way that was considered abnormal. i would say that this whole period of change, from the mid-late 19th century to the 1940's, was a time in which the homosexual rights movement was beginning. that being said, i think it's fair to say that the homosexual rights movement - in a form that is recognizable to us now - did truly start in the mid 20th century.   i hope that helps; i'm happy to answer any specific follow-up questions!   edit: i realized i forgot the important caveat that my knowledge is primarily us-based. also, i'll cite george chauncey's *gay new york* as my main source.",1,

336768,"this one is true, but really disgusting.   when i was little i used to sleep over at my dads house. he rented a room inside of a house owned by other people with only one bathroom for the family that owned the house and my dad. so instead of walking out to the bathroom he would piss inside of soda cans that he had finished earlier. i was not aware of this, so one night i was really thirsty in this dark room with everyone sleeping. i found a soda can that felt half full and just took a gulp out of it. it was cold from sitting around for a while but tasted really sour and just god-awful. i had no choice but to swallow this huge mouthful of piss because i couldn't just spit it onto the bed. i still wasn't 100% sure what had happened until the next day i asked my dad ""did you take a piss in a soda can last night?"" and he said while laughing ""yeah....why? did you drink it?"" well i was too embarrassed to tell him so i said ""no, i just smelt it and it smelt like piss"" and just went about my day.   **tl;dr: i drank a mouthful of my dads old and cold piss.**  edit: speilling  edit2: since some of you seem to enjoy this story, i will add in another about my dumb ass dad:  my dad always had another nasty habit. he really liked pretzels, but instead of just eating the fucking things like a normal human, he would just lick the salt off of them. the worst part about this habit is that instead of throwing each pretzel out, he would just put them right back in the packaging (these are the rod pretzels, not the standard shaped ones). still, to this day, i have no clue why he does this. so randomly, when i was little, i would go to eat some pretzels only to take a bite out of a soggy, salt-less stick. so of course, i made a habit out of checking every pretzel to make sure none of the salt was missing before even touching it. unfortunately for our visitors, they were unaware of this habit my dad had. so recently at my dads house i see my aunt eating some pretzels she found sitting next to the couch. i didn't really think anything of it until she asks me why we buy unsalted pretzels. i guess my dads spit dried up on these pretzels making them seem like they weren't salted to begin with. i fucking gagged.   **tl;dr: don't eat the pretzels if you ever come to my house.**",0,

124359,"i'm not a social scientist at all and i can only speak as a gay person from my own perspective, but i like to ~~ramble~~ write about this topic so hopefully might offer something of value. i'm basically just going to try and regurgitate everything i've learned so far which is quite a bit so fingers crossed!  in order to understand why we are here in this moment of time, we first have to explore how we got here in the first place.   the modern gay rights movement started in 1969 after the [stonewall uprising](http://www.thirteen.org/programs/american-experience/stonewall-uprising/). it wasn't until the 1940s when people started moving en masse into cities where most gay people actually learned they were not alone; other people were gay too! they could actually gather and be with people who are like them and they weren't the only ones after all; over the next 20 years or so these communities and ghettos would grow to provide the foundation of the networks which organized the first gay rights movements. this solidarity and sense of community was something gay people never had before, and it would prove to be the empowerment they needed to finally stand up, speak up and come out.   homosexuality was actually fine in most cultures until around 300ad or so when religion (and later imperialism) came along and stirred up a frenzy; all homophobia as we know it today is rooted in religion and if religion didn't suppress study into the subject as well as enact a campaign of oppression and demonization then it could be argued the concept of homophobia (and equality of rights and respect for gay people) as we know it today would be absolutely non existent and we'd have societies which are much better educated about the phenomenon as apposed to our current situation which is essentially an intellectually stunted society on every level in regards to this subject.   you often hear people say ""everyone in africa or asia has probably always hated gays"" but this is far from the truth; it wasn't until we british came along with our civilized moral values and religion and imposed our homophobia onto these societies did anti-gay sentiment take root, which is ironic considering politicians in africa and india actually claim homosexuality is the western important as apposed to homophobia!  this anti-gay sentiment went full steam ahead during the victorian era because of opinions surrounding sex and ""cleanliness""; homosexuality was inevitably sucked into it. it was this victorian era flourishing of pure hatred which continued into the 20th century and basically produced the venomously homophobic western societies we all know and love today; where homosexuality is seen as somewhat ""dirty"" but you're not sure why and religion has ensured a plethora of unsavory myths and lies are still being spread without any education to dispel them and no alternative narratives to counter all the negativity.   homosexuality still not being included in sex education, biology or evolution in school ensures lots of false assumptions and misconceptions remain because kids are told ""all purpose of life is to reproduce"" without being told how gay people fit into the picture as well as a host of other things which leads them to jump to conclusions and assumptions which aren't in line with current expert theory or study.   in addition to the total lack of education and understanding throughout history, they have been indoctrinated and brainwashed into a very intense hatred and fear of lgbt people with all sorts of lies and myths and this conditioning adds fuel to the fire and there are virtually no alternative narratives that offer a positive or educational perspective until very very recently. it's basically been a constant hammering of bad ew wrong wtf for centuries with no opposition voice. people have been completely terrified of lgbt people for a variety of irrational and often humorous reasons from their children's innocence and safety to their own reputation and social status in their town in their social circle or as a parent to the very end of mankind itself through extinction or the rapture.   additionally, people need a punching bag and a scape goat to make themselves feel secure and powerful, and gay people have always been proven to be the perfect choice because of the climate of fear, hatred and lack of understanding surrounding them combined with their small numbers as a minority, their lack of political power, and because they don't produce offspring it means they are ""worthless"" anyway and would not be missed. they gave up women, they gave up black people and other racial minorities, but they will fight to the death before they will give up their last punching bag. what we are seeing recently is a lot of bigots screaming and crying about losing their punching bags due to ""political correctness"" or ""liberal agendas""; because everyone has always hated gay people like they do, they are absolutely fuming society has done such a sudden 180 and many haven't even acknowledged most people aren't hateful like them anymore. their tears are delicious.   it could be argued if religion and imperialism didn't throw a spanner in the works the idea of disliking someone because they are gay would be as baffling as disliking somebody because they have green eyes and the concept of homophobia as we know it would never have been stirred up. it could be argued the colossal fuck up that is humans understanding of homosexuality would never have happened and the resulting campaign of intense hatred and all the lies and stigma that came with it would be unimaginable. religion and imperialism (in india and africa for example) are the root cause of all homophobia as we know it without which there would never have been a need for ""gay rights"" because we already would have them. every anti-gay assumption or misconception you hear these days from ""gays are wrong because it's un-natural"" to ""gays are wrong because there's no baby at the end"" would have been dispelled a long, long time ago.   now, because minorities have been proven to internalize and manifest all the nasty things propagated about them no matter how false it may be, it wasn't until the removal of homosexuality from the mental health register combined with the anti-establishment, pro-civil rights ""fuck the police"" climate of the 60s and their still new sense of community and solidarity before lgbt people had the courage to stand up for themselves and try to put an end to this 1700 year long campaign of totally unjustified oppression and demonization by battering the police persecuting them which absolutely shocked the world because nobody beat the police; not the suffragettes, not the black panthers, not the anti-war movement, nobody. nobody beat the police and then all of a sudden the queers of all people totally fucked them up; it was truly revolutionary and sent shock waves around the globe.    what you need to understand is stonewall can be seen as the straw that broke the camels back and was actually *1700 years* in the making. stonewall was the inevitable boiling over of a pot which had been brewing for centuries. stonewall can be described as the defining moment where gays grew a back bone and said no more. this caused a tidal wave of inspiration and empowerment which quickly spread to other countries in the west as well as the massive campaign to ""come out"" in the 70s. this got the ball rolling (very slowly) towards the much more tolerant society we live in today.   one crucial point to remember is that the *only reason* i haven't been killed yet and snatched off the streets of england and slaughtered as a gay man is because of the blood, sweat and tears sacrificed by gay people who came before me since 1969. it's been a very gradual process, until acceptance surged at the turn of the century (which i will explain at the end)  to this day we are still absolute door mats and live under terrorism and apartheid in many different ways and there is still very little security in ourselves so many, many lgbt people are frightened to stand up for themselves or speak out or fight for their rights, and nobody is scared of gay people like they are of black people; we are still seen as weak, inferior, mentally disabled and apparently totally worthless easy targets which makes it much harder to gain respect and security.   the crushing pressure to conform to heterosexual standards and expectations as well as the pressure to become totally invisible and most importantly keep your mouth firmly *zipped* means there aren't many people who are brave enough to speak out, and those who ""rock the boat"" are seen as trouble makers who put all gay people at risk by extension and so lgbt people often learn to police and oppress themselves. it is very similar to the situation of black people in the 1950s and 1960s i think: it's much easier to shuffle to the back of the bus instead of inconveniencing the white passengers by standing up for yourself. standing up for yourself means you are putting all black people at risk of violent repercussion, so black people would prefer you to not cause a fuss. this means progress can be very slow and combined with the internalized feeling of being ""second class"" or ""sub human"" you basically agree with the oppression and so you take whatever shit is flung your way because on some level you feel it is deserved and just; ""i got beaten to a pulp, but it serves me right for going out dressed flamboyantly and flaunting it"", ""i was made homeless by my family, but it serves me right for not keeping my sexuality in the closet where it belongs""; ""me and my boyfriend were spat on, but it serves us right for holding hands in public and not keeping it in the bedroom where it belongs"" etc.   upon the realization that being gay is a genetic and inborn thing and not a mental quirk picked up along the way through bad parenting as previously thought, this has dramatically shifted people's perceptions of gay people and because they think ""it could have been me"" more people care about lgbt rights now because even though actual education and understanding has remained stagnant there is a lot more **empathy** and **compassion** because of this, and the fact people are born gay and not made and because they know they are gay from a very young age, this has dramatically increased the demand for a safe, supportive environment because they are seen as innocent kids as apposed to mentally deranged adult fetishists as they were previously perceived.   in fact everything i do in regards to lgbt rights is never for me; i am thinking of the gay kids who are suffering always. i am always working to make society a bit better for the next generation of gay kids like those before me have done. i'd argue that is why gay rights have become so important; because we want to create a better world for the next generation of gay kids who are inevitable whereas previously we thought they had to be made that way. every day a kid realizes he is gay and is tossed into a dark pit of despair, so every day we work hard to abolish the pit. it's a constant race against time and a matter of life and death for a good chunk of our populations which is why it is so important to me and others. most people these days simply say they ""don't give a shit"" and while that's good in the sense they aren't haters, it's bad because it means they are essential fence sitters and don't actually help push progress like they think they do. sorry guys, simply saying ""i have no problem with gays"" doesn't mean you are an ally who is helping society progress, you have to do more than that i'm afraid. since a lot of gay people are too afraid to speak out because it puts them at risk and are such a small minority, we really do rely heavily on the voices of our heterosexual allies. heterosexuals don't listen to me when i speak out against homophobia or for lgbt rights because duh i'm gay and i'm just a whining drama queen who is looking for reasons to be offended. heterosexuals listen to other heterosexuals though and your word is (sadly) worth more than mine in this regard so for the love of god, use it.   so what we have seen since gay people started ""coming out"" in the late 60s after the stonewall uprising is not an increase of ""acceptance"" and ""understanding"" but is actually an increase of *tolerance* and *empathy*, despite the general public's fundamental understanding and education remaining static since the 1960s with the exception of the ""is it a choice"" question finally being settled. i think this increase of tolerance is mainly because people learned after all the gays ""came out"" that the scary gay man wasn't actually a demon lurking in the shadows trying to eat their babies but was their sons, sisters, friends, co-workers; their loved ones.   also people simply don't care that someone might be gay like they used to as it's not seen as such a big deal in our sexually liberal socieites, especially now that society is more accommodating to them. remember, gay people break a lot, if not all of societies unwritten rules in regards to what men and women should look like, what men and women should act like and what men and women should do such as get married, have kids etc. so when they came out in the 60s it was always going to be a long struggle to change the infrastructures and deep rooted traditions, expectations and gender roles of our societies that were 2000 years in the making to accommodate them.   when gay people came out in the 70s it was like a drag queen busted in on a christmas dinner celebration they spent 2000 years cooking but had no seating or food for the drag queen and have had to frantically and sloppily scramble to accommodate them.   they also saw how their parents generations have oppressed and brutalized minorities like black people and gay people and want absolutely nothing to do with the disgusting sociopathic practice themselves and the fresh memory of the stomach churning oppression, hatred and misery means they are much more inclined to offer the drag queen a seat at their table. we are saying enough is enough of that bullshit and being ""pro-gay"" is to make a statement saying you do not subscribe to the oppressive practices of the past and are for progression and equality and change which is also why gay rights has become a totally partisan political position where ""liberals"" tend to be consistently pro-gay and ""conservatives"" tend to be quite anti-gay. this ""divide and rule"" political aspect of gay rights is definitely one of the reasons we are seeing more of a focus on the media and in the public debate; things like gay rights and equal marriage offer a nice divide and conquer distraction tactic to turn the attention of the masses away from other things like institutional corruption (which just pisses me off on so many levels really because it's such bullshit)   in the 80s we suffered a serious setback with aids because as it was regarded as a ""gay disease"" and so it was used to justify the sentiment ""gay is wrong"" and it probably re-ignited those homophobic ""gay is dirty and diseased"" flairs that lay somewhat stagnant since the uprising. we also lost a lot of lives, which means there is a huge generational gap and my parents generation is missing a lot of gay people who would have been there had things been different. the high body count of gay people in the 80s also meant there were less people to help fight the cause and it allowed society to take a few steps back in regards to lgbt respect with the flourishing of hostile speak like ""that's so gay"" or ""fag"" in the school environment as well as other things.   another crucial aspect of the rise of tolerance of lgbt people is the diminishing of strict gender roles and masculine insecurity; men especially have always been terrified of being perceived to be gay because it's social suicide as to be gay is to be ""fem"" and to be ""fem"" is to be ""weak"". even going to the extent of constructing the ideal of ""meterosexual"" where you can groom yourself with products, dress outlandishly and other ""gay"" stereotypes while retaining your masculine identity and thus retaining your social status as a ""real man"". this is also why ""no homo"" exists. the ""real men wear pink"" campaign a decade or so ago sums it up quite nicely; masculinity is now paradoxically defined by your security within your own masculinity and so men aren't as afraid of being perceived to be gay because of this in addition to the diminishing stigma surrounding actually being gay. the diminishing of the stereotype that all gay men are mega feminine means that the sexism men harbor and their desire to not be seen as ""fem"" or ""weak"" means a man being perceived to be gay is not as stressful for them. sexism is a corner stone of homophobia and masculine insecurity is often at the root of a lot of anti-gay sentiment and bullying; the desire to appear ""macho"" and ""alpha"" combined with the desire to not be seen as gay which is the opposite of ""macho"" and ""alpha"" according to the 1950s standards of masculinity and ""gay"". this explains why typical ""macho"" institutions like sport lag so far behind on gay rights and why you are only gay in certain countries if you are the bottom because that means you are the ""woman"" but if you are top you are the ""man"" and are therefore not gay. you'd be surprised how much homophobia stems from sexism, masculine insecurity and strict gender roles. at this point in time sexism and masculine insecurity are probably 50/50 with religion as causes of homophobia with a good dollop of perpetual ignorance through lack of education, experience or understanding thrown in. gay men also fall into this trap of believing being gay compromises their masculinity, so you see a lot of gay men try to over compensate by being as stereotypically ""macho"" or ""alpha"" as possible in every other possible way.    so as a 22 year old, it seems to me ever since the 60s we have seen a gradual increase in acceptance which is reaching the tipping point right now; despite understanding and education of homosexuality remaining virtually non existent. this gradual increase of acceptance seems to tie in with the gradual increase of visibility and most importantly, the gradual increase of confidence and strength of gay people to hold their head up high instead of cowering in the corner or becoming invisible. these aspects combined with heterosexuals new found empathy and increasing understanding, the realization gay people are born and not made, and the desire to break out of oppressive traditions of the past can all be combined to provide a solid explanation for the surge of attention given to lgbt rights compared to previous generations.  with every new generation, gay kids grow up in a slightly more friendly environment and so take less and less shit. gay people from the 60s would have tolerated shit gay people from the 80s would not, and gay people in the 80s tolerated shit that i would not.   my generation especially do not tolerate any bullshit, and i actually coined a term ""know your place gays"" to distinguish between people who i can only describe as people who have internalized the idea they are second class or sub human and value the convenience of heterosexuals over their own fundamental rights. ""know your place gays"" are people who are so desperate to be accepted by the cool kids they emulate them in every way, even down to their anti-gay opinions. they are people who are desperate to fit in, or people who have internalized and manifested all the nasty shit they've heard to the point they lick the boots of their oppressors. we have seen gay people be the most pathetic door mats in the past, we have seen them lick the boots of their oppressors in their pathetic desperate need for acceptance and we are breaking away from that. my generation of lgbt folk are bashing back and we are bashing back hard, without compromise. this often results in increase of respect but of course can have the opposite effect with the wrong person and cause a violent push back like we saw with the civil rights movement and the kkk, lynching etc. which i think we are starting to see now which is scary but ultimately it will prove to be the death rattle of a homophobic past so bring it on cunt nuggets.   the internet has proven to be absolutely revolutionary when it comes to advancing gay rights since forums and websites that allow communal discussion became possible during the turn of the century; it allowed discussion and education that is otherwise impossible to take place **on a global platform**. i have started many discussions on many websites over the past 10 years or so on lgbt rights and homosexuality, and have worked hard to share information and give people that fundamental education and understanding they were denied in school. myths are easily dispelled, and age old lies crumble in the face of concrete facts that are undeniable.   this discussion and information means people's understanding of homosexuality with anyone who makes use of these resources sky rockets, and the internet as well as media like hollywood or tv has given heterosexuals a much needed injection of empathy to boot.   additionally, during debate on lgbt rights or homosexuality online i can dispel myths, lies and slander with sources and studies that **prove** the homophobe is wrong; this is difficult to achieve outside of the internet. before the internet it was always like ""well everyone has an opinion and it's just a big mystery"" but since the creation of the internet we can actually find information and education and use those sources to prove outright whether something is true or false. it means i can stand up and say you are wrong and i can prove it in front of the whole world.  for me it's no coincidence that the unprecedented surge of lgbt acceptance over the past 15 years or so aligns with the rise of internet based communication, educational resources, online forums and social media. this is why acceptance and understanding of lgbt people has flourished since the turn of the century; good old internet. i couldn't walk up to my brother and spout off this wall of text and expect him to listen; the intrinsic nature of the style of communication in the internet allows me to articulate my thoughts, feelings and opinions and be **listened to for once**, this is simply impossible through other mediums.   so because understanding of homosexuality and lgbt people has been revolutionized thanks to the internet, and because the younger (internet using) generations of heterosexuals have plenty of gay friends, family and role models and are armed with a much better understanding, and because the younger (internet using) gay people have confidence and security within themselves that they never had previously, gay rights have been pushed into the forefront of our consciousness because more people actually care to speak out either for themselves or on behalf of their gay friend or family member who they love.   whereas straight people used to say ""okay"" or ""don't care not my problem"" they are now screaming ""no!"" and whereas gay people used to say ""okay"" or ""i deserve it"" they are now screaming ""no!"" and because gay people have always been the easiest political scapegoat around and the ""culture war"" is still being fought, we are seeing a lot of focus on gay rights right now. that's my take on it anyway. hope i could offer some insight! feel free to correct anything i might have gotten wrong, and if people want to get a solid understanding of how lgbt rights started and progressed i'd highly recommend the stonewall documentary series: ""before stonewall"", the ""stonewall uprising"", and ""after stonewall"". they give you a well rounded insight into how we got here, where we came from, and where we are going.",1,1

275241,"oh ok, yea when i first start any hero i check out a variety of guides because different people come up with different reasons for core items. staying up to date with the meta is also crucial to knowing what to build as updates change how some hero's work and interact with their play style. a small example of that is how people use to say a jungle enigma should build a basilisk for effeciency but now argue that that's obsolete and should build a soul ring for maximum efficiency.   usually core items have a general consensus so once you figure that out you should be good for now. it's always good to be openned to suggestions but don't worry about flamers. if you've done your research and know the reasons why you build the items you do they will have nothing to say.   starting items are pretty standard for the most part but it's good to try and predict who you might be laning up against and buy accordingly. for supports it's pretty standard though and doesnt deviate much from wards, courier, regen and branch if you got the space/cash.   late game items are almost always situational. for example, bkbs ares very standard in pubs, but be aware if the enemy team has a lot of spells that go through bkb such as blackhole, mana void, laso etc. [it's good to take a look at this list.](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/magic_immunity#list_of_abilities_that_will_go_through_magic_immunity) again i try to check out as many guides on a hero as i can and give it all a try just to have a feel.  always do your best to understand what the enemy line up can do. for example if they have a team that has a strong early game but weak stat gains it's good to go for early team fight builds and push them. another example is knowing if their dmg is primarily melee or magic, or mixed and building your defense accordingly. understanding the purpose of what items do will help you make these decisions. i feel like i'm probably at the same level as you so i most likely won't have any ground breaking advice, but i figured i'd just share my experience with you.   last thing that came to my mind is taking part in the weekly item discussions on reddit. those have helped a lot for me. it helped me understand the meta around such items and the dicussion usually invovles understanding how ithe items interact and hold up against other items across different heroes.",0,

995640,"ceph, please feel free to ask me to take this response down -- i just get really excited by this topic, but i understand if it's against the rules for a different person to answer.   **part 1**  gay as a term for homosexual only came into use once people started conceptualizing of sexuality as a singular category. prior to the 1920s, there was a fairly fascinating split on two different axes: first, a split between the way working class and middle class society viewed men who slept with men, and second, a split between how the men in either society viewed their actions. within the working class, there were three well-understood categories of men who slept with men:  *fairies*. these were men who slept only with other men, and were willing to be the receptive partner. they were (fairly) easily identifiable by certain modes of dress (eg., red ties, green suits, a colorful feather in one's hat). they also tended either to naturally exhibit or purposefully adopt feminine habits. according to chauncey's research, some men who were fairies did not actually desire to behave ""femininely""; however, at the time, that was literally the only way in which one could be identified as clearly interested in men, and therefore the only way in which one could attract a masculine partner (more on this later). pre-wwi concepts of sexuality would be very foreign to most westerners today. at the time, and particularly within the working class, your gender presentation was what counted, not your sexual actions. fairies, therefore, were considered a third sex; men who for whatever reason, had a female mind and female characteristics. this concept allowed masculine men to be the penetrative partner with fairies with practically no fear of societal shame, as they were still performing a masculine vs. feminine sexual act with a person who was not of the same sex. i'm going to stop emphasizing this now, but this was a very working-class mode of thinking; the middle class was quite a bit touchier about men who slept with men.  *queers*. this category would arise in conjunction with changing views on the nature of sexuality. queer men were men who wanted to be able to define their attraction as being primarily to men without having to give up a masculine or manly status; that is, they did not want to be boxed into a feminine presentation simply to attract men. the idea was quite revolutionary at the time, as it meant divorcing gendered presentation from sexual behavior.  *trade/rough trade*. this is probably the most confusing category for the modern reader to understand. trade men were considered by everyone to be ""normal"" (what we might call ""straight""). these were usually men in the most masculine of trades -- sailors, soldiers, bricklayers, etc. these men were often known to be quite violent and thuggish, and were acknowledged as sleeping with fairies for sexual gratification. it was generally understood that a man's sexual drive was uncontrollably powerful, and that it needed to be relieved no matter the circumstances; furthermore, female working class partners were generally understood to be for the purpose of procreation; marriage for love or serious attraction was not a true concept yet. therefore, it was expected that many, if not most working class men (particularly italian immigrants) would be trade; that is, retain their masculinity, but be open to the advances of and, in many cases, experience a strong connection to, fairies (who were not considered men due to their feminine presentation). trade were highly coveted by fairies and queers; the ability to seduce a ""normal"" man was a credit to the fairy in question. furthermore, the raw masculinity of trade was highly attractive, and considered the gold standard for a sexual partner.  to summarize so far: the concepts of homosexuality and heterosexuality as we know them did not exist prior to the the 1920s, and were not truly fleshed out until the mid-20th century. gender presentation was what mattered; as long as a man remained the penetrative, masculine partner, he could be considered ""normal,"" or queer at the very least.  **part 2** so, the next question becomes: when and why did the concept of sexuality as a static identity arise? prior to the 1920s-1940s, gendered circles were strictly policed; by this, i mean that there was nowhere near the amount of mixed-sex societal mingling that happens today. women, particularly in new york immigrant communities, were closely guarded by their families until marriage, at which point they would be confined to the home, sometimes partaking in social events with other married women. the public sphere was, for the most part, entirely male. men had only male friends, and women, only women. as society began to become more sex-integrated, many men, particularly in the middle-class, felt that the male sphere was being threatened, and that their masculinity was under assault. in addition to this, an office environment was rapidly becoming the standard workplace for the middle-class man; the difference between the perceived masculinity of he and his working-class counterpart was becoming ever starker.  chauncey argues that this middle-class male insecurity regarding a) the integration of women into the public sphere and b) the loss of job-related masculinity resulted in a new policing of appropriate male behavior. interestingly, and as a total aside, this is what resulted in a sudden fascination with bodybuilding and strength training, which had not to that point been a popular hobby; many men felt the need to emphasize their difference from women in whatever way possible, so becoming highly muscular was an obvious choice. digression aside, chauncey describes middle-class men of the time as seemingly having ""decided"" that the way in which they could retain a perception of themselves as masculine was through touting their solely-women attraction. in essence, if they couldn't be masculine through their jobs, and they couldn't be masculine by excluding women from the public sphere, they could at least distinguish themselves by eschewing the traditional concept of sexuality and enforcing a rigid adherence to opposite-sexed sex.  this, notably, was rather slow to catch on in working-class circles, perhaps because working-class men still felt secure in their masculinity. i would note again, because there is really no way to overstate this, the incredibly all-consuming importance of gendered presentation prior to the mid-20th century. as long as a man could be seen as ""not a woman,"" he could do whatever he liked sexually. it was femininity that was abhorrent, not a particular sexual act. it seems somewhat ridiculous now to suggest that sexuality as an identity arose because of a middle-class macho insecurity, but the pressure to distinguish oneself as anything but feminine was far more extreme than that of which most of us can possibly conceptualize. i would argue that femininity is still widely disdained, by both men and women; but, as evidenced by the fact that a masculine man could sleep with as many men as he liked and be considered ""normal,"" the importance of a masculine presentation in this period was critical to a degree unheard of today.  to summarize: the concept of sexuality as an identity, rather than as an action, did not come into vogue until the 1920s-1930s at the earliest. it was hurried along, in part, by a middle-class male insecurity regarding the dissolution of traditional gender roles.  *gay new york*, george chauncey.",1,

224072,"i'm not going to attempt to justify his behaviour; it is clearly unacceptable. the issue of consent is obviously the biggest one. your bf didn't want to, so he should have stopped. no questions asked.  however-- and this is not to justify anything, but to maybe hope to explain some of his thinking-- there are certain instances where common queer conceptions and common straight conceptions differ. (i am a lesbian, for the record.)  think about the classic ""girl-on-girl"" (barf) scene. maybe the girls are single, but maybe they both have boyfriends; either way, it doesn't really matter because they're *just having fun, tee hee.* it's seen as a way of de-fanging female homosexuality so that it doesn't seem as threatening to male heterosexuality; the male gaze is nearly always heavily, heavily implied. *oh my god, can you imagine what craig would say if he saw us pillow fighting like this? with my boobs out? this is crazy!* even if the boyfriend or boyfriends aren't around, it's implied that this will be a fun, sexy story to be shared later on. again, barf, but this is the metanarrative.  and the thing is... i've hooked up with a decent share of girls who have boyfriends. (not while they're looking, because that's not for me, but i was made aware of their existence ahead of time.) not initiated by me, but by the various girls, probably because they are looking for a story to tell to make them seem cool or avant-garde or progressive or whatever.   i don't usually say no because, well, number one because you get what you get in this lifetime and number two because it's sort of understood to be, uh, ""not cheating"" within this metanarrative. no boyfriend goes after the lesbian with a baseball bat for hitting on his girl, you know? that's not a thing, because female homosexuality isn't seen as having any teeth, like i said. do i like this conception? no, but if i'm going to have to deal with homophobia it may as well pay dividends for me. i remember things getting hot and heavy with a classmate of mine in the bathroom of a house party; then, a while later, i ran into her and her boyfriend (!!!) i didn't say anything, but she was quite content to tell him about it then and there. they weren't in an open relationship, but by both of their accounts, it ""didn't count."" lol, okay.  so, anyway, that brings us to your situation. your bf didn't want to kiss this guy, so he should have respected that; that much is obvious. however, many (not all) straight people do seem to have this idea that casual gay stuff while you're in a committed str8 relationship ""doesn't count"" because it's so highly differentiated-- ie., *it doesn't matter if i suck his dick, honey, because you don't have a dick to suck so there's no comparison.* not saying it's right or wrong or anything. this is just one school of thought which i would say is moderately prevalent. is it a homophobic school of thought, in which ""gay cheating"" doesn't matter as much as ""straight cheating?"" i would say yes, but again: dividends. evidently, it is a school of thought to which your friends apparently subscribe.  now, of course you have every right to be upset. your relationship isn't one which abides by these conditions; your boyfriend didn't want to do this which is worse still. but the things i mentioned are  beliefs which exist in our culture, for better or worse.",1,

""it isn't normal"" (op), in reference to gay marriage. oh, and not to mention he is fucking transphobic. priceless.  i can see right through your thin veil. let's distract people by going off on the ""marriage shouldn't exist"" or ""marriage is a social construct"" tangent, and then saying ""your sexuality does not define you"" to distract people from the original point i was trying to make! this is the circlejerk i am talking about!  &gt; you, you're the creepy fucking weird guy who wears their boy scout uniform day in, day out, just to make sure people know you're a boy scout, like they should care or give a crap.  lol dafuq? wait, so because i decided to call op out on *his very own words*, i am suddenly some evil flamboyant flaming queen who wants everyone to know about his sexuality? please, stop making me laugh. my sides hurt so much right now. i guess we should all just ignore people with stupid opinions, or people who say shit like ""i like gay people as long as i dont know about it, it's totes natural but it isnt so let's just not tell the children about it! oh btw marriage is a social construct lol *continues to not care if heterosexual people get married*.    i'm done with you! how the fuck does your hypocrisy make it possible for you to even look in the mirror each day?   you know what though? people like you are a dying breed. you get to keep your...

i understand i may be downvoted for it, but all of this korrasami talk is bleeding over into the general discussion and i just feel the need to throw my strong opinion in.  &gt;it won't happen. it shouldn't happen. even though it's right/progressive, it is far to controversial for nick to make that jump. it doesn't even fit the story; it's totally distracting. if they included a lesbian romance, you would have to go through the whole adjustment/telling everyone process. how do they react, are they surprised, yada yada yada. it's just totally out of place. most people are just using gay rights as an excuse. they want to see this happen because it's hot. which is fine! i agree. that's what all the fan art and stories and forums are for. trying to shove this into canon is ridiculous. it moves the story in a direction that seemingly comes out of nowhere. shippers try to say that there's grounds because korra and asami interact alot this season. girls can interact without being sexually attracted to one another! also, the creators are dancing around the idea because they know it's tantalizing. that's all they'll do; dance around a notion.   &gt;my ship is no ship. why does every story have to end with a perfect romance? why does every girl need to find a partner? it made sense for aang and katara. you can see that ark throughout the series. they were all each other had. korra has family, friends, mentors, a lot more people in her life. it doesn't need to end in a rushed romance, especially one that is total fan service.  &gt;tl;dr korrasami is hot but makes no sense in the series.  http://www.reddit.com/r/korrasami/comments/2c2f1g/the_official_korrasami_speculation_thread/cjdpz1s  ~~~  /u/expired_bacon  &gt;ugh, shipping korrassami is one of the most annoying things ever... it's never going to happen!  http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2czk1w/episode_10_long_live_the_quen_official_discussion/cjkn1in  ~~~  /u/tiger66261  &gt;this korrasami movement is getting out of control. &gt;i'm going to be blunt. it's not happening. they'll be friends. thats it. &gt;if the idea of korra being bi or gay was something which was carefully written into the show (in an emotional, non-fanservice sort of way from episode 1) i'd be behind this ship 110%. &gt;however, abruptly writing in a new sexual orientation for both korra and asami with no prior development is both terrible character development and bad storytelling. bryan and mike may like to toy with the fanbase, but i know for a fact that they would never take this turn. sorry to break it to you.  http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastairbender/comments/2eaf3o/korrasami_thoughts/cjxkj1f",1,

403089,"a bit cranky today considering all i said was you need to add information to make your post useful to someone else. your story is not a repeatable process therefore not useful without information about the change necessary to make it work under normal circumstances.  &gt; set up two lines, unlimited talk, text, and 1 gb of data per line. monthly total before taxes and phones: $80 monthly installment on two of their cheapest phones: $4 each  &gt; tried to trade in two old crappy phones;  there's a step either before or between these two that is missing: get 2 old crappy phones from somewhere. the only two sprint phones in your story by this point are the two you already had on your sprint account, which i assume were the iphones that show up later. someone could accurately call the $0.99 w/contract sprint phones or their current sprint phone an old crappy phone because they are old models and are usually pretty crappy by spec comparison.  that's the problem with this post: phones appeared from nowhere whenever they are needed instead of being picked up or explained in prior steps. if you fix that, it'll be usable. until then, directions unclear: penis stuck in generation 1 moto razr.  &gt; why are you so apprehensive toward my post?  it's missing a step. without that step, it doesn't work because the person following it ends up stuck on t-mobile with no sprint phone to switch back to sprint on a no-contract plan with. that's the source of my apprehension: it produces a result significantly worse than the one described if it is followed as written except in case of extreme luck. a lot of people come to this subreddit when they're practically broke and need something. if that something is a cheaper cell plan and they follow this, they don't end up with what they came for. for some people coming here, the difference comes out of their food budget.  &gt; i'm pretty sure bragging online about anything is as lame as can be.  you'd be surprised how often it happens in this subreddit. some guy posts that he bought a washing machine for $10 at a garage sale without thinking that noone else can possibly do anything with that information.",0,

247046,"dude, i get what you're saying. i, too, would cringe at the american college-style force feeding of 'tolerance', 'feminism', 'rainbow this', 'rainbow that'. i don't feel a special connection to trans people and certainly not to militant lesbians.  i'd like to show you - and other people here, apparently - some day that we're (yes, we're) not all like that. i like men, yes. men, i said. just like the majority of homosexuals: if i wanted to be with a girl, i'd be straight. those 'types' of gay guys aren't appealing to a lot of us, trust me. why go for a semi-girl if you like men? catch my drift?  therefore, the people that throw their sexuality in your face aren't very popular in the gay community when it comes to partners and dates.   i'm a business man and still play soccer in my old club where everyone slowly learned that i have a boyfriend, not a girlfriend - nobody stood up to declare themselves straight, so i didn't see a reason to stand up and tell everyone in a self-important way that i was gay.   i value my family and i don't choose my friends based on their sexuality. do i have gay friends? sure, and i am glad i do - we share a common interest, so to speak. but i have more heterosexual male friends, who see me as one of the boys and mostly just as a valued friend. i'm from a rural low-middleclass area and still have friends from there.  so what's the difference? well, i'm not ... an annoying tumblr cunt. annoying people will always be annoying. if these guys were straight, they'd be white knighting their vegan female friends (i hope you understand this rough analogy ...) and be just as annoying to you. lots of my gay friends vote conservative.  believe me, you probably know gay people that you actually like. you just don't know they're gay because a lot of us are really boringly normal guys who happen to sleep with other guys. which certainly has its perks - i wouldn't trade if there was a pill making me straight.   i hope this clears some of it.",1,

885623,"this is highly dependent on the couple and how they feel about it. i personally am not a jealous person.  i feel like ""swinging"" shouldn't be a problem. i have friends that i’d be willing to make jokes, i would never make around other friends. i will go for dinner, or a movie or out for a day with some friends that i wouldn’t do with other people. to me sex should be seen in this same light.   things such as condoms, the pill, and plan b, offer a large amount of protections from accidents (stds and pregnancy both). sex is something that should be fun, and it something that is emotional (no matter how much some say it’s not). hanging out with friends and telling jokes, stories, listening to someone vent, or venting to someone, these are all emotion and offer the chance to be fun. so if you are free enough to have a good laugh with someone, maybe even a good cry with someone, then why is sex something that is so off limits?   the analytical part of me (which drives my wife crazy most of the time), says that there should be no differentiation from going to a comedy club, going to a long dinner, spending the night in joking, and sex for the sake of fun, or possibly emotional release.   then the analytical part of me says, “if you are willing to make jokes and hang out with friends, and sex is not much different, then whether they are male or female, shouldn’t make a difference either.”   the thought of stroking of my best friend or something more graphic i’m not willing to think about, makes the heterosexual part of me say, “oh… that’s… that’s not going to happen.” in reality if swinging were to become more mainstream, homosexuality would have to be looked at less as homosexuality, and more as open sexuality. to categorize sexuality has hetero, homo, or bi, is only going to further perpetuate the idea of not “being one of them” or of being “one of those people.”    the bonds of labeling are to imbedded in our society, the 1%, black, mexican, straight, gay, bi, lesbian, etc. it’s all over and it’s not going away. sexuality has change much over 50 years even, and people are more open about their sex lives, and it’s acceptable to be open about it in many places now. i think that with time, and with some eliminations of labeling, the feeling of we are humans and it’s okay to have fun with humans, could come about and “swinging” will be an everyday thing for most people.   with all of this said, i grew up learning that sex and relationships being a very intimate thing... and the idea of another person doing some of the things that i've done with my wife, with her, just makes my blood boil, and i have to say ""no fuck that shit…it ain’t happening, and i won’t do that to anyone else because of my love for her.”    special note*  safety in sex is always important, and that will always be a deterrent for some. no matter if you are a swinger on not, always be safe when it comes to sex. a child shouldn’t have a shitty life because you decided you couldn’t get off without a condom, and you shouldn’t have to go through life with a new disease because you were lazy.",1,

769274,"feminine gay men in the early 20th century were known as ""pansies"" or ""sissies"" and masculine homosexuals as ""rough trade"" with lesbians being ""butch"" or ""femme"" in general, and not all couples would have such a set up, but they generally would hook up with ""rough trade"" who were masculine men, often married and considered heterosexual but were in the closet. not all ""rough trade"" were closeted but many were, thinking they were a heterosexual who likes to have a good time. homosexuality wasn't something you are, it was something heterosexuals did which was bad. then it became more established as a pathalogical thing with psychiatry  in the 50s a motocycle group formed in la called the satyrs who were masculine and rode motobikes and wore leather and all that, tom of finland would produce erotic illustrations featuring masculine men, and in the late 70s to the 80s the ""castro clone"" look became popular to establish masculine identity. during the early 20th century people didn't know much about sexuality or gender. gay people who weren't gender nonconforming were often very confused because they thought all gay men had to be ""sissies"" and vice versa due to the media; gay men like troy perry would rationalise to themselves they weren't gay because he wasn't a sissy and this was quite commonplace until everything was allowed to be crystalised and it was like okay we have homosexuals, drag queens, transgender, masculine gay guys, feminine gay guys, masculine gay women, people in between etc.   (obviously because it is quite complicated and impossible to define in the shadows people really didn't know anything about who they were or who we were; so in the early 20th century especially it was expressed in ways that from our perspective is quite hard to understand or explain)  there's a brief summary of this history at http://lgbtlibrary.imgur.com/",1,
825884,"this right here is a cult classic, a chef d'oeuvrea buried under erroneous preconceptions and unfounded criticism. this gem is obscured because it does not shine; it is buried because its tone is that of abyssal black. sakura trick pries into to the darkest corners of our subconscious, the most visceral of our cognition, the most carnal of our urges, and the most primal of our instincts. its sublimity will ever be debated yet always remain objectively irrefutable; the fundamental insight it provides into human and perhaps animalistic nature may shape the basis of sexual psychoanalysis for millennia to come.   superficially, sakura trick appears to be an anime which caters to the most lowly and deprived among men; conceited critics dismiss it as such often without a second thought. as self-important as these self-proclaimed critics are, they fail to realize that sakura trick is indeed a trick, and they are the ones being tricked. sakura petals, or cherry blossoms, are commonly associated with a sense of beauty and innocence in japanese culture. as discussed by ango sakaguchi in sakura no mori no mankai no shita, sakura petals are often a means to enhance and stylize the atmosphere of a scene, be it melancholic, resplendent or sensual. used famously in 5 centimeters per second, the sakura petals constructs an immense yet artificial atmosphere which proved successful in fooling the average fool incapable of critical analysis. what most critics fail to realize, however, is that sakura trick is playing them beyond this level. the entire visible layer of sakura trick is a euphemistic veil obfuscating the dark and uncanny human psyche which it explores; any tangible material is a metaphor for its meticulous meta-analysis of the metaphysical mentality’s pubertal metamorphosis.   as brilliantly put by charles baudelaire, “la sexualité est le lyrisme des masses.” in ulysses, james joyce subverts gender conceptions by deconstructing sexual stereotypes; in lolita, vladimir nobakov delves into the abnormal perversion of hebephilia; in doctor glas, hjalmar soderberg studies sexual catharsis through murder; in aquarion evol, shoji kawamori studies the manifestation of repressed sexuality as love. time and again, great thinkers have demonstrated the immense potential of sexual psychoanalysis in narrative form.   sakura trick fulfills this potential.   the exterior plotline of sakura trick is straight forward - two damsels unknowingly in love with each other: sonoda yuu and takayama haruka, start high school in the same class with four other apparent lesbians. this premise alone poses innumerable questions of pertinence - most of which are problematized further and explored as the series progresses. why are two girls romantically interested in each other? why are there four more girls of questionable sexual orientation in their class? were they perhaps influenced by haruka’s and yuu’s display of intimacy, implying a nurture over nature determination of sexuality? do their behaviors suggest abnormalities in their amygdala activity, or is such behavior governed by the wider cerebral hemispheres? hailed as the father of psychoanalysis, sigmund freud once said, “the sexual life of adult women is a dark continent for psychology.” the stringency and inadaptability of the traditional approach practiced by psychologists is to blame for this. sakura trick is unshackled from such rigidities - by investigating high school girls in late puberty, a time and setting in which sexuality is at its most volatile, and doing so through homosexuality rather than the vapid norm, it sheds light on the enigma which has eluded psychologists for centuries.   perhaps most imperative and counter-intuitive of all, sakura trick investigates male sexuality through the scope of lesbianism. je veux te baiser, baisez-moi! what is the sexual appeal in a couple which can only engage in abortive reproduction? when exposed to intercourse in explicit yuri, it is plausible that lust for the opposite gender can override the notion of evolutionary feasibility. despite the lack of explicit intercourse in sakura trick, male viewers nonetheless experience a craving for the girls’ well-being instead of jealousy and contempt for one of them as would be rational. this paradox challenges not only the darwinian theories of evolution, but also freud’s theories of sexuality. he wrote, “a man's heterosexuality will not put up with any homosexuality, and vice versa.” sakura trick proves the exact contrary: heterosexual men more than put up with the homosexuality in the series. according to psychologist henry havelock ellis, “reproduction… is highly complex and not yet clearly understood. it is not necessarily connected with sex, nor is sex necessarily connected with reproduction.” havelockian philosophy noticeably makes its mark in sakura trick; by taking hold of this anomaly in human behaviour and untangling its implications, it explores the darkest depths of our consciousness which borders between flesh and mind.   in his essay the sexual abberations, freud discusses human disposition to perversions, including hebephilia, as an original and universal disposition of the human sexual instinct which is not limited to the psychologically ill. sakura trick takes this theory beyond mere discourse and puts it into practice. the characters in sakura trick are impeccably crafted, not only in their characterization and likability but primarily in their support of the series’ psychological study. rather than each being equipped with sexually inviting traits, some characters are simply “cute”, for lack of a less vulgar word. a certain je ne sais quoi of the girls are successful in generating not just physical, but more importantly emotional cravings from the audience.   the brilliant technique of sakura trick’s probing into the atavistic lust is most aptly demonstrated through the analysis of the two main characters: haruka and yuu. on the one hand, haruka is characterized by her lascivious and manipulative personality, pneumatic figure, seductive voice, and red hair indicative of her prurience. in contrast, yuu has an innocent demeanor, underemphasized curves, a sweet voice characterized by childlike tenderness, and bright amber hair adorned with flowers – all of which are suggestive of a girl in the early stages of puberty. by contrasting these dichotomous traits, sakura trick follows in the wake of vladimir nobakov and his analysis of the abominable erotic attraction to the so called “nymphets”. a range of recent research by neurologists suggest paedophilia’s origin as a deep-rooted predisposition that does not change, rather than the previous theory of causation by psychological influences. perhaps influenced by this paradigm shift, sakura trick attempts what has never been done before – bringing out, in men, pseudo-paedophilic reactions to girls older than the previously stipulated plateau age of thirteen. this is achieved through the stark contrast between haruka’s maturity and yuu’s infantility which tampers with the viewers’ preset dispositions. the additional fact that it succeeds in bringing out such abnormal responses not only in the susceptible older population, but chiefly among the young, truly underscores the groundbreaking impact of sakura trick.  la peinture parle d'elle-même, il n'y a rien à dire; to describe the artistic qualia of sakura trick would be to describe colour to the blind, wisdom to the young, or life to the unliving. the artistic eminence of this series is utterly unparalleled. the visuals are primarily based on a minimalistic design reminiscent of frank stella’s later paintings, yet some of the most visceral moments of the series display a paradoxical resemblance to abstract expressionism. this visual style is augmented by subtly and tactfully altering its background or occasionally foreground objects into abstract patterns or drawings depending on the situation and atmosphere. certain patterns such as polka dots reoccur frequently throughout the series, showing inspirations from early pop-art but crafting a style most avant la lettre. in a masterful display of expertise in art-direction, these aesthetic shifts are extremely frequent yet uncontrived and never interfere with the viewers’ immersion. this enigmatic and radical style vividly complements the metaphysical nature of the series, reinforcing its character as an original pastiche of the post-modernist movement. it is an embodiment and perfection of the ideals that shaft had in mind for but failed to accomplish in their shows such as the monogatari series and sayonara zetsubou sensei.

351240,"i hate the premise of the title but lets look through this.   &gt;years later, someone told me of his disparaging description of me displaying my new-found femininity “proud as a peacock.”  how is that disparaging? there has to be some context here or this is just whining about nothing.  &gt;bisexuals and transgenders, however, include all sorts of groups with radically unconventional lives: polyamorites, pansexuals, sado-masochists, radical faeries, drag queens, she-males, heterosexual crossdressers, working-class transvestite prostitutes, gender benders, genderqueers. many of these bisexual and transgender people have little in common with the modern construction of middle-class gay and lesbian identities. when leaders of the u.s. glbt movement began to confront the inconsistent interests of the bisexual and transgender people with whom they were now allied in the “glbt movement,” they were faced with a political problem. having included bisexuals and transgenders in the coalition, how could they at the same time argue that glbt people are “just like you,” wanting the same middle-class lives as other u.s. voters (with the single exception of a same-sex partner) while being required to politically embrace polyamory and a man in a dress?  really dislike the way the idea of a sexual deviant is dumped onto bisexuals or that the listed things are even similar. polyamory has nothing to do with acting or dressing a certain way or having some fetish.   &gt;i suggest that gays and lesbians who discriminate against bisexuals and transgenders are reacting to political and social pressures, not psychological ones.  i think this is the only interesting point in the entire paper. some discrimination may exist in this regard but it is not valid because heterosexual couples are the primary actors in any of these behaviors. wanting to distance sexual orientation from uncommon sexual behavior may come off as phobic to these 2 groups but only if you first stereotype those groups as such. this is the entire point of the gay rights movement, that the attraction is not attached to the behavior and the fact that this author thinks that the actions are inherently bisexual is a huge problem. it is helping to reinforce a stereotype onto bisexuals which causes the problems mentioned.  &gt;this “horrible illness of the mind” is a reference to homosexuality. in this way, she attempts to avoid the severe mid-century stigma of homosexuality, as did many transsexuals of the time.  yup, the early example of a trans-person already showing how transgender is homohpobic.  .  .  .  my opinion of this paper is that it has no point. to me it seems like a grocery list. here is a list of things please read. it has a single good point nested in the middle  that gay men and women do not have the same kind of phobia towards b and t as the outside has towards the group as a whole but the idea that the discrimination directed at b and t is the same is ridiculous. gays might steer clear of bisexuals for relationships because there is that nagging feeling that the other person might want a family one day but the refusal to recognize gender identity is simply that. the concluding paragraph seems to be attempting to make a point but i dont see what it is.",1,

483117,"well, from this response i don't think that we are that far off from one another. i don't like the purely superfluous nudity and i do not like the practice of shaping a show around what is the most likely to get ratings. the primary scene that comes to mind with regards to unnecessary nudity is when littlefinger is monologuing in season 1, and they have him doing it while teaching ros how to engage in lesbian sex that would be appealing from the male perspective. i actually found that to be really distracting from his character development. that said, i am not sure i fully agree with you on the examples you chose because i do think in these instances the nudity did achieve something related to the story-line.   &gt; theon being tortured is very very important to his character. having missandi be naked isn't.   it's been a while since i last watched, but i am assuming that you are alluding to the scene where missandei is washing herself catches greyworm watching? i think that particular interaction was pretty strong at developing the storyline between her and greyworm - as an unsullied, it is hard to know where greyworm stands in regards to sexuality. this scene clearly indicates that despite being a eunich, he is capable of experiencing sexual feelings. it also puts into further context just how horrible the unsullied have it. i don't know what the greyworm/missandei story will build into, but it could end up being important.  &gt; having sansa be tortured by joffrey and cersei is the catalyst for her character development. melisandre being naked in the tub when she talks about stuff isn't.  i think that actually taught us a lot about selyse and it really showed the power dynamic in that relationship. could you ever imagine selyse being comfortable with *any* other person behaving in this way around her? it showed that there is absolutely no chance that mel is ever going to be removed from the driver's seat by the hands of selyse. could this have been done without nudity? perhaps. but i found this particular exchange powerful and i don't see a need to change it.  sexuality is a very important part of the game of thrones story - hell, the entire story wouldn't be taking place if it wasn't for an incestuous couple that happened to be from the one of the world's most powerful families. for that reason, the large amount of nudity makes sense to me. but the way the nudity is delivered clearly tries to pander to a straight male audience exclusively and that is quite frustrating - i think the show can do better than that. in instances where a male *should* be nude (such as when they are having or have just had sex), they are either clothed or they are under sheets while the women is fully exposed. it is a bit of a let down because one of the things that i like about game of thrones is that it doesn't usually shy away from the blunt realities that would occur in a world such as this one. but i think that they have gone the exact opposite direction with male nudity. i don't like the inconsisitency.",1,
315250,"downvoting is for faggots.    anyway:  &gt; regnerus said it was true that he studied “children who grew up in stably coupled married households versus kids who grew up in unstable households,” and that in reality he only found about a dozen out of 248 children raised by a parent who had a “same-sex romantic relationship” who lived with their mother and mother’s lesbian partner for at least 10 years. he blamed this discrepancy, however, on the fact that it was difficult to find stably coupled same-sex families – not on his methodology.  the guy took the typical homo-parent experience and the typical hetero-parent experience and he's being castigated for not using cherry-picked exceptions in his study.    let's look at the other side's approach.  the first page of search results brings up several links [referring to a study by benjaminnn sieeegellll](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/27/sorry-justice-scalia-theres-no-evidence-that-gay-parents-arent-great-parents/).  when i say say ""study"" i don't mean he did any research of his own.  he just studied the literature and boiled it down for us.   ok, great, whatever.  &gt; the best study, siegel said, is the national longitudinal lesbian family study, which began in 1986 with 154 lesbian mothers who conceived children through artificial insemination. a recent look at 78 offspring found that the children did fine — better, even, than children in a similar study involving more diverse families.  that sounds like a good study.  they probably did a much better job of sampling than mean old conservative mark regnerus!  [or not](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-010-9692-2/fulltext.html).  &gt; lesbian couples were collected through ""informal networking and word of mouth referrals"" but participation was also ""solicited via announcements at lesbian events, in women's bookstores, and at lesbian newspapers."" the couples were recruited – not from representative samples – but from three metropolitan areas: boston, washington and san francisco.  &gt; these women were nearly all white (94%), middle- and upper-class (82%), and college educated (67%). eighty-two percent held professional or managerial positions. the majority were in their mid-thirties at the beginning of the study.   &gt; so these are highly motivated lesbian mothers, gathered through what researchers call snowball or convenience samples via the political lesbian culture, they are told the nature of the study – allowing each respondent to easily ascertain the social, political and academic importance of the effort – and all interested callers volunteered and were adopted into the study. it begs considering whether these realities have any impact on the fact that the study as maintained a remarkable 93% retention rate over its fifteen year history.  regnerus himself comments:  &gt; the bottom line is that snowball samples are nice for undergrads to learn about data collection, but hardly high-quality when you're a professional sociologist working on a complex research question with significant public ramifications. it's not fair, not even close, to compare parenting and child outcomes from a national probability sample of hetero parents and a snowball sample of lesbian parents.   the actual data is so squeaky-clean (zero incidence of physical or sexual abuse, one claim of verbal abuse across the entire sample, average age of first sexual contact for females is an astounding 20, and so on) that anyone familiar with the broader literature should be smelling bullshit at first glance.    dig deeper and the smell only gets stronger:  &gt; the nllsf found ""significant difference"" in family dissolution rates between the lesbian and mother/father headed families over the years of the study. the lesbian homes broke up at much higher rates compared with heterosexual families (56% vs. 36%).   &gt; ... numerous studies have long shown that family instability and divorce have substantial negative and long-term consequences for child well-being. ... but here is the other remarkable finding from the nllfs: within the lesbian family sample, no…differences were found among adolescent  offspring…whose mothers were still together and offspring whose mothers had separated. 25  &gt; ...  &gt; remarkable. however, the nllfs fails to note how this finding is strongly at odds with the larger body of literature on family dissolution and child well-being. and this ""no-effect"" finding from the break-up of lesbian homes surely results from the remarkably small sample size utilized than lack of true effect.  __bottom line:__ the regnerus study may conflate homosexuality and instability but it at least uses recognized methods for sample and control group selection and is performed by a published researcher in the field.  meanwhile, the supposed ""best"" orthodox study is straight-up propaganda from a lesbian activist that just aggregates testimonials from other militant lesbians.",1,1

400810,"there are like so many examples though starting from the early seasons (and i don't count him dating carmen as one since you're right, she's a woman):  - in the modeling episode, rex takes off his shirt and mac very obviously checks him out and then explains that rex's body won't quit and that if you took off his pants, you'd probably find a bird that won't quit.  - all of mac &amp; dennis break up. (there's [this deleted scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnf63sz2eyo) if this ep isn't gay enough for you already.)  - if you listen to [this commentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yn5avvemy), charlie is trying to get dr. drew to admit that mac and dennis are in a gay relationship and even says ""there's no arguing that they are closeted homosexuals,"" and rob only chimes in to say stuff like ""is mac even in the closet?"" and ""i want to see myself inside of [dennis]."" i know it's a commentary but it shows how the creators see these characters and their relationship (they've talked about it other times too).    - mac wrote a love letter to chase utley and also starved himself to look good before meeting him.  - got a boner miming sex with dennis in the nightman cometh.  - have you heard him go on about beefcakes?  - watches dennis's sex tapes (though i guess not anymore, rip dennis's ""life work."" dennis even says in the new ep that his tapes are partly ""for mac and charlie""). i can't remember the episode but at one point they watch one together with frank and all become aroused. he also admits watching them in mac's banging the waitress.  - has watched dennis bang in the bunker. (i think this comes from the storm episode.)  - says he ""hates women"" a couple of times. definitely in the movie episode, there's one time where charlie says ""yeah we know that you feel that way"" but i can't remember when.  - feels dennis's nips and puts his pubes on his face and gets dennis's balls in his mouth in the manhunter episode.   - gets all defensive and confused about gay stuff in mac fights gay marriage.   - mimes blowing dennis in the dance competition.  - for sure has a crush on dolph lundgren.   - in this kitten mittons ep, the alcohol gun scene is staged to look like mac is jerking it and then coming into dennis's open mouth, and like the whole thong scene... so hetero.  - in the gang cracks the liberty bell, mac &amp; dennis are tarred and feathered for being ""sodomites.""  - everyone in the gang is very excited to see a dude hang dong in thundergun express (if we're making a parallel list of examples that dennis is bi, we also have ""4 extra seconds dedicated to the dong scene, that's what i'm thankful for!"" in the gang squashes their beefs)  - the whole premise of the gang gets a new member is basically that compared to an actual hetero bro, mac and dennis look queer and weird, and schmitty openly is like ""haha what?"" to everything they do (flowers, candles, choosing his meals, matching rings, etc.). at one point he asks point blank if they are trying to bang him and mac laughs way too hard so dennis shushes him and says something like ""stop or he's gonna think...""  - in mac's banging the waitress, charlie and dennis misconstrue that mac wants to bang them (which isn't what's happening), but they aren't surprised at all and at the end of the episode are like ""he still wants to bang us though right?"" mac also comments that dennis has great thighs.  - then there's seasons 8 &amp; 9: mac tries to kiss dennis in the gang recycles their trash, dennis tries his weird rat seduction thing on mac in flowers for charlie and they almost kiss, mac has a fantasy that dennis will cry over his dead body as he ascends to beefcake heaven, dennis &amp; mac wrestle naked in lw6 (""it's a love story between two men""), mac day, the gang dines out, mac has seen dennis's dick tricks and won't stop talking about them (""you gotta stop talking about dicks, it's just getting too much at this point""), etc. they got real obvious with it these seasons.   - i don't know how canonical the book is, but in it mac describes his fantasies about getting banged by 5 dudes at the same time in a chapter called ""here's how straight i am,"" and then explains that getting a boner from beefcakes is just a hetero appreciation of muscles. (for what it's worth, the book also indicates that dennis is non-binary, which like, please. i want some gender issues to come out as he spirals wildly out of control.)  these are things that on any other sitcom would just be like ""haha these bros4life did something gay! no homo though!"" but on this show part of the joke is that they happen &amp; they happen often because the characters actually aren't heterosexual, they only think they are ([charlie could also be included since he's pretty much asexual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og3xrol51qi)). dennis and mac are eventually gonna fuck i'm pretty sure.",1,

875786,"&gt;1) bisexual men in hetero relationships using gay men for sex and doing nothing to be out or support gay rights in any way but when its time for an orgasm....  the same behavior is true of closeted homosexuals, and likely more common given that bisexuals can be sexually satisfied with opposite gender partners but homosexuals can't. it's only more common among bisexuals because fewer bisexuals are out, but ultimately that's just a reason to not date people who aren't out.  &gt;lesbians actually often have horrible experiences with bisexual women not because the bisexuals are jerks or have a mental illness or are just cheaters as happens with all people, but becuase of their bisexuality. do not tell me this doesn't happen a lot. it does.   not being out and not having a supportive environment are correlated with mental illness. again, good reason to not date people who aren't out, but if you want to look at why bisexuals have higher incidences of mental illness, suicide, self-sabatouging behavior, and other related issues then monosexuals including perhaps the answer is to look at those that discriminate against us.  yes it happens, but that's not a reason to systematically discriminate against us and the answer remains ""date people who are out"".  &gt;3) there are more bisexuals in swinging/open/poly or whatever relationships (http://polyinthemedia.blogspot.nl/2013/04/bi-and-poly-connection-and-numbers.html[1] ) then in a loving relationship with a same sex partner (http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/02/20/among-lgbt-americans-bisexuals-stand-out-when-it-comes-to-identity-acceptance/[2] ). not saying there is anything wrong with that. but homos are not necessarily going to relate to a bisexual woman that f$#%s women with her husband. do we have to be brow beaten and accused and guilt tripped for being biphobic monosexists if we just don't feel we have anything in common with you?  open relationships and polyamorous relationships are loving, they're just not monogomous. if you don't want to be with somebody in an open or poly relationship, don't be with somebody in that situation. that doesn't somehow make us fundamentally different.   &gt;4) constant whining of bi erasure. any gay man or lesbian that is not a total flamer or a bulldyke gets assumed to be straight. my fiancé and i are femme. we get ""erased' all the time. bfd. we all get erased. its not a horrendous tragedy. its not erasure you should be wailing about so much that hurts you. its the bisexual closet most of you choose to stay in.  you misunderstand what people are complaining about when we complain about bi erasure. it's not simple underrepresentation, **it's denying the sexuality of out bisexuals**, claiming that they are either straight or gay and will ""grow out of it"" or are ""in denial"", hence ""erasure"" as opposed to ""underrepresentation"".   out of your complaints the first two are legitimate and both have systematic causes rooted in discrimination against bisexuals.",1,
253351,"yup.  &gt;the 2003-2004 gay/lesbian consumer online census surveyed the lifestyles of 7,862 homosexuals. of those involved in a ""current relationship,"" only 15 percent describe their current relationship as having lasted twelve years or longer, with five percent lasting more than twenty years.[4] while this ""snapshot in time"" is not an absolute predictor of the length of homosexual relationships, it does indicate that few homosexual relationships achieve the longevity common in marriages.  &gt;in the sexual organization of the city, university of chicago sociologist edward laumann argues that ""typical gay city inhabitants spend most of their adult lives in 'transactional' relationships, or short-term commitments of less than six months.""[5]  &gt;**a study of homosexual men in the netherlands published in the journal aids found that the ""duration of steady partnerships"" was 1.5 years.[6]**  &gt;***in male and female homosexuality, saghir and robins found that the average male homosexual live-in relationship lasts between two and three years.[8]***  &gt;**research indicates that the average male homosexual has hundreds of sex partners in his lifetime**  &gt;**the dutch study of partnered homosexuals, which was published in the journal aids, found that men with a steady partner had an average of eight sexual partners per year.[12]**  &gt;***bell and weinberg, in their classic study of male and female homosexuality, found that 43 percent of white male homosexuals had sex with 500 or more partners, with 28 percent having one thousand or more sex partners.[13]***  &gt;***in their study of the sexual profiles of 2,583 older homosexuals published in the journal of sex research, paul van de ven et al. found that ""the modal range for number of sexual partners ever [of homosexuals] was 101-500."" in addition, 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent had between 501 and 1,000 partners. a further 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent reported having had more than one thousand lifetime sexual partners.[14]***  &gt;a survey conducted by the homosexual magazine genre found that 24 percent of the respondents said they had had more than one hundred sexual partners in their lifetime. ***the magazine noted that several respondents suggested including a category of those who had more than one thousand sexual partners.[15]***  &gt;a canadian study of homosexual men who had been in committed relationships lasting longer than one year found that only 25 percent of those interviewed reported being monogamous."" according to study author barry adam, ***""gay culture allows men to explore different...forms of relationships besides the monogamy coveted by heterosexuals.""[16]***  &gt;the journal aids reported that men involved in relationships engaged in anal intercourse and oral-anal intercourse with greater frequency than did those without a steady partner.[39] anal intercourse has been linked with a host of sexually transmitted diseases, including aids.  &gt;a study of steady and casual male homosexual relationships in amsterdam found that ""steady partners contribute to (hiv) incidence more than casual partners. this can mainly be explained by the fact that risky behavior with steady partners is much greater than that with casual partners (30 versus 1.5 uai [unprotected anal intercourse] acts annually).""[41]  &gt;***the assumption that lesbians involved in exclusive sexual relationships are at reduced risk for sexual disease is false:***  &gt;the journal sexually transmitted infections concludes: **""the risk behavior profile of exclusive wsw (women who have sex with women) was similar to all wsw.""[43] one reason for this is because lesbians ""were significantly more likely to report past sexual contact with a homosexual or bisexual man and sexual contact with an idu (intravenous drug user).""[44]**  &gt;a twins study that examined the relationship between homosexuality and suicide, published in the archives of general psychiatry, found that homosexuals with same-sex partners were at greater risk for overall mental health problems and were **6.5 times more likely than their twins to have attempted suicide. the higher rate was not attributable to mental health or substance abuse disorders.[45]**  &gt;in a survey of 1,099 lesbians, the journal of social service research found that slightly more than **half of the lesbians reported that they had been abused by a female lover/partner. the researchers found that ""the most frequently indicated forms of abuse were verbal/emotional/psychological abuse and combined physical-psychological abuse.""[47]**  &gt;**the national violence against women survey, sponsored by the national institute of justice, found that ""same-sex cohabitants reported significantly more intimate partner violence than did opposite-sex cohabitants. thirty-nine percent of the same-sex cohabitants reported being raped, physically assaulted, and/or stalked by a marital/cohabitating partner at some time in their lifetimes, compared to 21.7 percent of the opposite-sex cohabitants. among men, the comparable figures are 23.1 percent and 7.4 percent.""[50]**

379665,"well, sure. i'll give you an illustration.  ^((i'll preface this by saying a couple things. first, there really are a shitload of studies about media's influence on society, but i don't think that compiling them will really influence your opinion all that much. second, i am completely aware that the previous sentence is used more or less verbatim by people with no argument, and i apologize for that, but it is true both that said studies exist and that i feel like an actual account would be more illuminating in any case.)^)  so, i'm gay. how gay am i? i'm *very* gay. i'm so gay that i came close to tears one night because i couldn't get over how [beautiful janelle monáe is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqmorihntn4). but for quite a long time i thought i was asexual and aromantic.  forgive me for profiling, for a minute, but given your stance on this issue and the fact that you're a reddit user, i'm going to assume that you're a white, heterosexual, cisgendered (i.e., not trans\*) man. and that's great! everyone's gotta be something, and it's particularly nice to be all four of those things in our (western, us) society. i share three of those qualities, and life is [honestly pretty nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipvg4vgpwac)!   but our culture is really thoroughly aimed at people who are *all* of those things. when you're not all of those things—even if you just miss out on one of them (and, of course, they have very different weights, particularly in how they combine—being a white gay in the united states is much, much easier than being, say, a ugandan trans woman living in the us)—it's pretty evident! you notice things that the target audience just takes for granted.  our culture is *full* of stories about heterosexuals. packed to the brim. heterosexuality is ""the norm"" for us. there are romance movies about heterosexuals, of course, but also family dramas about heterosexuals, action movies about heterosexuals, thrillers about heterosexuals—the works. that is to say, there are movies with straight people that are *not about being straight*. the hardboiled police chief has a picture of his wife on his desk, john mcclane was divorcing his wife, and neo falls in love with trinity. but there's no story imperative for these people to be straight. hell, neo should probably be *a*sexual, given the jesus parallels. ^((i'll get back to your marketing point in a minute)^)  now, look at stories about gay people. it's gotten a lot better, especially in recent years, but there's still a very present trend. *milk* is about a gay politician. *brokeback mountain* is about gay shepherds who wrestle with their homosexuality. *glee* is about social outcasts (ostensibly because of their identity and not because they're a bunch of whiny shitheads). *blue is the warmest color* is about a woman accepting her lesbianism. same with *but i'm a cheerleader.* the gay couple in *modern family* are there to provide diversity. these stories are *about homosexuality*. don't get me wrong, i totally appreciate that, and it's nice to see that they're being published (and are, *mostly*, good), but the gayness *does* have an imperative. *brokeback mountain* with a heterosexual couple would just be a [shitty nicholas sparks movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2726560/). the emotional depth would be completely excised, because it is *fundamentally* a story about the repression arising from being gay in the sixties.   straight people in movies don't have that imperative. would *blade runner* be tangibly different if harrison ford made out with a male android instead of a female one? not really. his sexuality itself is incidental to the plot. it's *fundamentally* a story about identity and ethics, as explored through the tale of a guy who kills robots. and it's a great story, don't get me wrong. but this is the point i was trying to make in my initial reply, which is that it's not a fault with any one story but with *all* stories being a certain way. look at the list of openly [lgbt characters](http://whatculture.com/film/10-greatest-gay-male-characters-movie-history.php) in film—there are lots of leads from movies about being gay, and then even more sidekicks and comedic bit parts from straight-people movies. if you're a gay kid, you get to *only ever* see yourself as a hairdresser, a tearful and overwrought teenager, or a bedridden aids patient. and that sucks!  if you're a straight, white, cisgender boy, it's not at all hard to put yourself in the place of pretty much any lead character, because our characters are overwhelmingly straight, white, cisgender men. but if you're not, there's a very real barrier. it's not that there's a movie that says ""only straight people can be action heroes."" of course there isn't. but the fact that there are pretty much no gay action heroes ^((i say ""pretty much"" because i can't think of any high-profile ones, i'm sure that some indie film somewhere has a gay gunslinger)^) gives an overwhelming sense that gay people just aren't cut out for all that saving-people nonsense.   defeat the bad guy, get the girl: it's trite, but writers *almost exclusively use it*. movies (blockbusters in particular, i'm aware that chick flicks are a thing) are written for straight guys, and what straight guys wanna see is hot ladies. did megan fox's presence add anything to *transformers*? no, it could have been a sexy lamp. but she's there, she leans against some motorcycles, and she makes out with shia laboef. if you're a gay kid watching this, you see that part of being cool and hanging out with giant robots is making out with women. if you're a girl watching this, you see that being cool and hanging out with giant robots is something that boys do, and *maybe* they'll let a hot young woman join them for a couple minutes in between doing cool things.   picking on *transformers* isn't entirely fair, so let's look at others: [*jurassic world*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jurassic_world) has one woman headlining. [*goodfellas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goodfellas) has one. [*groundhog day*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/groundhog_day_%28film%29) has one. [*the fifth element*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_fifth_element) has one. [*elf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elf_%28film%29) has two. but they're all romantic leads or moms—in groundhog day, andie macdowell exists only to be wooed: she's there by narrative imperative. mila jovovitch spends her first twenty minutes onscreen wearing next to nothing, and she's a lady so that she and bruce willis can fall in love. it's the same thing as with the gays—they only exist *when they have to*. since this is much more visible, it's becoming *less* of a problem (see *mad max*), but we're still at the point where female action stars are a novelty.   the overwhelming message from media to girls is that women aren't action stars—not because arnold schwarzenegger kneels down halfway through *terminator* and says ""only men can do this,"" but because there are so few stories about women kicking ass *without* being sexy. that's also a crucial difference, and one that even helps this meander back to the original comment: schwarzenegger's not sexy. as a gay guy, schwarzenegger is *really* not sexy. he's macho, sure, but even if he were attractive in the first place he spends the entire movie covering his body with trenchcoats and leather jackets. women can *sometimes* be action stars, but they've got to have [big boobs and a nice ass *and* show them off at all times](http://www.mindpollution.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/avengers-promo.jpeg). because that's what sells. and since it sells, it keeps getting made, and since it keeps getting made, it percolates through society. and at the end of the day, young girls don't have an ass-kicking role model who isn't sexualized and who doesn't [die fifteen minutes in](http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/jenette_vasquez) (though sigourney weaver is usally an exception).  ok, finally getting back to your initial point, six thousand characters later: yes, these are tropes because they sell. you got me. from a purely economic standpoint, there's nothing *wrong* with a company playing it safe. universal thinks that straight white men age 18-31 want to see movies about straight white men, and they're pretty right. it's reliable. if you're making a big blockbuster, you have to guarantee a return, and you do that by being conservative with your message. if, all of a sudden, spider man were black, then you'd risk pissing off your central fanbase of white guys (don't tell me this risk doesn't exist, because it does). the comparative gain of the black market you'd (probably) attract isn't as big—at least, you're pretty sure. finding out would be *very* costly. making him white and preserving the status quo is, for them, a business decision.  but it's delusional at best to pretend that that translates for audiences. i didn't go to see *iron man* and think ""yes, he is straight because that will guarantee reliable approval. this decision makes fiscal sense."" i thought ""oh boy, another straight guy. revolutionary."" it was, to borrow a phrase, another brick in the wall of ""straight guys are the only heroes.""   look at it this way: when a rock erodes away, it's not the fault of any individual drop of water. each probably had its own reason for being there. they weren't intentionally trying to erode the boulder. but there were so many of them carving their own tiny little groove that eventually the rock was just gone.   do businesses have an obligation to provide representation in media? no, not in the strictest sense. but they also don't really have any *obligation* to pay their workers--it's inefficient, economically. but just because it's not an economic imperative doesn't mean it's not douchey to not do it.   if they're going to determine the tone of public conversation in the country, then people have a right to call them out for being irresponsible about it.",1,
501544,"as a dyke, i may be just slightly biased, but here goes. in my opinion, before modern times, i can see people encouraging heterosexual marriage even for homosexual folks for the necessity of producing children, especially if in a small community. yet i believe there is benefit to having homosexual couples that cannot produce children on their own--they contribute to society without needing as much in return, and for children without parents or family, homosexual couples can act as nature's babysitters/adoptive parents, as they have loads of resources (money, home, love) that aren't being used on anyone else. to me, i see little difference between a gay couple and an infertile straight couple.  that said, i think kids need role models that represent both genders, but thankfully as gay people don't spring full-formed from nothing, they have family that can help to provide them. in a modern context, homosexual couples can adopt, or choose something like ivf. here, a lesbian couple has the choice of sperm they will use, and some may choose a that of their partner's relative, so that the child has biological ties to both sides of the family.  i perhaps out of necessity take a more modern stance on gender roles, as in my own household, we both end up having to kill the damn spiders; i think it's the duty of parents, whatever gender they are, to provide for their family, raise their kids, etc.  end of the day, i think that who you are doesn't matter as much as how you live and how you contribute.",1,1
475959,"i don't think anybody's going to read this but i'm going to write all my thoughts down in this comment anyways and probably reiterate what i've written in other comments. this was truly a roller coaster of an episode: the first half was mostly cheerful but then the next half got horribly dark and then it became (in my opinion) just a little bit positive when jimmy showed up.  when the episode began i was glad that mickey was finally addressing the issue of ian's condition but holy shit did that storyline take a turn for the worst. i am honestly heartbroken at what's happened to their relationship. when mickey beat up that guy at the club i couldn't bear the pain in his voice (that was exemplary acting by noel fisher), that scene's going to be really hard for me to watch in the future.  i feel very strongly for mickey right now, it feels really unfair for him to go through all this and it breaks my heart that he started taking out his anger on lip and the ~~bakery~~ beanery. i can't wait to see what happens in the next episode, i just hope ian and yevgeny remain safe and ian gets psychiatric help. poor mickey, the guy can't ever catch a fucking break.  (i should also add that i was glad they showed ian &amp; mickey being sexual in this episode. i hate it when shows depict gay characters like celibate roommates but show the straight characters going at each other in every orifice. it's nice to see that same-sex relationships aren't being discriminated against in this show). however:   &gt;""fagaccino"" ""fairy"" ""queen""  *shameless* succumbs to homophobia yet again, fucking breederomenstruals. the fact that the show features a same-sex relationship isn't enough for me to overlook how it sometimes shamefully employs homophobic remarks to elicit giggles from the breeders in the audience. i'm actually relieved the lesbians vs. carl storyline got dropped now because i'm afraid it would have meant hearing more homophobic verbal diarrhea.  moving on, i'm proud of lip for not taking part in the shooting at the ~~bakery~~ beanery, for not letting what other people think hold him back from the future he deserves and i'm especially happy that he's going back to college before he fucks up. watching debbie pummel her ex-friends was awesome. and i liked carl in this episode too. he's a drug dealer right now, i know, but at least it's a step up from being a twatlicker (an underage one i might add) and seeing a trace of his old self in the scene where he speculates about fiona's big announcement was quite enjoyable.  i disliked the start of the episode however because seeing fiona and pfender together disturbs me even though pfender seems like a good dude (perhaps because i feel he isn't the right guy for fiona?). even their house looks depressing. i'm glad jimmy is back because i believe he's right for fiona and he's the only one who can help her right now. seeing fiona reassuring jackie (the waitress) was wonderful, i missed that 'awesome big sister/friend' side of her. and thank goodness jackie survived.  &gt; ""you have to even the score, you have to do what i did...get off on a woman, any woman as long as i don't know her, handjob only, i'll watch the babies. i cheated on you now you have to cheat on me""  what the fuck v?!!! how could you ever think that was a sensible solution? and i can't believe kevin actually went through with it, that seems so out of character for him. this was the most wtf-inducing moment in the entire episode.  best moment: fiona's talk with jackie  funniest moment: mickey talking about ian packing a 9-incher  saddest moment: mickey when he was pouring his heart out while beating up that dude at the club.  overall i thought this was season 5's best episode so far. it left me begging for more. can't wait for next sunday.  edit: bakery ---&gt; beanery, and holy crap somebody actually read this, thank you!",1,1

575996,"that one norwegian documentary from a few years ago had an episode talking about homosexuality, supposedly the brain of many gay men are more feminine than the ones of straight men, same for lesbians compared to straight women, the whole concept of the ""gaydar"" comes from this idea that homosexuals and heterosexuals have slight differences in the way they act, present themselves, etc. i found it somewhat interesting because it implied that many stereotypes, for example the idea of gay men being more likely to get a job typically held by women, such as being a hairdresser, lesbians being more ""butch"" than straight women, and things like that had basis on reality.  in the case that this is true, then an homosexual man or woman is a ""step"" towards the other gender, so if you believe that a trans-woman has an advantage, a lesbian also has.  i don't know if this is proven, though.",1,

623824,"can't comment on anderson's defense as 61.7% is pretty bad but he's also on an oddly poor defensive team considering they have asik and davis as shotblockers. i'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with.  on offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. he's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat anderson is. montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had.  you also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... dwight (lewis in orlando). it's also been a noticeable part of offense for the spurs (matt bonner) and suns (formerly channing frye) in the past. if houston had the opportunity to trade montiejunas for anderson straight up morey would have montiejunas on the plane to new orleans in a heartbeat.",0,

663802,"devil's advocate argument:  if we view sexuality as a spectrum, then there is definitively an element of choice for those people who wind up squarely between the two poles: bisexual folk.     don't get me wrong, the confluence of factors that add up to make a person identify as bisexual are not chosen, but their choice of partners, and whether or not to put up with social sanctioned homophobia, is definitely a choice.  this ability to ""unpunished"" for their identity gives some gay folk misgivings about whether or not one can actually trust in a relationship with a bi-person; there is a ton of gay media about this dynamic, because of closeted folks with beards are ""apparently bisexual"" by their revealed preferences, but how they actually feel about their sexual dynamics work to complicate the judgment.     undermining the ""choice"" argument does not necessarily make one a hypocrite to the lgbt movement.  so long as sex positivity is alter of that sacrifice, because there is where the real political tradeoff exists.  sex positivity has the benefit of unhinging sex from reproduction, a social construct that yields huge potential benefits for cisgendered folks and noncisgendered folks alike. think about it, until the late 1950's, no-one had consistent control over reproduction, and all the ""patriarchal"" social structures regarding control of women just happened to serve the purpose of any given strait man being 100% sure of parental lineage of a child.  once that cord is irrevocably severed by the pill: the binary between homosexual and heterosexual can no longer exist, so it doesn't.  a man can be 100% sure that his dalliances wont result in pregnancy, a woman can be 100% scandalous in her choice of partners, and there will be no collateral damage in the form of a kid that someone has to provide resources for.  if sex then, is simply about physical pleasure, and not reproduction, that opens up all the sexual behavior options free of all biological consequence, (especially if condoms are used) leaving only two shapers of sexual behavior considerations: 1.) one's organic internalized sexual preferences and 2.) one's perception of how society will act on knowing about a person's choice of sexual partners/activities.     the dynamics before the pill were such that 1.) social structures very clearly told a homosexual youth that they were undesirable, unhealthy, &amp; abnormal. 2.) this would lead rational folks to have to make a choice: is it worth it to be true to my sexuality, or just live under any radar.  this period of time helped to make concrete for the industrialized world what ""gay people"" are like in comparison to ""straight people"" because only the folks who could not surpress their sexual identities would try to change society to carve a space for themselves.  for the people who could literally not repress their true identities anymore, those were the gays that represented the movement.  this implies that under the banner of ""straight"", are folks on the sexual expression spectrum who did exhibit a choice, and exercised it for social convenience.  be they closeted lesbians and gays who could not overcome the fear and risk or the truly bisexual who simply made a convenience argument to themselves, or the people in between those markers, there was a choice, and the lgbt movement carried them this far to today.  where non-binary folks can say, with a straitface, my orientation is free of your prescriptive ideologies for how i should use my body.  and they can point that argument at strait and gay folk alike.       we now live in a time where sex positivity has gotten to the point that folks closer to the middle of the hetero/homo binary are developing a voice to shape the movement.  the theme seems to be, ""prescription by others is caustic.""  this is why hypocrisy is on the lips of tia commenters; two factions that they see on the same side of the movement, are both fighting for greater sway in the country, at odds with some of one another's goals, all in a country whose atmosphere is still pretty fucking prude and judgmental.  all non-straight opinions and political actions should be measured on whether or not it is convenient for the gayrights movement.     i know i typed a lot, but seriously, this is just a devil's advocate argument.",1,
422357,"i was born in 1984.  in 1993 (when i was in grade four) i remember kids in the schoolyard chuckling and saying the word ""gay."" a few months later, i learned about homosexuality.  9 year old me thought, ""why is it funny when people of the same gender have sex with each other? why's that such a big deal? what's so wrong about that?!""  flash forward to 1998 or so. ellen degeneres comes out as a lesbian, and her character on ellen does the same. that episode was very controversial and got high ratings. 14 year old me thought, ""this is great! i hope there are more positive portrayals of gay people on tv!""  flash forward to 1999. 15 year old me attended pride toronto for the first time. a few months later, i learned that my sister is openly bisexual and was in a relationship with a woman. ""i'm so happy for my sister.""  year 2000- 16 year old me started a relationship with an openly bisexual man. because i was honest about having had sex with a man who has had sex with men on my blood donor legal form (i'm type o negative, a very popular blood type for blood banks), i was banned from donating blood to red cross/canadian blood services, even though i tested hiv negative, and to this very day i've had several hiv tests that have all come out negative.  around 2002-2003, 18/19 year old me learned that my sister's partner, who identified as a butch lesbian when he first got together with my sister, came out as a heterosexual transgender man. fortunately, my sister is attracted to him and continues to be in love with him. my sister and i thought ""it's really important to fight transphobia.""  i'm proud that in spite of having straight privilege and cis privilege, i've never been homophobic or transphobic.  2014- 30 year old me attended world pride in toronto! it was a lot of fun, and transgender rights were really highlighted there.  2015 (now)- 31 year old me is really excited about attending pride toronto later in june.",1,
359198,"this... this can't be true... this is too much...  &gt;&gt;i'm a pedophile and ever since i realized it about myself, i've been told by society that i am a disgusting, filthy, morally corrupt monster who is deserving only of a bullet. the biggest battle of my life has been convincing myself that i'm not this monster. i almost lost this battle many times, but each time i've decided to kill myself, i haven't gone through with it because i can't leave my family behind without a truthful explanation. and i just cannot handle leaving this world knowing that everyone i love considers me a monster. so here i am. i know that if i'd had this service available to me, i would have been in there getting help many years ago. blind hatred towards pedophiles is only adding to the feedback loop. we need help, not hatred. since you only hear about pedophiles who have been caught abusing kids and never hear about the ones that don't, it's very easy to come away with the impression that ""pedophiles abuse kids"". yes they do, but not* every one does. we have absolutely no way of knowing how many non-abusive pedophiles are out there.   &gt;&gt;sexual orientation has nothing to do with morality. being a pedophile is just like being a straight male in a world where all females are lesbians. the obvious result is that you'd have sexual desires that cannot be met without hurting someone. this leads to a very uncomfortable (and absurdly difficult) situation of either never having sex or raping someone (because they cannot give you consent). **i truly sympathize with you.** i don't know if i could handle never having sex. **i certainly wouldn't condemn someone who is faced with this choice.**   &gt;&gt;it's not an illness though. pedophilia has existed for all of human history, it's just now that western societies are making arbitrary age requirements. and i'm not saying it's right or wrong to be attracted to children, but it's definitely not ""unnatural"" in any way. fucking kids used to be no big deal. disclaimer: i'm not a pedophile nor do i think people should be allowed to fuck kids in this day and age. but i do agree that pedophiles who haven't actually fucked a kid yet should be given every opportunity to come to terms with their desires and accept that they can never act on them. it would probably result in a lot less kids getting fucked.   &gt;&gt;i hate to say it... but you have a point. **""treating"" pedophilia seems an awful lot like the pray the gay away camps that so many ""rehabilitated"" gays went to back when it was much more taboo.**   &gt;&gt;honestly i'd be terrified someone would track me down through reddit somehow and beat me to death or something. there was an episode of law &amp; order: svu that i'll always remember because there is a kid maybe 15 years old that has feeling about his young step-brother. he goes to the police (svu) and tell them he need help. they're basically like ""well unless you do something we can't send you to jail and other than locking you up we can't help"". they then tell his parents. so later in the episode he turns up brutally murdered. his stepfather beat him up with a baseball bat (mind you he didn't physically do anything) and then some other self-hating celibate pedophile stabbed him to death. the worst part is at the end of the episode they were basically like ""well that's that, what's next?"" they didn't give a shit at all about him. really horrible but i think that's how most people in this country feel at best.   &gt;&gt;**there's nothing wrong with being sexually attracted to children anymore** than there's something wrong with being turned on by rape fantasies, or snuff fantasies. however, it's good to see someone acknowledge that there are some fetishes that cannot ever be acted out without harming someone.   &gt;&gt;**it's important that people recognize that pedophilia isn't something you do out of spite.** just like being gay, no one ever chose to be pedophile. there are heterosexual, homosexual and pedophile rapists. it just doesn't mean every pedophile is a sex offender. that programm is a step in the right direction, **the world has to realize that people like you don't need to be punished, but that they need help. even if someone has already molested a child it's still important to help them deal with the urges without hurting someone.** you can still punish them without having them killed... (death penatly for child molesters is a popular motive with extreme right groups in germany) that doesn't help anyone, not even the victims and is just a blind act of retaliation. edit: just for clarity i strongly disagree with the notion that homosexuals are child molesters. it's complete bullshit. but then again, it can not be left out of this discussion. **because the fact that some people believe in this misconception shows that there is still a lot education necessary about sexuality in general. we must not just hush them out in an odd attempt of political correctness.**",1,
484292,"oh. my god.  deirdre this one is almost as bad as the harry potter social justice article.  what have you done?  what hell have you wraught to me?????????????  full disclosure: i was big, big into the phantom menace from like 2001-2006 because of one reason.  qui-gon jinn and obi-wan kenobi having master/padawan relations.  the masterapprentice.org archives are *enormous* and their biggest pairing section is for qui/obi.  it absolutely started a revolution in star wars fanfiction for slashers/yaoi fans.  but that doesn't make tpm a ""lgbt cult favorite"" or whatever.  tpm is terrible to watch no matter what, and tbh obi-wan is hardly in it, even though all we want to do is see him nervously tug on his padawan braid.  you know it's what we wanted.  anyway let's get down to this.  massive picture of qui/obi with a rainbow...with amidala below them drawn *more masculinely* in order to reinforce that amidala (the decoy) was actually a man?  despite mentioning the decoy was played by keira knightly?  what?  &gt; in the 90s, many parents believed their children would grow up to be just like them: ***cis breeders.*** little did they know that their kids were covert members of a rebel alliance whose mission was to destroy the evil, heteronormative empire.  lol.  please.  stop.  (edited to add: this point, this opening paragraph, is where it officially goes worse than 'harry potter social justice article'.  fyi.)  &gt; ""everyone [in the phantom menace] is in drag. that always wins me. amidala does some fun identity switching too.""  what???????????????  who is in drag in this?  the fact that they wear robes? cause that's the whole ""monk"" thing. and amidala's identity switching was supposed to be spy/intrigue shit, it was just stupid and bad b/c lucas is bad at writing and directing.  &gt; ""everyone remembers amidala in the first movie!"" aaron, a twenty-something trans femme star wars fan, exclaims. ""like, i still see her referenced as a icon 16 years later. [amidala] had so many costume changes, and each one hinted at the history and culture of her home world.""  so lucas was well aware that there were no other women in this film aside from amidala, so he made sure that she was there to keep women's interests.  what do girls like?  makeup and dresses, of course!  so she wore tons of different outfits.  they have said this was specifically to cater to women.  amidala doesn't ""dress like a drag queen"".  what in the fuck does that even mean?  she's a star wars character from another planet, she's dressed like a *sci fi queen*.  what in the hell.  &gt; ""in episode i you see a different side of star wars. the spaceships are sleek and clean, the costumes are rich and elaborate, the cities on naboo are bright and colorful. it lends a different texture and culture to the galaxy that reflects a happier time.  yes, because everything was green screened.  literally everything.  that's why.  &gt; ""the alien humanoids of the star wars saga consistently challenge gender binaries, but to say jar jar was actually trans would be giving george [lucas] too much credit. jar jar was a cheap jab at black masculinity—call it what it is.""  &gt; aaron agrees with niv's analysis, stating that, ""jar jar is a problem! i definitely vote no on queer icon. i don't see him as a trans or gay, but maybe asexual and aromantic or something.  .... what in the fuck is happening right now?  am i crying?  are these horrified tears?  what is my life yall?  &gt; lucas crafted a complex relationship between qui-gon and his padawan, obi-wan kenobi. these two characters remind sean of two archetypal homosexual relationships: priests beside altar boys, and older gay men who date younger guys.  yeah this is absolutely true.  most popular part about this movie was this gay ass couple. [look at this shiz!](http://archiveofourown.org/collections/master_apprentice_archive/works)  (edited to add: fandom is also notoriously cracky and there are some pretty hilarious fanfics about qui-gon actually having two dicks, and him being so horrified for obi-wan to find out, but when in truth, it turns out obi-wan has two vaginas!  oh, you scamps.)  &gt; ""it's almost an allegory for the young catholic church; the jedi counsel taking a young boy and introducing the world to him,"" sean says.

935609,"i am an exception to your statement/question.  straight married father here.  when i was younger and socialized more than i do now i had a few lesbian friends. i only had a handful of close friends to begin with because i don't open up too much usually. the 3 women would be in my top 15 closest friendships i have had in the last 10 years. 2 were friends in and out of work, and 1 was a boss and primarily a working relationship.  one is a dyke. she wears that label proudly. she used to go to pride in sf every year. she isn't large (tall or heavy) but she is strong and wears clothes found in men's sections at stores. with work boots. she fucked more hot ""straight"" chicks than anyone i have known. she is funny, doesn't take anyone's shit, and generally wants people around her to get along. she ended up being my wife's brides maid at our wedding in ca. it was so funny seeing her in a dress with her hair done. she did that for my wife. our parents are conservative and she wasn't out to make a statement or ruffle feathers. she handled the situation with class. we have lost touch because she had a crazy gf who was jealous of her and my wife's friendship, even though we were no longer in the same state, and we both miss her. i had no desire for her and she had none and she was cool with all kinds.  the two best bosses/supervisors i have worked for were lesbian.   the boss i only had a ""work friendship."" she kept work and personal separate so i took no offense. also we had an age gap where we wouldn't have socialized in similar groups anyways, probably. i was not attracted to her and she was fair and equal to everyone, by the book. we had great conversations because i would engage her about my development at work and she loved coaching/teaching. we talked about things other than work and both have a dark, dry sense of humor. for what it is worth there were lesbians that worked for her and she didn't show any preference.  my other supervisor was a tomboy. she was more open with coworkers about her sexuality than the previously mentioned boss. i genuinely loved her as a friend, which is increadably (spelling help plz) rare for me. at a time i had wished she was straight and a bit more feminine, because we would have been a kick ass couple. i never said anything to her about that, but after a break up with a long term gf she mentioned she wanted a gf who she could have a relationship with that was similar to ours. and neither of us were attracted to each other. there were no intimate or sexual feelings. i was 18 yo when we met. we became closer when i was about 21-22 yo. i did not discriminate that much when it came to sexual partners, so i would probably had sex with her if she had shown desire. i imagine it would have been similar to masturbating though. just do it to do it. again though i never desired her. she was cool with everyone except for large bossy males. if they were physically imposing and arrogant, rude, selfish, ect she was not cool being alone around them. we were close but i never asked why. she knew i knew, and she knew she could have told me free of judgement. she never did, i never asked.  i have some observations that i think can support your claim. in my life, as an american who has lived in ca, nv, and tx, between work and school and socializing i see males as being more sexually driven/aggressive than females. i see on average males being larger in size and strength and that being encouraged, while women on average are smaller and our culture largely promotes the idea of a petite woman. if a heterosexual female befriends a homosexual male there is more safety (i need a better word) in that staying a plutonic relationship than a heterosexual male. many of these females that i have seen befriend gay males befriend more effeminate males than masculine ones (like bears).   i think a heterosexual female would prefer to befriend a sensitive and gentle person, male or female, over an assertive sexually driven heterosexual male. as an outsider looking in the former seems like a better pairing for a friendship than the latter.  why isn't it the same with straight males and gay females? i don't know, like i don't know anything above for certain. if a gay woman wants to spend time with a male friend and they are alone the male is on average going to be larger, which can be imposing. that male could have the assertive sex driven mentality. it wouldn't go away based on the company you keep. it would only be put into action if there were suitable individuals potentially available. a tomboy lesbian may not be the average mans cup of tea, but that doesn't mean that he isn't thirsty enough to drink. the drive is always present in men. it is controlled by the vast majority of men the vast majority of the time, but i think most would agree that a straight male would make a move on a gay female more often than a gay male would make on a straight female.   this is some of what i have seen. i love all people and if you feel i was rude or unfair please tell me.     iran doesn't have these situations because they don't have any gay people over there. that must be nice and simple for them.",1,1

650292,"&gt;preponderance of the evidence indicates that papias was referring to the gospel of mark.  preponderance of what evidence? there is no evidence at all that he was talking about canonical mark. his description doesn't match, and nobody was calling it the gospel of mark until irenaeus.  &gt;it seems you missed a few paragraphs underneath that where it says: ""oral literature is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. in his study of the iliad and the odyssey, cedric whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure ""of the most amazing virtuosity"" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.""  the chiasms in mark are all literary constructions, impossible from natural speech.  the iliad and the odyssey are not from natural speech either.  incidentally, the gospel of mark is in chronological order. papias says his peter's memoirs were not.  &gt;it seems you missed a few paragraphs underneath that where it says: ""oral literature is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. in his study of the iliad and the odyssey, cedric whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure ""of the most amazing virtuosity"" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.""  *chora* is the fields around a town. there were several towns between gerasa and the lake. i've seen this apologetic many times and it doesn't work. as i already pointed out, there are no cliffs by the lake even if you pretend that vthe *chora* of gerasa extended 30 miles to the lake, avross three rivers and through bigger towns.  &gt;ah, i suppose this is what it all boils down to right? whether or not you believe in fairy tales irrespective of the text does or does not say.  since you seem intent on trying to deny what the text says, i'm just asking you if you really think you're making the most plausible argument.  &gt;it is a route, just a bad one.   it's not a route. it goes in the wrong direction. mark also doesn't seem to understand where the lake is. his whole itinerary is like a pac man wrap-around.  &gt;sidon shared a common border with damascus a city of the decapolis in the first century. damascus was nowhere near the rest of the decapolis and nowhere near the lake  &gt;wow, those are some top-notch guys if all of their trials were always 100% by the books and nothing shady ever happened. after all, apparently corruption and murder (over religion no less!) are an historical impossibility.  they never had trials at night or on the passover, nor did they have them away from the temple. those things are historically impossible and would have served no purpose anyway. the trial could have no legitimacy with the public, plus jesus had done nothing contrary to jewish law anyway. mark's trial before the sanhedrin is a fiction invented to shift blame for the crucifixion away from the romans. the idea that pilate could have been pressured by the priests is ridiculous. they were hand-picked lackeys. they had no ability to exert any pressure and pilate didn't care about jewish blasphemy anyway. crucifixion was used by the romans only for crimes against the roman state. if jesus was crucified, it had to have been a roman decision and only because they thought he was guilty of some kind of sedition.  &gt;good question, i don't know. maybe one of the people there later became a convert, or talked about it afterwards, or maybe jesus (assuming he really did come back to life) told his disciples about it post-resurrection.  the only ones there were the members of the sanhedrin, and mark says they all voted to convict. even if we follow your hypothesis, then you're admitting the information did not come from peter.  &gt;and maybe they understood that jesus' son of man reference was him claiming divinity. it is possible that the members of the sanhedrin knew their jewish theology better than you do.  nope. they understood jewish theology better than the author of mark.  the phrase, ""son of man"" just means ""human being."" it has no claim to divinity. even when meant messianically, it's not claim to divinity. the jewish messiah is not god.  &gt;yes but before that papias says that mark wrote down ""things either said or done by the lord."" and then goes on to say that there was not intended to be an ordered logia it seems evident that based upon philo's usage of extending logia to narrative and based on the fact that mark wrote down every thing either ""said or done"" by jesus. it seems likely that papias meant logia to apply to more than just what jesus said  papias used the word ""logia"" with regards to matthew, not mark. he says matthew wrote doesn the sayings of the lord.  &gt;the text indicates he was: ""for information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding mark who wrote the gospel, which he [papias] has given in the following words]: and the presbyter said this. mark having become the interpreter of peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. it was not, however, in exact order. . .""  this words quoted from *papias*  indicate no such thing. eusebius (wrongly) thinks he was talking about the canonicals, but papias says nothing to indicate that. nothing he says matches the canonicals.  &gt;because you declare anyone who says otherwise as a crank and not a scholar  they are. there is no serious scholarship that questions markan priority.  &gt;""handed down"" is παραδίδωμι which can mean verbal delivery, look at a concordance please. and if an eyewitness delivered something verbally  looking at a concordance and desperately hoping to find a definition which will support your preconceived belief is about as specious as it gets.   he says that others have written accounts before him and that they wrote based on what had been ""habded down"" from (what luke erroneously believed) were eyewitnesses.  this is bart ehrman on the subject:  &gt;he claims that many others – whom he also does not name – preceded him in writing an account of “the things that have been fulfilled among us.” these “things,” of course, are the events of jesus’ life.   the predecessors based their accounts on traditions that had been handed down by “eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.”   luke does not say that he himself has had access to eyewitnesses, only that the materials that both he and his predecessors provided in their books were based on reports that ultimately go back to eyewitnesses and “ministers of the word.”   it is not completely clear whom this latter category covers, but presumably it means those who proclaimed the word – that is preachers of the gospel stories before the gospels were written.  &gt;luke implies a dissatisfaction with the work of his predecessors. they have written their accounts, he knows about them (presumably from having read them), and now he wants to do a better job than they did.  he has followed all these things closely for some time, and now he (in contrast to his predecessors?) wants to write an “orderly” account of what happened.   it’s not completely clear if that means that he wants his account to provide the correct chronological sequence for the things that happened, or if, somewhat more likely, he wants to provide a generally more correct version.    this comment of his, however it is to be specifically interpreted, clearly means that he thinks that his predecessors did an inadequate job when they wrote their accounts.  the reason that matters is that scholars have established beyond much of any doubt that *one* of his predecessors was the gospel of mark, which luke used as a source for many of his own stories of jesus.   that makes things very interesting, because it seems to suggest that luke did not think mark’s gospel was reliable and that he needed to improve upon it (the mere fact that he changed it so much points in the same direction).  that would suggest some “critique” of mark even from within the new testament itself.  that's the mainstream consensus.

580657,"""homosexuality is normal.""  debunked by u/tsar_moose  one study reports 70% of homosexuals admitting to having sex only one time with over 50% of their partners (3). one study reports that the average homosexual has between 20 and 106 partners per year (6). the average heterosexual has 8 partners in a lifetime. many homosexual sexual encounters occur while drunk, high on drugs, or in an orgy setting (7). many homosexuals don't pay heed to warnings of their lifestyles: ""knowledge of health guidelines was quite high, but this knowledge had no relation to sexual behavior"" (16). homosexuals got homosexuality removed from the list of mental illnesses in the early 70s by storming the annual american psychiatric association (apa) conference on successive years. ""guerrilla theater tactics and more straight-forward shouting matches characterized their presence"" (2). since homosexuality has been removed from the apa list of mental illnesses, so has pedophilia (except when the adult feels ""subjective distress"") (27). homosexuals account for 3-4% of all gonorrhea cases, 60% of all syphilis cases, and 17% of all hospital admissions (other than for stds) in the united states (5). they make up less than 1% of the population. homosexuals live unhealthy lifestyles, and have historically accounted for the bulk of syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis b, the ""gay bowel syndrome"" (which attacks the intestinal tract), tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus (27). 73% of psychiatrists say homosexuals are less happy than the average person, and of those psychiatrists, 70% say that the unhappiness is not due to social stigmatization (13). 25-33% of homosexuals and lesbians are alcoholics (11). of homosexuals questioned in one study reports that 43% admit to 500 or more partners in a lifetime, 28% admit to 1000 or more in a lifetime, and of these people, 79% say that half of those partners are total strangers, and 70% of those sexual contacts are one night stands (or, as one homosexual admits in the film ""the castro"", one minute stands) (3). also, it is a favorite past-time of many homosexuals to go to “cruisey areas"" and have anonymous sex. 78% of homosexuals are affected by stds (20). judge john martaugh, chief magistrate of the new york city criminal court has said, ""homosexuals account for half the murders in large cities"" (10). captain william riddle of the los angeles police says, ""30,000 sexually abused children in los angeles were victims of homosexuals"" (10). dr. daniel capron, a practicing psychiatrist, says, ""homosexuality by definition is not healthy and wholesome. the homosexual person, at best, will be unhappier and more unfulfilled than the sexually normal person"" (10). for other psychiatrists who believe that homosexuality is wrong, please see national association for research and therapy of homosexuality. it takes approximately $300,000 to take care of each aids victim, so thanks to the promiscuous lifestyle of homosexuals, medical insurance rates have been skyrocketing for all of us(10). homosexuals were responsible for spreading aids in the united states, and then raised up violent groups like act up and ground zero to complain about it. even today, homosexuals account for well over 50% of the aids cases in the united states, which is quite a large number considering that they account for less than 1% of the population. homosexuals account for a disproportionate number of hepatitis cases: 70-80% in san francisco, 29% in denver, 66% in new york city, 56% in toronto, 42% in montreal, and 26% in melbourne (8). 37% of homosexuals engage in sadomasochism, which accounts for many accidental deaths. in san francisco, classes were held to teach homosexuals how to not kill their partners during sadomasochism (8). 41% of homosexuals say they have had sex with strangers in public restrooms, 60% say they have had sex with strangers in bathhouses, and 64% of these encounters have involved the use of illegal drugs (8). depending on the city, 39-59% of homosexuals are infected with intestinal parasites like worms, flukes and amoebae, which is common in filthy third world countries (8). the median age of death of homosexuals is 42 (only 9% live past age 65). this drops to 39 if the cause of death is alds. the median age of death of a married heterosexual man is 75 (8). the median age of death of lesbians is 45 (only 24% live past age 65). the median age of death of a married heterosexual woman is 79 (8). homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident (8). 21% of lesbians die of murder, suicide or traffic accident, which is at a rate of 534 times higher than the number of white heterosexual females aged 25-44 who die of these things(8). 50% of the calls to a hotline to report ""queer bashing"" involved domestic violence (i.e., homosexuals beating up other homosexuals) (18). about 50% of the women on death row are lesbians (12). homosexuals prey on children. 33% of homosexuals admit to minor/adult sex (7). there is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, known as the north american man and boy love association (nambla). this is a child molesting homosexual group whose cry is ""sex before 8 before it's too late."" this group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades across the united states. homosexuals commit more than 33% of all reported child molestations in the united states, which, assuming homosexuals make up 2% of the population, means that 1 in 20 homosexuals is a child molestor, while 1 in 490 heterosexuals is a child molestor (19). 73% of all homosexuals have had sex with boys under 19 years of age (9). many homosexuals admit that they are pedophiles: ""the love between men and boys is at the foundation of homosexuality"" (22). because homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting children. homosexuals can be heard chanting ""ten percent is not enough, recruit, recruit, recruit"" in their homosexual parades. a group called the ""lesbian avengers"" prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. they print ""we recruit"" on their literature. some other homosexuals aren't as overt about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into positions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young children (e.g., the clergy, teachers, boy scout leaders, etc.) (8). see the dc lesbian avengers

448296,"i'm gonna let dan savage handle this one.   i was wondering what you think about the folsom street fair, the annual gay leather/fetish/bdsm street fair in san francisco. do you think it is still a socially relevant display? or do you think that in this time when we are fighting for civil rights and equality that it does more harm than good?  better displaying san francisco  i’m pretty sure that the folsom street fair remains socially relevant — and highly so — to folks in the leather/fetish/bdsm scene in san francisco. it’s also relevant to anyone who believes in freedom of sexual expression.  and it’s important to emphasize that the folsom street fair, which took place last weekend, isn’t exclusively gay. thousands of straight kinksters attend every year. about the only difference between the straight attendees and the queer ones is that no one claims that the kinky straight people at folsom make all heterosexuals everywhere look like sex-crazed sadomasochists.  straight people, of course, aren’t fighting for their fundamental civil rights. kinky straights can marry in all 50 states, after all, and no one is pledging to kick kinky straights out of the armed forces or to write anti-kinky-straight bigotry into the us constitution. so maybe it’s not the same — maybe it’s not as politically risky — when straight people come out in bondage gear, leather chaps, and pony masks. but straight people are a big part of folsom, too.  but you didn’t ask about kinky straight people. you wondered if the folsom street fair was harming the struggle for lgbt equality.  the folsom street fair has taken place on a sunday in september in san francisco every year since 1984. pride parades have been taking place on a sunday in june in cities all over the country since the early 1970s. and every year, we hear from concern trolls about the damage that’s supposedly being done to the lgbt rights movement by all those drag queens, go-go boys, dykes, and leather guys at pride or folsom or international mr. leather.  but everyone acknowledges — even our enemies — that the gay rights movement has made extraordinary strides in the 43 years since the stonewall riots in new york city. we’re not all the way there yet, we have yet to secure our full civil equality, but the pace of progress has been unprecedented in the history of social justice movements. the women’s suffrage movement, for example, was launched in the united sates in 1848. it took more than 70 years to pass the 19th amendment, which extended the vote to women. in 1969, at the time of the stonewall riots, gay sex was illegal in 49 states. gay sex is now legal in every us state, gay marriage is legal in six states and our nation’s capital (and in all of canada), and gays, lesbians, and bisexuals can serve openly in the military. (the armed forces still discriminate against trans people.) and we’ve made this progress despite fierce opposition from the religious right.  we couldn’t have come so far, so fast if folsom or pride parades were harming our movement. and i would argue that leather guys, dykes on bikes, go-go boys, and drag queens have actually helped our movement, bdsf. they demonstrate to all people that our movement isn’t just about the freedom to be gay or straight. our movement is about the freedom to be whatever kind of straight, gay, lesbian, bi, or trans person you want to be. and freedom, as dick cheney famously said, means freedom for everyone — from pantsuit-wearing pos sellouts like mary cheney and chris barron to kinky straight people and hot gay boys in harnesses.  i don’t think it’s a coincidence that cities with big pride parades and events like folsom are more tolerant and more accepting of sexual minorities than cities that don’t have big gay parades and fetish street fairs. if an event like folsom were actually counterproductive, bdsf, you would expect san francisco to be less tolerant and less likely to back equal rights for sexual minorities, not more likely.",1,1

homosexuals. of those involved in a ""current relationship,"" only 15 percent describe their current relationship as having lasted twelve years or longer, with five percent lasting more than twenty years.[4] while this ""snapshot in time"" is not an absolute predictor of the length of homosexual relationships, it does indicate that few homosexual relationships achieve the longevity common in marriages.  &gt;&gt;in the sexual organization of the city, university of chicago sociologist edward laumann argues that ""typical gay city inhabitants spend most of their adult lives in 'transactional' relationships, or short-term commitments of less than six months.""[5]  &gt;&gt;**a study of homosexual men in the netherlands published in the journal aids found that the ""duration

years.[8]***  &gt;&gt;**research indicates that the average male homosexual has hundreds of sex partners in his lifetime**  &gt;&gt;**the dutch study of partnered homosexuals, which was published in the journal aids, found that men with a steady partner had an average of eight sexual partners per year.[12]**  &gt;&gt;***bell and weinberg, in their classic study of male and female homosexuality, found that 43 percent of white male homosexuals had sex with 500 or more partners, with 28 percent having one thousand or more sex partners.[13]***  &gt;&gt;***in their study of the sexual profiles of 2,583 older homosexuals published in the journal of sex research, paul van de ven et al. found that ""the modal range for number of sexual partners ever [of homosexuals] was 101-500."" in addition, 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent had between 501 and 1,000 partners. a further 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent reported having had more than one thousand lifetime sexual partners.[14]***  &gt;&gt;a survey conducted by the homosexual magazine genre found that 24 percent of the respondents said they had had more than one hundred sexual partners in their lifetime. ***the magazine noted that several

greater frequency than did those without a steady partner.[39] anal intercourse has been linked with a host of sexually transmitted diseases, including aids.  &gt;&gt;a study of steady and casual male homosexual relationships in amsterdam found that ""steady partners contribute to (hiv) incidence more than casual partners. this can mainly be explained by the fact that risky behavior with steady partners is much greater than that with casual partners (30 versus 1.5 uai [unprotected anal intercourse] acts annually).""[41]  &gt;&gt;***the assumption that lesbians involved in exclusive sexual relationships are at reduced risk for sexual disease is false:***  &gt;&gt;the journal sexually transmitted infections concludes: **""the risk behavior profile of exclusive wsw (women who have sex

with an idu (intravenous drug user).""[44]**  &gt;&gt;a twins study that examined the relationship between homosexuality and suicide, published in the archives of general psychiatry, found that homosexuals with same-sex partners were at greater risk for overall mental health problems and were **6.5 times more likely than their twins to have attempted suicide. the higher rate was not attributable to mental health or substance abuse disorders.[45]**  &gt;&gt;in a survey of 1,099 lesbians, the journal of social service research found that slightly more than **half of the lesbians

362583,"i get the feeling you've never done customer support, much less for one in a large call center environment for a faceless corporation.  1.  comcast likely outsources the support to another company or companies.  usually companies diversify their support so that differently owned call centers are directly competing with others so they don't get complacent.  they can look at reports and say x call center is doing better than y, let's give a higher percent of the call volume to x.  how well a call center does as a whole directly impacts job security.  so to say comcast hired the person, it might be true if comcast is the one doing the support, but i'd be pretty skeptical that they do.  generally, if comcast is outsourcing, they aren't equipped to deal with some random employee of a company they outsource work to in an individual basis.  you don't see the outliers when all the data has been averaged.  2.  customers call in wanting free stuff all the time.  i mean all the fucking time.  they will have all sorts of creative stories that may or may not be true, claiming previous agents told them they'd get free this or that, usually things that cannot ever be promised.  and even if the customer is telling the truth that an agent told them that, the agent will carefully omit that from their case notes to bring less attention to themselves should the customer call back.  the only way they'd get caught is if the call was randomly picked to get reviewed.  the 2nd agent is only going to have the customer's word vs. the previous agent's notes, which may not confirm what the customer is claiming is accurate.  now in this case, he has it recorded, but does that truly prove to her that he didn't have a friend record it with him?  at any rate, if she isn't supposed to do it, it's not worth risking her job over satisfying one customer.  in her mind, do you think she cares more about his $12 a month than her own job security?  absolutely not.  3.  she many not even be capable of offering what he's claiming.  i've had to deal with people who were promised things we cannot do and i couldn't fulfill them either.  and that's not a case of ""well get your supervisor to do it.""  i was the supervisor.  the next level above me was escalated cases and there was a specific guideline for what gets escalated.  a customer supposedly being promised something we literally cannot do was not a valid escalation scenario.  before you say ""well escalate it anyway and let them handle it"" it doesn't work like that.  knowingly escalating an invalid case too often gives more back-end work to the team that handles those, which end up de-escalated anyway as invalid.  they don't even get to see the case as the team that approves it would flag it.  too many invalid escalations can result in a corrective action form (getting written up).  getting 2 cafs in 6 months would lead to the agent being terminated.  4.  within the context of the company i worked for, giving something away for free was called empowerment.  it was doing something outside the normal policy to keep the customer happy and we had limited scope of what we could use it for.  this generally required approval (as a supervisor i didn't need external approval) and was tracked as a percentage of how many calls where you gave away empowerment.  the goal was to not exceed 3% per month and anything over 5% would get investigated into.  so if i legitimately had 20 calls where 2 people had a valid reason for receiving compensation from us for an issue that is on our end, it would've been in my best interest to only give it to 1, and in most cases that tends to be the first person not the second one.  5. playing back the previous recording was likely a bad choice on his part.  that will flag the new agent that he's likely recording her call as well, and she's going to do everything by the books.  she can't get in trouble for denying him the 12 month promotion if that's what her documents/policies tell her to do.  you try to boil it down to ""well comcast is obligated to follow through with it"" but it's never that simple.  the more likely outcome is the agent that handled the first call will get written up or fired.  and now that it's gone viral to a degree, comcast may try to make it right.  for the average customer though, their call isn't going to go viral, and there are too many degrees of separation to get approval to make it right (or you have no proof the customer is telling the truth, so you err on the side of caution by denying them).  there are just so many factors at play here that someone who hasn't done customer support will be completely oblivious to.",0,

the blog post does not ""point out"" the science is faulty. it merely refers to a few studies that question other studies.  the loren marks study questions the foundations of apa statemant from 2005. if you would actually have read the sources i presented, *none of the sources was that apa statement*. so the marks study in no way refutes the sources i presented. neither did the marks study claim that same sex parents are inferior to straight couples.  and on the regnerus study: he did not actually even study kids who have grown up with same sex parents. the whole study had only 2 kids who had grown with same sex parents. and in the study, everyone, even kids of male-female couples, where the other parent had had a same sex relationship, even a short one, were labeled as ""children of same sex relationship"".    interestingly, the anti-gay institute you linked to, witherspoon institute funded the regnerus study with 700 000$ and expected the study to be anti-gay, and a witherspoon institute employee helped in the study and was in the editorial board of social science research where the regnerus study was first published.  &gt;first of all, reading the article would bring you to the regnerus study.   the key factor in science is that the studies that test hypothesis have to be able to replicated, so other studies can see do the results hold up. tons of scientific studies are replicated, and the replications find out the original study must have had some faults, as the original results were not replicated. regnerus study is a single study, whereas the sources i presented referred to a large pool of studies. the regnerus study does not refute all other studies, and as said, the regnerus study had methodological problems, or as said by the american medical association:  *the data does not show whether the perceived romantic relationship ever in fact occurred; nor whether the parent self-identified as gay or lesbian; nor whether the same sex relationship was continuous, episodic, or one-time only; nor whether the individual in these categories was actually raised by a homosexual parent (children of gay fathers are often raised by their heterosexual mothers following divorce), much less a parent in a long-term relationship with a same-sex partner. indeed, most of the participants in these groups spent very little, if any, time being raised by a “same-sex couple.""*  mark regnerus also himself has said that his study does not tell about same-sex couples adopting, because his study did not even study same-sex couples who grow up children together. his study merely compared adults of married heterosexual parents to adults who remembered that one of their parents had had some sort of same sex relationship.  &gt;and some of these studies do not posses the methodological fails of the pro-gay marriage camp ones.  as said, the regnerus study for example does. secondly, do you have the qualifications to spot the methodological fails?  &gt;further research would bring you to numerous scientific studies saying i am on the right side of this argument and you merely on the right side of history.  i have researched, and i presented to you the results. you are replying with ""search more"". it is not my job to look back up for your claims. it is your job.  what you are doing in essence is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k00ansfa4-y). you ignore the large consensus of broad range of scientific studies, and you look for a couple singular studies and use them to refute all other studies.  it's the same method used by climate denialists. current understanding of global warming is based on thousands and thousands of studies. and when a climate skeptic finds *one* study that says otherwise, he claims it proves all the other thousand and thoushands of studies are now refuted.  i'll ask you a question: **what kind of proof would you demand to believe same-sex parents are as good as male-female parents??**  &gt;your faith in science is way over the top. that is your only argument here. science, science, science.  well yea, after a certain point, the capacity of normal human being to make sense of the world is limited and blurred by resources, ideologies and cultures, so in order to understand the world more, we have to trust in science.  if you want to see the results of people who do not have faith in science, look at anti-vaccers who refuse to listen to science and then we get measles and other epidemics that can kill children.  besides, this started from your claim that ""*the best substitution for a child's family is another mother and father*"". if that claim should not be studied with science, then how do you measure ""best""? what is the ""best"" in here, if social studies, psychology, psychiatry and other sciences relating to human behavior are not to be trusted?  &gt;the positivist notion that empirical methods can be applied to the liberal arts is, in my view, false and you fail to see it. however, if you read the article, you'd see it is in fact scientific, but your bias is preventing you to.  scientific articles go trough peer-review process and are published in scientific journals. that article is not peer-reviewed and not published in a scientific journal.  &gt;the point is, you're not thinking nor looking around.  i can say the exact same thing about you, so that point is completely meaningless.  &gt;science is your god, while metaphysics or philosophical anthropology are strangers to you, even if they have superior methods to deal with the problem. explaining it all would require a great deal of effort i do not posses for a social justice warrior.  to be frank, you sound like a kind of social anti-justice warrior because you are willing to ignore the broad view of scientific field because ""*methaphysics and philosophical anthropology have superior methods to deal with the problem*"".  i've got news to you: they don't.   &gt;i do not equate love and relationships. you do. there may be no teleological digression between these two forms of love, however that is not the case for a relationship.  you said that the relationship of a same-sex couple who wants children is ""fundamentally different from a heterosexual family"".  the vast majority of people see that love and commitment is part of a long-term-relationship, the kind people who start families have. i do not equate love with relationships, but i see it as a part of it, like the vast majority of people see. you claim the relationship in same sex families is fundamentally different.   &gt;you'll need to read what i wrote again (and the article i posted, don't forget about that!).  i read. yet you again fail to specify what the fundamental difference is. the article you posted does not make any claims of fundamental differences either.  &gt;it's amazing how you do not stop at the notion that i'm a homo.  why should i?   &gt;your will to prove your point is so large you're trying to tell me you know what i think, what i've experienced and what i've deduced in life.   no. i just pointed out that you didn't present how your sexuality supports your argument. you again say that you've experienced and decuded something in life, but you refuse to say what. you said ""*do not try to make this about legitimate feelings between two adults. i should know, being a gay man all my life*"" but you in no way presented why you being gay should mean you know any better. so it's irrelevant, as you didn't say what in you being gay actually relates to the argument. you just said ""i know because i'm gay""  &gt;and i never wrote i was right because i'm gay, i merely wrote i think i know more about homosexual love than you.   yet you completerly failed to say what is the fundamental difference in homosexual love / relationship that ""you know"" but refuse to tell others.",1,

177396,"it's cruel for the mormon church to create these impossible, wrenching choices for people.  for your girlfriend re:  the mormon church's history on lgbt rights.  you can be a gay or lesbian member of the mormon church as long as you remain celibate for life.  otherwise, you're excommunicated.    bisexuals must marry people of the opposite gender.  no official stance on transgenders yet.  lgbts are second-class citizens.  more than 70% of lgbt mormons leave the church, either voluntarily or via excommunication because they haven't remained celibate.  according to the centers for disease control, lgbt mormon kids have significantly higher suicide rates than non-mormon lgbt kids—a problem that has been attributed to the church's longtime policy of forcing parents of gay kids to choose between their church and their children.   it also has long been common practice for mormon parents to kick lgbt adolescents out of their homes because of their sexual orientation.  the general conference is a semiannual gathering of mormons in salt lake city that is broadcast to 102 countries.  church leaders speak on a variety of spiritual topics.  (no women are allowed in the men's sessions, although men preside over all women's sessions.)  this last spring, the late mormon apostle l. tom perry, 92, defended ""traditional families"" — a legally married mother and father, who rear their children together — and warned against the dangers of ""counterfeit and alternative lifestyles,"" meaning lgbts.  from the church's mormons and gays site, created in 2012:  “though some people, including those resisting same-sex attraction [the church's term], may not have the opportunity to marry a person of the opposite sex in this life, a just god will provide them with ample opportunity to do so in the next. we can all live life in the full context of who we are, which is much broader than sexual attraction.”  [emphasis mine.]  in the 1970s, gay students at byu (brigham young university) were encouraged to administer electric shocks to their penises to “cure” their homosexuality.    at the time, the church taught that homosexuality was second only to murder in the eyes of god.  the church has advocated other forms of “reparative/conversion” therapy via the church-affiliated evergreen international, which closed in 2014.  now north star has abandoned reparative/conversion therapy and offers support to lgbt mormons.  until recently (perhaps still?), mormon leaders encouraged gay and lesbian mormons to “marry the gay away” - marry a heterosexual mormon of the opposite sex without necessarily telling his/her spouse beforehand.  many have, usually with heartbreaking results for their spouses, their children, extended families, and themselves.    jared fronk, an economics ph.d. in washington d.c., gay, and a former member of the church:  “it surpasses my skill with words to describe the sheer weight of cultural norms and religious dogma that drives gay men and women into heterosexual mormon marriages....  most mormon parents would rather their child die in righteousness — and thus be assured a place in heaven — than live in sin [of a same sex relationship].""  jason conner, 26, said he struggled with gay feelings while serving in a leadership role on his mormon mission in florida in 2006.  ""i was suicidal,"" he said. ""i couldn't live with the pressure. i was feeling so unholy.""   he said he was sent to ""conversion therapy"" in orlando where for a year he was told if he practiced his faith and prayed, feelings of same-sex attraction would go away.   ""i had a rubber band that i would flick every time i thought about it,"" he said. ""whenever i would see a man, i would have to picture myself in a bathtub full of worms.""   though the therapy lifted his depression, he said he was set on a disastrous path: he was told to move to utah, find a girl within six months, and then six months later, be engaged. conner enrolled at byu and made it to the engagement, but then broke it off.   ~~~~~~~~~  the lds church has been a driving force against gay-marriage initiatives since at least 1995. it was instrumental in delaying same-sex marriage in hawaii and alaska and, in 2000, it helped pass california's proposition 22 (the proposition 8 precursor known as the knight initiative), which defined marriage as solely between a man and woman. (prop. 22 was struck down by the california supreme court in 2008.)  the church has been credited with almost single-handedly getting prop. 8 passed in california in 2008, despite a well-funded opposition with backing from hollywood.  mormons - secretly urged on by church leaders, donated an estimated $30 million of the $42 million total to the campaign.  each weekend leading up to the vote, as many as 25,000 mormons were bused into california to canvas neighborhoods.  the church's involvement was exposed by lgbt activist fred karger.  to their credit, in utah this spring, the church backed legislation that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation when it comes to housing or employment.   however, they made sure religious groups and organizations are exempt from the requirement, as are boy scouts of america, which has close ties to the lds church.  in response to last week's scotus ruling on same-sex marriage, the church reaffirmed their doctrine of marriage between a man and a woman:  http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/supreme-court-decision-will-not-alter-doctrine-on-marriage  note:  the pr department didn't realize the mormon couple in their picture supports marriage equality.  heh.  the woman “rainbow-fied” the picture for her facebook profile photo:   http://kutv.com/news/local/lds-church-uses-photo-of-marriage-equality-supporter-in-release-about-unchanging-doctrine    to drive home the church's stance on marriage equality – as if members had any doubts, beginning this sunday, july 5, every congregation leader must read members a lengthy statement from the first presidency, detailing the church's response to the scotus ruling:  http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/supreme-court-decision-will-not-alter-doctrine-on-marriage   of course, the missionaries don't want your girlfriend to know any of this info.  best  http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/what-is-general-conference   http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/prop-8-mormons-gay-marriage-shift   http://www.sltrib.com/lifestyle/faith/2378770-155/group-scolds-mormon-apostle-for-disparaging  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15marriage.html?pagewanted=all  http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/57344806-78/north-star-evergreen-gay.html.csp   http://abcnews.go.com/health/mormon-gay-cures-reparative-therapies-shock-today/story?id=13240700  http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/suicide-violence-prevention.htm   http://mormonsandgays.org/   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/04/mormon-lgbt-anti-discrimination_n_6801202.html   http://mic.com/articles/108324/a-study-of-gay-mormons-married-to-straight-women-came-to-a-devastating-conclusion   edits: formatting; add a sentence",1,

[editor's note: due to reddit formatting 'trans' is used instead of 'trans(asterisk)']  **a little background and historical context first:** up to 5% of the world population experiences some degree of gender dysphoria - but significantly less than 5% of the population goes through reassignment surgery; also significantly less than 5% will ever tell anyone or otherwise do anything non-gender normative for fear of reprisal because of the following:   * trans youth account for 18% of the homeless population in medium to large size american cities.   * trans youth whose parents pressure them to conform to their anatomical gender report higher levels of depression, illegal drug use, suicide attempts, and unsafe sex than peers who receive little or no pressure from parents.  * 1 in 12 transgender people in america is murdered. (the average cisgendered heterosexual american has about a one in 18,000 chance of being murdered.)   * one american study of trans adults found that approximately 50% of respondents were survivors of violence or abuse, and another found that 25% of trans respondents had experienced hate-motivated physical/sexual assault or attempted assault. in a recent survey of trans people and loved ones in british columbia, 26% reported needing anti-violence services at some point in their life. in examining reports of hate crimes against trans people, researchers found that 98% of all ""trans"" violence was perpetrated specifically against people in the male to-female spectrum; of the 38 murders of trans people reported internationally in calendar year 2003, 70% were women of color.    * 78% of minors who are trans or gender-nonconforming report being harassed, and 35% physically assaulted, in school.   * 90% of trans adults report harassment or discrimination at work.    * 29% of trans adults report being harassed by the police.   * 49% of trans people attempt suicide. (the general percentage of americans who ever attempt suicide is 1.6%.)  trans people have been rooted throughout history all over the world.   * looking south: mtf priestesses have been found among the araucanians (southern chile and argentina) and mapuche. some females in the tupinamba tribe lived as men, hunted, and went to war. in 1576, explorer pedro de magalhaes recorded this, and recalling the greek legend of the amazons, named the amazon river for these tupinamba. for the yoruba (brazil), the deity shango is represented as all sexes.  * in our neighborhood: as late as 1930 (with the klamath in the pacific northwest), two-spirit natives are noted among tribal communities. originally called ""berdache,"" a name of largely insulting intent given by europeans, native culture adopted the term ""two-spirit"" as a blanket term -- though in reality, nearly every tribe had at least one (often several) unique name for two-spirit peoples, with the names sometimes addressing different aspects of those populations. two-spirit actually covers the full range of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons, as well as intersex and other gender-variant people. it was often thought that two-spirits had two spirits inhabiting the same body, and that two-spirit people deserved a special kind of reverence. jesuit priest jacques marquette notes that in the illinois and nadouessi tribes, nothing is decided without their advice. the sensational nature of reports of two-spirit peoples and the hatred they contained were used to try to justify genocide, theft of land and the dismantling of native culture and religion. in panama, explorer vasco nunez de balboa threw a king and forty others of a native tribe to be eaten by his dogs, because they crossdressed or had same-sex partners.  * looking north: inuit ftms serve white whale woman, who was believed to have been transformed into a man or woman-man.   * looking east: in seventh century bce, king ashurbanipal (sardanapalus) of assyria spent a great deal of time in womens' clothing, something that was later used to justify overthrowing him. in egypt, 1503 bce, egyptian queen hatshepsut ascended to the throne, the second egyptian queen to rule (the first was queen sobekneferu of the 12th dynasty). possibly learning from the disfavor shown to her predecessor, she donned male clothing and a false beard signifying kingship, and reigned until 1482 bce. she had one daughter, neferure, who she groomed as successor (male clothing, false beard and all), but neferure did not live into adulthood. and nzinga ruled as king of angola from 1624 - 1653, cross-dressed and led several successful military battles against the portuguese.  as a general historical point to make, white people used to make black people use different restrooms in the 20th century. we determined that was fundamentally wrong for thousands of different reasons and we put a stop to it. this is a relevant human rights issue because every single person needs to use the restroom. think about how many times you used the restroom yesterday. if you're a gender normative person you likely used the restroom in peace every time. you should extend the same peace and dignity to people that have a much harder life than you could ever imagine.  **back to your question:** so, a person could be genderfluid without being trans; however a person could be genderqueer and trans. in either instance it is going to be a person.   so your question of what qualifies someone as trans has an easy humanist answer (the commonly accepted criteria is that the person [1] identifies as trans and [2] feels that their gender assigned at birth does not accurately describe them)  gender dysphoria is just as much a choice as you chose to have your skin color prior to your birth. under generally accepted medical and scientific literature it's not a super fun party fad that you turn on and off like choosing a haircut, or a slick nickname like *tex*. as detailed above through statistics **it puts an individual at heightened risk for the worst kinds of things to happen to them in life.**   also, people born with vaginas assault women all of the time. it happens, like at least a few a year in harris county, though someone that exclusively handles criminal defense could likely ballpark that one more accurately.   **the 'legitimate issues' you might be concerned about:** a crime is still a crime, a criminal prosecution largely is not going to focus on the specifics of how they came to arrive at the scene - whether by false pretenses to claim they are gender fluid and today is a *lady day*, or if it's just your ordinary knife wielding heterosexual psychopath who slashes his way to the lady's restroom to commit other various crimes in there.   the sex offender specific laws and the corpus of the criminal laws apply generally to people. in the 17 jurisdictions with explicitly trans inclusive nondiscrimination laws that apply to private entities there has been no indicia generally that sex assaults have increased since the passage of such legislation, nor specifically that this great fear has ever come to fruition that a totally straight guy puts on a dress just to 'r' someone in a bathroom. there are plenty of psychopaths out there that just commit crimes against women when they want to - the prisons would be empty if humans all were on their best behavior at all times. but presuming that a psychopath will make extra efforts largely ignores the stupidity of most criminals - they do what they want, sometimes on video, and they hire a lawyer if they can afford one or they get appointed one by the court when their number is finally up and they are hauled in front of the judge.   i'm worried for the safety of the ladies in my life generally when they just go shoe shopping alone or that a murdering psychopath crosses their path because they are at the wrong place at the wrong time, but i have zero concern about them being alone with a trans person in the bathroom or otherwise in a private space just because it's a trans person. if they had neck tattoos or tear drop face tattoos that would be my main concern at that point, not that they were anatomically born the wrong gender and were in the process of rectifying that situation.   also if you have never been to prison, you don't want any details of your past coming out like that you were arrested wearing a dress. that's why i am not worried about men employing a clever ruse like that to sneak into a lady's restroom - even true thugs know there are serious consequences in the big house for that. prison justice isn't actually always justice, but it is swift.  i have not heard any reasonable arguments against my position ... because to reiterate a main point: there is absolutely no reliable evidence to suggest that sexual assaults, sexually perverse crimes, etc. have increased (in restrooms or outside of them) in states that have been allowing broadened trans access to restrooms.  tl/dr: i think we should protect the most vulnerable members of our society and allow them the basic decency to use a toilet in peace.",1,

346094,"""we have the other extreme: so-called ""christians"" that hold up signs at ""gay pride"" events that say things like, ""god hates f**s!"".""  st. thomas states that prudence knows when to speak and when to be silent, as someone such as myself that is surrounded by homosexual individuals, atheists, agnostics, jews, muslims and all sorts of stripes of different heretical/schismatic sects. i would not advise anyone to go out there and make a sign like that, or provoke someone to blaspheme god. st. thomas advises that if you know for certain that someone will blaspheme god as a result of a comment you make, that it would be better to refrain even from speaking truth at that moment. better to wait during a more opportune time, and this of course takes discernment something that fanatical protestants don't ever seem to have. this of course is obvious their false religion is totally void of grace, and no matter how hard they try they will simply fail, because their foundation is not with the lord.   anyways the whole god hates fags is theologically inept. first of all, god damns faggs. that would be the more precise term to use, for hate suggests very much an anthropocentric attachment to the word. sodomy cries out to heaven for vengeance, and the death of the sinner who commits it. this is much different than ""hate"" as it is commonly understood in english parlance talk.  to be honest, there is only one or two individuals who i was not sure that i knew when i was attending the indult a while back, that might have had a sex change, but i never bothered to ask, because it was none of my business. if the person was not willing to share, i should not pry or spread hear say. i have spoken to so many lesbians and homosexuals, including even lived with some for 3 months at a time. all i can say that some of them even thought they ""were good catholics"" and for a long time i sought to give them the benefit of the doubt. i don't think many realize just how powerful the modern argument to such individuals is, that they can't really help themselves. i.e. that it is the equivalent to hair color, size, teeth make up, and any other genetic factor you are born with. what i have personally seen, is that once they accept the whole argument that you are born gay, they usually anywhere from 3 months to 1 year later, become fully practicing homosexuals.   well we must make the distinction between false and true compassion. i certainly don't advocate alienating them as much as possible, but up to a certain point we should really out of true charity and love for their eternal souls. tell them especially if they are intimate with you (i.e share with you their secrets in private), that god cannot command the impossible.  the difference between heterosexual perversions and homosexual perversions, is that heterosexual perversions can and ought to tempered by a rightful healthy sexuality under what god permits by law. homosexual perversion are always going to be against the natural and divine law, no matter how ""innocent they might be"", it can be wanting to just cuddle or straight out sodomy. i know that you are aware of this, but the reason why i mention it is for the benefit of others.   i think many have really distorted especially the conciliar church and the modern catechism of the catholic church, with respect to the teaching of sexual inclinations and homosexuality. similar to the nfp crowd, they will compare their homosexual ""inclinations"" with a cross they have to bare. as if god would give them a cross that is totally unnatural, so now they think that they are somehow going to be more holy as a result of their perversion! you be surprised how many folks have told me that! they compare their wicked perversion to the cross of our lord jesus christ, and this is the very root of the problem. how could you ever start being sorry for your sins, if you can't deny the essence of the problem.   many under a pretense of compassion, will repeat the mantra to such individuals, and after hearing this a million times from their friends and family. they now think that they have been given a special cross in their life, and that god demands of them something unreasonable. give this little worm some time in their head and it is not unreasonable to see why is it that all of them end up having gay sex shortly afterwards. for why would god deprive of them of something so intimate as their own ""happiness."" so they have two choices, which is to adopt the errors of modernism in order to apply historicist analysis tot he question of the sin against nature, and how to be able to soothe their conscience. since the overwhelming majority of ""priests"" in the diocese are pro homosexual perversions. in my own home town i was deeply involved, only but 5 of them were against the homo agenda. out of those only two of them were public about it, the other 3 afraid of what might happen to them. by the way we are talking about 100+ priest diocese here. so go figure, and you might ask yourself ""how do you know."" well i know because i did actually ask all of them, over a period of time of course, but that is how i know. given that there was some controversy about this issue locally, it was easy to see who stands with the lord and those who profess a stance against morals.  several close trustworthy honest friends who were in the seminary, repeated the same problem (thank god they all left, some of them are on the path to the priesthood, others got married). also have stories of that dating back to at least the 80's and forward (older friends). they really have it absolutely spot on when they call the conciliar church a ""queer church"" run by overt queers or those who promote/defend queerdom to differing degrees. either through silence, modernism, liberalism, pick and choose your 100 heresies that permit such a pestilent environment to be fostered among the faithful. the best thing to do is simply to just stay away, do your best to talk to those individuals who are still good willed and not completely convinced that they are born gay. once they are convinced they are born gay, they have accepted heresy and as such are to be treated anathema. this is of course after you explain to them why, and if they are stubborn about it. you are to tell them you are always to have the door open the day that they reject their errors and are willing to start repairing the damage that they do to others.  a very simple example of compassion which is true and a compassion which is false. someone feeling sorry for the perpetrator of a crime is an example of false compassion, especially if the crime is grievous. say larsony, murder etc... so what they do is they ""go back"" to his family abusive home and start feeling that its ""not really"" his fault that he did this. it was all 100% due to his environment and even god forbid his mental genetic make up (something he obviously could not help). true compassion would be for the victim of a crime, whereby the person empathizes with the individual what he/she has suffered through. so much is the distress of the outsider, that through this they are able to in essence connect with the individual and form a deep bond that can bring deep comfort to the one grieving.   a criminal needs to be sorry, and i don't mean like ""say sorry dear johnny."" no, words mean absolutely nothing, he needs to by his deeds do reparation for the crimes he committed in proportion to the damage made. this is of course to his own benefit for the divine judge will lessen his punishment in purgatory if he is to be counted amongst the elect after he dies.   false compassion is applied to homosexuals who are perpetrating a crime, which is put on an equal footing with murder (another sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance and the death of the sinner who commits it). they are committing a crime against nature, and as such we are not to pity them, but be truthful with charity. the most important thing is to be able to determine whether the person recognizes that he is sick, as opposed to perfectly healthy and normal. if they were abused as children, or were shown pornography since a young age does not change the fact of them being homosexuals.   the best we could do is to simply be there and pray with them, and for them that they might have the courage to say no to heresy. to say no to the spirit of the world, and to the satanic agenda of heretics out there trying to convince them otherwise. we should just simply remind them of the gravity of such a thing, and so long a sinner desires to be converted, god will not forsake him ever. if they have that true and supernatural hope, they will surely be cured of their problem.",1,1

""homosexual men are more than twice as likely to spread hiv and other stds than straight men, which applies to lesbian woman too."" okay, so what?  we don't have anti-sodomy laws anymore, so even if gays couldn't get married they'd still 'spread hiv' just as much as they would if they were married.  and that's assuming that's still the case - the 'aids is a gay disease' thing is so 1970s.  ""gay are not the proper role models to raise children.""  every real, scientific journal who's looked at this say children raised by gay couples are no worse off than by straight couples.  ""it's unnatural. yes, some animals do it, but just being found in nature doesn't make it natural. homosexuality is found almost never, only in very rare cases. albinism is more common, and that's highly considered unnatural."" lol you know what else is unnatural?  computers.  cars.  phones.  clothes.  we as a race have collectively said a 'fuck you' to nature long ago.  ""marriage is a religious institution. it's has it's own laws based on religion, and most agree against gay marriage."" yea well it gives non-religious, real benefits to the people in it.  and besides, just because more religions say x doesn't make it more correct in the eyes of the law, otherwise we'd all be muslims (because they have the most people).  separation of church and state - again - says that the government cant' endorse any religion over another, so there's no reason for the 'religious institution' of marriage to both have real benefits and to not apply to other religions (like episcopalians, who are pro-gay marriage).  any more?  d: um... oh right, i forgot you're... how to put this lightly... homophobes.  there's precisely no reason homosexual relationships shouldn't be equal to heterosexual ones, because that's unequal protection, and we've got an amendment for that.  it's 14.  read it.  we've also got considerable court precedent that says they are - see above (there's more but, again, i won't get into that).  i guess, in my eyes, that's a pretty easy assumption to make, because it's just the 'people are equal regardless of how they're born' assumption.  gay people are born gay - that's 100%, scientifically proven.  saying their relationships are unequal is like saying asian people's relationships are unequal, and therefore asians can't get married (refraining from using blacks because... well, nevermind).  asians have no control over the fact that they were born asian, they just want to love people.  gays have no control over the fact that they were born gay, and we shouldn't be treating them as second-class citizens.  e: hmmmm... why shouldn't secular equality be good?  do you think that people should be treated better or worse by the government based on a quality they had no control over?  do you think that's a just and fair thing for a government to do?  because i don't, and if you do we've got some serious issues.  just imagine if being gay was the norm, and straight marriage was what was in question.  would you want to be treated as a second-class citizen because you're straight?  no.  you had no control over being straight, you just are straight, and nothing could ever make you gay.  you just want to love who you love, and not have anyone say you're better or worse because of it.  that's how gay people feel all the time.  and if your'e incapable of understanding that, then you're a literal sociopath who is incapable of feeling empathy.  i'm a straight, white male, and i understand that.  i feel for everyone's problems just as much as my own.  hence why i'm a 'sjw' - i care about the plights of everyone.  i want everyone to be equal regardless of what they were born as.  f: the purpose of marriage doesn't matter.  some people get married for religious reasons - good for them.   but plenty of atheists get married too.  some people get married for children - great for them.  but plenty of people who don't want children get married too.  *i* think the purpose of marriage is to allow two people who love each other to be bound for the rest of their lives.  but the purpose is irrelevant, what matters is that gay people want to do it, and the only reason they can't is because they were born gay.  and that's segregation.  edit: i think you'll find you are just as 'awash in your cultural biases' as i am.  everyone is unconsciously surrounded by bias, it's impossible to escape with our limited brains.",1,

969685,"does it matter? plenty of people today believe homosexuality to be other than an unchangeable inborn quality. few today would say that betty isn't gay because she believes that her childhood made her a lesbian, or that bob isn't gay because he feels that he chose to be, so using that as a prerequisite for homosexuality when discussing the past seems like a reach to me.  but to answer your question, it was sometimes described as something innate. in de sade's justine, the edition from 1801, this is the description of a character:  &gt;if his figure or his traits had some flaw, it was that they were a bit too close to this nonchalance, of this softness which only belongs to women; it seemed that while giving him the attributes of this sex, nature had equally inspired him with its tastes...  there are similar descriptions of ""tribades"" with large clitorises, but unlike bressac (who is explicitly not at all interesting in women) they are usually bisexual. but their physiognomy is definitely connected to their sexual preferences.   and then there's this a few pages later, where the character described above says:  &gt;don't think, justine, that we are made as other men; it's an entirely different construction; and this ticklish membrane that furnishes your temple of venus, heaven when creating us has decorated the altar where our lovers sacrifice with it.  so yeah. homosexuality here is something you're born with, and it's something that makes gay men a distinct group. with special butts. with a ticklish membrane. just like in the temple of venus. ~~sometimes i hate the 18th century.~~ it's interesting, because homosexual activity is pretty much ubiquitous in justine, while bressac is the only one written about like this. apparently the rest are straight guys who just happen to like receiving anal sex, which matches the excerpt from le bordel national, where lafayette professes to only be interested in women while being penetrated by bailly. similarly, there are characters in justine who are only sexually attracted to men, but will sodomize a woman as long as her vulva is hidden. it's interesting, because that to me seems like sexual identities are even more immutable than in the modern day, where heterosexuality and homosexual behavior are seen as mutually exclusive, and vice versa.   on the other hand, there are other texts where the benefits of homosexuality are debated, which could mean that it was seen as something that could be chosen. however, those are satires, and might not reflect what people actually thought about sexuality, since the point is to show the ridiculous ideas of political opponents.",1,

426612,"i am not sure why, but the topic of gay marriage has been on my mind quite a bit lately. there has been a lot of talk on the news about this. there seems to be a very vocal group of people who are pushing the agenda. i hear very little about any opposition from this. mainly because straight people think it doesn’t affect them so they really don’t care. however, i don’t think it is initially obvious what the detrimental effect the gay marriage agenda will have.   i am not sure why i am so fired up about this. i guess it is part because of the birth of my daughter, and the sudden fear i have that the earth will not be as nice a place for her as when i entered the world. or maybe it is because throughout my life i have seen the steady degradation of the moral fabric that our society is made of. we are to the point where kids are idolizing drug addicts like lindsey lohan, and porn stars like kim kardashian. add in the ‘politically correct’ agenda and it’s even worse. we can’t even say “merry christmas” or “under god” in the pledge of allegiance. we have a formula that will tear apart the very things that made america great.  i could go on and on.   i want to say that, i do not want to offend anyone but i feel strongly compelled to voice my opinion. i have zero problems with homosexuals. in fact, my mother owning a hair salon nearly my entire life, i have had more than average exposure to gay people. i have never had a problem with them, and by no means am i anti-gay. in fact, i am 100% for gay couples having the same rights are married people. i am not however, in support of redefining marriage.   the other day, i made a post on facebook that said:   “marriage, to me, is between a man and a woman”   as expected, one of my lesbian friends (not sure if we are still friends) was the first to comment and she went on to tell me how disappointed she was and how sad she thought i was. i tried to have a friendly debate, which unfortunately went sour and i had to delete the post. she didn’t understand how i felt, and resorted to calling me “ignorant” and a “bigot”. so i tried to find a better way to put my thoughts into words and did a quick google search that led me to this link:   http://www.law2.byu.edu/organizations/marriage_family/talking%20pts%20-%2013%20pts.pdf     i thought there were several good points here, and i have taken them and modified them slightly to try to explain why i feel so strongly about this.   1.      this is about marriage, it is not about homosexuality.   the issue is whether the basic social institution of marriage should be radically redefined. the issue is not about homosexual relations, which have long existed without needing (or wanting) to be called “marriages.” it is not about homosexuality; it is simply about the institution of marriage. today, tragically, many marriages fail, but legalizing same-sex marriage will not solve that problem. rather, by reducing the meaning of marriage, and applying the “marriage” label to gay and lesbian relations, will only worsen the problem.       men and women are different, and the union of a man and a woman is different that the union of two men or two women.   throughout history marriage has been defined as the union of a man and a woman for powerful reasons relating to the complementary differences between men and women. the differences combine to create a unique and essential social relationship. marriage channels human sexuality into responsible and socially valuable functions, namely adult complementary sexual union that results in the procreation, nurturing, and training of the next generation. it gives couples and society a future. the combination of the opposite sexes creates a distinctive integrative union and social relationship. no two men together or two women together can do this. just as the combination of the different chemical elements na (sodium) + cl (chlorine) together make salt, but na + na or cl + cl do not.     3.      tolerance opposes same-sex marriage.   the law categorizes and treats relationships in three ways: some are barred and prohibited; others are tolerated and permitted; and some others are preferred and privileged. historically, same-sex relationships were prohibited, but in recent decades they have become tolerated and permitted in the united states and many other countries. but tolerance is quite different from preference. conjugal marriage always has been the most preferred and privileged social relationship because it is the foundation of society. the claim for same-sex “marriage” abandons tolerance and seeks special preference; it actually removes the preferential treatment of conjugal marriage, rather than elevating same-sex couples. where same-sex marriage is legalized, tolerance is restricted. freedom of religion is undermined, and freedom of speech is curtailed. children in public schools are taught not true tolerance but the moral relativism of equivalency, i.e. that different forms of human sexuality are no more than matters of personal preference. disagreement with this “principle” is not tolerated.     4.      equality does not require treating different relationships the same.   same-sex marriage advocates purport to desire “equal treatment” with heterosexual couples, but it is inequality to give full marital status to relationships that are so markedly different in lifestyle and social impact. same-sex marriage really means the near-term elimination of actual marriage. as a matter of nature it cannot fulfill the same functions as traditional marriage, and the effect is to pull traditional marriage down to the lowest common denominator and soon render it meaningless. our society cannot accept this outcome.     5.      marriage is a pre-existing social institution, not a mere legal creation or social construct.   marriage between male and female is a uniquely ubiquitous social institution, found in all civilized human societies. finding marriage already in existence, the law has recognized the importance of marriage by regulating and thereby protecting it. the law does not create marriage any more than it creates parents, land or water, but the law regulates those resources -- marriage, parenting, land, and water -- in the public interest.     6.      the legal definition of marriage signals important social functions.   the way the law defines and treats marriage sends powerful social signals to all members of society about marriage roles and what is expected of married persons. by diluting the meaning of marriage, reducing it to a mere romantic relationship between any two persons, it dilutes the meaning of marriage itself and ignores and denigrates the integral responsibilities of marriage and marital parenthood. conjugal marriage reinforces the taking of responsibility for the natural outcome of the sexual act: children; same-sex marriage weakens that tie.     7.      legalizing same-sex marriage harms families and makes more vulnerable those who invest their lives, and sacrifice their careers, for their marriages and families.   in states and nations where same-sex marriage has been legalized, the public commitment to families and conjugal marriage and families is significantly weakened. mothers are marginalized, and social support for them weakens. sexualization of society increases. public support for marital parenting wanes. marital childbearing and childrearing drop, and public education becomes more propagandistic. churches and religion are harassed.  8.      legalizing same-sex marriage harms children by depriving them of a mother or father, and removing the clear legal signal that marriage connects parents to children and parental responsibility.   all children need and deserve to be raised by a mother and a father; they are deprived of that by same-sex marriage. two moms are not the same things as a mom and a dad. legalization of same-sex marriage is false advertising to children; it teaches them that same-sex coupling and parenting is fully equivalent to dual gender marriage and parenting. it deprives some children of a parental connection with half of their biological heritage and family. parental authority is diminished.     9.      legalizing same-sex marriage harms society by the transformative power of inclusion and by weakening the basic infrastructure of society.   conjugal marriage historically has “scripted” responsible living and civic virtue. gay and lesbian lifestyles do not. by redefining marriage to include gay and lesbian couples, the social meaning of marriage is transformed by the power of inclusion; the culture of infidelity, promiscuity and polyamory that characterizes gay and lesbian sexual relations will redefine what marriage means in a way that will undermine that social institution and bring suffering to many families. society should not engage in “consumer fraud” by sending the message that there is no difference between conjugal marriage and same-sex unions.     10.  marriage is defined to serve the public interest, not private special interests.   marriage is a public institution, not a mere private arrangement. the law allows many private relations organized and defined as the private parties wish, but the institution of marriage between a man and a woman exists and is protected by law to promote fundamental social needs, including the necessary link between husbands and wives and between parents and children for critical social needs, not just to bind boyfriends and girlfriends and other romantic interests.   11.  the radical redefinition of marriage is a matter for the people, not the courts, to decide   12.  many constitutional amendments have been adopted to protect threatened basic institutions and rights.   13.  it doesn’t end with redefining marriage.   legalization of same-sex marriage is the beginning, not the end, of the social revolution gay and lesbian activists promote.",1,
780780,"it is an absolute mistake to think jay is not either enjoying the same benefits of selective information (see all of those screen caps) as serial does, or that the intercept doesn't also have the power of editorial narrative.   i feel like jay's problem of real life impacts comes from the fact of serial's popularity, not serial's content. because right now, 37k readers are listed on this on this sub. statistically (and once you throw in 7 million) you're dealing with such a large population sample that you're going to end up with with some unscrupulous and morally bankrupt folks.  there have been a few questions as to the ethics of serial, the way in which it makes real events into a narrative, and real people into pieces of that narrative. to that i say that every radio documentary, and every documentary period has that effect. it's part of the way humans consume information and media. from a journalistic standpoint, everything in serial, including jay's testimony and participation, is newsworthy. it's public. no piece of information was bullied or forcibly taken from any individual.   the fact of the matter is, anyone who has heard that testimony has the right to judge its validity or credibility. anyone who says ""we're not in a position to judge"" or ""i don't judge"" is a straight up liar. a person can't not judge, even if they tried. for my part, what i find compelling about serial overall is not that i get to feel the happy anticipation of being able to feel contempt- it's that i have no real idea what to make of anyone. adnan is a massive question mark for me. jay is a massive question mark. sarah koenig has tried to give both as much depth as the medium allows.  i don't condone any personal harassment of any person involved in this story. i don't feel a great big wrench about contemplating hae's family in this because they are a very small part of this story, and lose nothing by this investigation. adnan's family gains something if he is exonerated. hae's family gets confirmation of his guilt if he is not. jay gets confirmation and closure, if he is not. no one has anything to be afraid of except jay- but no one should have to tolerate incursion into their life by rabid internet users. not hae's family, not jay's family. i recognize that the reminder of these events are painful for both, but that does make them the sacred property of any one person. my father committed suicide when i was 17, but i don't have the right to go around telling people they can't talk about suicide in front of me because i find it painful. i can ask them to, but i wouldn't, because i am not the only person who is affected by those events. we can't ask for a gag order for hae's family because that would prevent adnan's family from having any part of the conversation.   the biggest standout to me is that sarah koenig has taken care not to vilify anyone in this case. not a single person. she has spoken only to facts. in fact, i'd say in the whole podcast the person who comes out the worst is christina gutierrez-and not because koenig blames her for failing adnan, but because she acknowledges the challenges that professional faced in private.  from what i can see, the only person who is actually doing the vilifying is jay. jay is consistently the only person to vilify adnan. the world has a right to know exactly why. shoe on the other foot, his actions made adnan's family into casualties- and adnan's possible guilt is not his family's responsibility. jay has no right to expect to be exempted from public anger, regardless of who is guilty or who did what. that said, people need to leave him alone. anyone who does trespass on his property or offer threat to his family, they need to be arrested and prosecuted.",0,

160543,"in [*one hundred years of homosexuality*](https://wannabegay2.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/halperin-termenulhomosexualitate.pdf), david halperin gives a nice succinct history of sexuality as characteristic of a persons. basically, the history goes that prior to the 19th century, there was no ""homosexuality."" but during that century, psychiatric practice was caught up in the regulation of emerging sexual and gender norms. and from this came the embryonic category *sexual inversion.* sexual inverts were characterized as having various crossings between the sexes, ranging anywhere from men who were too fond of cats to transvestites and sodomites. of course, like any other scientific enterprise, psychiatric practitioners sought to disassociate themselves from religious mores and establish the objectivity of their craft. so, sexual inversion was fractioned into different configurations, the two major ones being *sexual object choice* and *sexual aim*. to put it simply, sexual object choice would evolve into *sexuality*, and sexual aim would become deviant or dysphoric gender(s).  in this outline there is the historic construction of sexuality, specifically homosexuality. of course there are some interesting contradiction that emerge from our history of sexuality, and how it fits into current understandings of sexuality. for example despite the split that occurs between the two ""inversions,"" there remains this tense thread linking the two. in their relations to cisgender heterosexuality, often termed ""normal,"" ""natural,"" ""productive,"" or cisgender heterosexuality, sexuality and gender/sex trade back and forth meaning. this is the interesting key in the construction of sexuality (and gender), that is, it's a meaningful *cultural fiction*. these various categories are built up in relation to each other, one conferring meaning or (de)value on another. and when reflecting on history, sexual object choice has not always been meaningful or configured in this way. that is, sexuality and sexual behavior are not trans-historical, trans-cultural categories.  one interesting thing that comes out of this relational structuring of sexuality is how it plays out in some contemporary scientific studies of sexuality (ann fausto-sterling's books provide a lot of content on this subject). in the emphasis that is placed on the naturalness of various sexualities, some researchers have sought to show sexual categories as innate parts of one's bodily development or brain. for example, in neuroscience research aimed at characterizing the ""gay"" brain, ""gay"" brains are compaired to ""female"" brains, and similarities are highlighted that are supposed to account for ""gayness."" of course, what is interesting here is how the stablization of ""gay"" as a brain characteristic is done through reference to an already socially constructed cateogory, that of sex/gender. this has added even further complication as researchers have sought out the source of gender dysphoria by looking at ""trans"" brains and compairing them to ""lesbian"" brains, and even ""normal"" brains. in a way, each category is stablized and made meaningful through reference to *other* categories that are socially constructed. not to put to fine a point on it, the construction of this scientific knowledge turns on the constructs of gender, sex, and sexuality.",1,
111486,"first of all, let's toss all these buzzwords out the window. transphobic, heterosexist, whatever. these words are invented by academics *for* academics to understand each other. in everybody conversation they're more likely to confuse than anything else, including the people using them.  second of all, sounds like you went to some sort of tumblr-esque space. don't worry about the zealots. every group has them and from the sounds of it didn't deserve the response you got.  now, to answer your questions:  &gt;1) first question is already implied above. do i refer to this person as ""he/him"", or ""she/her""? i'm going to assume the latter, but i want to learn the right way to discuss this stuff, and using ""it"" seems - unkind, at the least.  she/her. pronouns are based off of gender, not reproductive sex.  &gt;2) is alice considered heterosexual or homosexual? she thinks of herself as a woman, and is attracted to men, but is biologically a man.  i'm going to deviate from your question a bit here, but i'll answer it after. alice is reproductively male, but i don't think you could categorize her as a man that easy. if she is presenting as a woman i am going to assume she has been on hormones for decent amount of time(although not always the case). her estrogen and testosterone levels are going to be within female ranges. this is going to change how, on a cellular level, her dna is expressed. from the current evidence we have, if you did a brain scan of alice she would have brain structures more closely resembling that of a female rather than a male. calling her a ""biological man"" is tough because you're only looking at the body's phenotype, or structure, rather than other biological markers that denote male or female. one way to think about this is that alice is neurologically intersexed. some ""tests"" for sex say male and others say female.  now to the question. orientation is based off of gender and not sex. man and woman are gender. male and female are sex. as a woman attracted to men alice would be heterosexual.  &gt;3) it seems that the majority of the lgbta community accepts that performing surgery to make alice's biology match her gender identity (what i would term ""healing the body"") is perfectly acceptable, and yet any attempt to make her gender identity match her biology (what i would term ""healing the mind"") is rejected outright. let me be clear - i understand that the systems in place today are not successful, and in many cases use inhumane practices. i don't want to be seen as supporting conversion therapy. they are doing it wrong. but there also seems to be an overall attempt to reject the label ""gender dysphoria,"" as well as a desire to supress serious research into treating the mental side of it. the assumption across the board seems to be ""if your brain and your body don't match, you have to change the body."" why is that? why isn't it just as valid to suggest that we consider real alternatives to bring the two in alignment by changing the brain?  rejection of dysphoria is a...messy topic. first of all it is a small subsection of the trans community that believes that dysphoria is not required for one to be transgender. second of all there is a whole lot of misunderstanding surrounding the criteria for [gender dysphoria](http://www.theravive.com/therapedia/gender-dysphoria-dsm--5-302.85-\(f64.9\)) as it's detailed in the dsm, which is the manual for mental disorders. what often happens is that people claim that ""being transgender is mental disorder!"" which is was...in dsm-iv, the previous edition, under gender identity disorder(gid), diagnosing the identity rather than the dysphoria. with the move to the new dsm-5 gid was replaced with gender dysphoric disorder, diagnosing the dysphoria as the illness.  what happens is that when people say that ""being transgender is a mental disorder!"" they are ignoring the distinction that the american psychological association has made. being transgender itself is not a mental disorder. the discomfort one has not living as their identified gender is. when trans individuals bring up this distinction it can often look like we don't believe in dysphoria, but the vast majority of us definitely do.  as for the ""why not treat the brain?"" question, let's do a thought experiment. i am andi. i am a trans girl. let's cut off my arm. i am now a trans girl with 3 limbs. let's cut off my other arm and both legs. i am now andi with no limbs. science has figured out a way to [separate my head from my bod](http://png-3.findicons.com/files/icons/1227/futurama_vol_5_heads_in_jars/256/richard_nixon_s_head.png)y and keep me alive so we do that. i am still andi and i am still a transgirl, but i'm only a head.  now, we are also in the future and we have precise ways to change brain structure. we change my brain's structure to male. i'm...not really andi anymore. i still have alot of things that made me andi, but i'm not her. and i might not be a bad person, i might be a very good person, but i'm not really me anymore.  now let's extend changing people to other realms as well. the planet is overpopulated and the only sure way that the government has found to control the population is to control their sexuality through this technology. would you be alright using this technology to erase the ""straight"" part of a human's brain and replace it with a ""gay"" part? or would something that made these people themselves be lost in that transformation? i think it would.  also, it brings up the point of autonomy. should i be forced to change my mind to fit society and make sure other people aren't uncomfortable? or should my identity and my life be subject to a democracy that doesn't include me?  now, beyond morals and thought experiments we just don't have any evidence that anything like conversion therapy works, but therapy to deal with dysphoria related issues is very encouraged. read through the posts here for a day or two and see how often therapy is mentioned or suggested to help overcome these issues. it's a lot. you're not seeing research into that area, not because trans activists don't want it, but because the science hasn't shown anything to necessitate research into that area. it hasn't borne fruit before so it probably won't again.   &gt;4) i find the label ""heterosexist"" difficult; i don't understand what those who label me as such are proposing i do instead. given that the majority of people i interact with are openly cisgendered heterosexuals, is it really such a terrible thing to assume that anyone i don't know otherwise for is the same? the only other alternative i can think of is to assume the opposite - that everyone i don't know otherwise for is a transgendered homosexual - which seems equally ridiculous.  again, the academic language thing. people throw the shit around without explaining it...with nuance.  alright, go to google image search. search for ""couple kissing."" now scroll for a bit. notice anything? it's almost all pretty straight white couples. now, by demographics and how we process attractiveness it...should be mostly pretty straight white couples...but the proportions are way off. how many pictures do you think it takes to find a homosexual couple kissing? by my rough estimate i was about 300 pictures in before i saw a pair of lesbians. with this ratio you'd assume lesbians were only  .3% of the population. (on a side note it's even funnier looking for a black couple. you'd think they were less than 1% of the population or something).  calling *you* heretosexist is a little misdirected because the phenomenon is societal. and while we, as people, make up society it only makes sense that you would probably assume, by simple statistics that someone is straight and cisgendered.  the problem is in the degree of representation and acknowledgment in society. imagine for a second that you are a transman. you are still you in the head entirely, but you have a woman's body. you're young and going through puberty and hating all the changes that are going on and don't know why. everyone just *assumes* that you're a girl having problems and you have no reason to doubt this because your exposure to being transgender is probably limited in both scope and depth. this isn't exactly active malice, but it is doing a disservice to the people who identify this way. people could figure it out sooner. realize there are pockets of society who exist that are like them. live their life in a happy manner they way they want instead of suffering in the dark.  this also comes with *accurate* portrayals as well. often a transgender character is used as comic relief. if your only exposure to trans individuals is laughing at them, don't you think you'd probably do anything you could not not be trans?  anyways, this got long so i'm going to wrap this up. i hope it explained some things and let me know if you have any more questions.",1,
994458,"some people who spend a lot of time thinking about these things forget what it was like to not know much. here's a little history  there was no such thing as transgender until the 60s or so; only homosexuals and then transvestites; which would include drag queens, transsexuals and transgender.   in the 20s and 30s, gay people paired off as very specific couples: butch and femme for lesbians, and sissy and rough trade for gay men. most trans people would have thought they were homosexual and would probably cross dress, some lived as drag queens or ""transvestites"" all the time which might suggest they were actually transgender.   gay couples emulated society pre-60s because there was no other relationship traditions, and feminine and masculine gay men and women adopted gender roles associated with their gender. butch lesbians would cress dress in suits and top hats, and feminine gay men would often do drag and dress as women, but mostly not and assigned to the submissive role in the relationship anyway. couples would usually be ""butch/femme"" or ""sissy/rough"", with the ""rough"" often being closeted lower or middle class masculine men.  in the 30s-60s there was difficulty in understanding why some gay men dressed as women and some were feminine but didn't dress as women, and why some where masculine etc. because masculine men were closeted and invisible, it helped pushed the idea all gay men are feminine.   transgender people themselves didn't know what being transgender was any better than anyone else; they were still called drag queens but would often earn a living in ""female impersonation"" contents and be seen as very beautiful, in contrast to other drag queens who felt male or dressed in extravogent costumes.   books would come out like ""the transsexual phenomenom"" which gave transgender people an identity, and allowed them to understand what they were feeling and why they weren't just men who dressed as women and vice versa. christine jorgensen, the first trans woman in the us to have a sex change, did so in 1952 and became an instant celebrity.  around the mid-60s tv broadcasts like these happened:  https://distrify.com/films/2239  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmr3kq9k-zk&amp;t=17m56s  and transgender people started to say ""i'm not a drag queen who wears crazy clothes, i'm a heterosexual woman who wants to be taken seriously as a woman and dresses professionally."" and from there transgender, transsxual and gender fluid people were distinguished from homosexuals who dressed up as women. the term ""transvestite"" went out of fashion as an umbrella term for every one who cross dresses  1960s onwards. with men growing their hair out and women wearing jeans, it was popular to challenge gender roles. conversation around sexuality and gender was very ""big"" from the 60s onwards and people began to be able to make distinctions between homosexuals, bisexuals, drag queens, transgender, intersex, asexual and later gender fluid and more. masculine gay men realised all homosexuals weren't feminine and asserted their identity, which stopped sexuality being associated with gender so much.   n the 70s gay men began to establish a masculine identity to counter the stigma of being feminine by the media and society, combined with transgender people's assertion they aren't homosexual, are a couple of reasons gender and sexuality become to get more detatched from one another.    the actual science is complex, but you can find information on biology, neurobiology etc. which explore how gender and sexuality relate to the brain under specific categories at /r/lgbtlibrary along with various other educational resources  edit: [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxaog8vayzi&amp;feature=youtu.be) is considered a good start also",1,

732796,"&gt; this is simply because you happened to pop out of a womb in your birth city. if that womb had been in mecca you might be a devout muslim right now.  if you were born in mecca, you're more likely to go for the same sex than if you were born in a liberal western society with easy contact with the opposite sex.  same-sex behavior is *more* common in ultra-strict cultures.  http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/05/the-kingdom-in-the-closet/305774/  &gt; “it’s a lot easier to be gay than straight here,” he had said. “if you go out with a girl, people will start to ask her questions. but if i have a date upstairs and my family is downstairs, they won’t even come up.”  # &gt; in saudi arabia, “it’s easier to be a lesbian [than a heterosexual]. there’s an overwhelming number of people who turn to lesbianism,” yasmin said, adding that the number of men in the kingdom who turn to gay sex is even greater. “they’re not really homosexual,” she said. “they’re like cell mates in prison.”  &gt;this analogy came up again and again during my conversations. as radwan, the saudi american, put it, “some saudi [men] can’t have sex with women, so they have sex with guys. when the sexes are so strictly segregated”—men are allowed little contact with women outside their families, in order to protect women’s purity—“how do they have a chance to have sex with a woman and not get into trouble?” tariq, a 24-year-old in the travel industry, explains that many “tops” are simply hard up for sex, looking to break their abstinence in whatever way they can. francis, a 34-year-old beauty queen from the philippines (in 2003 he won a gay beauty pageant held in a private house in jeddah by a group of filipinos), reported that he’s had sex with saudi men whose wives were pregnant or menstruating; when those circumstances changed, most of the men stopped calling. “if they can’t use their wives,” francis said, “they have this option with gays.”",1,

200978,"really enjoyed it thus far, i hope you intend to continue going scene by scene through the movie. one thing i'm not sure you touched on, and i assume would during the psychosis scene later, was the relationship between olive and caden, and olive and adele. you showed eaches reaction to her becoming upset at the idea of having blood, but their relationship itself wasn't talked about (if i'm remembering correctly). it always seemed to me that adele wanted to push the responsibility of olive onto caden, yet when she leaves, she takes olive with her. almost as if she's enjoying the fruits of olive's childhood, but leaving caden to eat the rest. further is the idea that olive is in fact an extension of caden, adele can never escape caden as long as olive is with her, which to me comes back to the scene where olive is afraid of the blood inside her. caden tries to tell her that yes, she has blood (he wants to feel a bit of himself is in olive), but adele tells olive that she doesn't have blood (saying caden is not in olive) which allows her to escape from caden, with olive, and not feel like, or able to deny, that caden's work still lingers in the form of olive.",0,

paul was not saying that idolatry turns people gay; rather, he was saying that idolatry led to participation in shameful acts of lust. i believe most of the participants were heterosexuals who were acting contrary to their nature. let me explain, using cybele worship as an illustration.  ten to fifteen years before paul wrote his letter to rome, emperor claudius permitted the worship of cybele, a mother goddess, to take place in rome. there were prominent temples to the goddess in rome (where the letter was being sent to) and in corinth (where paul wrote the letter). greeks and romans were abandoning the worship of the invisible deity taught by their own philosophers, and were worshiping cybele instead, using idols of women, lions, serpents, and birds. the male priests of the goddess castrated themselves (what a penalty for their error!), and played the part of women in temple prostitution. even the women likewise, who worshiped cybele, were equipped with artificial phalli/dildos, and played the part of men in pagan prostitution. most of these worshipers were naturally heterosexual, but gave themselves over to the frenzied sexual rituals in order to honor cybele.  you see, just as the majority of hindus are straight, so likewise, the majority of idol worshipers in rome were straight — but took part in dishonorable acts as part of pagan worship. similar things happened among worshipers of aphrodite and other deities. as i said before, romans 1 is not about gay christian boys or girls, but about idolaters with darkened understanding.  but as you said, we all are flawed, yet loved! paul goes on in chapter 1 to mention all kinds of sin, and then in 2:1 turns the table and says even the jews were guilty, indeed, all the world reaps the wages of sin, yet we are all given the gift of eternal life through jesus christ! that is indeed a marvelous comfort!  another passage often quoted against us is 1 corinthians 6:9, wrongly translated as “homosexuals.” but remember that, 500 years ago, martin luther translated “arsenokoites” as “child molesters.” recall the story of jupiter/zeus arriving in the form of an eagle and abducting the boy ganymede to be his cup bearer and sex slave. keep in mind that, in ancient rome, masters could have sex with any male or female slave they wished — this was rape. very often, men married to women kept boy slaves or prostitutes on the side to have sex with. so i believe that passage, in the culture of rome, was referring to the abuse of boy slaves and boy prostitutes, not to a loving, equal, committed relationship.  sometimes genesis 19 is mentioned, but the sin of sodom was partly arrogance and oppressing the poor (ezekiel 16:49) and partly an attempt to gang rape the messengers of god. judges 19 also refers to gang rape of a female concubine by the men of gibeah. but genesis 19 no more condemns all homosexuality than judges 19 condemns all heterosexuality.  finally, leviticus was written to ancient jews, not modern gentile christians. i eat pork, shellfish, and cheeseburgers; i wear blended fabrics; i shave my sideburns; and i dare to shake hands with a menstruating woman — for those laws were not addressed to me. so, jewish men were to abstain from anal intercourse (this may have referred to pagan male prostitutes in canaan), but interestingly, many conservative rabbis permit two jewish men to be partners as long as they do not engage in that particular act (other sexual acts are okay). notice also that women are not even mentioned, so apparently jewish lesbians are okay.  my friend, when it comes to ethics, people use the bible to prove all kinds of things. faithful believers support and oppose capital punishment; dedicated christians support killing in war, and pacifism. life is complex! i believe christ did not wish to burden us with rules like the pharisees. he simply said, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” and, “love one another as i have loved you.” we are not under the law of moses; god has imparted the living holy spirit into our hearts with the inner principle of love. therefore we are not slaves under a yoke, but free (galatians 5:1).  if i ever meet a fine gay man who is spiritual and loving and mutually attractive, and if i felt the lord leading me to him and him to me, i would feel free to be his mate. jesus was lord of the sabbath, healed the sick on the sabbath, allowed his disciples to pluck grain on the sabbath, commended abiathar for giving the holy showbread to david’s hungry men, touched the lepers, and allowed the woman with a hemorrhage to touch him. jesus valued people and their needs more than rules! since i am not anointed and gifted to do celibacy well, i believe christ also would permit me to be mated with another male, as my heart yearns.",1,

904240,"&gt; no, that's actually a tremendous amount of the entire thing. if it's small, just do as i say: decouple 'sexual acts' from the discrimination laws.  homosexual relationships are no more reducible to their sexual aspect then heterosexual relationships are.  it's demeaning and offensive to treat gay rights as though it boils down to nothing more then protecting the right to have gay sex.  &gt;also, what's this 'act gay' stuff? because it sounds like you're coming very close to just outright framing gays as pretty damn stereotypical. maybe a politically approved version of a stereotype.  &gt;actually, all it would do - if anything - is treat sexual activity across the spectrum as 'not relevant' to these laws. you assured me that sex was practically a non-issue here, a very tiny part of things at most. but then you turn around and say that if we don't protect sexual activity, advocacy for sexual activity, etc, then we're basically keeping people from 'acting gay'. which is apparently, despite what you said earlier, all about sex.  you're framing this whole thing in a way that really doesn't make sense to me.  i don't think i ever mentioned protecting the right to sexual activity or the right to advocate for sexual activity, because like i said, it's insulting to reduce gay rights down to nothing more then the right to have gay sex.  in america, gay sex has been a constitutional right for a long time.  that fight is over.  homosexuality is a behavior, just like heterosexuality.  i'm not talking acting gay like acting like a stereotypical gay person, i'm talking about openly gay people openly behaving as though they are gay.  which again, is not always true.  i know straight and gay people who do not openly appear attracted to anyone, don't date, etc.  there's a whole range of possibilities here, but it's not stereotypical to acknowledge that the majority of gay people have sexual desires just like most straight people and will tend to act in some way based on these desires.  &gt;why not? let them act as they like, on their own time, not on the job, even if they're 'out' in the broadest sense at work. and, why is that suddenly political, when you just assured me that the only reason sodomy is 'political' is because we made it so? i can assure you, plenty of them will cite love - love of family, love of neighborhood, love of state - to justify their antics.  i feel obligated to point out again that this isn't about ""sodomy"", but looking past that, giving quarter to racists is sending a very clear message to everyone else.  we can't be the sort of society that protects a minority at the expense of everyone else.  you have a constitutional right to be a racist, but forcing an employer to retain a racist employee would create a hostile environment for every minority in the company.  this is distinct from forcing an employer to retain a homosexual employee; our love lives are personal and don't implicate any of our coworkers.  the fact that i'm dating a woman doesn't imply that i look down on someone who is dating a man, but the fact that i believe all races are equal certainly alienates me from people who believe that the white race is superior to other races.  we simply cannot have any quarter for racists.  accepting a racist means rejecting everyone else.",1,
327288,"for one thing the scenes with the gun make it appear like there are many days pasted together over any space of time. for all of this to happen in order, it would of all had to happen since he's been there and he's probably only been there two weeks at most. so within that time, dolores had to of tried to shoot reebus at least a few times, infected maeve, who did all of her stuff, and they would of had to change the logo in the dressing room and film it again so that maeve could see it in hq. it seems just as unlikely.   (i heard this on a podcast) logan knew about arnold. despite working there for 15 years bernard, who must know everything there is to know about behavior programming, had never heard of arnold. that could be because logan is there only a short time after opening the park and there are people still working there who knew arnold.  there's been no clarification as to when logan and william are there. i think bernard's most recent scene has really opened the time frame to a larger possible period. but the only malfunction mentioned would of had to occurred before bernard was ever there, and he only mentioned one thirty years ago. so people assume it's the event he mentioned thirty years ago. but then again, look how much he knows. maybe that is why people think bernard is a host.   we don't know what triggered the other event or if that is actually what's happening. but based on dolores response it seems to be the same remnants of the arnold host that she access more than the other hosts are able to. i guess that is why this is all dolores related.   they've already decided, because this seems straight-forward to them. so they assume the mib is william thirty years later. they assume william's face blew off and now he looks like ed harris. they assume that the initial event changed william into the mib, a sadistic gamer, instead of a goodie-goodie who hates games.",0,

537212,"as paxottomanica said, it was much less talked about.  but sihaq (lesbianism) [did exist throughout muslim history](http://www.cvltnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/l0033082.jpg) (arguably nsfw).  medically, lesbianism was thought to occur either from a hot itch on a woman's vulva that could only be soothed by another woman's cool sexual fluid, or from a woman having a short vaginal canal, making penetrative sex painful. these observances were based in greek medical science (i.e. galen, whose daughter was a lesbian) and continued by people  like al-kindi.  folklorically, lesbianism was said to have been 'invented' in pre-islamic arabia by a person known as al-zarqa al-yamama (""the blue-eyed woman of yamama""), who loved a christian princess of the lakhmids.  the princess (hind) loved al-zarqa so much that when she died, hind cut her hair, wore only black, and became an ascetic until she died. notings of lesbianism continue into islamic spain, where the famous poet wallada had both male and female lovers (ibn zaydun and ibn abdus were male, muhjah was the name of her female lover), with  a line of her poetry saying ""i give my cheek to whomever loves me/and i give my kiss to anybody who desires it.""  another poet is said to have declared ""i drank wine for love of  flirting/and i shifted towards lesbianism for fear of  pregnancy.""  like ""hind and al-zarqa,"" lesbian couples occupied  a place in arabic literature.  the 10th century al-nadim listed a bunch of books about lesbian couples, like: ""the book of rihana and qoronfel (literally, the book of basil and clove); the book of ruqayya and khadija; the book of mo'ees and zakiyya; the book of sakina and al-rabab (of calm and the mistress of the household); the book of al- ghatrifa and al-dhulafa'; the book of hind and bint al-nuvman (of india and the daughter of al-nuvman, undoubtedly the couple described above); the book of 'abda al-'aqila and 'abda al-ghaddara (of the wise slave girl and the treacherous slave girl); the book of lu'lu'a and shatira; the book of najda and zu'um; the book of salma and suvad; the book of sawab and surur (of justice and happiness); the book of al-dahma' and nisma (of the dark one and the gift from god).""  another common story was the island of waq, an amazon-esque island filled exclusively with women warriors, the queen of which was sometimes depicted as preferring women over men.  in the 12th century, muhammad al-idrisi observed that there are many masculine women who want to be the active partner, and are brought to lesbian love. ""most of the women with these characteristics are to be found among the educated and elegant women, the scribes, koran readers, and female scholars.""  the 13th century al-tifashi wrote one of the most interesting books on the subject: *a promenade of the hearts, or what does not exist in any book*.  he writes about lesbian communities (one in particular led by a person named rose).  these communities apparently continued into the 15th century, as leo africanus observed the same thing.  the arabic word for 'lesbianism' (sihaq) literally means ""rubbing"" or ""tribbing.""  what is that?  well al-tifashi describes, in a sex act called ""the saffron massage"":  &gt;the tradition between women in the game of love necessitates that the lover places herself above and the beloved underneath - unless the former is too light or the second too developed: and in this case, the lighter one places herself underneath, and the heavier one on top, because her weight will facilitate the rubbing, and will allow the friction to be more effective. this is how they act: the one that must stay underneath lies on her back, stretches out one leg and bends the other while leaning slightly to the side, therefore offering her opening (vagina) wide open: meanwhile, the other lodges her bent leg in her groin, puts the lips of her vagina between the lips that are offered for her, and begins to rub the vagina of her companion in an up and down, and down and up, movement that jerks the whole body. this operation is dubbed ""the saffron massage"" because this is precisely how one grinds saffron on the cloth when dyeing it. the operation must focus each time on one lip in particular, the right one for example, and then the other: the woman will then slightly change position in order to apply better friction to the left lip ... and she does not stop acting in this manner until her desires and those of her partner are fulfilled. i assure you that it is absolutely useless to try to press the two lips together at the same time, because the area from which pleasure comes would then not be exposed. finally, let us note that in this game the two partners may be aided by a little willow oil, scented with musk.  one of the most favored places for women to have sex with each other? graveyards, believe it or not.  going to graves to honor the dead was an event that women did without men (women of all religions).  and apparently, these women were sometimes caught making love at graveyards.  but there is a more important locus associated with lesbianism: public baths.  they were a place where women bathed outside of the purview of men.  and women of all religions came to these baths, blurring the religious identities that were normally present.  therefore, the lesbianism that occurred at public baths became associated with a sort of transgression of religious/cultural boundaries. in arabic epics like *1001 nights*, christian princesses and other non-muslim women were sometimes portrayed as preferring women as sexual partners.  these women are usually converted to islam (and heterosexual relationships) by the hero, after seeing them do something like wrestle with their handmaidens by a river or lake (like the princess nura).  literature from the 9th-16th centuries implied that non-muslim women were a temptation for both muslim men *and women*. this tradition continued into the ottoman era, and some ottomans blamed lesbianism on greek christians, saying that they seduced muslim women in bathhouses, and taught them how to make love to women.  this is in obvious contradiction to the traditional folklore that it was invented by a pre-islamic arab woman.   europeans commented on the importance of islamic baths.  but because *they* didn't bathe and their culture was *obviously* superior, they had to come up with reason why ottoman bathing was bad.  so, instead of it being hygienic, it was  a sign of illness and depravity. the 16th century scientist prosper alpini said that the hot climate caused excessive sexual desire, and overeating (especially by women) and sexual indulgence created a humor imbalance that caused illnesses and body odor. bathing ameliorated these diseases. lesbianism was one such 'disease.'  in the 16th century, ogier ghiselin de busbecq said that some turkish men tried to seclude their wives at home, to prevent them from having affairs with men.  the women then started having affairs with other women at public baths.  the men tried to prevent their wives from going there, but ultimately couldn't, due to the law.  busbecq notes that ""this evil affects only the common people; the richer classes bathe at home.""  likewise, europeans hypothesized that women went to baths and engaged in lesbianism as some sort of rebellion against their repressive husbands.  we should ultimately be skeptical of european accounts, as they were ways that europeans could mock and condemn islam, and show the superiority of the european system that doesn't allow women to have affairs with other women (and shows the superiority of european men, who fully satisfy their wives). not all muslim  men were opposed to their wives having lesbian affairs.  one man was told that his wife was having affairs with women, and he responded that ""as  long  as she frees me from any  sexual  obligation  towards her let her do what she wants.""  the third locus for lesbianism (especially in the minds of europeans) are ottoman harems.  commenting on a *1001 nights* story where a man finds his female lover and maid kissing, richard burton said that harems ""are hot-beds of sapphism and tribadism. every woman past her first youth has a girl who she calls 'myrtle' (in damascus),"" and that ""amongst the wild [bedouin] arabs, who ignore socratic and sapphic perversions, the lover is always more jealous of his beloved's girl-friends than of men rivals.""  in the 16th century court of constantinople, a venetian envoy said that suleiman's harem of ""lustie and lascivious wenches"" were having sex with each other so much, that if they asked for cucumbers, they had to be given them pre-sliced, or they might use them (either as a masturbation aid, or as a toy with a partner).  again, on the 'depravity' of the east, allen edwardes compiled others' surveys, reporting ""females were generally given over to fantastic sapphism"" when secluded in harems.  again, he repeats that they used sex aids (bananas, tongues, candles, dildos),  that each woman had her  own private companion they called 'myrtle,"" and that because arabs  thought ""women corrupt women more than men do,"" arabs were more jealous of their lovers female friends than male friends.  edwardes' book featured an introduction by albert ellis, a psychologist who tried to 'cure' homosexuality. similarly to what was previously said, lesbianism declined with the influence of western morality.",1,
210348,"nightskyline - shortland anchorage - lvl 100  started around end of march - early april 2015  [my fleet](http://i.imgur.com/iox9bbn.jpg?1)  for my first (half) year, it has been very progressive overall. a lot of hard-to-get ships have came in this short time (yamato, akizuki, etc.) so i'm really grateful for that. overall just the growth of the fleet and all the progress through the maps and spring-fall events are my pride and joy. notable shoutouts to:   -**haruna** (especially) for finding yamato, single handedly carrying spring and summer events while the fleet was still in its infancy, and just being the prime vanguard of the fleet.  -choukai for her contributions in clearing event and monthly eo maps. your sister is the queen of aa saving the fleet from the plight of bombers, but you are the executioner with your god-hand day and night battles. others helped wipe floor of enemy fleets, but you were always the one to put the final nail in the coffin.  -yukikaze for her godly cut-ins in the darkest hours. another event and monthly eo star, your torpedoes sank even the most ruthless of bosses in times the rest of the fleet was heavily damaged.   -shoukaku for being boss despite her short time. i promise to get you to k2a before january ends. -everyone else in the fleet. there's too much to name, every ship has their special moment and their contributions this past half year have impacted the fleet one way or another.   -and then there's you guys here. thanks for the tips, advices, memes, etc. it's been great so far, keep it up for the next year.  for the next year, musashi and zuikaku are top priorities. teruzuki and unryuu if the chance comes by. their sisters are lonely without their siblings around. also to be more prepared for events and overall stockpiling. all my events thus far always start with average 20k resources and 100 buckets...absolutely horrid for farming and progression in general. lastly, learning to fleet set-up properly without always relying on guides, advice, composition suggestions etc. too often have i stuck to looking up info for maps and compositions and following everything word for word, really doesn't help if there's certain equipments or ships i lack.  happy new years everyone.",0,
437260,"yes, in the movie she says she doesn't like men, and it's implied that she's more into the female pilots she employs.  in the book, it's plainly stated that she is a lesbian, but ian fleming gives slightly contradictory reasons as to why. he describes her like this:  &gt; she had the only violet eyes bond had ever seen. they were the true deep violet of a pansy and they looked candidly out at the world from beneath straight black brows.  ~~which suggests that fleming thinks homosexuality and unusual eye color go together, and would indicate that he thinks she was born gay (assuming she was born with violet eyes).~~ but at the end of the book he gives a different reason for pussy galore's avoiding men, and implies that she was never really a lesbian to begin with:  &gt; she lay in the crook of bond's arm and looked up at him. she said, not in a gangster's voice, or a lesbian's, but in a girl's voice, 'will you write to me in sing sing?'  &gt; bond looked down into the deep blue-violet eyes that were no longer hard, imperious. he bent and kissed them lightly. he said, 'they told me you only liked women.'  &gt; she said, 'i never met a man before.' the toughness came back into her voice. 'i come from the south. you know the definition of a virgin down there? well, it's a girl who can run faster than her brother. in my case i couldn't run as fast as my uncle. i was twelve. that's not so good, james. you ought to be able to guess that.'  so there's really plenty of insults to go around here. there's the idea of a lesbian eye color, and a lesbian voice. there's the idea that everyone in the south is an incestuous pedophile. and there's the idea that lesbianism requires an explanation, like being raped by your uncle when you were twelve.  one thing that ian fleming certainly didn't write was that scene from the movie in the barn. in the book, bond and pussy galore don't have sex until the very end, and bond wins her over by being compassionate and sweet to her.  **edit:** lol, thanks, to /u/veirce - i simply was not thinking about pansy, _the flower._ of course he's describing the color there. makes so much more sense now. so - forget about fleming thinking purple eyes are for gay people. but i think the other things i'm saying here make sense, as far as i know!",1,
931995,"hey /u/brake_l8  great questions. i'll try to answer them concisely and from the heart.   1) in short, i respect people of other religions. even though they have different traditions/faiths they are still god's children and creations, same as i am, and i myself did not earn salvation/god's love nor do/can they... without jesus, which is the core of what i believe as a christian.  people ask me ""so if you're a christian, you believe anyone who is not a christian is going to hell""... that is a very hard question to answer just because of the sheer brutality of it. the ultimate thing is, i as an individual am not god and hence not the judge of souls (thank goodness). so, it's not my place to judge anyone else's salvation.  with that said, the bible is very clear in saying that the penalty of sin is death, and that the only way to be cleansed of our sin is to accept christ as our savior.... so if there is someone in my life i encounter who hasn't done that, even if they are from another religion, i respectfully try to just share what i believe, because it's the best news i have ever or will ever hear -- in that we can have eternal life with god.   i think that christianity is the true world view when compared to other religions because technically speaking, it is not a religion. here's what i mean by that -- the ""religion"" part: pastors/churches/etc should all just be to glorify god and jesus... but ultimately, all that is required to be a christian is to accept jesus as the savior for our sin. that's it. so, given how based in love it is, and given the fact that all can have that salvation and we don't have to work for it or try to earn it,  i believe in jesus and define god as he expresses himself in the bible.   2) atheists/agnostics. i wouldn't say i respect people with no religion any 'less' than people of other religions, they just have a different story. with people of other religions, they are usually pretty devout so i'm also interested to hear what they believe... people that devoutly follow other religions usually love god also, so if nothing else we relate on that level.   people that think religion is just a bunch of fairy tales then, don't believe in god so i guess the conversation just starts at a different point. believe it or not, most people i have met at college are pretty open to hearing about my faith. i think especially at my age people just have more questions than anything. i have of course met ardent atheists, though i guess my feeling towards them is largely sadness (not in a 'coming at them from a high ground way') just in the sense that they are denying themselves the possibility of understanding god's love... because i was there myself once, and life is so much more confusing, dark, and lonely in that mindset.   i flew in a normal airplane over the rocky mountains for the first time this past summer. looking at how enormous and beautiful they were, my literal first thought was ""how can anyone doubt the existence of god?"" -- what i mean by this is, i personally find so much more happiness in life attributing the creation of everything to a perfect god, the same god that created the rockies, and the same one that made me. i just feel bad for people that think those mountains came up by accident by some plates colliding, and we are all just the accidental combination of some genes and mutations.   3) my thoughts on lgbt people. soooo. this has been a really hard thing for me to even sort out my own thoughts over, as i have met tons of fantastic, funny, considerate, loving people and friends who are lesbian/gay, etc.   the bible says that the actual sin for a homosexual or otherwise person is to consummate that feeling of attraction. now, please note from my life decision, the bible also says it's a sin to consummate heterosexual love outside of marriage. there is no weighted scale for sin, so me as a straight male having sex with a straight woman outside of marriage is a sin just like it is for a homosexual couple to consummate their love.   now, the problematic thing (for homosexual people i mean) is that the bible describes marriage as between a man and a woman, so while i can eventually have sex in marriage with my wife, the bible does not condone the marriage of homosexuals, meaning that even though such marriages are technically allowed in the us right now, consummation of attraction would still be sin.   so..... what do i think. i agree with everything i have said the bible says. the ideal and most ""godly"" life for someone who truly believes they are homosexual to follow would be to be celibate for life. having temptation is not sin. now, i know that sounds like a super lofty ""easy for you to say"" type thing. i hope you see it's at least a little less easy for me to say given my personal convictions in the realm of sexual sin, but ultimately i do have the option at least of having sex in marriage, so ultimately i guess it is ""easy for me to say"" than if i were actually a homosexual faced with the question of sin and celibacy for life.   here is the thing though, and this goes back to what i was saying about me not being the judge. i have met gay christians. i have met straight christians who have sex out of marriage. i have met straight christians who have had sex with other people while married. point being -- we are imperfect beings. i, as an individual, will not and can not say that being gay and having gay sex is ""worse"" than a straight person committing adultery or something. bottom line is: sin is sin. now, the only way for us to reconcile with god in light of our innumerable sin is through jesus' sacrifice.   then, the idea is that once someone becomes christian, like my experience, you gradually just want to live in a way that pleases god... not for fear of punishment, but out of love and reference for my body as one of his creations, and the bodies as others as his equally magnificent creations.   hope that answers your questions, feel free to ask any more or clarification questions!",1,

240694,"&gt; and lesbian couples in committed relationships are on average less promiscuous than heterosexual ones. it's a guy thing.  firstly, we see the same sorts of behaviors among lesbians. in a study of women [here]( http://sti.bmj.com/content/79/2/147.full.html) who had sex with women or who identified as lesbians or with lesbian-like designations such as “dyke” or “zani”, it was found that “**87% reported two or more female sexual partners ever**”.   further http://sti.bmj.com/content/76/5/345.long found that women who have sex with women tended to be more promiscuous even with men than straight women. they reported that “**interestingly, the median number of lifetime male sexual partners was significantly greater for wsw** [women who have sex with women] **than controls (12 partners versus 6, p&lt;0.001). wsw were significantly more likely to report more than 50 lifetime male sexual partners (9% versus 2%, or 4.1, p&lt;0.001)**”. and that’s even despite the fact that in their sample, “**twenty five per cent reported no previous sexual contact with men ever**”.  http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cochran/pdf/natsurveyaalesbiansgaymen.pdf was a survey of african-american homosexuals that described themselves as in a relationship. 45.8% of lesbians said that they had had sex with someone else since the relationship began, as can be seen on page 29. this is despite the fact that the median length of the relationship for lesbians in the study was only a little over two years.   and only a little over half – 56.5% - said their relationship was closed to sex with others.  further, a study of the divorce rates among straight, gay, and lesbian marriages in norway and sweden found that lesbians were by far the most likely group to divorce. it was [found]( http://www.uni-koeln.de/wiso-fak/fisoz/conference/papers/p_andersson.pdf) that, once other factors were controlled for, “**the divorce risk in partnerships of men is 50 percent higher than the corresponding risk in heterosexual marriages, and that the divorce risk in female partnerships is about double that of men**”, even when demographic differences were controlled for.  and according to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1446471/pdf/11392937.pdf, only 13.6%  of lesbians reported having one sexual partner in the past 5 years compared to 70.0% of straight women.

476555,"###last post, continued from above  #steam some vegetables   [this](http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/parmesan-cauliflower) is a recipe that involves a little  bit of sauce making with steaming. i simplified it a little for you folks.  * 1-1/2 cups cauliflower (fresh or frozen) * 2 tbsp butter * 2 teaspoons flour * 3 tablespoons sour cream * 2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese * salt and pepper to taste  place cauliflower in a steamer basket; place in a small saucepan over 1 in. of water. bring to a boil; cover and steam for 4-5 minutes or until crisp-tender. meanwhile, in another small saucepan, melt butter. stir in flour until smooth. remove from the heat; stir in the sour cream, parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. add cauliflower to the cream sauce. cook and stir over low heat for 1-2 minutes or until heated through. yield: 2 servings.  #pan fry some salmon  earlier, in the saute section, i had a video of gordon ramsay’s salmon, [cook that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=squyowntavm). make that or you can grill some salmon according to my own recipe:   * 1/2 onion, quartered * 2 tbsp ginger, skinned * 1/4c soy sauce * 1/4c olive oil * 2 tbsp butter or olive oil * salmon, 6oz per person up to 6 servings  1. 3 hours before dinner, add onion, ginger, soy sauce, and olive oil to food processor. blend until pureed. 2. in an airtight container, cover the salmon with the mixture and store in fridge for 2 and a half hours. 3. preheat butter or olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. 4. add the salmon to the skillet, skin side up. raise heat to medium high and cook for 4 minutes. flip and cook for 6-8 minutes, skin side down until the fish is flaky and cooked through. serve.  ---  ###conclusion   hopefully with practice, you will be able to successfully apply heat via a variety of methods to achieve the changes that you want to see in your kitchen.   wow, this has gone on for a really long time, as always bring your own recipes and don’t be afraid to provide feedback to me. if i missed something that you would like to add, go ahead and speak up.  next month will be shorter, i hope...",0,1

599756,"are you me? i (and my fiancé(e)) identify as a homoromantic pansexual. i personally call myself a lesbian, and like the word as it fits my life better than bisexual. my fiancé (e) hates it and much prefers 'gay' or 'dyke'.  i often worry i'm contributing to bi erasure (and i reject the idea that a non-exclusively-homosexual woman identifying as a lesbian is contributing to lesbian erasure) by not identifying with that label, but like others have said - identifying yourself is up to you and you alone. i can't tell someone else who they are (unless they are asking for suggestions of labels).  i think the reason the sexuality part is highlighted by our culture is because within the patriarchy there is a hyper focus on the ""act"" of being gay/straight (""a real man has lots of sex with women!"", ""a lady must stay a virgin until her wedding night!"", the slurs used against gay men focus on the act [""fudge-packer""] and you could 'turn gay' just by participating in the act [even unwillingly, re: prison rape]) rather than the feelings. which is why non-sex-focused terms like 'gay' are more pc now than 'homosexual'. so by focusing in the romantic side of the equation, we are able to redefine relationship structure away from ""tab a fits into slot b"" and make it more about all the aspects that make a good relationship, including sexuality.   if i had to be really specific i would clarify to say i'm intersectional-feminist-sexual and not-cis-man-romantic. lesbian just rolls off the tongue a bit better.  for the most part there is overlap between people's romantic and sexual orientations (aside from asexual or aromatic folk that are not a romantic or asexual, respectively) - i've never met someone identifying as homoromantic and heterosexual or heterosexual but homoromantic (while i don't doubt there can be people like this, i feel like life will get pretty difficult without also including other variables like being polyamorous). so to me a lesbian is someone whose point of intersection is loving and sleeping with women.",1,1

862245,"&gt; off the top of my head, we are better at multitasking  off the top of my head, ""multitasking"" is pretty much evenly spread among different people and is actually a myth. people do, however, do task switching:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/creativity-without-borders/201405/the-myth-multitasking  &gt; bad idea. homosexuality is a miswiring in the brain, and is not a natural part of humanity. let's not encourage it. i'm not religious, but i am an evolutionist, and naturally we're meant to reproduce with the other sex.  unfortunately, homosexuality exists in nature so we cannot write it off as an evolutionary problem. the fact that it exists means it evolved to exist. perhaps it is a form of natural population control?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior  &gt; gay marriage hasn't been in practice nearly as long as straight marriage, so of course, with significantly higher numbers of straight marriages there is a higher fail rate. i'd say it is too soon to tell, and the studies that are put out currently are merely projections, and sjw-oriented ones at that.  it probably is a bit soon to tell, however, lesbians do exhibit higher divorce rates. this is not so much against your point as it does point out that in a short space of time, women are getting into and out of same-sex marriage very quickly. this would be a nightmare for any kids they chose to have. if things continue as they are, you'd probably have far more stable gay marriages than lesbian ones. we'd need a few decades, i think. would be nice to see a ""married for 50 years"" piece in the paper about a same-sex couple, but that's becoming rarer among heterosexual couples these days too.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/divorce_of_same-sex_couples  quote: ""a study on short-term same-sex registered partnerships in norway and sweden found that divorce rates were 50-167% higher for same-sex couples than opposite-sex marriages, and that unions of lesbians are considerably less stable, or more subject to serious change, than unions of gay men.""  &gt;i'd argue that the feminine imperative is cancer; it's toxic, but it's not female nature. men need women, and women need men. we're symbiotic sexes with natural, symbiotic gender roles. naturally, men are testosterone-producing, logical, risk-taking, leading beings; and they need women—the most biologically natural choice— to be their soft spots, their beauty, muse and support. men are not naturally soft, delicate, playful beauties. women are not naturally boisterous, shrilling, tough/guarded, society-shattering creatures (these qualities are not in female nature). the more i think about it, the more i'm convinced you're suggesting breeding mutants. also, like someone else here pointed out, your post is reminiscent of a rick &amp; morty episode where there is a planet of all males, but also a planet of all women. http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/raising_gazorpazorp  while i don't really agree with your first part, you make a good argument at the end. women and men do need each other. we just need to figure out a way to do it without hurting each other as much. perhaps better laws?",1,
871790,"^^^^ this shit 100%. if they really hated gay and transgendered people, then they would definitely not allow or even befriend gay people in their group due to their sexuality. and when a lot of people think and talk of homophobia, they think of the bigotry toward only gay men, and completely forget that lesbians exist. i mean is a straight guy really homophobic if he likes lesbian love scenes, but doesn't like love scenes between gay men? is a straight girl really homophobic if she likes sexual or romantic gay male scenes, but not lesbian love scenes? it's obvious why: because they are straight, not because of homophobia. there are gay men who get grossed out by women, lesbians, and female love scenes. there are lesbians who don't like any sexual or love scenes with men. so are they heterophobic now? i sometimes feel there's a double standard with this as well. straight people are expected to love gay love scenes, but gay people are not expected to because they are the minority and most love scenes are between heterosexuals anyway because again, most people are straight.   think about it like this: blacks, latinos, and asians are the minorities in the countries like usa &amp; uk. they are not expected to like white people due to their minority status. however, white people, who are the majority in those countries, are expected to like all people put in minority groups for the wrong reason: only because they are minorities; thus, reasons like kindness, intelligence, and compatibility are often secondary. you should like someone because they are a cool fucking person, not because they're ecuadorian.   there's a fine line between disassociation and discrimination. is an asian girl racist because she doesn't want to date white men? maybe it's due to racist reasons, but what if she simply prefers black and latino men over white guys? either way, that is her choice. it's unhealthy to be too close-minded, too open-minded, and forcing yourself to like someone you don't.   there are racists, opposite sex haters, and bigots, and then they are just some people who merely feel comfortable with others like them within their own group(s). think! for example in la, there are russian communities, nigerian communities, a chinatown, a gayborhood, muslim communities, black communities, indian communities, jewish communities, etc, etc, etc. here we are trying to promote diversity (not saying we shouldn't), but yet at the end of the day most people prefer to identify and hang with their own. it's like an innate human survival trait: safe vs. risk. i honestly don't find anything wrong with just that.  we need to understand that straight people are held at a completely different standard then gay people due to status reasons. straight people can say faggot, dyke, or queer and be quickly labelled a homophobe (even if those words weren't being used in a typical discriminatory way). gay people can be just as hostile to straight people (especially women) and call them breeders and whatnot with ridicule, but due to their status, not many make complaints. one group shouldn't be able to discriminate toward another and vice versa. that's not the equality we should be aiming for. i don't really condone people being discriminated against, but i believe that all people should be discriminated equally if that's the case.  people and groups like many preachers, most republicans, many democrats, westboro baptist church, one million moms, sjws and many so-called activists, kkk/white pride, glaad, black panthers (the black supremacist version), and countless others are all the fucking same and help make society more bitter, prude, and divisive. i think our society just tries go fucking hard to make issues out of non-issues like this. let me stop here before i write a damn book about 1,000,001 things wrong with people in this world.",1,1

paul was not saying that idolatry turns people gay; rather, he was saying that idolatry led to participation in shameful acts of lust. i believe most of the participants were heterosexuals who were acting contrary to their nature. let me explain, using cybele worship as an illustration.  ten to fifteen years before paul wrote his letter to rome, emperor claudius permitted the worship of cybele, a mother goddess, to take place in rome. there were prominent temples to the goddess in rome (where the letter was being sent to) and in corinth (where paul wrote the letter). greeks and romans were abandoning the worship of the invisible deity taught by their own philosophers, and were worshiping cybele instead, using idols of women, lions, serpents, and birds. the male priests of the goddess castrated themselves (what a penalty for their error!), and played the part of women in temple prostitution. even the women likewise, who worshiped cybele, were equipped with artificial phalli/dildos, and played the part of men in pagan prostitution. most of these worshipers were naturally heterosexual, but gave themselves over to the frenzied sexual rituals in order to honor cybele.  you see, just as the majority of hindus are straight, so likewise, the majority of idol worshipers in rome were straight — but took part in dishonorable acts as part of pagan worship. similar things happened among worshipers of aphrodite and other deities. as i said before, romans 1 is not about gay christian boys or girls, but about idolaters with darkened understanding.  but as you said, we all are flawed, yet loved! paul goes on in chapter 1 to mention all kinds of sin, and then in 2:1 turns the table and says even the jews were guilty, indeed, all the world reaps the wages of sin, yet we are all given the gift of eternal life through jesus christ! that is indeed a marvelous comfort!  another passage often quoted against us is 1 corinthians 6:9, wrongly translated as “homosexuals.” but remember that, 500 years ago, martin luther translated “arsenokoites” as “child molesters.” recall the story of jupiter/zeus arriving in the form of an eagle and abducting the boy ganymede to be his cup bearer and sex slave. keep in mind that, in ancient rome, masters could have sex with any male or female slave they wished — this was rape. very often, men married to women kept boy slaves or prostitutes on the side to have sex with. so i believe that passage, in the culture of rome, was referring to the abuse of boy slaves and boy prostitutes, not to a loving, equal, committed relationship.  sometimes genesis 19 is mentioned, but the sin of sodom was partly arrogance and oppressing the poor (ezekiel 16:49) and partly an attempt to gang rape the messengers of god. judges 19 also refers to gang rape of a female concubine by the men of gibeah. but genesis 19 no more condemns all homosexuality than judges 19 condemns all heterosexuality.  finally, leviticus was written to ancient jews, not modern gentile christians. i eat pork, shellfish, and cheeseburgers; i wear blended fabrics; i shave my sideburns; and i dare to shake hands with a menstruating woman — for those laws were not addressed to me. so, jewish men were to abstain from anal intercourse (this may have referred to pagan male prostitutes in canaan), but interestingly, many conservative rabbis permit two jewish men to be partners as long as they do not engage in that particular act (other sexual acts are okay). notice also that women are not even mentioned, so apparently jewish lesbians are okay.  my friend, when it comes to ethics, people use the bible to prove all kinds of things. faithful believers support and oppose capital punishment; dedicated christians support killing in war, and pacifism. life is complex! i believe christ did not wish to burden us with rules like the pharisees. he simply said, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” and, “love one another as i have loved you.” we are not under the law of moses; god has imparted the living holy spirit into our hearts with the inner principle of love. therefore we are not slaves under a yoke, but free (galatians 5:1).  if i ever meet a fine gay man who is spiritual and loving and mutually attractive, and if i felt the lord leading me to him and him to me, i would feel free to be his mate. jesus was lord of the sabbath, healed the sick on the sabbath, allowed his disciples to pluck grain on the sabbath, commended abiathar for giving the holy showbread to david’s hungry men, touched the lepers, and allowed the woman with a hemorrhage to touch him. jesus valued people and their needs more than rules! since i am not anointed and gifted to do celibacy well, i believe christ also would permit me to be mated with another male, as my heart yearns.",1,

""guerrilla theater tactics and more straight-forward shouting matches characterized their presence"" (2). since homosexuality has been removed from the apa list of mental illnesses, so has pedophilia (except when the adult feels ""subjective distress"") (27).  homosexuals account for 3-4% of all gonorrhea cases, 60% of all syphilis cases, and 17% of all hospital admissions (other than for stds) in the united states (5). they make up less than 1% of the population.  homosexuals live unhealthy lifestyles, and have historically accounted for the bulk of syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis b, the ""gay bowel syndrome"" (which attacks the intestinal tract), tuberculosis and cytomegalovirus (27).  73% of psychiatrists say homosexuals are less happy than the average person, and of those psychiatrists, 70% say that the unhappiness is not due to social stigmatization (13).  25-33% of homosexuals and lesbians are alcoholics (11).  of homosexuals questioned in one study reports that 43% admit to 500 or more partners in a lifetime, 28% admit to 1000 or more in a lifetime, and of these people, 79% say that half of those partners are total strangers, and 70% of those sexual contacts are one night stands (or, as one homosexual admits in the film ""the castro"", one minute stands)  (3). also, it is a favorite past-time of many homosexuals to go to “cruisey areas"" and have anonymous sex.  78% of homosexuals are affected by stds (20).  judge john martaugh, chief magistrate of the new york city criminal court has said, ""homosexuals account for half the murders in large cities"" (10).  captain william riddle of the los angeles police says, ""30,000 sexually abused children in los angeles were victims of homosexuals"" (10).  dr. daniel capron, a practicing psychiatrist, says, ""homosexuality by definition is not healthy and wholesome. the homosexual person, at best, will be unhappier and more unfulfilled than the sexually normal person"" (10). for other psychiatrists who believe that homosexuality is wrong, please see national association for research and therapy of homosexuality.  it takes approximately $300,000 to take care of each aids victim, so thanks to the promiscuous lifestyle of homosexuals, medical insurance rates have been skyrocketing for all of us(10).  homosexuals were responsible for spreading aids in the united states, and then raised up violent groups like act up and ground zero to complain about it. even today, homosexuals account for well over 50% of the aids cases in the united states, which is quite a large number considering that they account for less than 1% of the population.  homosexuals account for a disproportionate number of hepatitis cases: 70-80% in san francisco, 29% in denver, 66% in new york city, 56% in toronto, 42% in montreal, and 26% in melbourne (8).  37% of homosexuals engage in sadomasochism, which accounts for many accidental deaths. in san francisco, classes were held to teach homosexuals how to not kill their partners during sadomasochism (8).  41% of homosexuals say they have had sex with strangers in public restrooms, 60% say they have had sex with strangers in bathhouses, and 64% of these encounters have involved the use of illegal drugs (8).  depending on the city, 39-59% of homosexuals are infected with intestinal parasites like worms, flukes and amoebae, which is common in filthy third world countries (8).  the median age of death of homosexuals is 42 (only 9% live past age 65). this drops to 39 if the cause of death is alds. the median age of death of a married heterosexual man is 75 (8).  the median age of death of lesbians is 45 (only 24% live past age 65).  the median age of death of a married heterosexual woman is 79 (8).  homosexuals are 100 times more likely to be murdered (usually by another homosexual) than the average person, 25 times more likely to commit suicide, and 19 times more likely to die in a traffic accident (8).  21% of lesbians die of murder, suicide or traffic accident, which is at a rate of 534 times higher than the number of white heterosexual females aged 25-44 who die of these things(8).  50% of the calls to a hotline to report ""queer bashing"" involved domestic violence (i.e., homosexuals beating up other homosexuals) (18).  about 50% of the women on death row are lesbians (12).  homosexuals prey on children. 33% of homosexuals admit to minor/adult sex (7).  there is a notable homosexual group, consisting of thousands of members, known as the north american man and boy love association (nambla). this is a child molesting homosexual group whose cry is ""sex before 8 before it's too late."" this group can be seen marching in most major homosexual parades across the united states.  homosexuals commit more than 33% of all reported child molestations in the united states, which, assuming homosexuals make up 2% of the population, means that 1 in 20 homosexuals is a child molestor, while 1 in 490 heterosexuals is a child molestor (19).  73% of all homosexuals have had sex with boys under 19 years of age (9).  many homosexuals admit that they are pedophiles: ""the love between men and boys is at the foundation of homosexuality"" (22).  because homosexuals can't reproduce naturally, they resort to recruiting children. homosexuals can be heard chanting ""ten percent is not enough, recruit, recruit, recruit"" in their homosexual parades.  a group called the ""lesbian avengers"" prides itself on trying to recruit young girls. they print ""we recruit"" on their literature.  some other homosexuals aren't as overt about this, but rather try to infiltrate society and get into positions where they will have access to the malleable minds of young children (e.g., the clergy, teachers, boy scout leaders, etc.) (8). see the dc lesbian avengers web page, and dc lesbian avengers press release, where they threaten to recruit little boys and girls. also, see afa action alert.  references  (1)

lol, 2 years it took me to even think about it. i agonized for months, and finally came out, to my parents - my mother didn't believe me. no one believed me. the line in *life makes you so damn tired*, ""i was so keen, despite all of my doubt. thing is i wasn't sure if it was true or just to defy in the only way i could do […]""  i was worried that my mom was right, as i had a 5 to 1 comparison ratio of men to women. but i was a lesbian and i moved to europe in may, 2005. i was a lesbian, everyone knew. i think one reason i always dated guys was because men are biologically the aggressor - the ones to approach and as girls out. coming out for women and figuring it out is much harder, because men come to you, and it's just the path of least resistance. society teaches us that women don't really like sex anyway, how they fake headaches to get out it, use it as birthday presents, etc. how was i supposed to know that of course it's bunch of bullshit? i'm also very proud and never take the initiative to tell someone i have a crush on them until they've said so first.  then october came (lol, that makes me think of *dreamed a dream* - ""but he was gone when autumn came.""), and i started my course at the london music school. in retrospect, i'm bi-romantic, and homosexual. i got a crush on a guy name gabriele. he was tall and skinny, and italian who didn't speak much english, and he had puppy eyes, and was the nicest person i'd ever met. something in me - in my lizard brain (the right brain, the one that has the instincts and tells you to breathe, etc.) knew that i couldn't lose him. i told him i liked him the night before christmas break 2005, *even though* he had already told me he had a crush on another girl in our class. he let me down gently, and said we should email over the break. and we did, he would respond immediately, and they were long, ""i shouldn't give a shit, but i loved hearing what he did today"" type stuff. and the day i got back from usa jan, 2006, i had a text from him, ""i've been dying to see you.""  we decided, as schoolmates (sorry, i go in and out of british /american terminology) that we  and a danish girl, stine, were gonna share a flat! blah blah blah, literally *2 day* after moving in, he told me he liked me, and asked if we could be bf &amp; gf. he had a cold, and couldn't kiss me, lol. that sounds bad, but it's one of the things, that turned out to be so ""him"".  within the first 2 weeks we lost or virginities to each other, and he had told me he loved me, and i had said it back. we hated living with stine, so we moved out may (2006) into a flat for just us. it never really even occurred that we were moving in together - as a couple - cuz we already did that, just in separate rooms.  i'm bipolar ii, and ocd, and adhd, and i worked (and am still on) feeling happier, and he helped me with my ups and downs, and he was very ocd, and takes things really hard and personally, like losing out on a bid for a vintage guitar amp. and i loved him, i loved taking care of him (this is the part of the letter/story that i'll start crying, so fyi, from here on out, i'm crying). he was my best friend. we could just sit and watch tv, cuddled up a bit, and we spoke to each in grossly adorable voice, and called each other ""beebee"" and ""hunny bunny"" and ""cuddle bundle"" which turned into ""cundle"" and ""bundle"" etc. it was the kind of relationship where if i called him ""gabriele"" he knew i was mad at him, and if, on the phone, he didn't talk to me if the voice we spoke with each other, it meant he was with friends. my *moon song* - the chorus is ""for you, i am the stars at night to keep you company. my twinkle and shine watching over you - always there to welcome the day with you. | for you, i am the moon, i radiate the night sky. my pale light to balance you - i control your stormy seas, so you won't have to."" i was his stars, he was my moon. for 6 years, we took care of each other, and, like i said, society had me thinking of sex as something he wanted, and let's just get this over with.  so, on to *the winner takes it all:*  first off, i interpret ""winner"" as the person who left and the reason it ended, **me**, and ""loser"" as the one who understands why i left, but isn't a victim, **gabriele**. the loser is still an equal…oy, i hope i'm making sense. i performed it from my current perspective of this broken heart because i had to leave him after 6 years because he's heterosexual, and needed and deserved someone who *wanted* to have sex with him. but that wasn't the only problem, and he hurt me too in other way, but the underlying issue, i feel, would be that a lot of things that went wrong were because i was unable to reciprocate what the core of a sexual relationship is. he needed that physical affection that i couldn't give him. like i said, i had alway preached that you love who you love, and i practiced what i preached. i've always said that we were so perfect and so compatible for each other except for that one thing, that one tiny little thing that out of a million tiny things that made us who were together was the dealbreaker. why? why that one? why can such a small part of a relationship be such a big part of it. it's not fair. i'm brokenhearted that i couldn't change it. i miss him so much. i was finding it really hard to understand how i couldn't get over him even though i wasn't still *in love* with him. i fonally saw a therapist and she gave me the breakthrough i need - it felt like he had died, but i was greiving the death of our friendship. and i still am. we could never be ""just friends"" because half of the very basis of our communication was the cuddling and the nicknames and the tones of voice. i *have* lost him, and i will never see him again.  he *is* my other half. i'm sure i'll fall in love again, but i will always be missing that half. and i feel like it's my fault, i caused the rift that lead to our mutual break up. therefore i'm the ""winner"" in the definition i've given it.

316275,"[just another fairytale lesbian blogger from damascus](http://takimag.com/article/just_another_fairytale_lesbian_blogger_from_damascus/print)  &gt; the eminently credible mainstream media was all aflame last tuesday with reports that a prominent lesbian blogger in syria had been captured by armed-and-hairy secret police who were none too pleased with her lesbian blogging. it was presumed that at the very least, her hatefully oily captors would administer a lesbian flogging.  &gt; without bothering to so much as toss in a “reportedly” or “allegedly,” places such as [cbs news](https://web.archive.org/web/20110904085209/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504943_162-20070103-10391715.html), [msnbc](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43306543/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/let-her-go-support-grows-lesbian-bloggers-release/), [time](http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/06/07/gay-girl-in-damascus-blogger-kidnapped-by-armed-men-in-syria/), the [washington post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/gay-girl-in-damascus-blogger-detained/2011/06/07/ag0tmqlh_story.html), the [huffington post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leah-mcelrath-renna/abduction-of-syrianameric_b_872175.html), and the [guardian](https://web.archive.org/web/20150814064437/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/07/syrian-blogger-amina-abdallah-kidnapped) posted articles on june 7 claiming that sapphic syrian was in the clutches of homophobic islamist militarists.  &gt; then, suddenly sometime last week, npr’s andy carvin acted as if he was the last reporter on earth and decided to check some facts. he said that his contacts in syria’s gay community claimed they had never heard of an “amina arraf.” then it occurred to him that no one on earth had ever said they’d met amina in the flesh. then a croatian woman in london said that her ex-husband contacted her after seeing pictures in the media that claimed she was the kidnapped syrian blogger. the woman, jelena lecic, said that this “amina arraf” person had stolen an estimated 200 pictures of her and had used them on her blog and a facebook profile. finally, it was revealed that all of the online correspondence that “amina” had done with others was traceable to a pair of ip addresses in edinburgh, scotland, neither of which was available for use as a proxy. when reporters and government officials worldwide could find no trace of an “amina arraf” ever existing, it became clear that there was no gay girl in damascus.  &gt; this morning it was revealed that “amina arraf” is actually a 40-year-old scottish activist named tom macmaster. he said that although nothing he wrote was actually true, he was trying to “illumine” events that actually were true by, well, writing things that were completely untrue.   [last week was a great week for lesbians coming out of the closet — coming out, that is, as middle-aged heterosexual men. ](http://www.steynonline.com/4179/libz-get-real)  &gt; on sunday, amina arraf, the young vivacious syrian lesbian activist whose inspiring blog ""a gay girl in damascus"" had captured hearts around the world, was revealed to be, in humdrum reality, one tom macmaster, a 40-year-old college student from georgia. the following day, paula brooks, the lesbian activist and founder of the website lezgetreal, was revealed to be one bill graber, a 58-year-old construction worker from ohio. in their capacity as leading lesbians in the sapphic blogosphere, ""miss brooks"" and ""miss arraf"" were colleagues. ""amina"" had posted at lezgetreal before starting ""a gay girl in damascus."" as one lesbian to another, they got along swimmingly. the washington post reported:  &gt; amina often flirted with brooks, neither of the men realizing the other was pretending to be a lesbian.  &gt; who knows what romance might have blossomed had not ""amina"" been arrested by a squad of baath party goons dispatched by syrian strongman bashar al-assad. tom macmaster then created ""rania,"" a fake cousin for his fake lesbian, to try to rouse the world to take up the plight of the nonexistent amina's nonexistent detention.  &gt; a ""free amina!"" facebook page sprang up.  &gt; ""the obama administration must speak about this,"" declared peter beinart, former editor of the new republic. ""this woman is a hero.""  &gt; on june 7th the state department announced that it was looking into the ""kidnapping.""  &gt; the pretty young lesbian muslim was exposed as a portly 40-year-old male infidel at the university of edinburgh with the help of ""paula brooks,"" shortly before ""paula"" was exposed as a 58-year-old male construction worker from ohio. ""he would have got away with it if i hadn't been such a stand-up guy,"" the second phony lesbian said of the first phony lesbian. as to why stand-up guys are posing as sit-down lesbians, ""paula"" told the associated press that ""he felt he would not be taken seriously as a straight man.""  &gt; ""he got that one right,"" sneered the toronto gay magazine xtra.  &gt; from cnn to the guardian to bianca jagger to legions of tweeters, western liberalism fell for a ludicrous hoax. why? because they wanted to. it would be nice if ""amina arraf"" existed. as niche constituencies go, we could use more hijab-wearing muslim lesbian militants and fewer fortysomething male western deadbeat college students. but the latter is a real and pathetically numerous demographic, and the former is a fiction — a fantasy for western liberals, who think that in the multicultural society the nice gay couple at 27 rainbow avenue can live next door to the big bearded imam with four child brides at number 29 and gambol and frolic in admiration of each other's diversity. they will proffer cheery greetings over the picket fence, the one admiring the other's attractive buttock-hugging leather shorts for that day's gay pride parade as he prepares to take his daughter to the clitoridectomy clinic.",1,

""you're."" and no, not ""tell you as a child."" expose you to this constantly as a child, conditioning you for it in the future. it's like teaching children to eat their vegetables. vegetables taste horrible and kids hate them, but there are entire propaganda campaigns dedicated to making it happen, and it works for the most part.  &gt; i tell you this so you know that if i wanted to call you a faggot i would have just typed faggot.  this is perfectly fair and pretty much my go-to argument for pretty much any slur.  &gt;instead i suggested that you might be bisexual because you seem to feel that human sexuality can be easily manipulated.  from a young age. not later in life, once patterns have been established and choices made. there is a difference. you can't generally convince a grown adult to change one way or the other unless they were already considering it, whereas convincing a child is relatively easy by comparison.  &gt;as someone who thinks sexuality is fixed the only logical answer is you are bisexual.  you seem to be really fixated on this. projecting, perhaps?  &gt;so like me you believe that gender is a physical part of our brain. are you aware of the studies done showing the brain of a trans person is closer to the gender they identify with then the one they were born with? this is not something in doubt. thats not something we can treat. its really not. we can however make them comfortable in their body. we cant change the mind but we can change the body.  no, we really can't. you'll never be able to swap an x for a y (until we figure out how, in which case, *by all means*). a trans 'woman' will never be able to bare children. more importantly, claiming to be something you're not is lying to everyone around you. it's even worse if you're attempting to date people of the 'opposite' sex who are straight.  &gt;if you have one please link it i would love to read it.  documented cases? no. personal anecdotes retold by friends in the medical field? certainly. sadly, i can't provide links.  &gt;you said earlier that you believed gender dysphoria was real now you claim they are just self hating? or have i misinterpreted this?  gender dysphoria is real, *mostly caused by self-hatred* or escapism.  &gt;what do you mean by lesbians? do you mean the stereotype butch lesbian? if so no. if you mean do i like 'lesbian' porn then yes. yes i do. you?  ah, see, therein lies the problem. 'lesbians' are more like the stereotypical 'butch' dykes than the lipstick lesbians you see in porn and on television. oh, i'm sure they exist, i'm not denying that--i'm just saying they aren't common. the thing with lesbians you have to understand is that, from a man's perspective, *they're men in everything but name.* they are competition for other women, they have absolutely no interest in men, and once you get to know them you'll find that most see men as competition as well and generally *hate* us or see us as somehow inferior. not saying that's all of them, only *every one i've ever had the misfortune to interact with*.  &gt;yet another law as idiotic as the one banning gay marriage. if an adult, of sound mind obviously not depressed people, wants to end their life they should be allowed to. who are we to tell them they must live in pain for the sake of our outdated moral code.  on this issue, i do agree for the most part. the problem is that anyone wanting to opt out is, by definition, *not of sound mind*.  &gt;and isis want us all to live under sharia law. but we don't and we won't.  you say that, but europe slides closer to this every day.  &gt;would not have picked you for a torchwood fan. i am guessing that like me you hate dr. who but love torchwood?  no, actually. i loved torchwood up until rdm moved to america. i loved doctor who up until capaldi, after which point i could not give a fuck one way or another. there are good episodes and there are bad with him, but overall he makes a lackluster doctor.  &gt;finally you still have not addressed my main point. how will more people loving and fucking the same sex lead to: the breakdown of the old moral virtues: honesty, sobriety and self-restraint."" explain how gay people lead to drunken liars with no self restraint  because, quite honestly, it's degenerate--and if you've ever been around actual homosexuals who weren't pulled straight out of a sitcom, you would likely agree. it doesn't lead to 'drunken liars,' it leads to *more homosexuality*, or the sort of 'rebellion' you see at pride marches. or to people actively trying to spread stds, and other stupid shit. it's a mental illness, not a biological imperative, and it needs to be treated as one instead of having us ""tolerate"" it to the point where everyone jumps on the ""this is normal"" bandwagon.",1,1

ignorance can be good. i'll give an example. there are cisgender women born with prominent adam's apples. it doesn't necessarily that a woman is trans if they have one. i say this all the time. what i don't say is that if you encounter a woman with an adam's apple the woman is more likely to be transgender than cisgender. the half truth protects transgender women, the full truth enables their misreatment as well as the mistreatment of the occassional cisgender woman. i know for a fact that the half-truth has caused people to go easy on folks they suspected were trans so i can positively cite that this is just one example of how visibility can hurt the transgender community. that being said, while visibility may possibly do more harm than good to those who are living stealth and have already transitioned visibility is hands down more beneficial to the rest of the community. visibility gives trans children who don't know words for what they're feeling hope (speaking from experience here). visibility makes it so those who have transitioned and are openly trans will face less mistreatment. sure, visibility can give signs for how to spot a trans person but overall for those who aren't in stealth visibility does more good than harm. visibility isn't enough but its gradually getting better for us. even the visibility of caitlyn jenner, who i cite as the worst representative of transgender people around, even worse than zoe ""black trans women are just drag queens and trans men don't exist"" tur, has ultimately done more good than harm, even if i feel that she individually actually slowed down the pace of progress because its caused an increase in visibility for other transgender people. it was ten and a half years ago that for the first time ever i heard about transgender people. a substitute teacher who had worked for over 30 years without incident transitioned and the parents assumed that she was some sort of child rapist and alerted the media to it, demanding the school board that she be fired. she wasn't fired, fortunately, and the media actually omitted the baseless accusations of sexual abuse. while the local media shouldn't have even reported on it in the first place it exposed me to the notion of transition and probably saved my life. while the message was clear that being trans wasn't morally accepted by society it showed that it was still possible and you could lead a relatively normal life. visibility matters, especially to transgender minors. its not a cureall and i've seen more shit than most trans folk ever will, i even almost became the transgender matthew shepherd, things are slowly improving. we've even got gsas at most middle and high schools now, and many of them aren't ""gsa"" for ""gay-straight alliance"" but ""gender-sexuality alliance"". don't get me wrong, things are fucked, at least a third of the population doesn't think we should be allowed to exist, but i guarantee that its better than what it was ten or twenty years ago.  oh, and nobody will like to admit it but exposure to trans porn on the internet has helped too. being fetishized is bad but its not as bad as being demonized. yes, chasers are dangerous but not as dangerous as lynch mobs. trans porn is even how a lot of people first get introduced to transgender people and while it doesn't set the cards up perfectly with the internet allowing for direction discussion between the participants in trans porn and the viewers it provides a lot of opportunities for the people who start out as fetishists to come around to thinking the right way. yeah, they'll still probably want a trans girl with a twelve inch cock to shove it up their butt but they'll know better than to create an abusive relationship around it.",1,

120454,"warning: this is quite long.  you are correct in saying i don’t believe most people are straight, because i don’t. as i said before, i think it’s a big social fiction, and i think i said that very clearly. [this link from my blog](http://scripturehomosexuality.tumblr.com/post/135946045222/the-majority-are-bisexual-part-1-the-surveys) shows four surveys and studies i found (three within the past 10 or 20 years) which show that at least 50% of the people surveyed carried some sort of same sex attraction, and/or engaged in some sort of same sex behavior. furthermore, the majority of those 50% were neither exclusively heterosexual or homosexual. in the two surveys which asked separately for sexual identity, both of them had a “straight”-identified majority. this is why i believe - on what i think is a firm basis - that the 50% is an underestimate, and perhaps a big one at that. as to why other surveys had different figures (i.e. only 10% of the pop. is not “straight”), i think it’s because the studies use labels signifying sexual identities (“straight”,”gay”,etc) interchangeably with names describing sexual behavior (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual,etc). i think that’s a huge mistake, because identity and sexual behavior are two different things. the two surveys which separately asked for sexual identities and sexual behavior show that two don’t share a causal relationship.  the thing is, it’s not just my opinion. there’s a growing general consensus that human sexuality lies on a continuum, and is not strictly segmented. as such, there are also a few (including those who conducted the studies cited above) that believe that most humans are not exclusively heterosexual or homosexual, but different and varying mixtures of both, which the concept of bisexuality includes because of its broadness.   this brings me to another point i wish to make: the labels of lgbt (“lesbian”,”gay”,”queer”) *are sexual identities, and not sexualities* in and of themselves. bisexual is an exception of sorts, as it was originally a scientific term describing sexual behavior. in any case, identities can be arbitrarily adopted or rejected. given that, i reserve the right to decide how i will identify myself, and how i will not. as such, i will not identify as part of a community whose leadership and media won’t even discuss ideas that may threaten certain conventions, and one of whose forums put me on probation for even broaching the idea. the tptb of the lgbt community simply don’t speak for me, and to still identify as part of them despite that - and thus implicitly support their refusal to discuss different ideas - is a type of surrender i simply can not and will not submit to.   you are also correct in saying i’m bisexual. i never denied that i was; i just chose to say it another way, which is completely within my rights. the thing is, while i consider myself a bisexual man, i don’t identify as bisexual in association with the lgbt/”queer”/”gay” identity. i can’t be bothered to use that much verbiage to say that, so i just choose to say where i would fall in the kinsey scale. besides, anyone familiar with the goings-on of lgbt know that of the letters in the acronym, only the l and g really count, and at times the g counts more often. so even if i identified as part of lgbt, i wouldn’t really be doing myself any favors anyway. the biphobia within the lgbt community can be breathtaking at times.   furthermore, i know as well as you do that most people attracted to the same gender - whether they admit such or not - do not act in those stereotypical behaviors. like i said before, i was speaking in general terms, about the concepts of our broader society. my point is, for the larger society, that perception still exists, and that’s precisely why it has bearing. because of these popular conceptions, a person can falsely believe (as i did) that because one doesn’t identify with “gay” culture, they can’t possibly be experiencing genuine same sex attraction. in their minds, being attracted to the same gender would automatically mean being into “gay” culture. thus, they believe that they are “straight” by default, and continue to be confused in trying to fit themselves into the label. they may ask themselves, “i know i’m not gay because i’m not all those things, but if i’m straight, why do find ‘x’ same sex peer so attractive, and why i do think of doing ‘y’ and ‘z’ with them?” i don’t envy anyone in that position, because i was one of them.   in saying that the concept of homosexuality only developed in the 1860’s, i wasn’t denying the existence of same sex relationships. indeed, whether the people involved want to spend the rest of their lives together, or just wish to remain very close friends, they were homosexual relationships by definition. my point was that, with the invention of the term in the 1860s, same sex activity and attraction was segregated, and treated as its own little thing unique from the rest of human sexuality. this had never happened before, and that’s what i’m disputing. at most, there was the concept of “sodomy”, but even that didn’t strictly describe all possible same sex acts between men. before it became a term describing general same sex behavior in the 20th century, “sodomy” was strictly defined as anal sex (mostly male-male, and sometimes male-female) and bestiality, at least after the 14th century. this was the definition law codes, the common people, and less extreme clerics used. so, if one didn’t engage in what they called “sodomy”, they were treated the same as everyone else, because once again if no penetration was involved, it wasn’t even sex.   lastly, i’m not creating yet another interpretation of the bible purely to favor my views. these texts were written in a certain context, and i was merely trying to explain it in full detail. people can take it or leave it as they wish, but in making up their own opinion on how it reads, they will have to acknowledge that they are ignoring context (as most of christianity is right now). besides, a condemnation of an activity is not wrong in itself. in the bible, stealing, murder, adultery, and dishonesty are all condemned; i don’t think most of us wouldn’t find those condemnations disagreeable. meanwhile, anal sex is an act that can be very risky and perilous, no matter what genders are involved. it is also very effective in spreading disease, which given your silence on my point about anal sex and stds, you seem to agree with what i said. in that case, i don’t think a prohibition is entirely unreasonable. furthermore, i say again, the condemnation is on a behavior most lgbt-identified men don’t even do, so if the opinion of christianity changes to this, they wouldn’t be affected.   it is true that jesus never remarked on same sex behavior. however, i think that is a rather weak argument, because it could be said that his silence didn’t mean he actively encouraged it. he just said nothing for or against it. to say that the bible is full of myths and half-truths is a non starter with most christians; it always was with me. plus, it would be hard to apply that logic to the “clobber passages”: leviticus was a record of israelite law, romans and 1 corinthians were letters referencing real life events. it’s hard to say that those passages in particular were myths and half truths, and thus should be disregarded.    on a separate note, i can’t help but notice that your points of disagreement have been shifting. i also can’t help but notice that, by virtue of your silence, you seem to agree with ideas that i thought would be more controversial: the conflicting definitions of “gay”, the link between anal sex and stds, etc. i mean this in the most earnest way possible: is there something i’m missing in what you’re saying? are you of the opinion that the bible condemns homosexuality in general?",1,

413272,"sorry to answer so late, but i just noticed this question. i'll repost what i wrote for an earlier iteration of this topic!  **part 1** gay as a term for homosexual only came into use once people started conceptualizing of sexuality as a singular category. prior to the 1920s, there was a fairly fascinating split on two different axes: first, a split between the way working class and middle class society viewed men who slept with men, and second, a split between how the men in either society viewed their actions. within the working class, there were three well-understood categories of men who slept with men:  1. fairies. these were men who slept only with other men, and were willing to be the receptive partner. they were (fairly) easily identifiable by certain modes of dress (eg., red ties, green suits, a colorful feather in one's hat). they also tended either to naturally exhibit or purposefully adopt feminine habits. according to chauncey's research, some men who were fairies did not actually desire to behave ""femininely""; however, at the time, that was literally the only way in which one could be identified as clearly interested in men, and therefore the only way in which one could attract a masculine partner (more on this later). pre-wwi concepts of sexuality would be very foreign to most westerners today. at the time, and particularly within the working class, your gender presentation was what counted, not your sexual actions. fairies, therefore, were considered a third sex; men who for whatever reason, had a female mind and female characteristics. this concept allowed masculine men to be the penetrative partner with fairies with practically no fear of societal shame, as they were still performing a masculine vs. feminine sexual act with a person who was not of the same sex. i'm going to stop emphasizing this now, but this was a very working-class mode of thinking; the middle class was quite a bit touchier about men who slept with men.   2. queers. this category would arise in conjunction with changing views on the nature of sexuality. queer men were men who wanted to be able to define their attraction as being primarily to men without having to give up a masculine or manly status; that is, they did not want to be boxed into a feminine presentation simply to attract men. the idea was quite revolutionary at the time, as it meant divorcing gendered presentation from sexual behavior.   3. trade/rough trade. this is probably the most confusing category for the modern reader to understand. trade men were considered by everyone to be ""normal"" (what we might call ""straight""). these were usually men in the most masculine of trades -- sailors, soldiers, bricklayers, etc. these men were often known to be quite violent and thuggish, and were acknowledged as sleeping with fairies for sexual gratification. it was generally understood that a man's sexual drive was uncontrollably powerful, and that it needed to be relieved no matter the circumstances; furthermore, female working class partners were generally understood to be for the purpose of procreation; marriage for love or serious attraction was not a true concept yet. therefore, it was expected that many, if not most working class men (particularly italian immigrants) would be trade; that is, retain their masculinity, but be open to the advances of and, in many cases, experience a strong connection to, fairies (who were not considered men due to their feminine presentation). trade were highly coveted by fairies and queers; the ability to seduce a ""normal"" man was a credit to the fairy in question. furthermore, the raw masculinity of trade was highly attractive, and considered the gold standard for a sexual partner.  to summarize so far: the concepts of homosexuality and heterosexuality as we know them did not exist prior to the the 1920s, and were not truly fleshed out until the mid-20th century. gender presentation was what mattered; as long as a man remained the penetrative, masculine partner, he could be considered ""normal,"" or queer at the very least.  will continue into your actual question of when the word gay became linked to homosexuality shortly. sorry for getting carried away!  **part 2**  edit: continuing on! so, the next question becomes: when and why did the concept of sexuality as a static identity arise?   prior to the 1920s-1940s, gendered circles were strictly policed; by this, i mean that there was nowhere near the amount of mixed-sex societal mingling that happens today. women, particularly in new york immigrant communities, were closely guarded by their families until marriage, at which point they would be confined to the home, sometimes partaking in social events with other married women. the public sphere was, for the most part, entirely male. men had only male friends, and women, only women. as society began to become more sex-integrated, many men, particularly in the middle-class, felt that the male sphere was being threatened, and that their masculinity was under assault. in addition to this, an office environment was rapidly becoming the standard workplace for the middle-class man; the difference between the perceived masculinity of he and his working-class counterpart was becoming ever starker.   chauncey argues that this middle-class male insecurity regarding a) the integration of women into the public sphere and b) the loss of job-related masculinity resulted in a new policing of appropriate male behavior. interestingly, and as a total aside, this is what resulted in a sudden fascination with bodybuilding and strength training, which had not to that point been a popular hobby; many men felt the need to emphasize their difference from women in whatever way possible, so becoming highly muscular was an obvious choice. digression aside, chauncey describes middle-class men of the time as seemingly having ""decided"" that the way in which they could retain a perception of themselves as masculine was through touting their solely-women attraction. in essence, if they couldn't be masculine through their jobs, and they couldn't be masculine by excluding women from the public sphere, they could at least distinguish themselves by eschewing the traditional concept of sexuality and enforcing a rigid adherence to opposite-sexed sex.  this, notably, was rather slow to catch on in working-class circles, perhaps because working-class men still felt secure in their masculinity. i would note again, because there is really no way to overstate this, the incredibly all-consuming importance of gendered presentation prior to the mid-20th century. as long as a man could be seen as ""not a woman,"" he could do whatever he liked sexually. it was femininity that was abhorrent, not a particular sexual act. it seems somewhat ridiculous now to suggest that sexuality as an identity arose because of a middle-class macho insecurity, but the pressure to distinguish oneself as anything but feminine was far more extreme than that of which most of us can possibly conceptualize. i would argue that femininity is still widely disdained, by both men and women; but, as evidenced by the fact that a masculine man could sleep with as many men as he liked and be considered ""normal,"" the importance of a masculine presentation in this period was critical to a degree unheard of today.  to summarize: the concept of sexuality as an identity, rather than as an action, did not come into vogue until the 1920s-1930s at the earliest. it was hurried along, in part, by a middle-class male insecurity regarding the dissolution of traditional gender roles.",1,

563765,"&gt;why do they have to get their panties bent out of shape over the decision another trans person makes in regards to titles? why is it so fucking important to them and anyone that even slightly acknowledges the biological reality is the literal devil?  because anything that even remotely acknowledges the reality of biology (i.e. that humans are sexually dimorphic (the existence of the tiny population of intersex people proves and reinforces the biological sex binary rather than dispels it)) punctures the mtt mass delusion that they are *literally* women and hurts their fee fees. but more importantly, the material reality of biology totally undermines the dogma of gender identity. in order for mtts to uphold their dogma, there can be literally no difference between them and natal women because if there were, that would suggest that one type of woman is more ""real"" than the other and that reality really tears down a lot of their claims and aspirations (especially since legally and institutionally codifying rights for trans people based on the doctrine of gender identity (""anyone who feels like a woman is a woman, end of story"") often impinge on, erase, contradict, etc. rights for both women and homosexuals).  since you are new-ish to gender critical, i highly highly highly recommend you watch [this brilliant lecture by feminist philosopher rebecca reilly-cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpvnxykawao). she does an excellent job of answering the basic questions that many new to critically examining trans ideology have. including me. i watched that video like three times when i first found it.   &gt;also why does it seem most of this outcry is coming exclusively from ""lesbian"" transwomen as opposed to the straight transwomen?  because the trans movement isn't a monolith. gay males who are pressured into transitioning do tend to behave differently than the straight males (transbians) who transition. many of the straight males are autogynophiles and are basically acting out their misogynistic fetish on the rest of us. hetersexual natal males are the loudest and most aggressive contingent. sound familiar? ;)  &gt;like holy shit some of this is starting to look like just your typical mra talk dressed up and disguised in queer language!   this is a good observation and, i believe that many of the straight males who transition do so because they *are* basically mras who realize that they're ""beta"" (in their parlance) and have opted out of being ""beta"" in the male hierarchy to being totally alpha, bowed down to and worshipped in the current female liberal feminist hierarchy. they're the ""most oppressed"" according to libfems so they get centered and coddled, something that would never ever happen to them in a male dominated environment. sometimes this is  terrifyingly conscious, i think, ( [check out this fucked up mra video and its comments for evidence that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovkev0mv1xc&amp;t=8m20s) ) but mostly it's probably quite unconscious.   but, yeah, even though the trans movement *is* internally diverse to an extent, what it boils down to is an appendage of patriarchy that allows males to publicly and violently hate women again, to erase our experiences and our concerns, to not only co-opt feminism and thereby to stop us from making any forward progress in liberation but to also start to erase the gains we *have* made. it's a [big lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_lie) which is why it's so easily swallowed by well meaning lib fems and others who don't look closely at it, and why it's so hard to shake off, but once you start looking it becomes more and more apparent what's going on. :/ good luck with the learning curve. personally, i used to be an unthikning lib fem who supported trans ideology (and even considered transitioning myself at one point) and once i really learned what was behind it (white supremacist capitalist hetero patriarchy)  i became incredibly depressed.",1,

243716,"&gt; your premise of there not being sexual orientation is rejected by most of the scientific and medical community.   no, it isn't. sexual orientation as a concept isn't even rooted in the biological sciences. most research being done is in an attempt to understand where same-sex desire comes from or in the case of medical research its tracking medical information about msm and wsw.  &gt;once you remove that premise, your reasoning breaks apart.  yes, and once you remove the premise that sexual orientation is rooted in the biological sciences your premise falls apart. what's your point?  &gt;assuming you are a heterosexual male, you probably do not get aroused at the sight of other men. that's an orientation right there.  when i tell you i reject orientation i mean i reject them all: hetero/homo/bi/a/pan/whatever.  &gt;as long as there is a non-choosable involuntary predisposition toward being a certain sexuality (in this case, homosexuality) [...]  1. that would require proof that there is ""non-choosable involuntary predisposition toward being a certain sexuality"".  2. that such a fact should matter when organizing societies.  &gt;[...] it seems like it would be rather irrational and/or unnecessarily discriminatory stance to shun sodomy.  and yet various muslim-majority societies had colorful or vibrant ""sexual minorities"" while still treating sodomy as a sin.  &gt;this is ignoring the fact that it's absolutely not clear why sodomy itself, even if sexuality were 100% a choice, should be vilified.  ugh. let's not go into *that* argument.  &gt; i would go even broader and suggest that general public displays of sex should probably be punished/restricted. i would prefer not to go grocery shopping and see a couple fucking in the middle of the street, gay or straight.  congrats. your views are in line with islamic law.",1,

586916,"&gt; that's true. i'm considered femme by every lesbian i know, but among my straight friends, i'm considered gender non-conforming, even if they don't know the exact term. i think any small difference sticks out like a sore thumb in a gender-conforming group, and they can be hypersensitive to differences due to their homogeneity. for example, one of my straight friends told me i walked like a man (dyke walk, haha), and this was before i came out to her.  yes, conforming groups are hypersensitive. i've set people's gaydar off a lot and that's dressed as a man. it can be very awkward. it's not like they're suspicions are going to be denied the more they know me. i have to police myself. it's really subtle things. the way you sit. the colour of a shirt. too much care about dressing. the wrong laugh. not enough interest in sports. not being sexist enough. and this very much includes judgement from women.  but why would you say you are gender non conforming? why was it your friend was able to pick out the way you walk? presumably when you came out them they would think ""ah she always walked like a man."" of course i'm precisely not saying you are trans here. but that there is a relationship. what's your reasoning about that connection?  &gt; however, i don't think the majority of our society thinks critically about gender. while they might be able to detect minute differences in gender non-conformity, i don't think most of them really seriously thought about sex and gender and the pervasive effect it has on our daily lives.  oh i completely agree. in that sense they don't see it as conforming. they enjoy most of the roles and expression. they don't notice the details at all.  and completely understand the tension between a the liberal feminist who declares freedom and the radical feminist who says find that freedom stifling. but i don't have an easy answer.  &gt; it's the same reason why trans people can say things like i'm sex x because stereotype y and no one bats an eye. i think the vast majority of them simply haven't thought about it enough to separate the biology from the social construct.  sure i completely get that problem. i don't agree with all trans politics.  here's some problems with that though.  most people are conforming straight people who do confirm a lot of stereotypes. actually i have a problem with the phrase conform to stereotypes. to it implies that non conforming is a cowardly act. surely stereotypes are bad when the actions are actually negative. a straight sports jock being sexist is a stereotype but its only the sexism that is the problem, right? being a straight sports jock who loves cheerleaders is a stereotype but it's not problematic. a dyke into motorcycles and softball is a stereotype but it's not problematic.  i get that people ought not to make assumptions based on behaviour but it's safe to say that men will like masculine things and women will like feminine things. that really isn't a huge a leap. it's not a huge leap to say that those that break that are usually homosexual.  is it wrong for a man to say ""i like musicals, of course i'm gay"" ? there's plenty of gay men who don't fit that pattern. they might say ""just because i'm gay doesn't mean i don't like male things."" i know you'll say we shouldn't judge anyone's sexuality by their behaviour but haven't we agreed its a reasonable expectation?   &gt; i think it's the expectations above anything else, and in a lot of cases, those expectations are stronger in the presence of the opposite sex. people feel the need to perform gender more exaggeratedly to fit in.  ""fit in"" is only part of it. sexual appeal is important too. masculinity is part of the  minimum requirements to dating straight women. the whole metrosexual thing never really hit the mainstream. a mildly challenging expression that remains marginal and interchangeable with a slur.  &gt; chimamanda ngozi explains it really well here, from around 11:21 to 13:40. it's not to say heterosexual relationships are toxic or gay relationships are superior at all, because that's patently not true.  i think i've seen this before. i mean i like her intent. i like the aspiration. but i just feel the realities are more complicated.    for instance here she describes how damaging it is for society to demand ""the hard man."" when she says she dislikes the word emmasculate.  &gt; a nigerian acquaintance once asked me if i was worried that men would be intimidated by me. i was not worried at all. in fact it had not occurred to me to be worried because a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man i would have no interest in. &gt; (laughter) (applause)  isn't this the exact opposite of her message? what's being implied? laughter at a man who would be intimidated a woman?  he's not intimidated because he is a brave (masculine) and powerful (masculine) man?  that he is already so confident (masculine) that he would never be intimidated by a mere woman?  this sounds like the alpha woman accepting nothing less than an equally alpha man?  to be honest, given her context, i'm not sure he is straight. which gives a different spin on things. and i would back her words on nigerian politics.  intimidation is an interesting word. power is intimidating and also part of attraction.  why can't a man be drawn to a woman he finds intimidating? why can't a woman want that power within a relationship? i guess heterosexual relations are so driven by gender that there is little room for breaking the a lot of the roles.  i do think gay people often think more about their sexuality than straight people. straight people take it all for granted. i think that often means when they have any sexual variation they don't have much ideological framework to deal with it.",1,

964630,"as great as our need to stick together might be... i worry because we've been thrown under the bus many times by the lesbian and gay community. then again the toxic elements there also try to erase and invalidate bisexuals, asexuals, pansexuals, and everyone who isn't homosexual, or heterosexual. though in the latter case some of those toxic elements even try to erase straight orientations... still even less toxic elements tend to use the trans and gnc community as a throwaway pawn, dropping support for our issues as a ""compromise"" so they can get their equality recognized.  i'm very unsure of how much we should focus our communities. i'm not sure that interests sexuality minorities are always directly compatible with interests of gender minorities and visa versa... if we are to be unified then we need to address a few things. one is the hostility, heteronormative trans folk really need to be more understanding of sexuality minorities. at the same time cis gay folk need to be more understanding of gender minorities. more over, we all need to address femmephobia, cis, trans, gay, straight, asexual, bi, gender non-conforming... femmephobia damages us all and it reinforces toxic masculinity. not to say masculinity is toxic, but some expressions of it are. lastly, we need to make sure that gender identity and sexuality are well known to be distinct from each other. that will help with the over sexualization and invalidation of trans and gnc folk, while also helping to normalize minority sexualities.   to boil that all down; for gender and sexuality minorities to be unified, we have to work on mutual acceptance and support.   i just hope there isn't too much bad blood between both the sexuality side and the gender side, which would make the idea of unity more difficult.",1,
970168,"i was outed as bisexual early on sand i have only known bisexuality.  it is a spectrum issue too.  i have no problem finding other bisexual people because i have bi-fi.  that said, my girlfriend and i are finding a couple to be with.  i am more aggressive and was goth and pretty as a leader when i snapped  and ended up popular.  i don't like being told to call myself queer.  i would try to look at you options because lgbt is horrible.  check out bibros.  i am 35 and always identified as bi and none of them have  clue.   plus the pan/bi/whatever 6-14 other names for it and 58 gender nonsense is crazy.  they will make you feel worse because every week anything they can claim is privilege, they will use it to run you out.    as far as orientations to date, heterosexuals can be a somewhat safe bet because there is less of that ""triggered"" nonsense and i amd on my way out of there.  i was never in the closet and these homely miserable snots telling me i am some evil homophobic shitlord has rubbed me the wrong way.   gay men are ones i have never dated but they tend to lash out a lot more because we leave them as relationships and the art of reclaiming bisexuality from that in their minds is homophobic.  there are good, level headed people in all three of those populations.  level headed guys and down to earth women.  84 % of us are in the hetero world.  the lgbt and bi crap is just slowly being erased by queer theory and i can't identify with that.  you have the choice which one you want to be part of.   also, bisexuals and that heteronormative whatnot... in order to come to terms with it is to find a way to have a relationship.  if you get into the oppression olympics culture, it will be miserable.  my experience in the past was violence and when we fought 3-5/week, they always said i was queer.  so i cannot identfy with that because i was accepted in the goth community so i was great in the mid 90s.  i managed to end up terrorizing and making their lives hell.  but, i find that i state i am not in a position for drama so i only want bisexual partners and not rainbow flagging.  i have confidence, i lead a clique of 100 or so kids, i was pretty, only to establish the end of one era and the new sheriff in town.  i made out with homophobes in front of the gay kids because they hated me.  i used to tell hetero women that there was no way i could handle her or vice versa.  but bisexuality is not  supported in any way as progressing and supporting bisexuals falling in love.  i get accused of being a separatist nazi bow.  6 months ago, i was one of the allies to black lives matter because hate lgbt as a thing altogether and wanted to see the front page covering trans people being murdered and they pitched a fit.  i'd also avoid the ""bi guys are hot"" types too because they like thrills and drama and are sluts but will and have often convinced us with it.  find power in it the way  grew up and did, view heterosexuals and homosexuals as separate entities that hae no place to pry.  i step up to a hetero dude any time he feeds that nonsense oppression olympics.  i am a paralegal not but i am one who can take the heterp traits and adapt.  i will not let anyone make me feel bad.  i get those ""i could never date a bi male"" and i look at them and say, ""so?"".  same thing with gay people and i am attractive so i shoot a lot down.  to me, since i had to adapt as a ""queer"" in a real  homophobic society and this isn't.   i am still a lot like that in life.   i am only known to participate in anything if someone is killed in a hate crime.  queer theory isn't open to me being able top be diplomatic anbout getting a concept around heterosexual benefits i get and i am not intimidated by many of them.   my girlfriend and i are on the same page as are our friends who we are connecting with soon and we don't do marriage because it gives a license to take our autonomy.  it doesn't work for everyone.  the bi men and women who seem to lean one way or the other can be hard too.  they are always the martyr and mother theresa.  the bi cis women, who are the mean, upset kind of hetero-ish seeming teamed up with trans people to wipe out lesbian norms and they hate is the most next.  we have home court advantage because, we have been under the radar for awhile and organizing and infiltrating the mras would be where us older bi men can start because they want us and bisexuals have been programmed to fear being attacked but  i blend in fine.    hetero homophobia is gone and this may sound bad but i can play cards right and find a guy who is level headed and not bad, give him head and work my way in.  the plus side is, like radical feminazi types who aren't feminists in the real sense will go away and be less tolerated.  bi men and women are different than gay because the system and social norms did all thet ould to not allow us to love a woman.  and it is still a memory.  if we showed up and appealed to the older late 20's - crowd there and slowly eroded it then we could make this wacked out anyhow and since the radical feminist crew will attack us first, it is somethng looking into.  i still have yet to see this land of ivory towers where we are better and they just do what we tell them.  i want to come up with something to change or reputation.  we can really hit that problem there with the way i can add myself.  i am separatist and counterculture and hell, i was even a hot gothic teen girl for a bit with a rotten attitiude.  i had todowhat i had to do.    but i did seem female and i notices the big difference until i got angry.  division and hate isn't going anywhere and when i was forced into this role embracing the mainstream norms will screw me because our issues with how we are erased is associated with homophobia or sexism and i think shutting down the nutcases on both ends and really looking at the same page that most rational folks can see.  both radfems and mras have valid pisitions on some things.  i don't know but i am hell bent of doing something to get some credit in the straight world for something .  i was treated horrible since i was 7 but my method of ending it makes people not care.  i almost lost one fight when i almost went out and i was done and since i was on my own, i would keep it lock,  stock and barrell if i had to... and they were going to rape my ex girlfriend and i put them in comas... they beatings were enought but then my ""girlfriend... nope.  when it came to goths, like other groups,there's the onedream girl and i hopped into it and socially, the element that didn't adjust would have been threatened out or whatever.  i helped our bi teens end up with solid sense of the world preparing to swim upstream..  nowadays the ""goth community"" os sjwish where unlike in 1997 when we had attacked [protesters for harrssing us.  channeling some of that really needs to happen because it is horrible to feel like this and it is spreaig an it is about time we do our oart and society lets us.  the sleeping truth is countereculture is a lit more direct and in their face and we are tired of and can find othwe ays of things and i am excellent at this kind of thing so the gau dudes who went mra will play the ""feminists pit us against each other.  my siocuiak pokace and dream to aim at problems and not sjw for 5 years more befoe i can pause beor the racism crap comes and society hid our right to love one gender in wevery wy and i want to contribiute to helping the big picture.  we are consideed the cultureless ones that in theor minds.   itfeels good to smile but let's do us and healthy masculinity will result in changing it.  bi women can reclaim queer and it is celebrated even the thought of if me in the same instance went to embrace heterosexuality i would get killed.   so sorry for the tldr bit it brings out my inner rage for being visible to shut my mouth.  bi men need this, at lest tbose oif us who were queered oforfce in a diferent way.  i can really have a shot at this.  nobody else is.",1,
421264,"once upon a time.   tl;dr: unrequited lesbians  a lot of people in this thread are listing shows with the claim that they ""didn't know when to end it"" but once upon a time's downfall started with something a little different - the writers/network did not understand the characters and their relationship dynamic, then balked when things started getting ""too gay."" specifically, the 2 main protagonists are emma swan, the foundling daughter of snow white and prince charming, and regina, the wicked queen/stepmother of that same story. ouat is known for it's ridiculous plot, engineered to interweave the tales of dozens of different ~~disney properties~~ fairytales into several seasons worth of sunday evening hour-long television.   the main background here, is that regina cast a curse that sent all of the enchanted forest characters into a small town in maine where she was mayor and nobody had their memories, were unable to leave the town, and their stories were all disrupted. just before the curse is cast, snow white gives birth to her daughter emma, and through a magical plot stump, emma is sent into the same world, outside the cursed town of storybrook. she is an orphan and a foster child, and ends up going down a delinquent path. she gives birth to a baby son of her own while she is in jail, and he is given up for adoption. at the beginning of the series, this boy shows up on her doorstep on her 30th birthday, and begs her to come to storybrook to help save the town and fulfill her destiny. it turns out henry, her son, was adopted...**by regina!!** dun dun dun!   so over the first two seasons, we get to know the dozens of characters and their history with one another, and inevitably everyone has a tragic motivation behind their actions, usually involving their mothers fucking something up. regina is arguably the best character on the show along with mr. gold, aka rumplestiltskin. as their stories are told and the curse on storybrook begins to break, emma and regina continue to come into conflict, not just over their personal historical beef, but over their son, henry. emma gave birth to him, but regina raised him. over time, emma and regina come to an understanding of one another, and end up being very supportive of one another   \- or they could have been, if the stupid show hadn't decided to throw in pointless heterosexual romances with captain ~~sweatypleather~~hook and ~~adulteratin~~robin hood. i'm not even saying that regina and emma needed to be romantic/sexual with one another. they were two strong women who had been been hard done by in life, that found their own inner strength and were motivated by trying to do right by people they cared about, even if they didn't always make the ""right"" choice.   i'm not even going to get into the cash grab of frozen, nor the boring neverland/oz plots. what really burns my beans is the writers seemed to really care about the characters and their development, then suddenly someone flipped a switch - it may have been labeled ""budget"" and suddenly all the rules of the world didn't matter, things people said or did are retconned left and right, and nothing anyone does makes a lick of difference to what ever is going on.   my advice: watch seasons 1 and 2, then just go and read lily roro spark's episode recaps past then because those are way more entertaining than the show itself.",1,
455445,"**re: child outcomes**  the state of the research is absurdly, hilariously bad. the study you linked to is indeed one of the most commonly cited, and it's a farce. problems with the study:  * they found the couples by advertising that they were doing a child outcomes study in lgbt fora and magazines - all the participants understood very clearly that their responses would be part of a referendum on same-sex childrearing outcomes. they didn't even bother to single-blind it. * after a core of lesbian couples had been selected (and knew the purpose of the experiment), they were encouraged to recruit the remaining participants (gay and straight) from their own social circle. understanding that this study would have significant public policy ramifications, guess what type of participants they recruited? * the sample was restricted to rich lesbian couples (the sort who can afford clinical insemination), and the straight respondents were matched by ""similar degrees of urbanization"". which is like saying that a trust-fund hipster in brooklyn is comparable to a single mom in queens. * all responses were *self-reported*, in the form of diaries and questionnaires, except for a single home visit in which the families were recorded performing a task. self-reported by a non-representative sample of rich lesbian couples, who knew very well that the study was intended to demonstrate their fitness as parents (and the merits of lgbt parenting generally).  you couldn't ask for a more dishonestly engineered piece of social-science proof-texting. if it was about any other subject, it would have flunked as an undergraduate term paper - and *even then*, with their thumbs on the scale in every possible way, they could only muster a tepid, shrugging verdict of ""inconclusive"". but it's the gold standard, because every attempt at honest research returns the ""politically incorrect"" truth of the matter, so they get buried and the researchers blacklisted.  **re: mental illness**  homosexuality's removal from the dsm is a pretty interesting story, [covered on this american life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/transcript) a couple years back. essentially, it was not the result of new research, or even a new paradigm of mental illness - it was literally the result of a cabal of closeted gay men on the board of the apa, who simply didn't want their illness to be categorized as such.  if it was any other disorder, it would be painfully obvious that having pathological people defining pathology is wrong-headed. and if i had heard this on some right-wing talk radio station, i would have considered it a ludicrous conspiracy theory - but *it was on npr*.  obviously the definition of mental illness is pretty subjective - but it's characterized by one or more of the following: a) distress/dysphoria, b) disruption of basic functions of normal life, and c) socially disruptive/unacceptable behavior.  by all three of those standards, homosexuality qualifies as a mental illness. the dysphoria has been written off as solely the result of stigma, but that doesn't hold up under analysis. (and by the way, thirty years ago, psychologists said the same thing about divorce, but the stigma subsided and the harm remained).  the disruption of basic living is obvious - individuals who struggle with same-sex attraction have a very difficult time accessing the *immensely* important human experience of conceiving children and raising them with their mother or father. obviously we may disagree about what constitutes a basic human experience, but that's a philosophical question, not a scientific one.  the social disruption comes for the kids of lgbt couples, who are, by definition, deprived of at least one of their biological parents - an experience that social scientists acknowledge as tremendously important for child development in every context *except* the sacred cow of sexual politics.  obviously adoption is a beautiful thing, and stable lgbt couples are obviously preferable to the foster system or leaving them in an unacceptable home environment. but that's not how most lgbt couples raise kids: far and away the most common circumstance is gay couples raising kids from previous (heterosexual) relationships (66%), followed distantly by formal or informal surrogacy/insemination (~25%), followed by adoption (&lt;10%).  you can argue that in the coming inclusive utopia, the broken homes and suffering of children will stop - but that's a claim that would require much more evidence than we've seen, and it is wildly irresponsible to engage in this kind of social engineering on that assumption.  i don't think i have much more time for this discussion, but i sincerely hope i've answered your questions.",1,

902295,"[there was a recent thread on this sort of thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/swordartonline/comments/3yi9qs/discussion_mbti/), but i'll keep this readable people who don't know mbti and similar.  &amp;nbsp;  kirito excels at figuring out of things work in a mechanical/technical sense, it's why he's so good with tech and games in general; he understands how all the underlying mechanics and such function.   this is is top level function, if you will, and it is an introverted one. this is a trait (and overall type) commonly seen in mechanics and engineers, people who create, disassemble, and improve physical, technical items and devices.  &amp;nbsp;  he's also a very sensory, physical-driven person, acting through and relying on his five senses as his primary way of interacting with the outside world (extroverted trait). his combat skills are a direct product of his innate understanding of *how* to do stuff (first function) combined with his physical ability to excel at it.  this is also the reason he loves adventures and quests, as well as simple, sensory pleasures like good food and a nap in the sun, and is why he learns best by doing, first hand. this is the same sort of function that most sports-y types use very heavily.  &amp;nbsp;  his lower trait is one that focuses on other people. being a lower function he's not as good with it and it's often something he feels very uncomfortable using and dealing with, making him actively reject being around other people. this is also the trait that makes people strongly emotionally attached to others, usually in a very deep, fundamental way; one could often call it love, even if it's not romantic.  most people are bad/negatively involved with these lowest functions until they get a little older than he is, or something important/traumatic happens (good or bad trauma, if that makes sense). for kirito, he was only his old self, actively pushing people away and refusing to get attached to anyone, for all of two episodes (with klein and asuna). he finally found it in him to give in and truly care about someone, maybe he couldn't help it, maybe it was partly due to really needing people and being lonely at this point.  we know how that turned out. despite causing a complete reversal of his progress here for six months or so, sachi's message ultimately let him forgive himself and was a sort of ""positive trauma"", pushing him back into being able to use it again, and that's exactly what we see multiple times in silica's episode, and from there all the way through the rest of the series.  that said, he's still not great at *using* it, even it he's in a positive place, thus the subtle awkwardness and some less-than-social tendencies. he cares more than he's able to properly articulate, aside from through his actions, actions being something he's very good at.  &amp;nbsp;  sorry, this sort of went of a bit of a tangent, but i just can't stop when i get started on these sorts of posts. xd  here's [another (and shorter) kirito-specific analysis](http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/99495634070/sword-art-online-kirigaya-kazuto-kirito-istp), and here's a [general one about the type](http://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality).  of note, sinon is very likely also this type, and yuuki is the extroverted version of the same.",1,

paul was not saying that idolatry turns people gay; rather, he was saying that idolatry led to participation in shameful acts of lust. i believe most of the participants were heterosexuals who were acting contrary to their nature. let me explain, using cybele worship as an illustration.  ten to fifteen years before paul wrote his letter to rome, emperor claudius permitted the worship of cybele, a mother goddess, to take place in rome. there were prominent temples to the goddess in rome (where the letter was being sent to) and in corinth (where paul wrote the letter). greeks and romans were abandoning the worship of the invisible deity taught by their own philosophers, and were worshiping cybele instead, using idols of women, lions, serpents, and birds. the male priests of the goddess castrated themselves (what a penalty for their error!), and played the part of women in temple prostitution. even the women likewise, who worshiped cybele, were equipped with artificial phalli/dildos, and played the part of men in pagan prostitution. most of these worshipers were naturally heterosexual, but gave themselves over to the frenzied sexual rituals in order to honor cybele.  you see, just as the majority of hindus are straight, so likewise, the majority of idol worshipers in rome were straight — but took part in dishonorable acts as part of pagan worship. similar things happened among worshipers of aphrodite and other deities. as i said before, romans 1 is not about gay christian boys or girls, but about idolaters with darkened understanding.  but as you said, we all are flawed, yet loved! paul goes on in chapter 1 to mention all kinds of sin, and then in 2:1 turns the table and says even the jews were guilty, indeed, all the world reaps the wages of sin, yet we are all given the gift of eternal life through jesus christ! that is indeed a marvelous comfort!  another passage often quoted against us is 1 corinthians 6:9, wrongly translated as “homosexuals.” but remember that, 500 years ago, martin luther translated “arsenokoites” as “child molesters.” recall the story of jupiter/zeus arriving in the form of an eagle and abducting the boy ganymede to be his cup bearer and sex slave. keep in mind that, in ancient rome, masters could have sex with any male or female slave they wished — this was rape. very often, men married to women kept boy slaves or prostitutes on the side to have sex with. so i believe that passage, in the culture of rome, was referring to the abuse of boy slaves and boy prostitutes, not to a loving, equal, committed relationship.  sometimes genesis 19 is mentioned, but the sin of sodom was partly arrogance and oppressing the poor (ezekiel 16:49) and partly an attempt to gang rape the messengers of god. judges 19 also refers to gang rape of a female concubine by the men of gibeah. but genesis 19 no more condemns all homosexuality than judges 19 condemns all heterosexuality.  finally, leviticus was written to ancient jews, not modern gentile christians. i eat pork, shellfish, and cheeseburgers; i wear blended fabrics; i shave my sideburns; and i dare to shake hands with a menstruating woman — for those laws were not addressed to me. so, jewish men were to abstain from anal intercourse (this may have referred to pagan male prostitutes in canaan), but interestingly, many conservative rabbis permit two jewish men to be partners as long as they do not engage in that particular act (other sexual acts are okay). notice also that women are not even mentioned, so apparently jewish lesbians are okay.  my friend, when it comes to ethics, people use the bible to prove all kinds of things. faithful believers support and oppose capital punishment; dedicated christians support killing in war, and pacifism. life is complex! i believe christ did not wish to burden us with rules like the pharisees. he simply said, “do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” and, “love one another as i have loved you.” we are not under the law of moses; god has imparted the living holy spirit into our hearts with the inner principle of love. therefore we are not slaves under a yoke, but free (galatians 5:1).  if i ever meet a fine gay man who is spiritual and loving and mutually attractive, and if i felt the lord leading me to him and him to me, i would feel free to be his mate. jesus was lord of the sabbath, healed the sick on the sabbath, allowed his disciples to pluck grain on the sabbath, commended abiathar for giving the holy showbread to david’s hungry men, touched the lepers, and allowed the woman with a hemorrhage to touch him. jesus valued people and their needs more than rules! since i am not anointed and gifted to do celibacy well, i believe christ also would permit me to be mated with another male, as my heart yearns.",1,

121435,"i think i'm going to struggle with this too, when i move in with my boyfriend. i'll be lucky i don't gain more than 20lbs...  things he eats: most types of chips, bread, and cereal. chicken, and beef but it has to be ground. drinks sugary juice and soda. sometimes water. milk. lots of candy. mexican food with only the aforementioned meat types. chili beans. ramen.  things he doesn't eat: vegetables, fruit, steak, turkey, fish, burgers, anything with a bone in it, potatoes, basically almost everything from keto diet.   i can't force him not to eat what he wants; i can only control myself. my plan is to try my best to have a substitute that's better than his food. good, high quality meats and vegetables as well as low-carb alternatives to things like chips that you can have occasionally. there's a subreddit just for recipes called /r/ketorecipes. i'd suggest you practice and get the hang of cooking these foods, maybe pick a few dependable staples that you can make every week. also this is a good blog http://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/ for recipes.",0,

(13:35) “there’s gotta be someone there who eats instant noodles.” ryuuji is *so* gonna take that personally haha!  (13:42) soup and sandwiches are the perfect lunch. :)  (13:53) the sweat is pouring off of ryuuji.  (14:04) he’s gonna snap… it’s only a matter of time…  (14:21) can’t go wrong with johnny’s!  (14:27) and she got a sandwich hahaha! ryuuji would be pissed.  (14:35) damn minori. you da real mvp.  (14:52) and on that day, taiga gained 12 pounds.  (14:55) diet warrior does not approve.  (15:08) “why can’t ryuuji just make his normal bentous again?” sometimes simple is just better.  (15:27) she’s right. ryuuji is basically taiga’s personal cook.  (15:32) she’s gotta be the happiest worker of all time.  (15:41) it seems like she’s thinking of a plan. plans aren’t good. they’re never good. staaaahp.  (15:54) ryuuji perfecting his art! …or trying to.  (16:04) “is taiga coming over tonight?” probably. :p  (16:11) “mr. whatevers wife ran away with some other guy, so this will cheer him up!” i dunno that food would cheer up the guy in that case, but hey, at least she’s trying.  (16:28) all that food and he hasn’t ate any of it while he was making it?  (16:36) “why didn’t she come over” because she has a *plan*.  (16:44) inko is really chowing down in the background! xd  (16:55) this show is making me so hungry… damn i need to eat after this.  (17:08) doesn’t inko *always* sound like he/she is gagging? :p  (17:15) lol ryuuji is such a freak.  (17:23) damn he looks so evil!  (17:34) inko vs ryuuji? 5 bucks on inko. ryuuji could never lay a finger on that bird.  (17:42) does whatever inko said actually mean something? if so, translation please? :)  (17:47) oh, never mind. i’m guessing it means impossible since ryuuji said “it’s not impossible”  (17:54) oh gosh taiga’s cooking…  (18:05) only ryuuji would get nervous for lunch.  (18:17) what in the world did he do this time…?  (18:22) bomb threat!!! everyone out of the school now!!!  (18:32) oh gosh is it a mini oven??  (18:36) a rice cooker?  (18:44) ami’s reaction would be my reaction haha  (18:50) ryuuji’s like, “just act calm. yeah. i’m not bringing any attention to myself. nahh… not at all. this sweat is just because it’s hot in here, that’s all…”  (18:56) hahaha i love how she just knows it’s him!  (19;01) “you think this is home ec or something?” he’d get an a+ in that class, for sure.  (19:10) no proof except your guilty reaction. :p  (19:14) “yeah right! no one else is crazy enough to do this!” truth.  (19:25) with one pull of the plug, ryuuji’s dreams could be crushed!  (19:28) hahahahaha!!! ryuuji’s scream is so amazing!!  (19:40) a man beat by a grandma.  (19:50) i love how they’re always on the roof. that’s just the weirdest thing to me. :p  (19:58) “it’s lunch time, you lost, let’s eat!” taiga just wants her food!  (20:14) “that’s not a bentou though.” she’s got a point. ryuuji’s a damn cheater.  (20:31) ah so that was her plan. let’s see what taiga cooked up. :)  (20:43) daaamn that’s a lot of different rice balls.  (20:54) “remember? you taught me how.” awwwhhh :)  (21:00) awh. good memories. :)  (21:14) yeah, if you don’t eat it, taiga will!  (21:28) he either loves it or it’s horrible. :p  (21:36) hahaha what did i say? plans never go how you want them in this anime. xd  (21:46) add soup to overly salty foods? perfect idea!  (21:57) the joy of taiga’s face when she sees food lol  (22:05) i love how excited she gets over the simplest of things. :)  (22:14) “why didn’t i see it before?” “that i’m a genius” lol  (22:29) the moral of the story is love makes a lunch good. :p  (22:42) this is so cheesy haha!  (22:57) now *this* is really the end d: no more new episodes of toradora!  (23:06) “eating that soup made me even hungrier!” only taiga.

(24:09) “someone special” enter taiga. so damn cute. :)  (24:20) this is such a happy scene! :)  (24:30) the music fits perfect too.  (24:40) “if it’s from the heart, it’s always good.” :d  (24:44) cue (see guys? i spelled it right this time!) old ed! love this lead-in. :)  (24:49) pretty great picture!  (24:53) hahaha they’re making her feed ryuuji! *so* touching :p  (24:58) feels good to hear this ed again.  **concluding thoughts:** it was a fun episode and all, but if they were going to make an extra episode, it would have been cool for them to expand on taiga and ryuuji’s life in the future, or how minori, ami, and kitamura were doing after high school. either way, it’s still an extra episode, so it was still awesome. i really enjoyed the last scene where they were having a picinic. :) again, glad i could share all of my thoughts with you guys! it’s been fun!",0,

206577,"&gt;incrementalism = conservatism...  that's literally the exact opposite of what conservatism is. conservatism means no changes, whatsoever. go ahead and ask republicans if they are fans of steady movement towards clean energy or universal healthcare.  &gt;the civil rights movement was a success because of civic activism and civil disobedience, not because people sat around waiting for change to slowly crawl through their antiquated political institutions.  um...and yet the civil rights movement was a change which slowly crawled through antiquated political institutions. i mean, slavery ended almost 100 years before the civil rights act was passed. you think african americans just woke up in 1960 and said holy shit we have it pretty shitty in this country? or gays and lesbians woke up in 2010 and said wow maybe we should have the right to marry or something? women said in 1915 hey what if we voted? african americans just recently figured out they were experiencing police brutality?  yes, there are critical junctures in time which bring about massive sweeping changes to political institutions. but those things don't happen overnight, they happen after a long period of incremental change bringing forward the ability to close the final gap in one big push.   gay rights, for an example.   * 1948, the first paper arguing that homosexuality may not be a mental illness is published.   * 1956, evelyn hooker publishes her research that homosexuals and heterosexuals don't differ significantly, and that it's not a clinical disorder.  * 1958, scotus says a gay magazine isn't obscene material.  * 1962, the first state (illinois) decriminalizes homosexuality. * 1973 apa removes homosexuality as a mental illness * 1977, harvey milk gets a gay rights ordinance passed and prevents a proposition which would ban homosexual teachers * 1980, dnc endorses homosexual rights platform. * 1982, wisconsin bans discrimination based on sexual orientation. * 1993, don't ask don't tell is implemented. while imperfect and seriously flawed on some levels, it is a major step forward in terms of allowing homsexuals to serve (secretly) in the military. * 1996, scotus strikes down a colorado ban on lgbt protections * 2000, vermont legalizes civil unions * 2003, scotus strikes down sodomy laws, effectively legalizing homosexuality in every state in the country. * 2004, ma legalizes straight up gay marriage * 2009, obama allows same-sex partners to get certain benefits; hate crimes act is expanded to include homsexuality  * 2010, dadt repealed, homosexuals can now serve openly * 2013, doma is struck down * 2014, scotus declines appeals of district court rulings supporting gay marriage, effectively legalizing gay marriage in a handful of states * 2015, scotus rules same sex marriage is a right, legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  this shit doesn't happen overnight. incrementalism is progressivism.",1,

643690,"look, i'm not a hateful person or anything–i believe we should all live and let live. but lately, i've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. you see, just about wherever i go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.  take last sunday, for instance, when i casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. the guy looked like a real man's man, too–big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. he didn't seem the least bit gay. at least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.  where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? did i look gay to him? was i wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? i don't recall the phrase, ""suck my cock"" entering the conversation, and i don't have a sign around my neck that reads, ""please, you homosexuals, suck my cock.""  i've got nothing against homosexuals. let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, i say. but when they start sucking my cock, then i've got a real problem.  then there was the time i was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. he seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock!  what is it with these homos? can't they control their sexual urges? aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?  believe me, i have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. but try telling that to the guy at the beach club. or the one at the video store. or the one who catered my wedding. or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. all of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing i could do to stop them.  i tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: how the hell did this happen? where did this fairy ever get the idea that i was gay? and where did he get those fantastic boots?  it screws with your head at other times, too. every time a man passes me on the street, i'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. i've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations i enjoy with my wife–even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with vancouver canucks forward mark messier that i can't seem to stop thinking about.  things could be worse, i suppose. it could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. as it is, i'm just angry and sickened. but believe me, that's enough. i don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, i don't want to know. i just wish there were some way to get them to stop.  i've tried all sorts of things to get them to stop, but it has all been to no avail. a few months back, i started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. in fact, it only seemed to encourage them. then, i really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, neck, chest and hair seemed to have no effect. what do i have to do to get the message across to these swishes?  i swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, i'm going to have to resort to drastic measures–like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much i disapprove of their unwelcome advances. i mean, you can't get much more direct than that. sauce: http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/why-do-all-these-homosexuals-keep-sucking-my-cock-10861",1,1
