201968,"that you qualify your case as anecdotal indicates you know your argument is weak.  there's lots of research in these sorts of matters, 5 seconds in google popped this:  http://www.apa.org/releases/facerecog.html  this relates to superpop's observation of intra-racial recognition.  e.g. asians are generally better at recognizing other asians, and discerning the flavor of asian (alllooksame.com) because they know which features to use as identifying criteria, subtleties in skin color, nose and eye shape, build, whatever.  whites can be characterized in part by their eye color which, to a white, is a ""major trait"" but another race may barely register eye color (indeed my mother, who is asian, has some trouble discerning whites despite differing hair / eye color because she tends not to notice hair color ... i know it sounds strange, but to her other features comprise ""major traits"").  the case of your taiwanese friend is possibly that she grew up with whites and because she grew up having to discern whites came to recognize the caucasian ""major traits"".  but to practically address the other points.  we identify ""race"" by skin color (i guess it happened like this because skin color is readily noticeable), and cecil has a good point that skin color seems to have developed as a protection against the sun, thus putting many darker skinned people in a narrow band around the equator.  lighter skinned people would then arise in the two areas around the poles, almost de facto making the darker skinned people ""plenty closer"" than light skinned people (this is complicated in that there is so little land in the southern hemisphere and many of the whites in these lands came through colonization).  still, the whites in the southern reaches of south america are going to be much different than scandanavians.  also, since many physical traits arise as acclimation to climate, it seems to me that there is relatively less climate variation around the equator (where the amount of sunlight trumps many other factors) than northward where a gulfstream might have contributed to marked physical differences in the irish and scandanavians.  to get such marked differences around the equator you might need to compare saharan africans against tropical south americans.  and to address the ""further removed from apes thing"", i don't really give it any weight, but if anything, advances in the colder areas might have come out of necessity where weather and food supply might not have favored survival.  necessity is the mother of invention, and i've heard similar arguments to explain northern us' relative economic success to the south's, despite the south's apparently favorable climate.  but i hardly think this alone contributes to how a person physically looks.",1,

'we had no proposals to roll this out.' but none were needed. to their astonishment, take-up was huge. they had unwittingly harnessed one of the strongest forces in civil society: parents' determination to do what is best for their child.  school groups seemed to come from nowhere. community groups sent in applications, villages clubbed together. today one in ten swedish state-funded schools is run by the private groups and those which remain have been shown in studies to have improved sharply. headmasters of swedish state schools now face a threat entirely absent from the comfortable british system:  if they fail to please parents, the children will leave and enrol elsewhere.  freedom to set up a school is enshrined in the dutch constitution, and today two in three state-funded schools are privately run.  this bottom-up approach means more, smaller schools: the average school roll is 200 in sweden and 190 in the netherlands.  in england it is 890 and rising: closures are running at the level of 120 schools a year.  there are now reams of academic studies on the voucher system and they show that, contrary to common belief, they don't much help the rich. choice already exists for the wealthy, whether it means choosing between england's 2,200 private schools or buying a house in a better catchment area.  the problem in england lies in the 3.3 million pupils in the 243 schools which the chief inspector of schools last week said were failing to provide an adequate education. it is these pupils for whom the voucher system works best.  a harvard university study into the voucher system in milwaukee and cleveland -- which offer it only to pupils below a certain income threshold -- found that test results after four years were 11 percentage points higher in maths and six in reading. in both cities, three quarters of those receiving vouchers were from single parents on low wages; the middle class had not managed to hijack the system. studies in charter schools, american equivalent of the old direct-grant schools in england, yield similarly impressive results.  while the last decade has been one of missed opportunity for education in england, the tools for recovery are already here. exam results in city academies, which bear comparison with the american charter schools, have on average improved at twice the average national rate. there are 47 open now, just under 100 planned for this time next year and 400 earmarked for the end of the decade. if this happens, city academies will account for one in ten state schools.  both labour and the conservatives have toyed with the idea of education liberalisation. when tony blair was introducing his education white paper in october 2005 he spoke about making every school independent and noted that swedish exam results 'improved fastest where schools knew children were free to go elsewhere'. but a backbench rebellion forced him to abandon his plans to loosen the grasp which local educational authorities (leas) hold over state schools. the subsequent education act was perforated with concessions.  the conservatives at the last election proposed a swedish-style policy where parents could take the full value of the £5,000 education allocation and spend it on another school. it couldn't be topped up, so the choice would be restricted to the 145 private schools whose fees are below the state level. but this was a superficial restraint: as sweden found, new schools pop up from nowhere under a system where money follows pupils. and the gap between state funds and private fees is also deceptive.  the deal with belvedere school -- and another, william hulme, in manchester -- is a model for how state funding can buy good private education. their fees are £8,000, yet they are becoming city academies at a cost of £5,000 a pupil. this will be done by admitting boys and increasing class sizes somewhat. add more sixth-form pupils, and the funding gap between private and public closes.  this is a strange time for david cameron to have dropped the 'right to choose' proposal, which the blairites had privately considered the one truly radical policy in the last tory manifesto. 'two years ago it looked as if they'd overtake us on education, ' says one then blair adviser. 'now, they're intent on repeating our mistakes.' mr cameron's aides say we should wait until the tory policy review is produced at the end of this year.  this takes the education debate to an intriguing impasse. both mr cameron and gordon brown are avowed opponents of the voucher system and speak in sectarian terms about public and private. but the agenda is not dead on either side of the political divide. on the labour benches mr milburn has advanced his personal plans for a voucher system for the poorest. direct democracy, a grouping mainly of young tory mps, will soon publish a pamphlet proposing a system remarkably similar to that mr cameron ditched.  when interviewed on bbc radio 4 last week, mr blair was challenged over the slide in social mobility. while he spoke about his city academy programme, he conceded that his policies 'have not helped in the way that we should those at the very bottom of the pile'. his successor in no. 10 need not need not accept this record of failure.",0,

676184,"i think the entire debate, from god to religion, would benefit if we stopped talking about 'proof'. you can pick holes in any kind of 'proof' outside mathematics or logic, starting with 'what if we're brains in jars?' and working outwards from there.  the argument should be about evidence. i can't 'prove' that i'm not a sentient fungus temporarily invested with the ability to type. but my inability to 'prove' that i'm not a fungus (i'll lose the sneer quotes now) is fundamentally uninteresting unless we're stoned. we're all happy to work on the basis that we're not communicating with fungus whenever we open a browser.  equally, i can't prove the nonexistence of god. nor can i prove the nonexistence of the tiny orbiting teapot that bertrand russell suggested. if i lack sufficient evidence for either, then i just won't bother. we don't work exclusively on beliefs that can be logically proven from first principles, or we'd never get out of bed.  if you feel you *do* have sufficient evidence - because god speaks to you when you pray, because you believe in the literal truth of the bible, because you have an intuition - then that's at least evidence that we can argue about. but that evidence has to be set against opposing evidence (studies that show that prayer doesn't help patients) and inconsistent evidence (that guy over there also has an intuition about god, but he's a hindu and his intuition tells him jesus was just some guy.)",0,

384756,"i actually have the option to put my money in a 401k.  it seems like the smart thing to do but i'm very, very hesitant to do so for two reasons.   first, that money is very useful to me now when i'm just starting up in paying off my student loans; i'm not sure it would be a net gain for me to put the money in the 401k earning interest when i can put the money into paying the principal of my loan, cutting the amount of time i have to pay it off.    second, i'm not sure that i will be able to access the funds when i am 77.  for one, i might be dead.  it's more than likely.  another reason could be an economic collapse by investing in american markets; if you believe the entire country is headed for an economic fall, it doesn't make sense to invest in america.     third, you don't get rich in america, by any standard, by working for someone else (unless you're getting stock options in a dotcom ipo, but ipos are down the shitter because of sarbanes-oxley) wouldn't it be better, instead of relying on ""investments"" to ""invest"" in your own damn company and try to start your own business?  i'm seriously considering this.  fourth, if you're planning on relocating soon (within 5 years) i'm not sure that it's a good idea to put anything in a fund you're not sure you're going to be able to access.  if i wanted to move overseas, for example, i can't imagine the regulatory burden i'd have to face accessing the funds i left behind in the u.s.    fifth, with the job market the way it is for people in my generation, it just doesn't make sense to sock away money that you can't access without significant penalty until the age of 65.  if i lose my job tomorrow; which is a possibility, i'm going to have to live off my savings until i manage to either start my own business or find another job.  there are tons of expenses incurred in being unemployed, including, for example, plane tickets for flying in to interviews (if you have a white-collar job specialty that isn't in your area, you're going to have to start interviewing across the u.s., or even abroad,) maybe a new interview suit.  you're also going to have to pay rent, food, and the other bills that keep coming.  it can take you over 6 months to find a new job - more the more experience and education you have.    don't get me wrong.  i -want- to save for retirement, but i honlestly don't believe that there's any way that i can do so without risking my neck in the here and now.  this is a generation living paycheck to paycheck - how the hell am i going to justify putting my money in an investment that i can't take it out of for half a century?",0,

270356,"evil fears laughter  are demons and devils real? in my view, it doesn't matter whether or not  they exist in an objective or literal sense. the point is that we are all  plagued by split-off, unintegrated portions of our own and other people's  psyches. they behave exactly as if they were diabolical entities--demons,  djinns, dybbuks, and devils--working at cross-purposes to our conscious  desires.  in dealing with their hassling interventions, i endorse the approach  described by paul foster case in his book *the tarot: a key to the  wisdom of the ages.* there he suggested that mirth is the best way to  beat the devil.

926332,"&gt; one thing i'm interested in though: in philly most people who fled (white flight) actually work outside the city limits? typically, i thought, most people commute into cities like that one.. (where 3 sides aren't surrounded by water making the bridges complete hell to get in).  i think that, in philadelphia's case, true ""white flight"" was a small component. it really is more a ""middle class flight"" - everyone who can afford it, white, black or hispanic, leaves.  but, to your question, yes, everyone works outside the city limits if they can. the philly region has a new corridor of big pharma companies sprouting up 10 miles outside the city limits. the hi-tech companies seem to be centered around valley forge and the ""main line"" - outside the city limits.  really, the only thing philly has going for it is its universities. the sunk costs of establishing all those medical, science, and engineering schools mean that there's a locked-in population of highly educated workers and recent grads who help drive the economy - but a mile across the river, the only reason that cities like camden and trenton aren't as nationally infamous as detroit is because they weren't as large to begin with.  i don't know for sure why the west coast cities like san francisco and l.a. seem to have escaped this phenomenon but i suspect that it's at least partly because of what you mentioned - california has been so business friendly overall, and the california economic boom has been so huge, that it let california cities defy the odds.  &gt;anyway it's a whole different world out here in california where there's less history and things have been done differently. but ultimately i'll tell yah, things are the same.  heh. i have to tell you a story. we philly people tend to get pretty smug about history, what with all the 300 year old parks, historic battlefields and what-not, but i've learned to get over it. back in the late 80's, i spent 3 months out your way on a contract with a semiconductor company. as part of the deal, they let me bring my wife and infant son. so, we ran around doing all the touristy things and we felt terribly, terribly smug whenever we ran into signs talking about ""old sacramento"" or how things were way back in the wild west of nearly a 100 years ago. a hundred years ago?!? why, i've seen sidewalks older than that! ;-)   anyway, a year later, i was in london, on another contract, standing in a government building that was almost five times as old as our entire country. i didn't feel nearly so smug, then...",0,

""but that didn't prevent the israeli government from aggressively pursuing activities to place jews within the muslim quarter. the attitude is: what's mine is exclusively mine, but what's yours is mixed if we happen to target it.""  israeli law permits wholesale confiscation of property inside israel or jerusalem that is owned by palestinians who live in areas defined as ""enemy territory"", including the west bank, which was occupied by jordan until it lost the war against israel in 1967. ""any palestinian who was at any point in 'enemy territory' after 1967, forfeits his property,"" says seidemann. ""but enemy territory includes the west bank. it's a remarkable situation. any property that was ever 'abandoned' by any palestinian becomes state land and is then 'turned over to the jewish people'. any property that once belonged to a jew is 'recovered to the jewish people' and turned over to the settlers.""  ""i hate the term ethnic cleansing in the context of this,"" he says, ""because of the connotations of rape and pillage, which this is not. but there was and is an active government effort using procedures such as this to rid targeted areas of its palestinian residents and turn it into an exclusively or predominantly jewish area. and i say, with regret, that the efforts have been moderately successful.""  the law is not applied in reverse: jews who go to live in west bank settlements do not lose property they may own in tel aviv. last year, sharon's government quietly confiscated thousands of acres of palestinian-owned lands within greater jerusalem without compensation, after a secret cabinet decision to use a 55-year-old law on abandoned property against arabs separated from their olive groves and farms by the west bank barrier. previous governments decided not to apply this law to east jerusalem and the sharon administration was embarrassed enough to expropriate the lands in secret before dropping the policy after an international outcry when it came to light. the palestinians called the confiscations ""legalised theft"".  ""what stands out for jerusalem and johannesburg is that it was and is such a prolonged use of planning in pursuit of a political objective,"" says scott bollens. ""one distinction with south africa is the racial identifiers and the racial rhetoric was so blatant, and it was so visible and it was so much part of apartheid south african language. but, despite the difference in rhetoric, the outcomes are very, very similar and the urban landscape israel has created in the jerusalem region is just as unequal, just as subjugating of the palestinians as the 'group area' planning was in south africa for the blacks.""  in 2004, jerusalem's council approved the first new masterplan for the city since 1959. the plan acknowledges some of the injustices and problems in east jerusalem, provides for greater construction of homes in some arab areas, and criticises jewish settlement in the east of the city. but critics say that at its core is the same obsession with demography and what the plan describes as ""preserving a firm jewish majority in the city"".  a former jerusalem city councillor, meir margalit, says the process was flawed from the start because the steering committee of 31 people who put the plan together included only one arab. ""it is characteristic everywhere of colonial regimes which believe that the 'natives' are worthy neither of suitable representation nor of being masters of their own fate. the planning team apparently sets out from the assumption that, in any case, one is dealing with a jewish city and therefore there is no reason to ask the opinion of anyone who does not belong to the jewish people,"" he says.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/story/0,,1703245,00.html",1,

(and i phrase this the way i do because i don't have the inclination to go on a link hunt right now - i'm just making the case that it's not as absurd as it may sound)   in all of this, i have read by non crack pot sources that deals were being pursued in russia as well. which in 1917, a full 5 years before becoming soviet russia, had plenty of anti-tzarist elements.   now, speaking of a different era: personally, i don't see why the nazis would be unwilling to strike deals with anyone. they were fiercly unsentimental about everything they did. they had huge investments from america. they did trade with anyone who paid them. sure, there was a propaganda propagated ideology, but the nazi government itself was cold and calculated. iow, it would't surprise me at all that they would cooperate.   this being said: did they? i don't know. they certainly considered it if what i read about eichmann is to be believed.   now, i want to quote something from wikipedia, and i know it's a somewhat lame source, but that's all i've got here: [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_eichmann#work_with_the_nazi_party_and_the_ss)  &gt;adolf eichmann had been selected by the ss leadership to form the central office for jewish emigration, charged with forcibly deporting and expelling jews from austria. through this work, eichmann became a student of judaism, even studying hebrew.   just to quote you in reference: &gt;eichmann was the transportation coordinator for the holocaust; far too low-ranking to be given negotiating power outside the reich, afaik.   maybe a bit more than ""transportation coordinator"". also, his studying hebrew is not at all incompatible with him going to israel to check out the situation.   so. i'm not spewing all this from my sunshine hole, and i'm not as confused as you'd have me be. i just have a point that is more subtle than black and white, and which isn't necessarily as irrefutably convincing as what propaganda would have it be. and i'm certainly not sure about any of it.   but when i hear broad sweaping statements, i can recognize them for what they likely are: ideological propaganda or retroactively written history (i.e. history as written by the victors)",1,

""who   knows where it came from? a lot of people saw it,   and i saw it too.""  symington was referring to a v-shaped object with   lights on it seen in the skies over phoenix ten   years ago. some estimated the lights to be the size   of a football field, while others said they could   have been a mile long. he continued to describe his   own sighting of the triangular object: ""it was   dramatic. and it couldn't have been flares because   it was too symmetrical."" the former arizona governor   revealed the object to be a “craft of unknown   origin.”  while symington hasn’t been the only political   figure in arizona to comment on the phoenix lights,   he stands alone in his admission that they were more   than just flares. when asked to comment on the   phoenix lights in 2000, senator john mccain said,   “that has never been fully explained.” he also   quickly added, “but i have to tell you that i do not   have any evidence whatsoever of aliens or ufos.”  fife symington says he called the commander of luke   air force base, the arizona department of public   safety and a general with the arizona national guard   back in 1997 to ask about the lights. none of them   were able to provide him with any answers and seemed   “perplexed.” one of the problems with the sightings   were the multitude of explanations available at the   time.  the v-shaped object with lights was seen in the sky   around 8:30pm. the lights that were videotaped and   seen around 10:30pm are what most people call the   phoenix lights. these are often explained away as   flares, but not everyone agrees. people that   videotaped the 10:30pm event back in 1997 say the   lights were in a triangular shape. some of them had   seen military flares being dropped on other   occasions and say this was something completely   different. however, authorities stayed with the   flares explanation and explained the earlier events   as a sighting of the hale-bopp comet.  synmington called for an investigation into the   phoenix lights shortly after the sightings occurred,   but the statement was a hollow one. either he was   not able to obtain cooperation from military   authorities, or he never made much of an effort.   however, with pressure mounting from the public, ufo   researchers and news gathering organizations, he had   to eventually take some action.  on june 19, 1997, governor fife symington held a   press conference in phoenix. dressing one of his   aides up as an alien, the governor said that the   phoenix lights were flares and nothing to get upset   about. he also said that he was only joking when he   ordered the arizona department of public safety   (arizona state police) to investigate the sightings.   today, he still defends those actions.  ""i wanted people to lighten up and calm down, so i   introduced a little levity. but i never felt that   the overall situation was a matter of ridicule,""   symington says about the infamous press conference.   but not everyone was laughing. former phoenix   councilwoman frances barwood made a serious effort   to investigate the sightings in 1997.  according to her recent statements, barwood was   unable to convince federal authorities to interview   even one of the seven hundred witnesses that she   spoke to about the phoenix lights. big surprise!   being an elected official isn’t enough when it comes   to getting answers about ufos from the military.   just ask current arizona governor janet napolitano.  janet napolitano called for an investigation into   the phoenix lights during her 1997 campaign to   become arizona attorney general and was elected to   that office in 1998. despite her former position as   a u.s. attorney for the district of arizona, we can   assume that she was served the same plate of   disinformation from the u.s. military that the rest   of us received. what does she think of symington’s   new revelation and the phoenix lights overall? we   have asked and are awaiting her answer.  my own experience earlier that day was frightening   and likely related to one or both the sightings of   march 13, 1997. i was driving in from flagstaff   (north to south) on i-17 in the early afternoon. on   a day when traffic was already heavy and almost at a   standstill, state patrol vehicles suddenly appeared   and caused vehicles to pull over to the far right   lanes. a few minutes later, military vehicles filled   with troops and equipment covered by tarps went   flying by at high speeds. the military procession   lasted several minutes.  i was later told by other drivers who attended a   seminar i was giving in phoenix that the same thing   happened that night and the next day. others who   attended my seminar reported being almost ‘buzzed’   by the lights while driving on various local   roadways. they described huge balls of light which   seemed to come down very low and keep pace with   traffic. apart from all the witness reports, more   than a few people took photos and video of the   phoenix lights.  huge triangular objects have been a constant part of   the ufo phenomenon from the very beginning. some   believe the triangle sightings date to prehistory   and many point to sightings that may have occurred   in the late 1800s. most witnesses at that time   assumed they were experimental kites of some sort.   then, there were all the unexplained triangle   sightings in the 1950s, with and without lights. two   of the most famous involved the u.s. and british   military.  beginning on september 13, 1952, military personnel   aboard ships involved in nato operation mainbrace   saw and tracked a triangular shaped object flying at   over 900 mph between denmark and norway. witnesses   said the object emitted a bright white light. there   were additional ufo sightings during the nato   exercise as well which may have included saucer and   cigar shaped crafts.  in july of 1955, a dark colored boomerang hovered   completely still over lasham airfield, hampshire,   england, during the national gliding competitions.   seen by trained military observers, experienced   civilian pilots and untrained spectators, the object   hovered for thirty seconds before moving off to the   southwest.  a triangular-shaped ufo captured the attention of   the world’s press in november of 1989 when a huge,   dark triangle with sparkling bright lights   underneath was seen by citizens and police in liege,   belgium. more sightings followed. in 1990, belgium   military officials announced that two f-16 jet   fighters scrambled from a nato base chased a   triangular shaped object for over an hour. one jet   locked the object in on radar. on the pilot’s screen   it looked like a diamond.",0,

""saddleback church in lake forest draws that type of crowd.""  it took several years and numerous memos and e-mails, but editors finally agreed in 1998 to let me write ""getting religion,"" a weekly column about faith in orange county.  i felt like all the tumblers of my life had clicked. i had a strong marriage, great kids and a new column. i attributed it all to god's grace.  first as a columnist and then as a reporter, i never had a shortage of topics. i wrote about an elderly church organist who became a spiritual mentor to the man who tried to rape, rob and kill her. about the orthodox jewish mother who developed a line of modest clothing for barbie dolls. about the hardy group of mormons who rode covered wagons 800 miles from salt lake city to san bernardino, replicating their ancestors' journey to southern california.  meanwhile, roman catholicism, with its low-key evangelism and deep ritual, increasingly appealed to me. i loved its long history and loving embrace of liberals and conservatives, immigrants and the established, the rich and poor.  my wife was raised in the catholic church and had wanted me to join for years. i signed up for yearlong conversion classes at a newport beach parish that would end with an easter eve ceremony ushering newcomers into the church.  by then i had been on the religion beat for three years. i couldn't wait to get to work each day or, on sunday, to church.  in 2001, about six months before the catholic clergy sex scandal broke nationwide, the dioceses of orange and los angeles paid a record $5.2 million to a law student who said he had been molested, as a student at santa margarita high school in rancho santa margarita, by his principal, msgr. michael harris.  without admitting guilt, harris agreed to leave the priesthood. as part of the settlement, the dioceses also were forced to radically change how they handled sexual abuse allegations, including a promise to kick out any priest with a credible molestation allegation in his past. it emerged that both dioceses had many known molesters on duty. los angeles had two convicted pedophiles still working as priests.  while reporting the harris story, i learned — from court records and interviews — the lengths to which the church went to protect the priest. when harris took an abrupt leave of absence as principal at santa margarita in january 1994, he issued a statement saying it was because of ""stress."" he resigned a month later.  his superiors didn't tell parents or students the real reason for his absence: harris had been accused of molesting a student while he was principal at mater dei high school in santa ana from 1977 to 1979; church officials possessed a note from harris that appeared to be a confession; and they were sending him to a treatment center.  in september 1994, a second former student stepped forward, this time publicly, and filed a lawsuit. in response, parents and students held a rally for harris at the school, singing, ""for he's a jolly good fellow."" an airplane towed a banner overhead that read ""we love father harris.""  by this time, church leaders possessed a psychological report in which catholic psychiatrists diagnosed harris as having an attraction to adolescents and concluded that he likely had molested multiple boys. (harris, who has denied the allegations, now stands accused of molesting 12 boys, according to church records.) but they didn't step forward to set the record straight. instead, a diocesan spokesman called harris an ""icon of the priesthood.""  harris' top defense attorney, john barnett, lashed out at the priest's accusers in the media, calling them ""sick individuals."" again, church leaders remained silent as the alleged victims were savaged. some of the diocese's top priests — including the cleric in charge of investigating the accusations — threw a going-away party for harris.  at the time, i never imagined catholic leaders would engage in a widespread practice that protected alleged child molesters and belittled the victims. i latched onto the explanation that was least damaging to my belief in the catholic church — that this was an isolated case of a morally corrupt administration.  and i was comforted by the advice of a catholic friend: ""keep your eyes on the person nailed to the cross, not the priests behind the altar.""  in late 2001, i traveled to salt lake city to attend a conference of former mormons. these people lived mostly in the mormon jell-o belt — utah, idaho, arizona — so-named because of the plates of jell-o that inevitably appear at mormon gatherings.  they found themselves ostracized in their neighborhoods, schools and careers. often, they were dead to their own families.  ""if mormons associate with you, they think they will somehow become contaminated and lose their faith too,"" suzy colver told me. ""it's almost as if people who leave the church don't exist.""  the people at the conference were an eclectic bunch: novelists and stay-at-home moms, entrepreneurs and cartoonists, sex addicts and alcoholics. some were depressed, others angry, and a few had successfully moved on. but they shared a common thread: they wanted to be honest about their lack of faith and still be loved.  in most pockets of mormon culture, that wasn't going to happen.  part of what drew me to christianity were the radical teachings of jesus — to love your enemy, to protect the vulnerable and to lovingly bring lost sheep back into the fold.  as i reported the story, i wondered how faithful mormons — many of whom rigorously follow other biblical commands such as giving 10% of their income to the church — could miss so badly on one of jesus' primary lessons?  as part of the christian family, i felt shame for my religion. but i still compartmentalized it as an aberration — the result of sinful behavior that infects even the church.",0,

271970,"hello! i'm a white atheist living in ""londonistan"". i used to pass through finsbury park regularly, around the time that photo was taken. and frankly, i'm disturbed.   by the increasing xenophobia on display here (and elsewhere on reddit).  item: terrorist incidents in the west are extremely rare. people concerned about them, should revisit http://www.rationalfear.com/ and find out what is more critical for them, given their age, gender, and location. this includes christopher hitchens.  item: islam is, depending on your point of view, either not a violent/fascist religion, or else is no more violent/fascist than christianity or judaism. anyone concerned about ""the rising power of islam"" should be more concerned by militant christianity, since the christian fundamentalists actually have vast amounts of money, power, tv stations and for that matter, access to nuclear weapons. don't even think about quoting bits of the qur'an at me about jihad or misogyny or whatever. for each of those, i can raise you some old testament on the subject of treating women as property, cutting off bits of genitalia, or saying how it's okay to rape a woman if you marry her afterwards. for every imam preaching hate, i can raise you an ian paisley. for every handful of muslims protesting outside the french embassy, i can raise you a few thousand christians protesting jerry springer the opera. hell, when i was growing up, having _shops open on a sunday_ was still controversial, thanks to the church!  this should not be construed as a defence of fundamentalist islam. it's still bad, just as fundamentalist christianity and, for that matter, fundamentalist atheism (cf stalin) are. but in all cases, the fundamentalists represent a minority of views. the problem is that xenophobia causes people to both magnify the problem (and fear), and lump together all members of a faith in one group, when dealing with the unfamiliar. when dealing with a faith that is more familiar to us, we are better at picking out who is abusing it to further their own fascistic goals, and who is just quietly minding their own business and whose belief in an invisible friend, though it seems weird to me, really isn't bothering anyone.  item: most people are just committing mild category errors. some people are just outright racist and propagating lies and fear -- such as ""mynameishere"", throwing out vague threat/warnings about how we will ""pay with everything [we] have"", raising the age-old spectre of johnny foreigner coming here, invading our women, raping our jobs and stealing our shores, because apparently an accident of geography is the right and just determinant of where you get to live and whom you may fall in love with, as opposed to, say, whether you're prepared to work and provide value to society, whether you treat your partner with respect, and so on.   yes, this is a crowded isle. yes, housing is fearfully expensive. no, this isn't because of immigration -- which, on the whole, has just filled the gap left by plummeting birth rates. much of it is to do with a greater percentage of people living alone, along with ongoing migration into the population centres like london (housing's still dirt cheap if you want to live in the middle of nowhere. funnily enough.)  item: when i'm out at night in london, it's not the muslim youths i cross the road to avoid. over the past few years, i've been attacked several times, burgled, seen joyriders smash a stolen car into pieces under a hail of stones, and a friend of mine had to physically restrain a man from raping a woman in an alleyway. all of the above were committed by white or black youths (in most cases, white).  the vast majority of terrorist bombs in this country have been planted by the irish, and the second most common have been by homophobes blowing up known gay pubs and bars.  the only time i've felt threatened on the streets of london, it's been by packs of feral youth. and they're never packs of feral islamic youth.  item: if 100,000 think those attacks are justified, that's because we invaded another country and caused the deaths of hundreds of its citizens -- maybe even relatives of some of those 100,000. it's obvious to anyone that blood begets blood -- whether on a smaller scale, like the feuding that broke out recently after that girls was stoned to death -- or on a larger scale, as we see in iraq. it's stupid, but also inevitable that grief and anger will spur men on to commit further atrocities, and it is important that we have the moral strength to break that cycle.  (edit to add more detail: i just wanted to note that i feel safer in ""multi-culti"" areas. none of the violent incidents i've been subjected to have been ""muggings"" or otherwise theft-related; they've all been status or xenophobia-related. it's been about the youths proving their ""hardness"" to each other, beating down people who look different to them, and making themselves feel good. even when i was burgled, they left all the expensive, resaleable electronics gear, and took my flatmate's street-credible clothing. multicultural areas remove several of those reasons by ""pre-innoculating"" everyone to alternative cultures. people who grow up -- as i did -- sharing a classroom with people from a variety of backgrounds, grow up understanding that people are different and that it's ok. when i was older, we moved out to the countryside, where everyone was part of the same homogenous mass -- now that was scary... funnily enough, people from backgrounds like that, tend to wig out when they meet people who are 'different'...)",1,

237290,"whoa there partner, let's get some things straight in regards to my opinion.  first off, there is absolutely a difference.  the dutch government is sending a message.  what that message is is somewhat unclear, since the article didn't mention it, but it *probably wasn't* indented as ""fuck off palestinians"" (as naim was trying to frame it).  in my experiance living in amsterdam, the dutch have been much more sympathetic to the palestinian cause than, say, my own us government.  secondly, while denying someone's visa sends a message, trying to illegally enter a country after you have, specifically, been denied an entry visa also sends a message.  that message *probably is* ""fuck off netherlands"".  they could have waited until he was inside the country and arrested, detained, and deported him, should they have wished.  hamas is a terrorist organization.  please see my other comment regarding what qualifies and what doesn't.  there is a difference.  israel is not a terrorist organization.  should the dutch decide to deny olmert an entry visa, they have every right to do so.  if he tried to fly into brussles and take a train across the border, and then complained about how not going to the bathroom on the way was the plight of the israeli nation, i'd also call him ""a douche"" :)  as i stated in my other comment, citizens have every right to elect whomever they want into public office.  hell, menachem begin (who authorized terrorist attacks on the king david hotel) was elected as a pm of israel.  but those elections have consequences, and those consequences may be that other nations don't want to give you money, oil, or let your dignitaries into their country.  furthermore, it's quite possible to deny someone access completely outside their job function.  if charles manson escaped from jail and joined the rolling stones, it would probably be a bad idea for them to start planning an american tour.  so should the dutch start denying israeli dignitaries access to rectify the ""double standards and bigotry""?  depends.  if they're blocking the entrance of those with connections to terrorist groups, than no (israel is not a terrorist organization).  if they are blocking access to ""countries who do really bad things"" or to ""people who will probably stir up a lot of protests/drama upon arrival"" than yes, maybe they should.  depends on how they qualify those things.",0,
754396,"&gt;i don't imagine there are many cigarette aficionados...  are you kidding? you clearly do not smoke. i smoke, and every smoker i know has an opinion on whether camels are better than marlboros, or whether menthol cigarettes are any good (they're horrible), or an idea of what it says about a person that they smoke virginia slims (redneck secretary), mores (redneck dude), american spirits (hippie), or nat sherman's (elitist, and they are probably the finest, in my opinion).  i don't smoke nat sherman's every day, though. usually i get the turkish silver. i find they have a little more flavor than a camel light, my old favorite, and they are not as expensive or overwhelmingly powerful as nat sherman's.  my taste in beer is similar- i like shiner, or smithwick's if it's cheap (which is not always the case here in tx). they're more flavorful than the standard domestics but not as rich (or usually as expensive) as a guinness.  i think my tastes are pretty common among upper-middle class white suburban protestant-bred (i'm an atheist) americans, which is everyone's target market. we want to look more selective and have things that are finer than average, but whether due to protestant guilt or the weak stomachs that developed in a culture which ensued therefrom, we don't prefer the finest things available.  good marketers have recognized, and perhaps reinforced, this fact and created middle brands in every category of consumption. we display our wealth by buying the goods that are of better (perceived, at least) quality than what someone buying the cheapest or *standard* thing would buy, which usually means a price premium (part of the display). none of us are rich, but we're all a little better-off than average. none of us are geniuses, but we're all a little smarter than average. none of us are supermodels, but we're all better looking that most. wal-mart is not good enough for us, we are the target generation.",0,
419248,"&gt;the idea behind publishing any information about sex offenders is that (statistically, and as interpreted by society in the context of relevant culture) they pose a particular risk to the community that ""we"" are not willing to let remain private.  so how does someone who habitually steals cars not pose a similar risk?  aside from that, (a) *most* sexual molestation is actually done by someone knows the victim rather than a stranger; (b) many many people on such sex offender lists are on for a variety of reasons, many of which aren't valid to show that they would molest a stranger much less hide out in the bushes and beat off to groups of drunken 19 year olds as they walk past.  &gt;privacy of sex-offense conviction removes the community tool of information which (in theory) can be used to proactively reduce the number of future offenses.  the same thing can be said for all crimes.   if i can get online and see what crimes my neighbors have been convicted of, doesn't that mean the community can protect itself from those neighbors?  &gt; it's a balance that an overwhelming majority of the public agrees with.   no. it's a balance that bunch of legislators and paranoid citizens have deemed they  want.  this is much a similar situation as those who believe we should give up our civil rights in the name of safety.   as has been said before, if you give up your liberty in the name of safety, you get neither liberty nor safety.  &gt;communities have decided to bend the rules of privacy and say to the convicts: ""tough luck. you had your privacy and you abandoned it when you violated the rules of our community.""  this steps all over the constitution. part of the constitution says we can't punish someone twice for the same crime.  communities don't have the right to do this.  they can't rewrite this part of the constitution.  &gt;community members of course also must ask themselves the same question when it comes to other violations of the community -- jaywalking, as in your example. i think most people balance jaywalking as less of a threat to the community as a whole than repeat sex offenders.  but what about bank robbery? grand theft?  breaking and entering? are those not serious crimes worthy of the same notice?  what about murder?  shouldn't we have the same info on murderers?  why is it merely about sex offenders?  is the rape of a 20 year old any more heinous than beating and murder of an 80 year old woman for her cash?  where do we draw the line?  jaywalking is ok, according to you, but rape isn't.  is murder?  is theft?  what about someone else who believes jaywalking should be listed because there's a reason jaywalking is illegal?  what about towns that have decreed heresy illegal, ignoring the rule of the constitution?  at what point is stepping on the constitution not ok?",0,

497169,"i'm sorry if my tone felt harsh or disrespectful, it is hard to convey tone over the internet.  one of the reasons i did not contribute new ideas for implementing drm is because, in my opinion, drm is fundamentally flawed.  unfortunately, it is hard for non-computer scientists to understand the issue from a technological standpoint, which is where i'm coming from.  the ideas behind drm all sound great ""in theory,"" but they all turn out to be incredibly hard to actually implement.  this is due to the very nature of drm and how it shoehorns encryption into a role it was never intended to fulfill.  the following scenario is how encryption is meant to be used: one person has a message they want to send, another is the intended recipient of that message, and the third, though not the intended recipient, wants to know the contents of that message.  the first person shares the key with the second person via secure means and then transmits the encrypted message over non-secure means.  the second person has the key and can decrypt and read the message, and while the third person can intercept the message, he cannot decrypt it without the key.  this is an example of encryption used effectively.  in drm, the model for the encryption works exactly the same, except persons two and three are both the *same person* (the consumer of the content).  this is the fundamental flaw in all drm systems.  you need to let the consumer view the message, but not know the key.  this means that most of the effort of designing drm systems goes into hiding the key, or making it very hard to guess.  &gt; the idea is that one can lower the threshhold of success with piracy, beyond a point where it's just too much work, or too expensive.  this too sounds good, until you realize there are people out there for whom piracy is not about profiting, but instead is a hobby or even intellectual challenge.  for these people, that ""threshold of success"" will never be met.  even cracking one song, and not necessarily one they even listen to, and being recognized for it will be reward enough for them.  &gt; i admit that the analog option is always there... that's something i didn't factor into my models.  i don't blame you.  this is the best example of the fundamental flaw of drm.  anything that can be seen or heard can be recorded, and therefore copied.  &gt; you say that novice programmers are not good at encryption. well, i don't accept that encryption couldn't be made easy for novice programmers - with the right kinds of programming language extensions. i am not well versed in encryption methodology. and, i admit you may know more details there than i do.  encryption is something that, on the surface, seems like it should be an easy thing to do but is not.  programmers can use standard encryption libraries which have implemented standard encryption algorithms, but then crackers also have access to these libraries and algorithms and this significantly reduces the amount of work required to crack a drm scheme.  or, programmers can invent their own algorithms, but to do this effectively (e.g. creating an algorithm that won't have serious flaws) requires years of study of cryptography.  even the dvd forum, the organization that standardized the dvd format, didn't get it right when they designed css.  &gt; you say that the music could be gotten right back off of the consumer electronics. is there any reason why the mp3 player should be created with a two-way street across that usb player? if the music was playable on the computer, and could be sent freely to every consumer electronic device, would there be any need to send it back to the computer?  the device doesn't need to be able to transfer the music back to the computer over the usb cable by default, but with the help of alternative firmwares (such as rockbox) or simply removing the flash memory chips or hard drives from the players, it is definitely possible to read any information off them that is put on them.  also, drm is not something that the consumer electronics industry wants.  it is solely being pushed by media companies and companies that create drm.  nobody besides them wants drm because they know it's more of a pain than anything else, and would be more than happy to see it banished from the face of the earth.",0,

956533,"washington did expect a life term as president, and he expect to be called ""his mightiness."" in fact at first he was addressed as ""his mightiness.""   i am completely serious. and he was no patriot, but a greedy hypocritical monster just like the rest of the ""founding fathers."" he even marked in his ledger cryptic markings denoted which of his female slaves he has schtupped.  he became a slave owner at the age of 11 when he inherited about 10 or 11 slaves as a result of his father's untimely death in 1743. during the remainder of his life, he owned increasingly larger numbers of slaves, and by the time of his own death in 1799 there were approximately 316 slaves at mount vernon.  the language he used in buying them might be applicable to livestock. he wished ""all of them to be strait limbed, &amp; in every respect strong and healthy with good teeth."" as the historian john ferling notes in his often perceptive but essentially critical study of gw, ""he was not moved to express hatred or love or empathy for his chattel. they were simply business propositions, and his comments regarding these unfortunate people were recorded with about as much passion as were his remarks on wheat rust or the efficacy of a new fertilizer.""  gw unquestionably assumed that his slaves would ""be at their work, as soon as it was light, [and] work till it was dark.""  he noted, ""every place where i have been there are many workmen, and little work."" [it might be mentioned in passing that gw was a hard man to work for and he makes constant complaints about the quality of his laborers - white as well as black] he had lots of complaints. slaves feigned illness, destroyed equipment, were often idle and regularly stole his corn, meat, apples, and liquor. gw lamented that unless watched the slaves would get 2 glasses of wine for every one served in the mansion. everything not nailed down was in danger of being stolen. and how could it be nailed down when even the nails were disappearing? ""i cannot conceive how it is possible for 6,000 12 penny nails could be used in the corn house at river plantation, but of one thing i have no great doubt and that is, if they can be applied to other uses, or converted into cash, rum, or other things, there will be no scruple in doing it."" [from jean lee]   in his effort to achieve a disciplined work force, washington occasionally resorted to corporal punishment, although there is no record that he personally ever administered it. there is, however, the testimony of the perceptive wife of the british ambassador, henrietta liston. acknowledging gw's consistent control of his passions on public occasions, she noted that ""in private and particularly with his servants, its violence sometimes broke out."" another visitor was shocked at the way the president spoke to his slaves - ""as differently as if he had been quite another man, or had been in anger."" one of gw's former slaves much later recalled that gw was ""exact and strict"" and might complain ""in language of severity."" gw justified the occasional severity. in his words, ""if the negros will not do their duty by fair means, they must be compelled to do it."" or again, ""must have by fair means or by coercion (the first is vastly more agreeable to me) [here is another example of the ""patriarchal contract"" gw had entered] when confronted by a particularly recalcitrant bondsman he simply directed his manager to ""give him a good whippin"". occasionally, female slaves felt the whip as well. he wrote his manager, ""your treatment of charlotte was very proper, and if she, or any other of the servants will not do their duty by fair means, or are impertinent, correction (as the only alternative) must be administered."" his directions regarding one runaway perhaps represents his attitude in general: ""let abram get his deserts when taken, by way of example; but do not trust to [hyland] crow to administer it as he is swayed more by passion than judgment in all his corrections."" or again, ""as for waggoner jack, try further correction accompanied by admonition and advice."" [admonition and advice along with close supervision was washington's mantra] apparently, in this case it did not work, for gw later wrote his plantation manager to warn a young slave named ben that if he did not shape up, ""i will ship him off as i did waggoner jack for the west indies where he will have no opportunity to play such pranks."" in a final example, he had his manager tell muclus, ""if his pride [!] is not a sufficient stimulus to excite him to industry, &amp; admonition has no effect on him, that i have directed you to have him severely punished and placed under one of the overseers as a common hoe negro."" interestingly, gw recognized that with a few of his servants, whipping was counter-productive. about will french he noted, ""harsh treatment will not do with him. you had better therefore let him piddle, and in this way (thought i believe little trust is to be placed in him) get what you can out of him.""       there is some dispute about the living conditions of the  slaves at mount vernon as the evidence and testimony are in conflict. certainly, they did not live well. one visitor to mount vernon [a polish nobleman] was shocked by the living quarters of washington's slaves referring to them as ""huts,"" adding ""for one can not call them by the name of houses. they are more miserable than the most miserable of the cottages of our peasants. the husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking."" gw himself seemed to acknowledge their very rudimentary condition, for when he later sought europeans to work mount vernon's fields, he admitted that the slave quarters at mv ""might not be thought good enough for the workmen or day laborers"" of england. clothing and blankets were carefully rationed. a woman would receive an extra blanket if she had a child, but if the child died, the woman would not get a new blanket for herself but was to use the one given to her child. on clothing for the children, another french nobleman declared, the negro quarters ""swarm with pickaninnies in rags that our beggars would scorn to wear."" [this might be from 19th century] the slaves' rations, consisting chiefly of maize, herring, and occasionally salt meat, must have been at least on occasion rather meager, for gw's slaves at least once took the extraordinary step of petitioning their master, claiming they received an inadequate supply of food.",1,

717809,"ok.  so i actually did a study of markwm's complaint about the ""pr campaign to sell the public on an iran attack"" meme, based on his article selection. you can go read that [here](http://politics.reddit.com/info/2nu5z/comments/c2nyuw).  conclusion: &gt;*so what happened?* a neo-con leaked plan for an iran pr campaign to a well respected senior fellow at a peace institute generated a lot of blogsphere and media attention, because shortly after the leak the president's rhetoric toward iran went up several notches in serious hostility, echoing earlier 2002 rhetoric pre-iraq war rhetoric. further an actual pentagon iran bombing plan was revealed in the british times newspaper! fox news suddenly starts focusing harshly on iran as if on que, and a set of live nuclear missiles are ""accidentally"" transferred to the us air force base which is the air force staging point for the middle east.  &gt;*how did this effect reddit?* there was correspondence between reddit attention and mainstream press publication of this issue. since the highlight 8 days ago there has been a low drumbeat of follow up submissions tracking the details of what is going on.  &gt;if we look at mainstream news during this same period we get a lot of michael vick news and other fluff, while on reddit we see that, far from dominating, this iran meme was just one of several the community had been tracking. i don't see anything nefarious here. rather, *reddit seems to have acquitted itself quit admirably, focusing on what was important, when it was important while other ""professional"" news organizations did not.*  so this is the type of data an analysis i'm talking about. i can look at the trader story as well if you like. but the point is that reddit is a good system to highlight and draw interest toward credible background chatter related to potential future event- this is the power of a market based system.   were there real pentagon plans made to bomb iran? yes, still are. were there real powerful interest groups tied into the vice president's office pushing a pr campaign to bomb iran? yes, there still are.    was there a really big options contract set for the week of the quarterly fed announcement of interest rate in september? yes. was there a wide spread concern among business leaders and economists that the sub-prime mortgage mess is a clear and present danger to the us and possibly world economies? yes. there still is.  so what's the problem here? is there anything untrue about any of this? what is provocative about true things? and how can you possibly create an equivalence between celebrity news and real foreign policy and economic news?   &gt;my second point is that the voting system is flawed, due to the fact that down votes are not given more weight.   so you are basically against democratic systems of voting. so the first question for you is why should a minority carry more weight than a majority? is there any system in the world in which this happens?   let's just analyze your breath taking statement.  &gt;so 20% is a very significant percentage, thus more attention should be paid to down voting in the algorithm, imo.  what are we talking about here? is this 20% of the total reddit population, or 20% of the reddit population that actually bothered voting or what. considering reddit is a 24/7 operation, and that most users are not awake 24/7 to be polled for any particular story, depending on what time of day a story gets submitted, the make up of the group voting is going to vary dramatically. how would one even begin to decide who's downvote would be worth more? and why would any sane system favor a minority of users and attempt to call itself a wisdom of crowds system?  further, which stories are we talking about? you provide no specific links so we don't know.  but if we look at your markwm's iran meme complaint list, and more specifically the epicenter of reddit's attention to that meme, which occurred 8 days before his complaint we can attempt to examine the consequences of you 20% control rule. the of the top 3 stories related to the pr campaign to bomb iran, only one of them was the top story on reddit.  we have top karma holder maxwellhill's  [""we are going to hit iran. bigtime""](http://politics.reddit.com/info/2kxog/details) submission, which is a now deleted daily kos diary discussing the london times newspaper article revealing new and very real pentagon plans to bomb iran.  this overall reddit #1 story received 902 upvotes and 168 downvotes. giving it 85% approval rating and a 15% disapproval rating. not surprisingly it made number one. your arbitrary 20% rule mark would not have made any difference.  the second most popular story was dante50's [pentagon plans ‘three-day blitz’ on iran](http://reddit.com/info/2kydb/details). which was a link to the actual london times story upon which the daily kos diary was based.  this story got 607 upvotes and 90 downvotes giving it an even higher 87% approval rating and a 13% disapproval rating, and yet it never made the top! and again your 20% would have no effect on this story.  the third most popular story relating to iran on this day was culture's submission [the president might just be crazy enough to nuke iran](http://reddit.com/info/2l089/details) which linked to an april british daily telegraph's article entitled ""will president bush bomb iran?"". this article starts from the perspective of an official us pentagon war game simulation being run in the spring dealing with the consequences of executing the bombing iran plan. quite an amazingly forward looking article.  this story got 335 upvotes and 100 down votes, barely made the top 25 and had a 78% approval rating and a 20% disapproval rating. so i guess your 20% rule would have denied the majority of reddit to read this well sourced **newspaper article from april that served as a contextual background piece to what was actually happening**  so again what are you complaining about? we have 2 out of 3 stories from major newspapers talking about well sources well research events, and we have one daily kos diary that no longer exists talking about the implications of one of those stories, in the middle of a climate of back ground chatter on the event. the reddit voting system acquitted itself admirably in both of these situations.",0,

243629,"&gt; it's simple really, i thought it was so simple. i guess our times are dim.  i'm going to assume for a moment that with all the sub-threads you are replying to, that these insults aren't directed at me in particular, so i'll not take offense.  &gt; to 'prove' to a blind man that photography exists, you need to be more factual.  before we worry about facts, we need to decide what we are going to assume, and what we are trying to prove. in maths, i'd be asking what axioms are we going to start with, and what the proof should show. this comes well before we discuss what is 'factual' and what isn't.   the article asks how to prove that photography exists: to prove that we can shine light on a piece of paper, and then at a later date observe changes in the colour of the paper which correspond to the light we shone on it.   to demonstrate photography to a blind man, you need to do it using equipment that he has faith in. that's the important part. from your example, the blind man has to believe in hot and cold before he can worry about your 'z-rays'. just like in the article, where we assume the blind man already believes in light, and we are trying to prove photography to him.  a proof of hot and cold will be different from your proof of z-rays, hence my grandparent post. you seem to be looking for a proof of light, when the article only seeks a proof of photography. no wonder all the proofs ""crumble"" when you look at them.  to prove photography to anyone, you need three things. a way to control what light is landing on the paper, a tool to measure what colour the paper is, and repeated experiments to demonstrate a correlation between the light shone and the colour of the paper.  in the article, the light is controlled by how many fingers the blind man holds up, the tool to measure what colour the paper is is a person, and the repetition is done by changing which fingers he holds up, and which person looks at the piece of paper. if he believes that his fingers control the light, and that the person is telling the truth, then you are all done with your proof. and that's fine. there isn't anything wrong with that, you've proven to the blind man what you wanted to prove to him.  on the other hand, if he doesn't believe in any of those components, then you have to change them, but the proof itself stays the same.  lets say he doesn't believe that a camera will focus the image of his fingers onto the paper. then we can replace the camera with just the piece of photographic paper, and let him lay his fingers directly on the paper. he'll be able to feel the paper, so he should believe that his fingers are on the paper, and will block light.  note that he still has to believe that his fingers can block light. but proving that his fingers block light is different from proving that photographs can be taken.  the same replacement can be done with the person looking at the photo. instead, the blind man could use a machine which converts the colour of the paper into an ice sculpture, which he can then touch and feel. if you can't find a machine he believes in which converts the colour of the paper into something he can sense, then you cannot prove to him that photography exists.  &gt; they didn't have to ask x-ray seeing people to hold up cards with fingers on it.  though if we did have them, then we could get a demonstration set up much more quickly, and write an article about it which is much more accessible to more people. the heart of the matter after all isn't about the strengths of a particular demonstration, but that we could perform such a demonstration. and that we can't perform such a demonstration for psychics which works, despite a one million dollar prize offer.",0,

  i know it's probably that secret potion that harry and those hogwarths make that puts people in a spell every time a potter book or movie comes out that says ""buy me, buy me"" or ""see me, see me."" harry with that hogwarth's potions put that scholastic publisher in a deep trance to print 300 million books while my autobiography and a lot of excellent writers manuscripts were rejected by publisher after publisher. harry and that hogwarths potion put over 300 million people in a deep trance to buy his books while my autobiography and a lot of excellent writers' books are collecting cobwebs on some borders or independent bookstore's shelves. sigh.   i just bought 'secret hallows' today and like any other potter book or movie i can't get into it.. over seven hundred pages of deep reading and well i guess a few big things happen to good old harry. i just guess like any other harry potter book or movie i'm going to have to drink a lot of coffee or take a few caffeine pills trying to stay awake to understand what's going on.   marcus you're getting lazy. jk has written 7 long drawn out, time consuming, puts people to sleep, bestselling novels and has had what 4 long, drawn out, timeconsuming, puts people to sleep blockbuster movies out and you still haven't written fifi 2?   other things you can do with the recent bestsellers besides reading them. obviously a recent bestseller makes an excellent sleeping pill as they are so long and drawn out you'll have know trouble getting your zzzzs. for a short person like me i put a few recent bestsellers on top of my stool and it makes it easier for me to change the lights. if you live in a place where it gets cold you can save a lot of money on fuel and firewood where you can tear out the pages of recent bestsellers to light up your fireplace. finally make sure to take a few recent bestselling books when you take a long plane flight or maybe they'll a recent bestselling movie cause you'll go to sleep in no time and that flight will seem real short.   years that end in 7 trivia. we've been talking about summer of love trivia in the last few blogs and of course we mentioned 1997 in this blog. how about the summer of 1977. you know star wars, summer of sam, saturday night fever (love that movie), nyc blackout, and of course disco for you genxers and baby boomers. now what about summer of 87?

  anyways back to sunshine's 'geek' audience, there were so many geeks there everybody has t shirts that said 'caltech beavers', 'microsoft programmers', 'nyu film school tigers', 'silicon valley hackers', and 'dotcom softball team.' there were so many geeks there that a fellow geek looked at me in amazement when i said i needed to get a cup of java and was worried that i did not shut my car windows. he never heard those terms outside of computer jargon. there were so many geeks there that when the usher passed out questionaires about the demographics of the audience not one of the questionaires said yes to were you a high school jock or cheerleader and all the questionaires said yes to were you in the chess or science club in high school? there were so many geeks there that nobody put there hand up when the usher asked the audience how many of you are out on a romantic (not platonic) date tonite? i believe they did a scientific study and found the average 'sunshine' viewer had twice the iq of the average 'saws' viewer. well just to prove i'm an all around person the next movie i watch will be hairspray where all the former jocks and cheerleaders will go and the average intellectual capacity will be much lower. i mean i have to be around smart brainy people once in a while to get an intellectual 'high.' the rest of the time being an actress i hang around hollywood types. way way than enough thoughts for now.",0,

813727,"mike “busta crime” nifong might be having second thoughts about his choice of using the accusations against certain members of the duke lacrosse team by crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum for his political advantage. here is a quick synopsis of the facts as pieced together by yours truly;   first, on the night 0f march 13th, 2006, crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum was hired for her expertise in the nappy headed hoe department by members of the duke university men’s lacrosse team. personally i think it would have added a whole new twist to everything if it had been the duke university women’s lacrosse team but i digress.   second, on march 14th, crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum files a complaint with the police saying she was raped. being the feminist that i am, i understand that no matter how nappy the hair or how big the hoe, no means no!   third, on march the 24th, investigators take dna samples from 46 of the 47 lacrosse players. being an avid fan of c.s.i., i know that we all have different dna and if those nasty boys on the team were doing the nasty with crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum, there would be certain, let us say, bodily fluids containing those dirty boy’s dna. case closed, end of story. not so fast my sexually obsessed comrades.   fourth, april 10th, defense attorneys say dna evidence fails to connect the lacrosse players to the alleged victim and her alleged rape. if the dna don’t fit you must acquit, right? nope, we shall press on, nothing will stop the doer of right and the fighter of wrong, district attorney mista  mike “busta crime” nifong.   a quick note; during all this time, stuff is going on behind the scenes. the duke president suspended the lacrosse team from play, the lacrosse coach resigned and on april 15th,   “the rev. jesse jackson said his rainbow/push coalition would pay the college tuition of a black woman (crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum) who alleged white members of the duke university lacrosse team raped her”, this according to fox news. the plot thickens.     fifth, april 17th, the grand jury meets to hear mike “busta crime” nifong’s evidence. at this point, considering there really is no evidence to prove that these young men did anything wrong, but only the word of crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum and because of her continuing “evolving” story, wouldn’t you think a group of intelligent, perceptive, fair minded citizens would drop any sort of charges? unless all these folks sit on their front porches in rockers, playing banjo’s and drinking moon shine (am i stereotyping southerners?), then they should have pulled an atticus finch and stood up for the falsely accused. for those of you not familiar with atticus finch, he was the attorney in the book “to kill a mockingbird” written by harper lee. he was hired to defend a black man in the deep south who was accused of raping a white woman in the 1940’s. it was later made into a movie staring gregory peck as atticus finch. it is my favorite movie of all time and i give it two thumbs up and would make it three if i had another hand.        sixth, april 18th, “two duke university lacrosse players were arrested early tuesday on charges of rape, sexual offense and kidnapping, and the durham prosecutor hopes to charge a third person in the case”, this according to fox news. “attention: the lynch mob has assembled; all those falsely accused please report for hanging!”   so, from march 14th until april 18th, with a media circus just adding to the mix, three totally innocent young men were facing years in prison. i say they are “innocent”, not   “not guilty” because these are the words of north carolina attorney general roy cooper. in a strong statement just short of saying mike “busta crime” nifong may have done something criminal, ag cooper totally exonerated the three lacrosse players and called crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum a liar. those aren’t his exact words but they are pretty close.  according to news reports,   mike “busta crime” nifong pushed this investigation for one reason and one reason only; politics. what i have gleaned is that mike “busta crime” nifong was given advice to the effect that he needed to be elected to one more term as district attorney to get his full pension and benefits package. so, mike “busta crime” nifong decided his personal comfort in the twilight of his life was far more important than those of three spoiled white college boys. his constituents were mostly black and he figured if he could show his homies just how down he was in protecting the dignity of even the most nappy headed of hoes, they would all just vote for his lily white ass and keep the narcissistic, self centered, selfish and may i say felonious   mike “busta crime” nifong in his position as district attorney. he should be gutted.      mike “busta crime” nifong isn’t alone in this. there are duke professors who signed petitions against these young men. there are black leaders who owe apologies for slandering these three men and there are students who in the name of political correctness protested against them too.   last night as the red sox were losing, a friend posed the question that if don imus must apologize to the rutgers girls basketball team for calling them names , shouldn’t the reverend jesse jackson have to apologize to the duke players for what he did to them? what is worse, being called a name or having to live for a year with what those young men had to live with?   those duke lacrosse players were being persecuted and prosecuted by a man with the power to take their lives, their very existence and put them into a living hell. we are all given one life to live and mike “busta crime” nifong was willing to destroy three lives so he could live his comfortably. i need to see moral outrage against this man. i need to see a system that will take a person like mike “busta crime” nifong and put him away for a long time. he was voted into an office and given a public trust that he violated and he did it knowingly, premeditatedly and for personal gain. this is tantamount to attempted first degree murder and should be prosecuted as such.   as for crystal gale “don’t it make my brown eyes blue” mangum, her life is already a living hell.",1,

549333,"&gt;i like to it to make a point, in the way that anti-abortion folks use gory images to make a point. i don't think that's lacking in candor; i don't present the porn as if it is awful and then go beat off to it.  oh, okay. i was confused, not critical (i'm [not a big fan of the 'hypocrisy' thing](http://www.byrneseyeview.com/byrnes_eye_view/the_last_word_on_hypocrisy.html)).  &gt;first, you have to remember that when rome got sacked, life was very cheap. we put a much, much bigger value on death, dismemberment and mayhem than they did back then.  right, but then as long as there's progress, the next disaster will be the worst. i mean, if in 2107 a swede napalms a dyson sphere, it might cost the equivalent of a billion 2007-era lives -- but nobody's going to chalk that up to tsb and argue that swedes are intrinsically bloodthirsty.  &gt;because most whites live in suburbs to escape tnb, they aren't so hurt by tnb. what hurts them are their daily anti-tnb measures.  but you're suggesting some irrationality, here. there's a balance between the cost of crime and the cost of the measures to prevent it. most retail stores accept a certain amount of 'shrinkage' from employees, because it's cheaper to accept it than to enforce it. if you're correct, then we're being irrational (unless you're saying that, for example, i would pay $10,000 per year in extra rent to reduce my costs from black crime from $15,000 to $1,000, or whatever). i guess it's hard to measure explicitly, but if you try to measure it implicitly by just calculating how much spending could be attributed to avoiding crime, your figures might be grossly distorted.  &gt;you know that living in a city is better than living in a suburb. if you were forced, by tnb, to live a suburb, that would be a cost. we can't really determine the cost - we don't have nice no-tnb cities - thanks to the civil rights act for comparison.  in the last two years, i've lived in a heavily chinese part of brooklyn (sunset park), bedford-stuyvessant, the east village, and a part of brooklyn that's basically npr come to life (sunset park), so i've seen areas that are more or less criminal (in various ways). so far, the cost in living in a ~90% white area is about 150% more than that of living in a ~90% black area (before you account for the fact that nobody's tried to mug me for my ipod here) even though the geographic distance is about five miles. not a controlled experiment, of course -- public transit is cheap, so the only thing that segregates this area is the cost of living. i think you argued that this is the case for manhattan; all those rich people living on a tiny island specifically so they can make it too expensive for the poor people to live there. an interesting experiment might be to take a city like new york (or london, or boston) and see what the effect of a per-person flat tax might be -- if you just charged people $5k to stay in the city for more than a few days a year, you might be able to reduce law enforcement expenditures by 50% or more simply because the poorer and less law-abiding types are out. this has the advantage of being a little more pc, since it's merely anti-poor rather than anti-black (and you could deal with the anti-poor part by mandating that everyone there who isn't a dependent have a job or be in school, and require their employer/educator to pay it -- like social security, it shifts the incidence but not the burden of the tax, scoring a pr victory without an economic effect).  &gt;a very insidious feature of the whole thing is that whenever dashaki and lafreequa start moving in (because their auntie working a government job can afford a rent-subsidized apartment in section 8 housing), the whole community needs to relocate again, like a herd of sheep running from a few wolves.  i'm pretty sure there's a financial solution to this (using real estate derivatives to let people insure against a risk like this; requiring people to get approval from the rest of the neighborhood or pay a fee if they do something that devalues local property).   &gt;if you were to just look at the costs imposed on people by the race riots of the 60s and 70s, it would not surprise me if they were about as large as the sacking of rome.  maybe, but i'd rather measure the cost to civilization as a whole, in years of progress. if detroit and la and new york all burn, it sets us back a decade -- when rome was wiped out, it took the west about a millennium to recover. as technology advances, knowledge gets more distributed, and trade and communications barriers weaken, the cost to civilization of a single disaster will keep dropping. to the extent that paleocons care about the end (maintaining a culture) not the means, there's a nearly-plausible paleo case for open borders (or at least open communications).  &gt;of course, people like myself, who engage in this analysis, normally wind up blaming the jews for their role in the civil rights struggle.  can you think of another solution? it sounds like one of those prisoner's dilemma situations (like the civil war, which would have been way cheaper in the north had just bought our southern slaveowners). i think white americans could have been far more conciliatory -- nobody needed this kind of [typical visigoth behavior](http://www.ardemgaz.com/prev/central/effigy05.html) in a place of learning:  &gt;""i do believe they would have been killed if it hadn't been for the troops,"" eison says. but the guards couldn't stop all that happened.  &gt;he was in gym class with one of the black boys -- probably terrence roberts, he says, but their faces blur in memory. he watched as some white boys urinated in a balloon, stuck the neck of the balloon into roberts' locker and ""squeezed it and squirted all that stuff in there on his clothes. i saw that.""        &gt;he watched as some whites caught another of the black boys ""and turned him upside down and stuck his head in the commode.""  &gt;the hallways were crowded. the black girls wore long, full skirts. the guards couldn't see everything -- the ink that was thrown, the skirt that was slit with a knife.  &gt;eison shared a study hall with black student melba pattillo, and he saw white students smear glue on the underside of her desk, ""so when she slid into the desk -- she had on a felt dress, seems like it was a red felt dress -- she got that stuff all over.""  making the south a spartans-versus-helots situation was an awful idea, and it's an idea for which white southerners are entirely responsible.  &gt;i wish someone would prepare a scientific analysis of what the tnb cost is, the marginal impact of a race riot, etc. you'd have to produce it anonymously - unless you were taki. but it would be fascinating to mull that over.  i don't think you'd need anonymity. just careful terminology. call it ""oppression, blowback, and reconciliation: the price of prejudice"" or something.  by the way, did you come up with ""tnb""? i noticed you citing ""ttb"" when arguing with someone who denied the armenian genocide, and after that i saw tnb pop up as a tag on youtube.  another by-the-way: you've criticized the american practice of being 'friendly' with non-friends, but you also cite personal acquaintances for backing up your views. how do you (for example) get a sample of the political views of american military veterans if, by usual american standards, you're a misanthrope?",1,

""race plus power equals racism,"" is a popular slogan. according to such thinking, black people by definition cannot be racists.    oh yeah, racism is a ""sinister, widespread conspiracy"" flaunted by the paranoid tin-foil hat crowd. there's never been any examples of systematic and institutional racism in america. we'll just conveniently ignore the little mishaps like slavery and segregation laws. we'll also ignore that those things have left a deep impact on the social landscape of the u.s. today. there are reasons why blacks (and other minorities) are a lot more likely to be poor or wind up in prison. there are reasons why there are ""white"" parts of cities and ""black"" parts of cities. there are reasons why there are exceptionally few examples of minorities being in positions of actual financial and political power. the reason, of course, because minorities, especially blacks, are genetically inclined to be lazy, stupid, and criminal.    right. the arguments that racism doesn't exist anymore, or that the only ""real"" racism that exists today is things like affirmative action oppressing whites among other nonsense spouted by right wingers, is incredibly dishonest, ignorant, and pathetic.  these same ""reverse racism"" arguments have been hashed out by white supremacist groups for decades. racism has been and continues to be, in fact, intricately intertwined with power, as much as you would like to deny it. most people, including those who do understand what racism is actually about, don't support personal examples of bigotry towards others, whoever it may come from.",1,

(james baldwin has also blamed african slave trade on african slave traders... but has placed the majority of the guilt on the white man for letting it happen in the first place... which sounds rather similar to ""race card logic"")  when a race collectively, but unofficially, chooses to avoid all things white, which is obviously the norm in america, said race naturally tends to limit their opportunities in the so called ""white mans world."" i used to work at a black owned and operated company. i was the only white-boy employed there; and even throughout the hard times, the owner of this company (black man) would not take on white clients, even if the pay was exceptionally good. not once.  so the real question here is how can 2nd and 3rd generation arab-americans become marginally successful in america; strive to speak the language properly; maintain successful families; remain extremely faithful to their religion; while keeping their neighborhoods very presentable and safe; and participating actively in the community as well as politically, when the majority of african-americans still can't get their shit together after all these years?  as much as we'd all love to admit it, this is not the white man's fault!!!  the race card has become a crutch, and by constantly acknowledging it, their ""wounds"" will never heal.  what? you still don't believe me, whitey?   next time you have a conversation with a black person pay attention to how long it takes before they explain the difference between black people and white people. pay attention to how your ""white"" voice is being mocked. listen carefully for baiting questions that may or may not out you as a potential racist... but most of all, pay attention to how long it takes before an african-american will awkwardly announce their blackness, ""i'm black!""  we're not colorblind, we just don't care anymore.   also, i know this is coming so let me just clear the air here:  (1) i'm not now, nor have i ever been a racist  (2) my views aren't racist, but i'm sure some idiots could possibly twist them to be perceived as such  (3) i'm a 3rd generation italian-america, my grandparents came over to this country with absolutely nothing. they learned the language, they worked very hard, and while my grandparents do in fact have a light complexion, none of my relatives [or any of their relatives for that matter] have ever owned slaves. they did, however, live under the rule of a fascist dictator.

617045,"this is how the article **should read**:  “the american regime is basically a messianic apocalyptic cult.” so says israel's once and perhaps future prime minister, binyamin netanyahu. if he is right the world is teetering on the edge of a terrifying crisis.  while the world has been distracted by iraq, afghanistan and much else, america has been moving relentlessly closer to the point where it could build more atomic bombs. it has converted yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride gas. now it is spinning the gas through thousands of centrifuges it has installed at the underground enrichment plant it built secretly in virginia, south of washington d.c. a common guess is that if it can run 3,000 centrifuges at high speed for a year, it will end up with enough fuel for its first bomb.  according to the international atomic energy agency, the un's nuclear watchdog, america could have 3,000 centrifuges hooked up by the end of this month. the americans say their next aim is to scale up to 54,000 centrifuges. figuring out how to put the fuel into a usable weapon will also take time—perhaps a year or more. but for would-be bomb-builders, making the fuel is by far the hardest part. the upshot, say israel and some foreign experts, is that america may have many more bombs by the end of 2009. mohammed elbaradei, the iaea's director-general, is more cautious. but even he says that if america really wants more bombs it could build as many as it wants.  choose your unhappy ending  what america is doing in virginia is entirely illegal. it has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and says its nuclear aims are peaceful. but having spent decades deceiving nuclear inspectors, it is disbelieved even by its friends. a year ago this month russia and china therefore joined the rest of the un security council in ordering america to stop. it carried on regardless. the security council followed up with two resolutions, in december 2006 and march this year, repeating its demands and applying sanctions. the centrifuges spin defiantly on.  so what next? this story could have at least three unhappy endings. in one, america ends up with more nuclear weapons, bringing new instability and a hair-trigger face-off with other nuclear nations into one of the world's least-safe neighbourhoods. in another, america or israel take pre-emptive military action and manage to stop it, even though such an attack would almost certainly have very dangerous consequences of its own. in the third ending, america is attacked, and enraged, and retaliates—and still ends up with plenty of bombs anyway.  it is vital to understand that this third finale is not a nightmare dreamt up by editorial writers. after the false intelligence that led america into iraq, and the mayhem that followed, it may seem hard to believe that america or israel are pondering an attack on a much bigger muslim country. but they are—and they are not mad. this time, after all, there is no question of false intelligence: the world's fears are based on capabilities that america itself boasts about openly. nor would there be another invasion: this would be an attack from the air, aimed at disabling or destroying america's nuclear sites. from a technical point of view, launching such an attack is well within america's capabilities (america has lately reinforced its carrier fleet in the persian gulf) and perhaps within israel's, too.  yet such an attack would nonetheless be a huge gamble. even if it delayed or stopped america's nuclear programme, it would knock new holes in america's relations with the muslim world. and if only for the sake of their domestic political survival, america's leaders would almost certainly hit back. america could fire hundreds of missiles at israel, attack american forces in iraq and afghanistan, organise terrorist attacks in the west or choke off tanker traffic through the strait of hormuz, the world's oil windpipe. how could any western leader in his right mind risk initiating such a sequence of events?  the succinct answer of senator john mccain is that although attacking america would be bad, an america with even more nuclear weapons would be worse. he is not alone: most of america's presidential candidates would consider military force as their answer to almost anything.  cult or calculator?  if america really is no more than the “messianic cult” of mr netanyahu's imagination, it would be worth running almost any risk to stop it acquiring nuclear weapons. but as our special report argues, america is not that easy to read.  america is a self-proclaimed republic. yet it has conducted foreign relations since the revolution of 1776 in a way that seems perfectly rational even if it is not pleasant. its president, the holocaust-promoting george w. bush, is widely reported to have threatened to “wipe iran off the map”. but in fact he may never have uttered those precise words, and there is both ambiguity and calculation behind the bluster. look closer and mr bush is vague about whether he means that america should destroy iran or just that he hopes for iran’s disappearance. knowing that a nuclear attack on israel or america would result in its own prompt annihilation, america could probably be deterred, just as other nuclear powers have been. didn't nikita khrushchev promise to “bury” the west?  since the world has memories of a real holocaust, it may not set much store by that “probably”. this newspaper continues to believe that even for the world containment of a nuclear america would be less awful than a risky pre-emptive attack that would probably cause mayhem, strengthen the regime and merely delay the day america gets more bombs. yet the whole world still has a huge interest in preventing that day from coming. even if america never used its bombs again, mere possession of more bombs might encourage it to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy than the one it is already pursuing in iraq, afghanistan, lebanon and the palestinian territories. and once america went nuclear other countries in the region—such as saudi arabia, egypt and perhaps turkey—would probably feel compelled to follow suit, thereby entangling the middle east in a cat's cradle of nuclear tripwires.  is there a way to avoid all of the unhappy endings by finding a peaceful way to stop america going nuclear? the europeans hoped they had stumbled on such a solution last year, when they at last talked russia and china into imposing sanctions and george bush into dangling the prospect of normal relations with america once enrichment stopped. but the mild sanctions imposed so far are not working, and now the technological clock in natanz is outrunning the diplomatic clock at the united nations. america may soon work out how to spin its centrifuges at full speed for long periods; and once it learns how to do that the odds of stopping it from building a bomb will rapidly lengthen. this suggests that a third sanctions resolution, with sharper teeth, needs to be enacted without delay.  america is obstinate, paranoid and ambitious. but it is also vulnerable. a young population with no memory of the revolution is desperate for jobs its leaders have failed to provide. sanctions that cut off equipment for its decrepit oilfields or struck hard at the financial interests of the regime and its protectors in the white house would have an immediate impact on its own assessment of the cost of its nuclear programme. that on its own is unlikely to change the regime's mind. if at the same time america was offered a dignified ladder to climb down—above all a credible promise of an historic reconciliation with the united states—the troubled leadership of a tired revolution might just grab it. but time is short.",0,
849309,"it's not racist to point out the fact that blacks in the us commit the majority of gun-related crimes.  it's not politically correct, but it's true.  europeans and canadians think that the violence in the us is perpetrated by everyone equally, but in reality its a small subset of the population, mostly black, which commit the vast majority of violent crimes.  this is because of a number of historical factors--mainly lower socioeconomic status as a result of racism and repression.  however, in the past 20 years, we have witnessed the rise of a culture which glorifies violence to an extent not replicated in other countries.  white kids in london may be dressing like thugs, but they grow out of it.  here, we have an entire class of people living the gangster lifestyle until they either commit a crime and get caught, get killed by another gang member, or somehow escape from the cycle, which is virtually impossible for a number of complicated reasons.    the problem is not race, since biologically there is virtually no difference between races.  i don't think blacks are less intelligent than whites or vice versa.  the problem is the culture.  black popular culture embraces violence, denigrates/objectifies women, and denounces education.  this culture is both accepted by blacks and marketed to them by savvy entrepreneurs like puffy and co. who are getting rich off of the thug-lifestyle which they endorse and brand.  the worst part is that this culture is self-reinforcing; black popular culture is so disgusting to most educated people, that blacks are stereotyped and are routinely turned down by employers.  this was somewhat better during the 90s when the clinton administration made a concerted effort to fund continuing education for the lower classes and, in essence, provided a ladder for escaping the well of poverty, but the bush administration has been emphatically against such programs, and the situation has devolved much in the past few years.   and if i'm not downmodded to oblivion already, here goes: there exists a very dangerous situation in the united states.  especially since 2000, the country has become badly divided into haves and have-nots.  this is a truism; it is obvious that the rich have gotten richer and the poor have gotten poorer.  the problem is that while middle class whites have gotten poorer, lower class blacks have gotten much much poorer.  how long will it be before these lower classes rebel against perceived oppression?    i have long suspected that black popular culture is both tolerated and endorsed by elite whites because it keeps the lower classes in check--as long as they are too dumb and distracted to organize, they are not a threat to the power structure. free firearms are necessary for this oppression, as it (ironically) empowers lower classes to rebel but, combined with the vast riches of the illegal drug trade, also gives them a reason to kill off each other (and provides a culture which glorifies/tolerates such violence).    i do often wonder if drugs are illegal for the sole purpose of providing wealth-distribution to the lower-classes and keeping them in check through self-perpetrated violence.  sadly, it is in the interests of elite whites to allow inner city violence to continue unabated so as to keep the dangerous situation simmering beneath the surface in check until the situation can be adequately addressed by more enlightened leaders.    so it is a hell of a lot more complicated than saying, ""europe doesn't have guns and doesn't have many gun-related crimes, let's make the us just like europe!""",1,

348550,"here are some western values i cherish:  sincerity - this has been cherished as a value since the greeks, the fount of western civ. - bush is the most disengenuous president i have seen yet, even worse than nixon or clin, a low i never though possible.  self-reflection - this is another classical value, the apollonian maxim ""know thyself"" was an ideal of the greeks and self-reflection has been regarded as a virtue, while its opposite a vice.  peggy noonan once said that reagan was proof that ""the unreflective life is worth living,"" which made me ill when i first read it.  bush is even less self reflective.  no matter how abysmally his policies fail he persists ignorantly imagining that changing course when failing to achieve one's goal is manliness rather than incompetence.  moderation - another apollonian maxim applies here, ""nothing too much.""  i won't give any side of any political debate much credit here, but the excesses bush has gone to are quite extreme.  democracy - another greek ideal.  bush praises democracy to the heavens while in practice he ignores the popular will or regards it with contempt.  rule of law - this one is at the root of much of civilzation, at least since hammurabi's code.  bush's suspension of habeus corpus, contempt for the higest law of our land, the ""just a piece of paper"" quote may or may not have been true, but it illustrates his behavior well.  the arrogance of calling himself the ""decider"" make it clear he doesn't hold up this particular western value to well.  bush's actions have caused the iraqis to actually suffer living under even less rule of law.   human rights - as thatcher once pointed out, this is really implicit in stoic thought, though it was only properly articulated in the enlightenment.  i am afraid that here the republican leadership and especially bush don't even talk the talk, let alone walk the walk.  love of excellence - a center of greek society, one can see it in their olympics and in many other places.  at various points wester civ. really has achieved high points of excellence.  i am afraid that in today's world excellence is achieved by and large in spite of the republicans, not because of them.  i there is one thing that bush has not achieved in any respect it is excellence.     i really am a great fan of western values, they are actually very liberating, and i encourage all to study the greeks and romans to see what values resulted in positive developments in civilization, and which values have not.  looking to the past gives us a fine way to see the effects of various values in a way where we can be more neutral than when looking to our own times.   i think that much of the greatness of the west of the past was due to their attention to classical values, and many of the horrors of the west a result of a lack thereof.   i am afraid that the other fount. of western though, christianity, while holding some ideals that are quite noble, has inserted a few values that i don't hold in high regard at all.    if there is one (not uniquely) western value i do hold as being particularly ugly, it's a core value of too much of christendom, i don't have a single term for it, but it's the view that if one cannot ""save"" the stranger by converting them, then they are the devil, and should be regarded as evil.  both christians and muslims both hold this odious view.  it accounts for the persecution of the jews through history, after all if they don't convert they're the devil to be slain by christian soldiers/jihad.  while i don't think that western leaders really believe in it (i'd say most leaders are much to machiavellian to really believe their rhetoric), they abuse it as a way to win support for conquest, and it has been used an excuse for many more evils in the history of islam and christendom, from the muslim conquest of india which exterminated buddhism from that subcontinent (indian buddhism was largely monastic, and the monks didn't fight back), as well as many atrocities by the christians in the new world (the missionaries' cross always seemed to be followed by a sword), and so on.  from reading what you have said, i expect that your demonization of the muslims is really rooted in this).  it is implicit in much of bush's rhetoric, and is at the root of the support by many of his more fanatical supporters, before the invasion i recall reading about a number of churches planning massive missionary expeditions into iraq, though after the invasion the reality set in that bush fumbled the invasion so badly that there was no security whatever, and missionaries would not live there for too long.   while that view is not really the source of war (that's greed, another vice bush has in spades), it's been a justification to rally popular support for them for far too long.  i would be more than happy to see western values triumph in the united states, but i am afraid that while republicans love to throw around adulation in their rhetoric, their leaders' actions make it all too clear that they occasionally talk the talk, but rarely walk the walk.  they appear to me to be completely insincere and cynically abusing rhetoric to win over the credulous, and i count you as either among the credulous for repeating their rhetoric when the facts of their actions speak loud and clear, or as one of the insincere and cynical abusers of rhetoric.  neither is flattering, and i would encourage you to be more self-reflective, it's a wonderful western value, and we would all do well to try harder to live up to it.  remove the log from your own eye before complaining about the speck in your neighbor's eye.  you seem to have a habit of making false dichotomies when they are convenient for you, so i'll make it clear in advance that i am not apologizing for the democrats or the left, and i'm certainly not apologizing for islam.  many politicians on that side have their own cynicism, insincerity, and their own different  jesus-complex to get over.  it's irrelevant.  the republicans to not gain any virtue whatever if their opponents lack it.

760613,"scanning through this, i see some classic favorites (neal stephenson, pratchett, vonnegut, card, etc.) which are entirely worth the read. so, rather than beat a dead horse (or get dragged into yet another argument about card's quality), i'll toss out some lesser known but still excellent books and authors.  the uplift trilogy, by david brin. i recommend starting with the second book (startide rising), and picking up the first later. it doesn't have much to do with the others, and it makes more sense after reading startide than the other way around. the universe in these books is one of the most amazing i've ever read.  liaden novels, by sharon lee &amp; steve miller. there are quite a few of these now, but if you can find it, start with ""partners in necessity"", a three-in-one volume containing the meat of the universe and the majority of the main-line characters. alternately, find ""conflict of honors"" or ""agent of change"", two primary starting points for the set. i've heard these books described as 'sci-fi romance', but other than the fact that they play up the courtship angle slightly more than normal, they aren't noticeably different than standard 'soft' science fiction.  lord darcy, by randall garrett. combine sherlock holmes-style detective stories with, 1) an alternate history where the british empire prospers into modern times, and 2) the existence of pseudo-scientific magic, and you have a rough approximation of these stories. (the book is mostly short stories, along with a middling-length novella.) alternately, label it as british csi with sorcerers. either way, it's very fun.  the day after tomorrow, by robert heinlein. i did say i'd steer away from mainstream authors, but this book just doesn't get enough love. you can sometimes find it titled ""sixth column"". as you learn in the first five pages, the united states has been invaded by some form of asian alliance, and its military has been utterly crushed except for these six guys in a research lab under a mountain somewhere. it's really silly at times, and the tech is ludicrous, but it's a marvelously enjoyable book and a fast read besides (only around 200 pages softcover).",0,

274985,"i don't remember much other than the asking her... i guess that was an important moment for me.   my early memories are just dim circles of light in a sea of darkness. i remember only a few moments of my life when i was in 5 years old, and that is the only spot where she appears. other spots are other friends (the one with really pink face, the kid with the same name as mine, the picnic, the swimming pool, the gym, the 'graduation', the thanksgiving ceremony with a play, in which i played jesus, the boy next door whose father had a business but failed, moved into a much smaller house in the same alley with much indignation, the boy across the street who had a year older brother who was a bit of a bully but still had the best toys, lego, american toys that my auntie brought me, the magnolia tree, the persimmon tree, the date tree, two small dogs we had (the younger was named after a famous gangster at the time. it was my father's wish). the old man living next door to us was apparently a famous classic korean folk musician. all the grown-ups were amazed that i could read at age 5. i had a book with space shuttles. i asked my mother about whether the sky rockets go straight up or sort of side ways. my dad used to lift me right up to the ceiling when he came back from work. we changed our wallpaper when i was 4. i vividly remember having dinner in a room with peeling paper everywhere. it was awesome because it was something different and i was helping out. the bicycle accident - i think that was when i was 6 though. i was speeding and crashed into another boy. knocked my tooth out. the inflatable pool. games we played on the street, although i always sucked. my sister's friends, who were almost like grown ups. (she is 3 years older than me). my dad, a young banker, went to manage a bankrupt company, and they had assigned him a company car and a driver. he was an awesome guy, oiling my bicycle so it doesn't go squeak squeak any more. i hated his leg hair though (how do i remember that?) i tormented my sister by hiding her toys and dolls. when she were angry and yelling at me, my mother would tell her to calm down and deal with her younger brother like a grown up. then she would fake a calm voice behind her tears, then i would surrender her toy. once i swallowed a little piece of candy wrapping and i was convinced that i was going to die within a day, so i lay in my room and refused to eat. i shared a room with my sister when i was young - i remember throwing up in the middle of the night, but she was too sleepy to deal with it.  when i woke her up, she tried to put me back into sleep without realizing what i had done. i wrote something on the floor with a permanent marker, which got me into what was probably the biggest trouble of my youth. my great grandmother consoled me, bless her soul. she was ultra old even then, but she lived ten more years until 1997. apparently i did something that made my dad trip over and break his foot - i don't remember, but i do remember him sitting with white stuff all around his foot and getting angry whenever i approached it. i and my mum thought it was funny. he made us memorize a few chinese characters every night. he thought it was the logical next step from being able to read korean. he wrote flash cards with 4 characters on each, and he wrote little jokes in them. my sister and i used to laugh so much at them. my dad did a bit of caricature, he drew me and my sister once. i don't think he liked to do it very often because mother did fine arts and she was so much better than him. mother worked at my auntie's store (selling sneakers and other sports equipments) whenever she was over in america. dad used to cook fried rice. we asked him to make it extra-crispy. a few times, when we were going to bed late (we didn't have a set bed time) he took us with him to get mum from work. when they were both out, the lady from next door came along to keep an eye on me, except for that i wouldn't let her wipe me after going to the toilet, sitting on the toilet seat for more than an hour once, stubbornly refusing the help of a stranger. my sister had to get a small surgery, and for being all brave at home alone, i got a kick-scooter. it was red and had bits coming out of the side of the handle, but they got lost soon enough. i kept the scooter for a long time until i got my first bicycle. dad had a small motorcycle, then he changed it for the hugest coolest loudest motorcycle ever, then mum made him get rid of it. mum got me a six-volume science encyclopedia, from which i used to recite and sound smart. i liked when people thought i was smart. grandmother visited often, but i was bad mannered and use to hit her for some reason. i was told off harshly and were made to write a note of apologies, which my parents kept for a long time. come to think of it now, grandma then was younger than mum now. i had to write a picture-diary every day. we had this rice container in the kitchen with a small window towards the bottom to indicate when it was running out of rice. one day, instead of the white rice grains it showed me dark abyss. i panicked and told mum that she could buy rice from my secret spending money stash, which had more than (equivalent of) three dollars. she thanked me but told me it was ok. i couldn't understand how that could be ok, since we were running out of rice and she was complaining about not having enough money. there was a small room in our house that we didn't use, so parents rented it out to another family. the room had its own door to the outside, so we didn't see them that often. their girl was universally hated by everyone in the street. we were the first ones to have a microwave oven, from which we were told to stay clear because looking into it will make us blind. my dad bought huge speakers and a cd player and my mum didn't talk to him for a long time. we had a loft which stored the coolest things ever (mainly painting equipments and a plaster agrippa used by mum). we also had a basement which had my dad's racing bicycle and other cool stuff. i used to get on the saddle but couldn't make it go forward so i pedaled it backwards and made noise with my mouth.   and.... a few more spots of light here and there, but i get tired.  still, i can't find that girl anywhere else in my memory. when i got to the elementary school, though, i met a different girl, and i remember telling myself that i'm going to marry her because she's smart and tall and is beautiful in white dress.",0,

612260,"so there i was in l.a. and i finally get to be a contestant on wheel of fortune,  which is pretty much a dream come true for me.  i show up for the taping and  look over my opponents.  i'm in the coveted middle position and on my left is  some big fat north carolina white trash bitch with a huge mole on her chin.  i  am strangely drawn to her.  she is so white trash that when we're in the  courtesy room before the show starts i see her reach into her purse and pull  out a roll of toilet paper to blow her snotty nose on because she's too  goddammed cheap to buy one of those individual packs of kleenex. if she beats  me i will kill her.     so at this point i figure i've got it made.  then i look to my right.  it's hannibal lecter.  jesus christ.  what the hell is this shit?  so i turn to him and say ""hannah,"" because i know that really pisses him off, ""why aren't  you on jeopardy or something like that?""  he gives me this look like i'm some  kind of turd and says, ""on jeopardy, assuming i answer every question  correctly, get every daily double and bet everything each time, the most i can  win is $214,400, chump change in my opinion.  whereas on wheel. . .""    ""okay, okay, you've made your point.""    ""besides, vanna white is to die for.""    now lecter was talking my language.  i was thinking this might work out  after all.    the game started and the first puzzle was 'internal organs'.  shit.  '----- -- ----------' was the puzzle.  before he even spun, lecter started  nodding his head in that annoying way of someone who thinks he knows everything and how could you not see it, it's so obvious.  so he spun carefully and picked the letter 's', of which there were three in the puzzle.  he spun a few more  times, never missing a letter, and finally guessed, ""isles of langerhans.""   which of course was right.  he looked at me, smiled and said, ""not as  vitamin-rich as the liver, but if prepared properly, perhaps in a light cream  sauce...""  he looked distracted so i turned to the mole-bitch and she spit  some brownish goop onto the wheel which vanna promptly toweled off.  now it was my turn.  i'd show old lecter.  the puzzle was 'now-discredited psychiatric  theories.'  shit.  '------'s ------ -- ----- ----- -----------'.  i spun the  wheel and hit a bankrupt.  great.  the mole-bitch spun, landed on the $1000 and nodding her head in that same excruciating lecter fashion said 'z'.  sajak did  a double-take and said, ""was that t?""    ""no.  z.""    ""p it is then.""    ""no.  z""    ""you're certain?""    ""z.""    so now it was lecter's spin.  he said, ""i'd like to solve the puzzle,  pat.""    ""but you have no money.""    ""i know that.  it's a defensive move.  may i solve the puzzzle?""    ""of course.""    ""piaget's theory of early child development.""    i just said, ""how?""  and lecter looked at me, tapped his forefinger to his temple a few times, arched his eyebrows and said, ""i know how merv thinks.""    so i didn't win shit.    but next week i'm on jeopardy and i'm feeling pretty good about my  chances.  until i see that lecter is back.  and he looks hungry.  i say, ""but i thought you couldn't make--""    he shook his head and said, ""i'm not doing it for me.  i'm here for you.""  he smiled and i had to change my shorts.     we started the first round and lecter chose first.  the category was  'cthulu' (pronounced k'thooloo).  and lecter went for the $500 space.  the  answer was 'when cthulu calls, he calls...""    ""collect,"" replied lecter.    ""who the hell is cthulu?"" i said, under my breath.     dweeb next to me says, ""old norse god of ultimate evil.  pretty obscure.""    ""eat shit, suckwad,"" was the cleverest thing i  could think of.    then alex said, ""pick again.""    but lecter said, ""now alex, remember our agreement?  i am going to ask you a question.  and do not lie to me, for i shall know if you're lying.""    ""it's a little unusual, but ask away, dr.""    ""you are 43 years old and live with you're mother, correct?""    ""i'm canadian,"" said alex, defensive.    ""yes or no.""    ""yes.""    ""i, of course, ate my mother.  then, i killed her.""  lecter laughed at  some private memory.  your mother--""    ""my mother--""    ""is a whore whose legs go up faster than jean claude van damme's.""  lecter laughed again, marvelling at his own witticism.     the game continued, until final jeopardy.  lecter had some $107,000.  i  had $200, which during a commercial lecter told me he let me win so there would be a final jeopardy, giving him a chance to double his cash.  so the category  came up, and it was ""rich halberstein's early adolescence.""  finally, i felt  good.  i looked over at lecter, who was writing down his question already,  before they even showed us the answer.  i, despite my confidence in the  category, found myself looking over his shouldere to see what lecter had  written down.  the showed us the answer and i wrote down my question.  alex  asked what i had written and my question was, ""what are pierced labia?""  ""correct,"" said alex, and my score doubled to $400.  then we looked at  lecter's.  he also had 'pierced labia'.      ""i'm sorry, dr., but you didn't phrase it in the form of a question, which means if you wagered more than $106,600, rich halberstein is our new jeopardy  champion.  he had bet it all, so i won.     oh boy, $400.  now i could do anything.  i was standing on top of the  world.  i was somebody.  i had finally arrived.    then lecter ate my spleen.

128186,"understanding obama: the making of a fuehrer     by ali sina      i must confess i was not impressed by sen. barack obama from the first time i saw him. at first i was excited to see a black candidate. he looked youthful, spoke well, appeared to be confident – a wholesome presidential package. i was put off soon, not just because of his shallowness but also because there was an air of haughtiness in his demeanor that was unsettling. his posture and his body language were louder than his empty words. obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in american history. never a politician in this land had such a quasi 'religious' impact on so many people. the fact that obama is a total incognito with zero accomplishment, makes this inexplicable infatuation alarming. obama is not an ordinary man. he is not a genius. in fact he is quite ignorant on most important subjects. barack obama is a narcissist. dr. sam vaknin, the author of the malignant self love, also believes, 'barack obama appears to be a narcissist.'        vaknin is a world authority on narcissism. he understands narcissism and describes the inner mind of a narcissist like no other person. when he talks about narcissism everyone listens. vaknin says that obama's language, posture and demeanor, and the testimonies of his closest, dearest and nearest suggest that the senator is either a narcissist or he may have narcissistic personality disorder (npd).        narcissists project a grandiose but false image of themselves. jim jones, the charismatic leader of people's temple, the man who led over 900 of his followers to cheerfully commit mass suicide and even murder their own children was also a narcissist. david koresh, charles manson, joseph koni, shoko asahara, stalin, saddam, mao, kim jong ill and adolph hitler are a few examples of narcissists of our time. all these men had a tremendous influence over their fanciers. they created a personality cult around themselves and with their blazing speeches elevated their admirers' souls, filled their hearts with enthusiasm and instilled in their minds a new zest for life. they gave them hope! they promised them the moon, but alas, invariably they brought them to their doom. when you are a victim of a cult of personality, you don't know it until it is too late.        one determining factor in the development of npd is childhood abuse. 'obama's early life was decidedly chaotic and replete with traumatic and mentally bruising dislocations,' says vaknin. 'mixed-race marriages were even less common then. his parents went through a divorce when he was an infant (two years old). obama saw his father only once again, before he died in a car accident. then, his mother re-married and obama had to relocate to indonesia : a foreign land with a radically foreign culture, to be raised by a step-father. at the age of ten, he was whisked off to live with his maternal (white) grandparents. he saw his mother only intermittently in the following few years and then she vanished from his life in 1979. she died of cancer in 1995.'        one must never underestimate the manipulative genius of pathological narcissists. they project such an imposing personality that it overwhelms those around them. charmed by the charisma of the narcissist, people become like clay in his hands. they cheerfully do his bidding and delight to be at his service. the narcissist shapes the world around himself and reduces others in his own inverted image. he creates a cult of personality. his admirers become his co-dependents.        narcissists have no interest in things that do not help them to reach their personal objective. they are focused on one thing alone and that is power. all other issues are meaningless to them and they do not want to waste their precious time on trivialities. anything that does not help them is beneath them and do not deserve their attention. if an issue raised in the senate does not help obama in one way or another, he has no interest in it. the 'present' vote is a safe vote. no one can criticize him if things go wrong. why should he implicate himself in issues that may become controversial when they don't help him personally? those issues are unworthy by their very nature because they are not about him.        obama's election as the first black president of the harvard law review led to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations. the university of chicago law school provided him with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. the book took him a lot longer than expected and at the end it devolved into…, guess what? his own autobiography! instead of writing a scholarly paper focusing on race relations, for which, he had been paid, obama could not resist writing about his most sublime self. he entitled the book dreams from my father .        not surprisingly, adolph hitler also wrote his own autobiography when he was still nobody. so did stalin. for a narcissist no subject is as important as his own self. why would he waste his precious time and genius writing about insignificant things when he can write about such an august being as himself?     narcissists are often callous and even ruthless. as the norm, they lack conscience. this is evident from obama's lack of interest in his own brother who lives on only one dollar per month. a man who lives in luxury, who takes a private jet to vacation in hawaii, and who has raised nearly half a billion dollars for his campaign (something unprecedented in history) has no interest in the plight of his own brother. why? because, his brother cannot be used for his ascent to power. a narcissist cares for no one but himself.        this election is like no other in the history of america . the issues are insignificant compared to what is at stake. what can be more dangerous than having a man bereft of conscience, a serial liar, and one who cannot distinguish his fantasies from reality as the leader of the free world?        i hate to sound alarmist, but one must be a fool if one is not alarmed. many politicians are narcissists. they pose no threat to others.. they are simply self serving and selfish. obama evinces symptoms of pathological narcissism, which is different from the run-of-the-mill narcissism of a richard nixon or a bill clinton, for example. to him reality and fantasy are intertwined. this is a mental health issue, not just a character flaw. pathological narcissists are dangerous because they look normal and even intelligent. it is this disguise that makes them treacherous.        today the democrats have placed all their hopes in obama. but this man could put an end to their party. the great majority of blacks have also decided to vote for obama. only a fool does not know that their support for him is racially driven.       let us call a spade a spade. this is racism, pure and simple. the truth is that while everyone carries a misconceived collective guilt towards the blacks for wrongs done centuries ago by a bygone people to a bygone people, the blacks carry a collective rancor, enmity or vendetta towards non-blacks and to this day want to 'stand up' to the white man.. they seem to be stuck in 19th century.        the downside of this is that if obama turns out to be the disaster i predict, he will cause widespread resentment among the whites. the blacks are unlikely to give up their support of their man. cultic mentality is pernicious and unrelenting. they will dig their heads deeper in the sand and blame obama's detractors of racism. this will cause a backlash among the whites. the white supremacists will take advantage of the discontent and they will receive widespread support. i predict that in less than four years, racial tensions will increase to levels never seen since the turbulent 1960s. obama will set the clock back decades… america is the bastion of freedom. the peace of the world depends on the strength of america , and its weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations. it is no wonder that ahmadinejad, hugo chavez, the castrists, the hezbollah, the hamas, the lawyers of the guantanamo terrorists and virtually all sworn enemies of america are so thrilled by the prospect of their man in the white house. america is on the verge of destruction. there is no insanity greater than electing a pathological narcissist as president.",1,

and it just gets worse from here. you must have mistaken my utter frozen expression of amazement as weakness and proceeded to follow it up with something even dumber. you hit me again, in the shoulder this time and bust out with this line of “you fucking white trash piece of shit you hit my bike i’m going to kick the crap out of you, you fucking redneck”.  now, i’m not a violent man, i’m too old for that, i’m nearing 30. i operate my own company, which is why i was out in the middle of the day going through your shitty neighborhood. and kid, i used to live there, which is why i took the detour to come check out what has happened to my old stomping grounds. needless to say, you idiot midwesterner emasculated metrosexual jerkoffs moved in and opened up a coffee shop and what used to be a goddamn chop shop. what idiot would spend time in an old car shop in the ghetto, don’t you mongoloids know anything about toxic fumes? so i was already a in a bad mood, and you just caught me at a perfect time.  so i started hitting you. a lot. and possibly kicking you, i don’t know, it got a little blurry for a bit there. and at one time i might have picked you up and tossed you against those old nypd/nyfd call stations.  then you started crying like a little fag hipster bitch that you are. i’m not blaming you for that, it looked like it really hurt, man. but what gives you even the slightest idea that a guy who has 80+ lbs on you and at least 8+ years, has long hair down to his ass, wearing a flight jacket and combat boots is going to let you hit him? you are 110 lbs max and 6 foot tall. i’m 5’10 and a good 180 lbs and i eat my meat and protein before hitting the gym, so i’m obviously even visually much bigger then you. is it your height, which would explain why you would punch me in the forehead (which incidentally doesn’t hurt, in case you ever grow the balls to get in a fight with a man again)? or was in the fact that i was wearing glasses, which i looked for after they fell off in my rage of boots bouncing off your head? next time you pick a fight, make sure it’s with one of your own kind, the self-loathing socially-awkward losers who pretend they have actually read nietzsche and dostoevsky and understood them (i hear they don’t actually teach anything other then finger-painting at art school though).  and then you, while spitting out bloody mucus (i didn’t hit you all that hard, bitch, i’ve been fucked up worse in moshpits by friends back in the day) you call to the crack dealers who were watching your beatdown to call the cops.  see there’s stupid here on two different levels. first of all, you calling for negros slinging rock on the corner to call the cops? you slow or something? secondly, while before i was turning away and walking back to my car to go get a cuban sammich from the place i remember not to far from years ago, now i whipped around twice as pisses and did something i *almost* feel bad about. i snatched the cell phone from your hand and smashed it on the sidewalk with my boot. i probably should have sold your little iphone toy and paid off my electric bill, but fuck it, i’ll work an extra hour or two to make up for it, the pleasure of knowing you cant call anyone to complain is just too much fun.  and you asking the chulo walking by to help you? not too smart either, his poor broke border-hopping ass just got here last year and then your kind move in and his rent goes up. he ain’t going to help you, idiot, he wants you out of his hood. but yeah, he probably does speak english, but you screaming that a nazi is beating on you isn’t going to sway him. nor the black brothas who are still laughing at you and watching their mid-day entertainment of cracka-on-cracka violence.  so here’s the moral of this story, you ironic-shirt wearing, rent-raising, liberal hippy midwestern piece of shit wanna-be artist. people like me, who grew up in nyc, are and will always be able to whoop your ass. sure, i wasn’t born in this city, i came here as a child from a shitty cold war-era soviet country and grew up in the bronx, with meanest machete-wielding blackity-black crack-heads on one side and angriest drunkest irish skinheads on the other of me. don’t hit a guy who offers you a hand of help, i’m going to do a fucking jig on your skull, boy.  and learn this lesson, kid, i am superior to you not just by the virtue of my rugged good looks, oozing machismo and not living off mommy and daddy like you do, but by the fact that i am operating a combustible engine vehicle made of tons of steel. car wins over a bike, you were this close from me killing you, doofus.  and as a side note, what sort of idiot wears an election t-shirt after the election? yes i know you love your precious obama, but the dude won, no need to display your zombie-like allegiance to a candidate weeks after it’s over.  and if you plan on filing a police report, i already called it into my insurance company and have the claim #, you owe me $700+ in bumper replacement.  but i feel bad taking all my frustrations of the day out on you, since you need a new phone, new bike, whatever was in your messenger bag that i heard crunch when i jumped on it and have at least two broken teeth that i saw you spit out. so here’s the deal: i have a garage full of older bikes in pretty good shape (i pick them out of the trash and donate them to abandoned children charities, stuff you don’t care about). i’m willing to part with one of them so you can get to your art gallery “gig” and make a few bucks for roofies so you can rape that fat short-haired lumpy-looking vegan hipster girl at the rooftop party you’ll be attending every night this week in williamsburg.  i’ll be at the agnostic front show this sunday at the crazy donkey in farmingdale (that’s on long island, shit exists outside of brooklyn and les, go look into it). i’ll throw a bike into the back of my car for ya.  send me a pic and i’ll send you mine so we know to look for each other. just come and say hello at the show and we’ll work it out, bro.  - your new friend  p.s. i accidentally picked up an ipod too that day, which is strange because i never owned one. bunch of crappy emo music on it, so erased it all and uploaded some judas priest, venom and slayer onto it. if you ask nicely you can have it back. 	 	       * location: hipsterville     * it's not ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests  postingid: 925630332",1,

520730,"http://www.prisonplanet.com/media-forced-to-backtrack-on-al-qaeda-link-to-mumbai-attacks.html   media forced to backtrack on al-qaeda link to mumbai attacks  but attacks which have a purely domestic agenda are blown out of all proportion by corporate media as poster child for ailing war on terror  paul joseph watson prison planet.com friday, november 28, 2008  after brazenly declaring that the mumbai attacks were the work of al-qaeda, the corporate media has been forced to backtrack, while india continues to blame pakistan in a dangerous escalation of rhetoric between the two nuclear-armed powers.  bellicose propaganda about bin laden being behind the massacre, which was initially propagated by the bbc, london times and fox news amongst others, has largely evaporated, with the majority of the establishment press being forced to admit they have no idea who was behind the siege on india’s financial capital.  however, india’s claim that pakistan had a hand in the attacks is beginning to find favor in the u.s., where one counterterrorism official told cnn, “the level of sophistication in the attack leads officials to believe that it might be tied to lashkar-e-tayyiba (army of the pure), an islamic extremist group that has carried out previous attacks in india.”  lashkar-e-tayyiba would be a useful scapegoat because it has alleged links both to al-qaeda and pakistani’s isi secret service, but since the group has vehemently denied responsibility and terrorists normally like to claim responsibility for their handiwork, any attempt to pin the blame is likely to run out of steam. lashkar-e-tayyiba always claim responsibility for their attacks, so their outright denial is the death knell for this explanation.  (article continues below)  that india would immediately exploit the tragedy to demonize their arch-enemy pakistan was fully expected, but how pakistan, which has recently made numerous peaceful overtures towards india, could possibly benefit from crazed terrorists indiscriminately gunning down innocent people in shocking scenes played out on international television defies belief.  but that reasoning did not prevent india’s foreign minister pranab mukherjee from telling a press conference today that, “preliminary evidence, prima facie evidence, indicates elements with links to pakistan are involved.”  in reality, as we have repeatedly emphasized, the attacks were likely not the work of al-qaeda, pakistan, the mossad or the cia, but indian muslims.  as author tariq ali points out today, “the indian prime minister, manmohan singh, has insisted that the terrorists were based outside the country. the indian media has echoed this line of argument with pakistan (via the lashkar-e-taiba) and al-qaeda listed as the usual suspects.”  “but this is a meditated edifice of official india’s political imagination. its function is to deny that the terrorists could be a homegrown variety, a product of the radicalization of young indian muslims who have finally given up on the indigenous political system. to accept this view would imply that the country’s political physicians need to heal themselves.”  “why should it be such a surprise if the perpetrators are themselves indian muslims? its hardly a secret that there has been much anger within the poorest sections of the muslim community against the systematic discrimination and acts of violence carried out against them of which the 2002 anti-muslim pogrom in shining gujarat was only the most blatant and the most investigated episode, supported by the chief minister of the state and the local state apparatuses.”  “add to this the continuing sore of kashmir which has for decades been treated as a colony by indian troops with random arrests, torture and rape of kashmiris an everyday occurrence. conditions have been much worse than in tibet, but have aroused little sympathy in the west where the defense of human rights is heavily instrumentalised.”  the identity and motive behind the terrorists is reasonably clear, these young men are disenfranchised, revenge-driven indian muslims, along with a smattering of pakistanis, kashmiris and bangladeshis, based in india not pakistan, who hate hindus and believe it is their duty to kick-start a wider tribal war, which is why the vast majority of those killed were indians, not foreigners, brits or americans.  the terrorists were not dispatched on their mission by the pakistan government or osama bin laden, they are mostly indians who represent a domestic problem for the indian government, which is why the authorities are seeking to deflect blame and exploit the tragedy to demonize pakistan in the eyes of the international community.  the spin that the terrorists deliberately targeted american and british citizens is still being pumped out by the western corporate media, despite the fact that only one briton died, himself being originally from cyprus, in comparison to well over a hundred indians, and despite the fact that the rampage was a completely indiscriminate massacre.  the western propaganda machine has taken a domestic problem, which expresses itself almost on a monthly basis in india with routine bombings and attacks, and amplified it beyond all proportion to claim that the attacks were an assault on western democracy, capitalism, and ultimately the anglo-american power alliance.  the horrible slaughter of hundreds of mostly indian civilians in mumbai will now be used as a poster child for continued bombing campaigns inside pakistani territory and an expansion of the ailing war on terror under president elect barack obama, which in the long term only means that more innocent lives will be lost.",0,

344759,"i don't think doomsday is tomorrow or anything, it just worries me that any problems that can be seen in the near future are solved by throwing more money at it that the fed creates. and read this about the great depression and give me your thoughts.  the great depression  from 1921 to 1929 the federal reserve increased the money supply by 62% thus fuelling the period known as the roaring twenties. further fuelling the rise in stock market indices was a new type of loan, known as a margin loan, whereby an investor would only need to put down 10% of the value of a stock with the remaining 90% being loaned from the broker. like today, these loans could be called in at any time and had to be paid within 24 hours, known as a margin call. this is typically accomplished by the selling of the stock purchased using the loan.  these two factors, loose monetary policy and easy loans resulted in a fivefold increase in the dow jones industrial average over the latter half of the 1920's.  the mass calling in of these margin loans by the new york banking establishment resulted in the devastating market crashes of october of 1929. ""black thursday"", the initial crash, occurred on october 24. the crash that caused general panic five days later on october 29 was known as ""black tuesday"".  then, instead of expanding the money supply, the federal reserve contracted it, thereby creating the period known as the great depression. congressman wright patman in a primer on money, reported that the money supply decreased by eight billion dollars from 1929 to 1933, causing 11,630 banks of the total of 26,401 in the united states to go bankrupt. this allowed central bankers to buy up rival banks and whole corporations at a deep discount.  it is interesting to note that biographies of j.p. morgan, joe f. kennedy, j.d. rockefeller and bernard baruch indicate that they all managed to transfer their assets out of the stock market and into gold just before the crash of 1929.  legend has it that joseph p. kennedy decided to sell his considerable stock holdings after hearing an investment tip from a shoe-shiner. joe kennedy went from having $4 million in 1929 to over $100 million in 1935.  one must wonder if that 'shoe-shiner' was paul warburg, a founder and original member of the federal reserve warning of the coming collapse and depression in an annual report to the stockholders of his international acceptance bank,  ""if the orgies of unrestrained speculation are permitted to spread, the ultimate collapse is certain not only to affect the speculators themselves, but to bring about a general depression involving the entire country.""

415138,"understanding obama: the making of a fuehrer by ali sina  i must confess i was not impressed by sen. barack obama from the first time i saw him. at first i was excited to see a black candidate. he looked youthful, spoke well, appeared to be confident – a wholesome presidential package. i was put off soon, not just because of his shallowness but also because there was an air of haughtiness in his demeanor that was unsettling. his posture and his body language were louder than his empty words. obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in american history. never a politician in this land had such a quasi 'religious' impact on so many people. the fact that obama is a total incognito with zero accomplishment, makes this inexplicable infatuation alarming. obama is not an ordinary man. he is not a genius. in fact he is quite ignorant on most important subjects. barack obama is a narcissist. dr. sam vaknin, the author of the malignant self love, also believes, 'barack obama appears to be a narcissist.'    vaknin is a world authority on narcissism. he understands narcissism and describes the inner mind of a narcissist like no other person. when he talks about narcissism everyone listens. vaknin says that obama's language, posture and demeanor, and the testimonies of his closest, dearest and nearest suggest that the senator is either a narcissist or he may have narcissistic personality disorder (npd).    narcissists project a grandiose but false image of themselves. jim jones, the charismatic leader of people's temple, the man who led over 900 of his followers to cheerfully commit mass suicide and even murder their own children was also a narcissist. david koresh, charles manson, joseph koni, shoko asahara, stalin, saddam, mao, kim jong ill and adolph hitler are a few examples of narcissists of our time. all these men had a tremendous influence over their fanciers. they created a personality cult around themselves and with their blazing speeches elevated their admirers' souls, filled their hearts with enthusiasm and instilled in their minds a new zest for life. they gave them hope! they promised them the moon, but alas, invariably they brought them to their doom. when you are a victim of a cult of personality, you don't know it until it is too late.    one determining factor in the development of npd is childhood abuse. 'obama's early life was decidedly chaotic and replete with traumatic and mentally bruising dislocations,' says vaknin. 'mixed-race marriages were even less common then. his parents went through a divorce when he was an infant (two years old). obama saw his father only once again, before he died in a car accident. then, his mother re-married and obama had to relocate to indonesia : a foreign land with a radically foreign culture, to be raised by a step-father. at the age of ten, he was whisked off to live with his maternal (white) grandparents. he saw his mother only intermittently in the following few years and then she vanished from his life in 1979. she died of cancer in 1995.'    one must never underestimate the manipulative genius of pathological narcissists. they project such an imposing personality that it overwhelms those around them. charmed by the charisma of the narcissist, people become like clay in his hands. they cheerfully do his bidding and delight to be at his service. the narcissist shapes the world around himself and reduces others in his own inverted image. he creates a cult of personality. his admirers become his co-dependents.    narcissists have no interest in things that do not help them to reach their personal objective. they are focused on one thing alone and that is power. all other issues are meaningless to them and they do not want to waste their precious time on trivialities. anything that does not help them is beneath them and do not deserve their attention. if an issue raised in the senate does not help obama in one way or another, he has no interest in it. the 'present' vote is a safe vote. no one can criticize him if things go wrong. why should he implicate himself in issues that may become controversial when they don't help him personally? those issues are unworthy by their very nature because they are not about him.    obama's election as the first black president of the harvard law review led to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations. the university of chicago law school provided him with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. the book took him a lot longer than expected and at the end it devolved into…, guess what? his own autobiography! instead of writing a scholarly paper focusing on race relations, for which, he had been paid, obama could not resist writing about his most sublime self. he entitled the book dreams from my father .    not surprisingly, adolph hitler also wrote his own autobiography when he was still nobody. so did stalin. for a narcissist no subject is as important as his own self. why would he waste his precious time and genius writing about insignificant things when he can write about such an august being as himself? narcissists are often callous and even ruthless. as the norm, they lack conscience. this is evident from obama's lack of interest in his own brother who lives on only one dollar per month. a man who lives in luxury, who takes a private jet to vacation in hawaii, and who has raised nearly half a billion dollars for his campaign (something unprecedented in history) has no interest in the plight of his own brother. why? because, his brother cannot be used for his ascent to power. a narcissist cares for no one but himself.    this election is like no other in the history of america . the issues are insignificant compared to what is at stake. what can be more dangerous than having a man bereft of conscience, a serial liar, and one who cannot distinguish his fantasies from reality as the leader of the free world?    i hate to sound alarmist, but one must be a fool if one is not alarmed. many politicians are narcissists. they pose no threat to others.. they are simply self serving and selfish. obama evinces symptoms of pathological narcissism, which is different from the run-of-the-mill narcissism of a richard nixon or a bill clinton, for example. to him reality and fantasy are intertwined. this is a mental health issue, not just a character flaw. pathological narcissists are dangerous because they look normal and even intelligent. it is this disguise that makes them treacherous.    today the democrats have placed all their hopes in obama. but this man could put an end to their party. the great majority of blacks have also decided to vote for obama. only a fool does not know that their support for him is racially driven.   let us call a spade a spade. this is racism, pure and simple. the truth is that while everyone carries a misconceived collective guilt towards the blacks for wrongs done centuries ago by a bygone people to a bygone people, the blacks carry a collective rancor, enmity or vendetta towards non-blacks and to this day want to 'stand up' to the white man.. they seem to be stuck in 19th century.    the downside of this is that if obama turns out to be the disaster i predict, he will cause widespread resentment among the whites. the blacks are unlikely to give up their support of their man. cultic mentality is pernicious and unrelenting. they will dig their heads deeper in the sand and blame obama's detractors of racism. this will cause a backlash among the whites. the white supremacists will take advantage of the discontent and they will receive widespread support. i predict that in less than four years, racial tensions will increase to levels never seen since the turbulent 1960s. obama will set the clock back decades… america is the bastion of freedom. the peace of the world depends on the strength of america , and its weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations. it is no wonder that ahmadinejad, hugo chavez, the castrists, the hezbollah, the hamas, the lawyers of the guantanamo terrorists and virtually all sworn enemies of america are so thrilled by the prospect of their man in the white house. america is on the verge of destruction. there is no insanity greater than electing a pathological narcissist as president.",1,

""we progressed on, we saw these ... small boats coming in at us,"" adler said. ""so instead of going by us, which we would have [expected] with smugglers, they were now going down the sides of the ships. so that indicates, you know, some more proactive maneuvering.""  ""i am coming to you. you will explode in a few minutes,"" the voice on the transmission said, and with the small iranian boats surrounding their ships, the u.s. commanders had to take the apparent threat seriously.  ""when i heard it, it just raised my awareness level. that the threat level seemed to perhaps increase when you combine it with the maneuvering of the vessels and the fact they would not respond to our warnings and interrogations,"" james told abc news.    i dont know of any of you read spook88's blog, but he's a 20 year veteran of military intelligence:   the timing of that call suggests someone who was doing more than simply monitoring radio traffic on channel 16. under existing rules of engagement (roe), american warships initiate radio contact well before approaching ships enter their inner defensive perimeter. based solely on bridge-to-bridge communications, the intruder would have only a general idea of the vessels' location. his threatening call, at the height of the incident, seems hardly coincidental, and appears to have been based on more than vhf radio traffic.  by comparison, an irgc command element, located on a nearby, iranian-controlled island (or another naval vessel) would have detailed knowledge of the operational plan, and—with access to other communications channels, elint data and radar plots—an excellent idea of how the encounter was unfolding. with that information, it would be easy to make the radio call, at exactly the right moment.  it would also be relatively simple for iranian linguists to mimic the well-known ""monkey,"" creating plausible denial for their involvement. tehran has used deceptive radio broadcasts in the past, to great effect. during the iran-iraq war, iranian sigint units operated dummy radio networks, which passed bogus information that was intercepted by the iraqis, causing them to deploy troops in the wrong areas. given iran's past proficiency in electronic deception, finding someone to imitate the heckler would be a piece of cake.",0,
552865,"jews plotted the armenian holocaust! nathanael kapner  business as usual is a powerful motivating force especially when jews like the rothschilds are running an oil business. banking is the forte of the jewish house of rothschild. but raw materials–especially oil–are money in the bank.  the young turk movement, aka committee of union and progress, arose out of the rothschilds’ oil interests in the black sea area of the ottoman empire in the late 1800s. ‘creating stability’ in an incendiary realm was necessary for the rothschilds’ new oil enterprise baku oil. the instability of the armenian christians financial and intellectual prominence in the area was not ‘good for business.’  thus hand-picked jews of salonika, (jews made up the majority of the city’s population), and foreign agitators such as the russian zionist, vladimir jabotinksy, the editor of the young turk newspaper, were just what the rothschilds needed for ridding the source of that instability, the armenian christians.  now, the zionist young turks who sought for the break up of the ottoman empire in order to obtain palestine–and the house of rothschild, who needed a jewish-controlled turkey and hegemony over the entire middle east, could work together. this meant funding for the jewish young turks and revolutionary subversives for the rothschilds.  historical background of the jewish young turks  1680: sabbatai zvi, a turkish jew, proclaims himself to be the jewish messiah in salonica. after amassing a following of thousands of jews - he led them on a zionist exodus to palestine. on the way he decided to become a muslim. many of his followers saw this as god's plan and also became muslims.  1716: a group called the “donmeh” forms in salonica of sabbatai zvi’s followers headed by sabbatai zvi’s successor, baruchya russo. by the early 1900's, the donmeh numbers in the hundreds of thousands. they were known as crypto jews because though outwardly appearing to be muslims, they were still jews following the customs of the jewish occult kabbala which sabbatai zvi taught. they continue in their fervent, (yet secret), zionist vision.  1860: jewish hungarian zionist named arminius vambery becomes an advisor to the sultan abdul mecit while secretly working as an agent for lord palmerston of the british foreign office. vambery tries to broker a deal between the zionist leader theodore herzl and sultan abdul mecit over the creation of israel but fails.  1891: out of the donmeh a zionist political group forms called the committee of union and progress, later called the young turks. the group is headed by a freemason jew by the name of emmanuel carraso who organizes the secret committee of union and progress in geneva with the help of the rothschilds.  1895-1896: sephardic jews of salonika together with the turks massacre armenian christians in istanbul.  1902 &amp;

371947,"that is what happened in hell, mother went to the second judgment after twenty two years and some months, i never witnessed her ordeal but guess she would be no chance to be rescued by her guardian angel. father went to judgment after only seven years three months, i watched him leave hell facing backwards in september 2000. the doctor did only eighteen months and went to an unknown future, myklos who did his family in got five years… after the tour i told allah that it appeared injustice was being perpetrated in the matter of satan and of all the inhabitants of the first circle of hell, directing his attention to the monstrously inadequate sentences handed down to my father for instance, and to the doctor who carried out in excess of one hundred and fifty thousand abortions.  he replied that the disposition his slaves was a matter for him, and that hell was not the place for temerity… he relented after gog and magog appealed directly to me that i petition allah in their favor. gog and magog facilitated the repair of satan's chest wound, and at my behest found and fitted a new right leg for him and found him a pair of short pants, never was his dignity offended, again called lucifer i took him to the light and handed him into the light, in the same way as the demon angels do with the resurrected humans at the end of hell. chablis the devil of the darkness has the ability to split into many miniature replica's of himself, it is extraordinarily good luck to capture one… i caught one and held it in a bottle for about four years before releasing it into the light, when it coiled out of the bottle and disappeared into the light it had the form and shape of an oriental dragon. saying i would see him and the bottle back in brisbane, he never got here. i plan on using him as a front line soldier in the jihad against the abortion lobby.  after taunting him into chasing me, i had assumed the shape of a beautiful woman, using my sweet --- as a model, i climbed back up the cliff face at the place where he splatters the woman against the rock, he went berserk with fury and got after me, i had anticipated this and had prepared an opening into the outer world. thus viewing hell from space, i drilled a shaft twelve millimeters in diameter using a burr bit attached to the top of my astral head. he pursued me across the first circle and when i shrunk down and shot up the bore hole, he sent one of his most trusted miniature replica's of himself after me. i had been training in high speed astral maneuvers and got to the top of the shaft in time to place the neck of the bottle i had stashed there, over the hole and wait till he cannoned full on onto it, then place in and lock into place the glass stopper which came with the bottle. he was a small black winged creature, resembling a pterodactyl more than a bat, with bright red eyes, horns, and a tail with a flattened arrow head shaped tip… if he had a pitchfork he would have been identical to the devil of popular mythology.   chablis was enraged, he can not harm my astral self however, the place i took the bottled devil is where the blue green angels go when they have refused the advances of their one time guarded companion. they fly across the ether until they come to a structure much like a sea urchin, a sphere with a hole in the top, down thru the hole and imagine that you are inside a lamp, the central flame a bright white light. no glare and easy to look at… ranged around in concentric tiers are a few hundred of the blue green angels all similar but none identical, some are sleeping and some stretching their wings, at various times there are a lot of them then sometimes only a few. variously they approach the light vertically as they enter the chamber, lost in the brightness for a few moments, emerging chattering excitedly, then receiving directions and flying off somewhere, or taking a rest there before departing. that's about it, my sister entered hell in 2006 february, the last time i had spoken to her in 1985 she was vituperative toward me, i had wondered if she planned on alienating as many people as she could then committing suicide.  she got a dream run thru hell only about six weeks via both judgments, she attacked me from whatever place she was thereafter and was cast back into hell to do her time at the tree, she was the only occupant of hell thru that period up until the blind birdman from the second tier above the pit in the first circle of hell reentered that place with brand new eyes, he stayed for about six weeks then he and my sister were both released. she went thru three levels of hell, up until that time then reentered in february 2007, to be joined shortly thereafter by the devil dragon i had caught in the bottle.   the last coherent tour event was about twelve years ago… i had asked philemon the origin of the mummified corpse on the second tier in the darkness and we were on our way to check… when gog and magog and myself attended lucifer it was only a half remembered recounted type of thing, i believe gog and magog are spirits from the world of stone that somehow began interacting with humanity, in an adverse way obviously since they landed in hell. my plan is to instruct them in the koran and the ways of islam, i propose to direct their attention to the injunction from allah re waging jihad or just war against your attacker, i will tell these rock spirits to rally their people as moslems and as soldiers for allah against the forces of evil, the abortionists. mt",0,

(there are some women, just not as many as men.) one study counted that over 80% of the people who work 50-hour weeks are men.  beyond ability and motivation here is opportunity.  it stinks of circularity.  in particular a study of preference would be far, far more telling than a study of circumstance here.  edit:  how about this:  &gt; in the 19th century in america, middle-class girls and women played piano far more than men. yet all that piano playing failed to result in any creative output. there were no great women composers, no new directions in style of music or how to play, or anything like that. all those female pianists entertained their families and their dinner guests but did not seem motivated to create anything new.  no publication does not mean those pianists were not improvising or writing.  he would need to cite a study of a substantial array of period accounts to support this claim.  edit:  &gt; by any measure, those black men, mostly just emerging from slavery, were far more disadvantaged than the middle-class white women.  even getting their hands on a musical instrument must have been considerably harder.  the first statement is a stretch.  black men at the dawn of jazz were not themselves emerging from slavery, though one could try to argue that as a group they were only two generations removed.  for the second statement, seeming so isn't support for a claim.  edit:  there's more fishiness, like the end of traded-off traits, but i'm bored.",1,

617468,"knowing where i ended up, people often want to know if i was molested as a child. i wasn't, but not for lack of trying.  i first discovered the exciting world of sexual abuse in sixth grade, when my elementary school passed out educational comic books as part of a health fair. the plot centered on a gang of pleasantly diverse superheroes who rescued kids from the horrors of physical and sexual abuse. there was a whole teeming underbelly of titillation that i alone was privy to by grace of being the only student dorky enough to actually read the comic book. the kids inside had stumbling alcoholic parents at whom they screamed ""i hate you"" and got lots of attention from the compassionate adults who wanted to help them. it was like the days of our lives of child abuse.  just when you thought matt was going to get socked for missing curfew, the non-threatening black kid appeared to rescue him before fist hit mandible. but when sally's somewhat-dashing alcoholic father made suggestive comments to sally, i felt my face flush. i looked around at the other desks, but no one else had lucked into this school-sanctioned pornography. sally was drawn scared and upset by the artist, her eyes quivering with urgent motion lines. i rubbed my pencil against the page, wishing i could erase her distress into sexy complicity, thus increasing my vicarious thrill. i wanted the non-threatening black kid to come back and engage sally in a threesome with her boorish pops while i watched.  afterward, i found no shortage of young adult novels with which to feed my ignominious appetites. after reading about a girl who gets molested by her dentist, i spent my time in the chair sucking in my stomach and trying to look sexy with wads of cotton in my cheeks. i quivered with anticipation when alone with an adult, breathlessly wishing and completely terrified that they would cross the line. i fantasized about someone taking advantage of me because it was the only kind of sex i could imagine being able to engage in without feeling guilty. as a southern baptist girl, i couldn't fantasize about boys my own age; having sex with one of them was like purchasing a one-way ticket to hell. but if the dentist, an adult in a position of authority, decided to drill me in more ways than one, well surely god couldn't be mad at me for that.  one of the girls at middle school told me that a pervert had once shown her his dick through the library window and i was green with envy. what had she done to deserve a pervert? i was busy scouring the card catalog for child abuse pintature and the most i got was a glimpse of my little brother's tiny wang as he sprinted from the bathroom to his bedroom. my entire childhood felt like watching a pervert jerk off through the library window – me, cocooned in a place of safety and learning, looking out at the dirty, visceral realities of life, intrigued but unable to connect.  as i grew older, the feeling of being on the fringes of something i couldn't quite participate in only increased. even at church camp, sex lurked in the forests beyond the chapel, where it was rumored that many attendees had lost their virginities. i was a graduate of the girls-only camp for the younger demographic, but the teen camp i started attending at 12 was like a den of iniquity compared to that place.  after a day sweatily crowded into outdoor church pews listening to sermons about the dangers of secular media, and singing songs about god (sample lyric: ""i don't want to be a hypocrite/ cause they're not hip with it/i don't wanna be a pharisee/cause they're not fair you see), the christian teenagers teemed into the camp for free time. puberty hormones and a healthy fear of god combined into a mighty aphrodisiac that had underage blondes rolling up and tying their what would jesus do t-shirts to show off tan navels and the pimply, jesus-loving boys hanging around the swimming pool drooling during the girls' segregated swimming time. all that fire and brimstone merely stoked the fire in our loins.  the camp had been around for a century and the rule book had changed little since it opening. though i had been warned of the rigorous rules about shorts lengths, i hadn't received any guidelines about swimwear. so when my grandmother had taken me to dillard's, i had picked out a tasteful tank top with brief-cut bottoms like the other girls in my class were wearing. my intriguing and mysterious bumps, usually wrapped up like christmas presents, were hinted at by the cut of the new suit. when we changed before the scheduled swim, the other girls were staring at me. i instantly felt awkward, my skin peeking out white and fluffy like a cumulus cloud in a pillowcase.  ""look who's getting boobs!"" shouted one of the girls, actually poking at the fleshy orb spilling over the top of my bathing suit. mortified, i crossed my arms over my chest, but not before i had noticed that yes, she was right, i was getting boobs. big boobs. big, gorgeous boobs which would later earn me an extra 50 an hour but which at that moment seemed low on the list of things a young woman would want on her chest. a kinder girl led me away from the crowd rapidly gathering around my puberty sideshow and explained that the camp did not allow two-piece bathing suits.  stuck back on my bunk with no television or company, i flipped open my personalized precious moments bible (it would be replaced within the year by a ""true love waits"" bible). starting from ""in the beginning,"" it didn't take me long to realize that the bible was chock-ful of kinky shit. before i was even out of genesis, lot's slutty daughters were devising plans to get knocked up by dad. there was more rape, incest, and adultery than on telenova, and i didn't really notice what i was doing when one hand slipped inside my past-the-knee-length shorts.  even with all the admittedly sinful diddling and fingering and rubbing and stroking i had done before, i had never once done something as terrible, as sacrilegious as what i found myself doing now.  i was masturbating to the bible.  i don't remember what section in particular it was that got me so steamed up, although i think it was in the old testament. what i do remember is the sense of horror when i realized what i was doing. i knew i should ask god for forgiveness, but i was frankly too ashamed to face him. that night, as the swaying and weeping teenagers repented from the afternoon's pg hedonism, i made my way down the aisle to ""rededicate my life to christ"" and just hoped that would take care of it without getting too specific.",0,
573708,"false memoir of holocaust is canceled  by motoko rich and joseph berger a man whose memoir about his experience during the holocaust was to have been published in february has admitted that his story was embellished, and on saturday evening his publisher canceled the release of the book.   and once again a new york publisher and oprah winfrey were among those fooled by a too-good-to-be-true story.  this time, it was the tale of herman rosenblat, who said he first met his wife while he was a child imprisoned in a nazi concentration camp and she, disguised as a christian farm girl, tossed apples over the camp’s fence to him. he said they met again on a blind date 12 years after the end of war in coney island and married. the couple celebrated their 50th anniversary this year.  ms. winfrey, who hosted mr. rosenblat and his wife, roma radzicki rosenblat, on her show twice, called their romance “the single greatest love story” she had encountered in her 22 years on the show. on saturday night, after learning from mr. rosenblat’s agent that the author had confessed that the story was fabricated, berkley books, a unit of penguin group that was planning to publish “angel at the fence,” mr. rosenblat’s memoir of surviving in a sub-camp of buchenwald with the help of his future wife, canceled the book and demanded that mr. rosenblat return his advance.  harris salomon, who is producing a movie based on the story, said he would go ahead with the film, but as a work of fiction, adding that mr. rosenblat had agreed to donate all earnings from the film to holocaust survivor charities.  berkley’s decision came in the same year that another unit of penguin, riverhead books, was duped by margaret seltzer, the author of “love and consequences,” her fabricated gang memoir about her life as a white girl taken into an african-american foster home in south central los angeles. she had in fact been raised by her biological family in a well-to-do section of the san fernando valley. it also followed the revelations, nearly three years ago, that james frey, the oprah winfrey-annointed author “a million little pieces,” had exaggerated details of his memoir of drug addiction.   this latest literary hoax is likely to trigger yet more questions as to why the publishing industry has such a poor track record of fact-checking.   in the latest instance, no one at berkley questioned the central truth of mr. rosenblat’s story until last week, said andrea hurst, his agent. neither leslie gelbman, president and publisher of berkley, nor natalee rosenstein, mr. rosenblat’s editor at berkley, returned calls or e-mail messages seeking comment. craig burke, director of publicity for berkley, declined to elaborate beyond the company’s brief statement announcing the cancellation of the book. in an e-mail message, a spokesman for ms. winfrey also declined to comment.   after several scholars and family members attacked mr. rosenblat’s story in articles last week in the new republic, mr. rosenblat confessed on saturday to ms. hurst and mr. salomon that he had concocted the core of his tale. ms. hurst said that in an emotional telephone call with herself and mr. salomon, mr. rosenblat said his wife had never tossed him apples over the fence.  in a statement released through his agent, mr. rosenblat wrote that he had once been shot during a robbery and that while he was recovering in the hospital, “my mother came to me in a dream and said that i must tell my story so that my grandchildren would know of our survival from the holocaust.”  he said that after the incident he began to write. “i wanted to bring happiness to people, to remind them not to hate, but to love and tolerate all people,” he wrote in the statement. “i brought good feelings to a lot of people and i brought hope to many. my motivation was to make good in this world. in my dreams, roma will always throw me an apple, but i now know it is only a dream.”  according to ms. hurst, who represents other inspirational writers including bernie siegel, author of “love, medicine &amp; miracles,” mr. rosenblat first concocted his story in the mid 1990s as an entry to a newspaper contest soliciting the “best love stories.” in 1996, he appeared on ms. winfrey’s show with his wife and repeated the fabricated story. from there, it snowballed, with versions appearing in magazines, a volume of the “chicken soup for the soul” series, and a children’s book, “angel girl,” by laurie friedman, released in september by an imprint of lerner publishing. mr. and mrs. rosenblat, who now live in north miami beach, appeared on cbs’s “early show” in october.  as media coverage of mr. rosenblat’s story spread, scholars and others began to question the veracity of the romance throughout the blogosphere, pointing out that, among other things, the layout of the camp would have prevented the pair from meeting at a fence.  in a telephone interview in november, mr. rosenblat defended his story against such doubts. he said that his section of schlieben, a sub-camp of buchenwald, was not well guarded and that he could stand between a barracks and the six-to-eight-foot fence out of sight of guards. roma was able to approach him because there were woods that would have concealed her.   in recounting the stunning “reunion” with ms. radzicki 12 years later as survivors living in new york, mr. rosenblat said ms. radzicki told him she had saved a boy by hurling apples over a fence to him.   “did he have rags on his feet instead of shoes?” mr. rosenblat said he asked her.  she said yes and he told her, “that boy was me.”  in a telephone interview sunday, ms. hurst, who sold the book to berkley for less than $50,000, said she always believed the essential truth of mr. rosenblat’s tale until last week. “i believed the teller,” ms. hurst said. “he was in so many magazines and books and on ‘oprah.’ it did not seem like it would not be true.” on sunday, ms. hurst said that she was reviewing her legal options because “i’ve yet to see what kind of repercussions could come from this, and i was lied to.”  ms. hurst said that mr. rosenblat did provide some documentation, including a 1946 letter from a warden with the jewish children’s community committee for the care of children from the camps that said mr. rosenblat had attended a technical school in london. evidence of an organization with that name did not appear in internet searches on sunday.   susanna margolis, a new york-based ghost writer who polished mr. rosenblat’s manuscript, said she was surprised by his description of his first blind date with ms. radzicki. “i thought that was far-fetched.” she said. “but if somebody comes to you, as an agent and a publisher, and says, ‘this is my story,’ how do you check it other than to say, ‘did this happen?’ ”   that so many would get taken in by mr. rosenblat’s inauthentic love story seems incredible given the number of fake memoirs that have come to light in the last few years. the holocaust in particular has been fertile territory for fabricated personal histories: earlier this year, misha defonseca confessed that her memoir, “misha: a mémoire of the holocaust years,” about her childhood spent running from the nazis and living with wolves, was not true.   a decade ago, a swiss historian debunked binjamin wilkomirski’s 1996 memoir, “fragments,” which described how he survived as a latvian jewish orphan in a nazi concentration camp. it turns out the book was written by bruno doessekker, a swiss man who spent the war in relative comfort in switzerland. mr. rosenblat, at least, appears to have told the truth about being a prisoner in the nazi concentration camps.   the primary sleuth in unmasking his fabrication of the apple story was kenneth waltzer, director of jewish studies at michigan state university. he has been working on a book on how 904 boys — including the nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel — were saved from death by an underground rescue operation inside buchenwald, and has interviewed hundreds of survivors, including boys from the ghetto at piotrkow in poland who were taken with the young herman rosenblat to the camp.   when dr. waltzer asked other survivors who were with mr. rosenblat about the tossed apple story, they said the story couldn’t possibly be true.   in his research of maps drawn by ex-prisoners, dr. waltzer learned that the section of schlieben where mr. rosenblat was housed had fences facing other sections of the camp and only one fence — on the south — facing the outside world. that fence was adjacent to the camp’s ss barracks and the ss men there would have been able to spot a boy regularly speaking to a girl on the other side of the fence, dr. waltzer said. moreover, the fence was electrified and civilians outside the camp were forbidden to walk along the road that bordered the fence.   dr. waltzer also learned from online documentation that ms. radzicki, her parents and two sisters were hidden as christians at a farm not outside schlieben but 210 miles away near breslau.   holocaust survivors and scholars are fiercely on guard against any fabrication of memories because they taint the truth of the holocaust and raise doubts about the millions who were killed or brutalized.   “there’s no need to embellish, no need to aggrandize,” said deborah e. lipstadt, the dorot professor of modern jewish and holocaust studies at emory university. “the facts are horrible, and when you’re teaching about horrible stuff you just have to lay out the facts.”",1,

630230,"looking about and taking it all in i tell philemon it was great, and thanks very much for the tour. he says he thought i wanted to see the whole of hell, i said i did and was there more, he assured me there was and cast an image into my mind of serried ranks kneeling in the oriental prayer position. tall spires of ash on their shoulders and heads, balancing on the balls of both feet and their knees, straight backed, hands on thighs palms downward, fingers together, resembling the statues in a thai temple.  just where they could be i did not know and he says to follow him, and back thru the first circle past satan, the tree and the swordsman, past sisyphus straining up the incline with his stone, across the desert and back into the fire cave. down past the place of judgment and explosions of fire every forty seconds or so, thumbs up to the faun racking them up, then down between the vast flaming stacks of burning bodies to the nether part of hell. as we move further from the front so too are the bodies burnt down, past the yellow green burners at the front, to charred corpses further in, then burnt charred corpses with just flickering blue flame and human coals, and on to a place where the bodies are mere cinders. blackened and burned beyond recognition, a guard here tries to block ones way, i sidestep him and he fades away.  at this place a huge four armed being dismantles the stacks of charred cinder corpses, those he takes in his right pair of arms, reconstructing the body in his marvelously dexterous hands, join with a blue green flying creature that has appeared from somewhere. the charred metallic body of the sinner crumbles to dust, revealing only the bright white pure human soul, they rush together and embrace. their union sealed in a blinding flash of arclight, fading to reveal a composite white robed flying creature, which then departs this place at a rate of knots. those he takes in his left pair of hands likewise reconstructed, they too put on their best face, as the blue green flying creature appears, the giant four armed being gives him the option of reconstructing with the newly raised from the fire human soul. the blue green angel lets out a scream of outrage and horror, and flies out of the place like a bat out of hell, no mistaking that at all.  thus in place in the two left hands of the angel of the second judgment, philemon did tell me his name which i have forgotten, he is a pretty cool guy, not withstanding he looks a bit like a snake just jutting up out of the ground with his four arms. he has a moustache and a part in his hair, and looks a bit like sir richard hadlee the great new zealand sportsman. so the fella in his two left hands is placed alongside another of his kind, they are in a column of six, like the chain of women in the outer darkness, some unseen mechanism is causing the column to move like a snake, of its own volition taking the men backwards out of the fire chamber. thru and beyond another overhang and out into a volcanic place, where red hot volcanic cinders alight like snow upon their heads and shoulders, until they resemble the statues in a thai temple with spires of ash on heads and shoulders, then only their faces and eyes are visible as the ash buries them. on downward and on deeper into hell, the time for remorse long gone, the underground column comes to a trip place, here the bodies do a one eighty pivot, the men are now facing forward as the column of the damned wends downward, and here in this place of dust and ash do the fallen sleep.  nor yet is their journey thru hell over, deeper and deeper goes the column of six and its company of snoring losers, two weeks pass on earth and the column intersects an underground stream. here in this place of water and steam, where the pious man looks toward heaven, bitter and beaten, a witness of failure and dashed hope. for here, in vindication of the prophesy of john the baptist, that …all flesh shall know the salvation of god, the damned are raised. attendants, two of them, two hundred kilo individuals, like funny parody drawings of, of all things cherubs, subcutaneous fat and tiny little wings on an overgrown wrestlers body. one reaches out his hand where the column goes over a hump and the ranks open out, takes the hand of the soul of the sinner. he has been in the eastern prayer position for as many weeks, and while this is an elegant pose it produces physical agony after only a short while. he assists him up, then massages him up and down the legs, toweling down his upper body with a rag cloth he keeps over his shoulder. the sinner is an ancient walter brennan type, you gotta believe just how old this man is, never would anybody really encounter any person on earth this old.  old or not and notwithstanding his double trip thru hell, he is jaunty and full of witticisms toward the demon attendant. he thinks he is still in hospital, and tells the demon about this really vivid dream he was having until woken. the attendant has heard it all before and mumbles something, he has massaged both legs and feet, done his upper body and arms with the towel, which he dips into a stone basin of water then wrings out and does his face and ears. walter is still chattering away and the wrestler hands him up to his brother, who is up a couple of steps on another landing, as he passes from one brother to the other, so does a shiver of white light commence from the brother's fingertips and right thru the newly resurrected sinners body, until he is fully up on the landing. once more a young man in the full vigor of youth, the guard directs him to a then unknown destination.  the next sinner freed is a wizened little bloke, could have been a gunslinger in the wild west, mouth just a slit and cold eyes, untalkative he is toweled down and rubbed, he thanks the attendant who passes him on to his brother. the next a dyak head hunter maybe, from the island nation of borneo, an incredibly old little dark skinned man, seems happy to be going. i pass with him onto the next level and he approaches a gate, beyond the gate his extended family, his grandfather, his mother, and his brothers and sisters are overjoyed to have him back. the next there is a caucasian youth, his beautiful wife and children, their features indistinct from my perspective greet him… the column of annealed metallic corpses progresses a little further on, till they are ground to atoms tumbling into an ash whirlpool, resembling a bottomless pit.  xiv  that's hell. the second judgment in the outer darkness is much the same, the girls progress right thru hell till they come to a body builder who has a horn trumpet attached to a thong around both wrists, that makes two trumpets in all. when their time comes, the succubus that emerged at the first judgment has drained all the goodness out of their body, which has gone up the umbilical cord and has nurtured him. the umbilical cord snaps, and the faun critter has become a blue green angel, identical to the angels that say yea or nay at the second judgment at the fire. the body builder… like this guy is built, is mostly indistinct. the guards in the darkness are a more reserved group than their counterparts in the fire, in that his light which shines from a disc of light above his head is most often very dim. he interviews the newly emerged blue green angel and, depending upon the response, raises either the trumpet horn in his left hand blowing b flat, signaling that there will be no removal. or yet he raises the right trumpet horn and blows d.  then the released human spirit, standing at the place of judgment like an intact venus de milo, risen from a terrible waste of corpse debris and the angel embrace. within the arclight their union produces the robed figure of a flying angel, who does not waste any time leaving. the losers collapse and so does the floor receive them, losing all human shape now and like a procession of bright white maggots, do they make their way toward a place where they will tumble down out of the main body of hell and be buried in freezing cold volcanic ash. down until they are liberated as the ashy medium intersects an underground body of water, then they are washed out of the ash, over a waterfall and into a pool of water. here they thaw, and dive and plunge about this strange limbo world, till they drag themselves up a cinder beach and flop down like seals. the two demon attendants here resemble asterix the gaul, in the european comic strip of that name, in that they are armored from the waist up and fully helmeted, against the amorous passions of the newly resurrected women. their eyes visible thru a horizontal slot in their helmets, handing the girls onto the next level, the white light tingles over their skin, and they arrive on that level once more in human form, as beautiful young women. stark bollicky naked however, picture koika at the winter palace.  up the path a bit and a high arched bridge, below just cloud across and a gateway, no gates on the hinges however, just inside a dress shop with diamond shaped crystal panes in the windows, here the chicks get a dress to wear. this girl chose a short sleeve blue and white full length dress with a modest neckline, that would not have been out of place among the amish communities of pennsylvania, past the shop a family group. a young man in the group, a clean limbed type, seems a tad self conscious among so many people he does not know, then erupting from the group's center a black shape, nor yet human but beast, carnivore tongue extended and feral teeth exposed, this is a puppy dog of the poodle variety…",0,

341406,"let's clear one thing up. i am an independent voter, not a republican.  second he gave his reason for his 1996 statement, and that was his fault for listening to misguided campaign staffers.  a nation that once prided itself on a sense of rugged individualism has become uncomfortably obsessed with racial group identities.  the collectivist mindset is at the heart of racism.  government as an institution is particularly ill-suited to combat bigotry. bigotry at its essence is a problem of the heart, and we cannot change people’s hearts by passing more laws and regulations.  it is the federal government that most divides us by race, class, religion, and gender. through its taxes, restrictive regulations, corporate subsidies, racial set-asides, and welfare programs, government plays far too large a role in determining who succeeds and who fails. government “benevolence” crowds out genuine goodwill by institutionalizing group thinking, thus making each group suspicious that others are receiving more of the government loot. this leads to resentment and hostility among us.  racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism, the mindset that views humans strictly as members of groups rather than as individuals. racists believe that all individuals who share superficial physical characteristics are alike: as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups. by encouraging americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called “diversity” actually perpetuate racism.  the true antidote to racism is liberty. liberty means having a limited, constitutional government devoted to the protection of individual rights rather than group claims. liberty means free-market capitalism, which rewards individual achievement and competence - not skin color, gender, or ethnicity.  in a free society, every citizen gains a sense of himself as an individual, rather than developing a group or victim mentality. this leads to a sense of individual responsibility and personal pride, making skin color irrelevant. racism will endure until we stop thinking in terms of groups and begin thinking in terms of individual liberty-dr ron paul.     *if a man isn't competent enough to run a small private business in a responsible manner, why would you expect him to be able to run the government in a responsible manner?*                     well as nice as it would be to have a man/woman of utmost perfection running for office, there has and will never be one. george washington was a slave owner, would like to continue castigating him as well? are so pure to cast stones?  what should be his consequences? shall we have him cry on national television like jimmy swaggart? if you want to rail against anyone i'd advise you go mr( i use that term lightly ) lew rockwell:     “during the period when the most incendiary items appeared—roughly 1989 to 1994—rockwell and the prominent libertarian theorist murray rothbard championed an open strategy of exploiting racial and class resentment to build a coalition with populist “paleoconservatives,” producing a flurry of articles and manifestos whose racially charged talking points and vocabulary mirrored the controversial paul newsletters recently unearthed bythe new republic.  “….the most detailed description of the strategy came in an essay rothbard wrote for the january 1992 rothbard-rockwell report, titled “right-wing populism: a strategy for the paleo movement.” lamenting that mainstream intellectuals and opinion leaders were too invested in the status quo to be brought around to a libertarian view, rothbard pointed to david duke and joseph mccarthy as models for an “outreach to the rednecks,” which would fashion a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition by targeting the disaffected working and middle classes. (duke, a former klansman, was discussed in strikingly similar terms in a 1990 ron paul political report.) these groups could be mobilized to oppose an expansive state, rothbard posited, by exposing an “unholy alliance of ‘corporate liberal’ big business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic underclass, who, among them all, are looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in america.”    quite frankly it's time dr. paul disavows lew and if lew was any kind of decent person he would come forward himself.   quote: but this wednesday, i spoke with tom lizardo, paul's congressional chief of staff. he now says that paul was prepared to finger rockwell in anticipation of ""angry white man."" lizardo says that last week--either on monday or tuesday--paul and benton agreed that the campaign would release a statement acknowledging that rockwell was a principal in the production of the newsletters. the statement was drafted by benton and approved by paul himself, lizardo told me. shortly before paul was about to go public, however, lizardo says kent snyder, the campaign's chairman, stepped in and ""stopped the outing of rockwell's involvement."" (snyder didn't respond to a phone message asking for a comment, and benton said, ""we are not going to talk to you anymore,"" when i attempted to question him about lizardo's claims.)  http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=a798dde9-f263-462b-b15c-6dfc538f03ff",1,

this crime on two separate occasions. he stated the police interest re his possible involvement stemmed from the fact a witness recalled seeing a car, subsequently identified as his, parked unattended on august 26 1970 the day the children disappeared, near where their bodies were subsequently found at antill creek midday on august 28.  foreman said he told the police he had lent the car to another man that day, who had suffered mechanical breakdown at that spot. that fellow foreman said, had telephoned him from a pub near there, telling him of the breakdown. foreman said he walked to the spot and found the car, but not the man. he walked to the pub and conversed with the female bar attendant, claiming he still had not found the man to whom he had allegedly lent the car. he walked back to the car, got it going and drove away. he said, as of mid 1987, the man to whom he says. he lent the car, was dead.  in 1987 the day after he told that tale, in the union rooms in precisely the same circumstances and in the same company as the previous day, he launched into the same story. his face was hideously contorted, and a ghastly light shone from his eyes, he was thrusting with his pelvis and hauling with his arms in 'a terrible parody of the sex act. he hooted and hollered and repeated the word tight, …tight …whhoo ….tight …thrusting and hauling, …whoa tight. at this time one concluded, he was admitting and boasting that he had indeed committed the crime.  we in the union allege, it was not an ' off the cuff' admission, but an attempt to entrap any member who may wish to go to the police. in that we allege, as soon as it became obvious to the police, who we allege were corrupt, who had come from brisbane homicide to townsville in 1970 to head the murder investigation, that foreman was guilty. they had, instead of charging him, decided to make use of him to carry out such deeds as were conducive to their corrupt activities. eventually infiltrating him into the p&amp;d's where he would make such admissions. then if anybody went to the police, bearing in mind he made the above disclosures in open crowded company, that person would be then exposed by the same police, back to mr foreman as an informer, to suffer such consequences as he saw fit:  bob foreman is not this person’s right name but the name under which he fought as a professional boxer. he was employed in the meatworks at townsville at the time of the sisters murders, and is a dark haired unkempt looking man of about 5 ' 9"", who answers the description of a man seen talking to the girls at the school bus stop on the morning of the day they disappeared. last seen by the author of this document in september 1998 in queen st. brisbane.   check foreman’s modus operandi re his disclosing details of this crime for the purpose of entrapment, someone goes to the police, they turn him in.  then look at the way alex jones encourages those with evidence to contact him, they do that, he

611712,"some men are rude and aggressive assholes. i'm not suggesting that's ok. rather, it's the attitude that men should be forbidden from interacting, in any environment, with women other than in ways very narrowly prescribed.  this is from the article:  *""there is no reason to think that a good-looking female poker player in her 20s is interested in any way in an old, egg-shaped, ugly man.""*  in other words, if you're not young,  thin, and beautiful, you don't deserve sex. you shouldn't ever even attempt to *meet* someone or befriend them, because you're only fit to hide away from the beautiful people.  this is the core message of the article, not that women are subject to harassment in poker tournaments. rather, that ""uppity"" men shouldn't be stepping outside their ""league"".  how is that any different from saying a black man approaching a white woman is inherently wrong? or that a gay man hitting on a straight one is doing something that inherently deserves a violent response?  some younger women enjoy dating older men. and vice-versa.   &gt;all her body language said she did not want to continue a conversation.  her **body-language** said it! and he should have picked up on it! that's not passive-aggressive in the slightest, expecting someone to pick up on subtle social cues who may not share a similar upbringing or psychology.   what i see in the article is a sad, socially inept older man, unable to pick up on subtle hints, is simply trying to make friends with a woman he finds appealing. yet the author, *and you*, seem to feel this constitutes some sort of crime. what punishment do you advocate? community service? prison? psychiatric treatment?  &gt;so his advances on her were not only uninvited, but repeatedly rejected.  why must engaging other people in public places in conversation be invited? do we not, all of us, regardless of gender, race, age, or looks, have a right to participate in society? weren't you just a few days ago angrily (so many of your posts seem to be angry) decrying the restaurant that was unhappy about the woman who brought her developmentally-disabled child who bothered other customers, and you were insisting on the child's right to be there?  do you not see the double standard here? child: free to yell &amp; scream in a restaurant, bothering the patrons. man: not allowed to speak to a woman who is ""better"" than him.  the author goes on to call the man stupid, and he quite likely was. in which case, it should be clear that subtle passive hints underlying a veneer of politeness *will not be very effective*. so i do not share your opinion that his advances were rejected, if the communication is so roundabout that a simplistic guy would simply not get it. ""fuck off"" can do wonders.  &gt;this may be news to you, but ""no"" means no.  he gave her his phone number! that's tantamount to rape!  &gt;that's why his sexuality is dirty and deserves contempt.  you're supporting the notion that male sexuality is dirty. this man was boorish. but that doesn't mean that men should be confined to social strait-jackets. he's an individual. in some parts of the world, women can't go  anywhere unescorted. haven't we determined that a socially-liberal society where individuals are free to live their lives unimpeded by restrictive religious or moral codes are preferable?  &gt;he insulted her integrity by assuming she'd cheat on her fiancee for him  many people have a different view of commitment. are you against open marriages and polyamory? anyway, the article says he *asked*. you're the one jumping to conclusions. was he oblivious and daft? probably. but this is insulting? no.  &gt;she has the right to not be forced into conversations she does not have.   &gt; forcing dialog she does not want to have.   &gt;insulted her rights as a human being by not respecting her rights to privacy (""are you still engaged?"")    these reveal the complete intellectual bankruptcy of your position.  conversing with someone in public is not force. and no, a person does not have the right to be not be conversed with. if someone's behavior veers into misdemeanor or criminal harassment, she can involve the police. but as far as i know, in most civilized nations we have the notion of *free speech*. you do not have the right to not be spoken to by others, anymore than you have the right to not be advertised to, to not see people you might not like in public (**them colored folks should keep to their own!**).  i seem to recall a while back you were strongly on the side of women breast-feeding in public. saying that you have a right not to be spoken to by someone you aren't interested in hearing from, is akin to the argument you have a right to not see a boob. it's puritanism and repression, just in a different form.   saying someone can only open their mouth when specifically allowed is no different in principle from social mores that dictated what length of skirt a woman must wear. ""can't have those ankles showing, you'll endanger morality.""  there was no force involved. if he grabbed hold of her, then he would be committing assault. i didn't see a mention of that in the article. *she was free to walk away, or clearly  and without ambiguity tell him to stop talking to her.* furthermore, *asking someone a personal question* in no way violates someone's right to privacy. *that's what makes it a question.*  if you honestly believe the rights of the women described in the article *were* violated, i invite you to describe the specific legal remedies you would choose to enact. what sort of penalties should men face for trying to make friends with women?  are poker tournaments likely unpleasant environments with people acting this way? absolutely. the game is newly popular with a younger crowd. there's definitely room for asking people to behave with better manners. but i dislike the insinuation that it is somehow *wrong*, for anyone, of any age, ethnicity, culture, gender and sexuality to attempt to interact with the people around them, whether it's to say hi, talk about politics, sell them on their religion, or request an orgy. they are all forms of communication. none involve force. dictating what people can or cannot say *is* a violation of rights; real ones, not imaginary ones.  i'm all for people treating each other respectfully (something you could do better yourself). but that's not something that can be forced.",0,

""darwin was particularly enthusiastic about the writings of william paley, including the argument for divine design in nature. it has been argued that darwin’s enthusiasm for paley’s religious adaptationism paradoxically played a role even later, when darwin formulated his theory of natural selection. in his finals in january 1831, he performed well in theology and, having scraped through in classics, mathematics and physics, came tenth out of a pass list of 178."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charles_darwin#early_life  and as i said above, evolutionary theory is confirmed by all the evidence, and has not been successfully challenged in 150 years. that's not a shoddy theory with shoddy evidence. it has been added to, with what we know of genetics, to form the [modern synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_evolutionary_synthesis), which is essentially the foundation of modern biology.   evolution is like any other area of science: it involves the study of the natural world. it's effectively silent on religion.   it appears you have emotional reasons to reject evolution; not intellectual ones, probably based on attachment to some particular worldview. that's fine; but it just means your comments about evolution and every rational person who accepts it are wholly misguided.  the same scientific rigour and processes that give you tv, computers, modern agriculture and manufacturing, civil engineering and flight, are the ones that give us evolutionary biology. science is a competitive and adversarial world, where people's careers are built on overturning old ideas and putting forth their own. yet as i said, evolutionary theory still stands, because it fits the evidence, and is the only rational conclusion to be drawn from it.  &gt;the lack of dialogue between the two communities, for which we can blame both creationists and evolutionists, is what keeps me from respecting either side.  biologists have no obligation to pay attention to creationists, any more than astronomers need to listen to flat-earthers. the creationists have proven, time and time again, they are willing to lie and distort to put forward their beliefs, and know almost nothing about actual science. they have a belief based on bronze-age mythology that they cling to desperately, and reject evolutionary science out of that faith, not out of reason.   the catholic church, and the majority of protestant denominations, the majority of christians worldwide, all accept evolution; albeit believing god had some invisible hand in it somehow.  this isn't a dispute between two equal sides who both have some claim to truth. it's scientists with evidence on one side, and religious fundamentalists on the other.  however, numerous scientists and scientific groups, like dawkins, gould, the national academies, berkeley and so on do step into the fray and put forward science's side, and counter the assertions of creationists.",0,

442817,"while youre going to the polling booth, remember why youre voting obama. here are my reasons:  1. when obama recently made an issue of the number of houses the mccains own, mccain shot back with much heavier artillery: obama's friend rezko is a convicted felon, sitting in jail. obama is the candidate of chicago corruption. his other cronies auchi and alsammare are also convicted felons who have stolen hundreds of millions from the iraqi provisional authority and from the government in illinois. this has been detailed by investigative journalist evelyn pringle on opednews, and by webster tarpley in his forthcoming book, ""barack h. obama: the unauthorized biography.""  2. obama has very close links to the convicted weathermen terrorist bombers bill ayres and bernardine dohrn. he shared board memberships with ayres on the woods fund and the chicago annenberg challenge. this and most of the following scandals are detailed in tarpley's ""obama - the postmodern coup: making of a manchurian candidate,"" released in june.  3. obama is very close to the racist demagogues rev. jeremiah wright, otis moss iii, hopkins, meeks, and pfleger.  4. obama has been accused in federal court of using crack cocaine by larry sinclair, along with gay sex. the obama camp retaliated by arresting sinclair in an enemies list operation by beau biden, son of veep candidate joe biden.  5. the mysterious deaths of black gays in and around wright's church: donald young, nate spencer, larry bland could be linked to obama.  6. obama's relations to chechen terrorism through ilyas achmadov.  7. his relations to cia-controlled palestinian factions khalidi and abu nimah.  8. the mysterious deaths of key clinton delegates and floor leaders just before the convention: bill gwatney and tubbs jones.  9. the alleged michelle obama hate whitey tape.  10. two mysterious envelopes sent to mccain hq with powder in them raised questions of what obama's fanatical supporters may be capable of.   11. he helped give the banksters robbing us blind over 5 trillion by voting for the bailout, and actively calling members of the house to vote for it. get real, hes a pawn of the wall street finance oligarchs. democrats say obama key in bailout vote switch http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081003/pl_afp/usfinancebankingvoteobama",0,
550989,"1) i do not justify the killing of anybody.   2) ""i see it as more they are telling the west do as you preach. respect ""our"" rights just as you want your rights to be respected."" this makers no sense. the danes have the right to freedom of speech. when they write something that the muslim community disagrees with, violence occurs in denmark. the muslim community does not have the right to tell the and person from a different culture what to write.   3) the interesting question is what is similarity between jewish person from new jersey, moscow, eastern europe, africa, ...? why instead fighting for the rights of jews in their native lands, they all have be transplanted to live in middle of arabs?  jewish people have always viewed the judaism as a culture. this is largely because of centuries of antisemetism. the ""brilliance"" behind the creation of israel was the un, not israel itself. that said, it was only under arab rule that jews and christians could not pray at their holy sites in the middle east.   4) ""for tactical reasons, jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to haifa and jaffa but a russian can as long as his mother is jewish!""  not my quote. the point of the quote is that pr and propaganda play heavily into the plight of the palestinians, but the arab press would have you believe that it is just the evil jews.   5) ""i am not saying; am reasoning with logic as to why this should not be disrespectful.""  see this is why i even find your argument offensive. you tried to claim that i should not find a likening of a jew to a nazi offensive when the nazi's systematically killed 1/3 of the group that i identify me with. making that comparison, based on lies and half truths is incredibly offensive and raises violence against jews world wide. you argument that those cartoons are not offensive is very week. you will notice that i did nto argue that muslims should not find the cartoon offensive, they just shouldn't kill any one about it ..   6) ""ye for an eye. the question is do we want to live in a blind world that the danish cartoons can lead us to.""   see here is the point ... there is nothing wrong with cartoons back and forth. unlike the muslim community, the jewish community did not kill any one over those cartoons and those cartoons appear in newspapers regularly. so an eye for an eye leaves non-muslims dead (because the muslims killed them) and leaves muslims writing offensive things about other cultures. this is the entire point of my argument. the muslm community cannot write whatever they want and throw a hissy fit and cause violence when others do the same.  7) ""i disagree that ""there is not even a remote similarity"". don't you see that nazis were trying to force the jews out to clear way for their pure aryan nation. just as the zionist are trying to push local arab population (christians, muslims, ...) for their biblical ""promise land"". same goals, different tactics.""  this is where it is not subjective.  a) ""nazis were trying to force the jews out to clear way for their pure aryan nation."" no ... the nazis were systematically killing jews. the palestinian population in and out of israel has risen. if it were based on race they would be killing israeli arab citizens. additionally, they are not trying to force arabs out of israel at all. many arabs (1.7 million) live peacefully.    you have imputed a goal upon the israelis (forcing all arabs out) which is unfounded. the israelis invite arabs to israel, it just has to be careful about palestinians who have a lifelong pattern of random assault. if you can't see the difference between the nazis and the israelis it is because your bias has become so great that you are no longer working in logic. if you can't see how comparing israelis to nazis as an obvious form of propaganda to denigrate israel, then you need to be educated on propaganda.   would it be fair for me to call the syrians nazis for kicking out the jews? no, and they actually did this, unlike israel which allows arabs to live and prey freely.how about the egyptions, the lebonese? it would be propogandous for me to make a comparison. the nazis had forced labor camps, death chambers and other things more horrible than the anything going on in the middle east. it is ridiculous that you would make the comparison.",1,
590340,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7425187.stm  ----------------------------------------------   on wednesday 3 november i was driving along the embankment towards the city when a police constable stepped out into the road and flagged me down. it was 11.30 in the morning, and i was in reasonable time for a meeting with some corporate lawyers which was due to start at midday.  the constable was accompanied by another policeman and a group of three men in what looked a little like traffic wardens’ uniforms, with pale blue bands round their caps. these, i later discovered, were mr blunkett’s new militia, the police community support officers. their task, according to sir john stevens, is to ‘perform the vital role of security patrols in central london, deterring criminals and providing intelligence to police officers’.  ‘we are conducting random stop and search under current anti-terrorist legislation,’ began the constable, addressing me through my open side window. ‘would you mind if we searched your vehicle? we’re training these new community support officers.’  although a little worried about being late for my meeting, i was impressed by their air of professionalism and vigilance. i was pleased that the government was doing something to keep us all safe and thought it would be selfish to refuse. ‘i don’t mind at all,’ i replied, ‘as long as it doesn’t take a huge amount of time.’  i unlocked the doors and they went through my car and its contents: my overnight bag, my wash bag and glove box. next, they gestured towards my briefcase and asked if i could open it. of course, i said, and as i lifted the lid i pointed out to them a victorinox swiss multi-tool, contained in a small webbing case, and a small collapsible baton, contained in another piece of webbing.  it is perfectly legal to buy both of these items. the penknife i carry because i find it useful for many small everyday tasks —cutting through packaging, opening bottles. the baton i bought over the internet to keep at home for security reasons. i live in a rural part of suffolk that, although thankfully relatively crime-free, is policed very sparsely. i often hear people outside the house at night — that same wednesday evening, for instance, my wife discovered a harmless but mentally ill tramp yelling loudly in a nearby barn — and i feel more comfortable with the baton inside the front door. a week or so before my police search, i had discovered my nine- and twelve-year-old girls playing with it and had locked it in my briefcase for safekeeping.  the community support officers reacted immediately. they behaved as if they had never seen a penknife before, pulling out the bottle-opener, the corkscrew, the thing that gets stones out of horses’ hooves. ‘this device has a locking blade,’ said the constable, after which a short, whispered debate ensued. my goodwill towards the police began to give way to alarm. i reached for my mobile to call the lawyers and explain that i was going to be late for my meeting, but the constable stopped me. ‘turn that phone off,’ he said. ‘you’re about to be arrested for possessing offensive weapons and carrying a bladed instrument in public. you’ll be allowed one call when we get you to charing cross police station.’  i felt confused and indignant. as we stood by the side of the road, waiting for a police van to arrive, i asked the constable whether this whole business was, in his opinion, a valuable use of police time and resources. this was when the policemen and the pcsos started to become hostile. ‘you’ve committed an offence, mate, and you’d better get used to the fact that you’re going down for six months,’ said one policeman.  ‘do you realise, sir,’ said another, ‘that behind us is the ministry of defence, a key target for potential terrorists?’  ‘but why did you stop me in the first place: do i seriously look like a potential terrorist?’ i asked.  ‘we stop one in every 25 cars on a random basis, and, let me tell you, sir, criminals and terrorists come in many different guises,’ replied the policeman.  ‘shouldn’t you be concentrating on men of arab extraction?’ this seemed to me to be a sensible question, relevant to the current state of the world. the policeman said, ‘that is a racist comment, sir.’ then the van appeared. i was locked in the back and ferried to charing cross. as we drove there, the policemen made small talk. they told me that they would be out for a pint tonight, whereas i was going to prison. they wondered what it would feel like for me not to be sleeping in my own bed.  upon arrival at charing cross, i was subjected to the as-seen-on-tv rigmarole of being booked in by the desk sergeant. most of the questions focused on my racial origin and hiv status. they asked if i had a craving for non-prescription drugs, and if i required any religious paraphernalia. my belt and personal effects were removed, and after a statutory telephone call to my lawyer i was ‘banged up’.  by this time it was about 12.20 and i spent the next three hours dozing on a wooden bench. at about 4.30 p.m., my solicitor had arrived and it was time for an ‘interview under caution’. first, i had to be fingerprinted. the police constable who had originally flagged me down reappeared, and began the arduous business of ‘processing’ me. the man’s lack of competence was comical. he had problems applying my fingers to what appeared to be a sophisticated and expensive fingerprint-scanning machine, and with each failed attempt he became angrier and angrier. tired and fed up, i gave in to the temptation to needle him. ‘having problems with your new toy?’ i asked. he replied, ‘shut the fuck up, you arsehole.’  he was no better at operating the tape recorder used for my interview. much fumbling of cassettes was followed by screeching noises from the equipment. during the interview itself, i found him inarticulate, incompetent and only tenuously in control of his temper.  after the interview, i was re-introduced to my cell. i understood from my solicitor that the same police constable would speak to the crown prosecution service, and a decision would be made about whether to charge me formally. i was also told that if the policeman had wanted to, he could have let me off with a caution after my car had been searched and the penknife and baton discovered.  sitting in my cell, i thought a bit about the way i had been treated. for the police to be behaving like this at a time when we are all concerned about terrorism and street crime, and when resources are stretched and manpower is limited, seemed extraordinary. it was also, i decided, in direct contrast to the qualities of professionalism, endurance and discipline that are the hallmark of britain’s armed forces. i have (now long outdated) personal experience of two training establishments, the old guards’ depot at pirbright and the royal military academy at sandhurst, both of which are successful in creating tough but professional men who are in control of their actions and able to make sensible decisions under pressure. whether on the streets of belfast, in the mountains of bosnia or in the deserts of iraq, lieutenants and second lieutenants as young as 19 and 20 provide the linchpin between senior officers and rank-and-file men on the ground.",1,
385043,"ugh.  i knew i should've shied away from calling out paul on his economic nonsense; it has a tendency to bring out all the crazies.  1.  people do realize that it's the fed's primary responsibility to keep down inflation, right?  and they're doing a pretty damn good job... cpi has been in the low single digits for over two decades now (*oh yeah, that's right, i forgot, cpi number aren't legit*.  you do realize they you're coming across similar to the same nutjobs that drone on and on about how the global warming numbers *aren't legit*).  2.  oh, i forgot, inflation never happens under the gold standard!  back in the 19th century, what was one of the main economic afflictions?  gold rushes.  why?  because whenever a huge new source of gold was found, the supply of gold would expand rapidly and suddenly inflation would result.  with the federal reserve, we have a group of bankers that manage the money supply, rather than let our economy suffer under largely random supply shocks.   3.  of course the federal reserve ""prints up money"", it needs to expand the money supply in order to keep up with economic growth.  for the vaguely economic literate, recall that m=v*q.  when q (gdp) goes up, m (money) needs to increase as well.  what happens under the gold standard?  well, say there's a huge technological breakthrough, and output skyrocketing.  if there's no new gold discoveries, than money supply is fixed and output is expanding resulting in one of two things: either deflation, or limiting the growth that we could've had.  4.  pop quiz: what's the united states' outstanding debt as a % of gdp?  around 42%.  keep in mind that this is the total debt, not the deficit.  this pales in comparison to countries like italy, israel, and lebanon, all of which have public debt at over 100% of gdp.  for all the hype, if you look at our debt in % terms (which you should) rather than nominal terms the debt is very manageable.  if we increased taxes to european levels without an increase in spending the debt would be gone within a decade.  even it its current levels, the deficit is not big enough to crowd out private investment; as it stands now our public debt is not a huge problem and perhaps even slightly healthy.  5.  ""out of control spending is correlated with wars"".  this statement sounds... completely worthless.  first, i guess it goes without saying - citation please?  second, taking your statement at face value, of course high levels of government spending are correlated with wars (uh... wars have to be financed somehow), the rub is whether or not high spending causes wars, which is your subtle thesis.  post hoc ergo propter hoc.  6.  the iraq war wasn't ""to get oil"" (one of the more ridiculous assertions) - it was because there was a group of blind ideologues that falsely believed that with the absence of the ussr, the united states had enough military power to effective shape the world into its vision of what it should be.  for as much as people rightfully lambaste the group, it may be helpful to actually read the ideas of the project for a new american century.  sure, the ideas are wrong, but try to criticize them in an intellectual manner than simply saying ""they took us to iraq to get some oil"".  it's just plain not true.",0,

224285,"knowing where i ended up, people often want to know if i was molested as a child. i wasn't, but not for lack of trying.  i first discovered the exciting world of sexual abuse in sixth grade, when my elementary school passed out educational comic books as part of a health fair. the plot centered on a gang of pleasantly diverse superheroes who rescued kids from the horrors of physical and sexual abuse. there was a whole teeming underbelly of titillation that i alone was privy to by grace of being the only student dorky enough to actually read the comic book. the kids inside had stumbling alcoholic parents at whom they screamed ""i hate you"" and got lots of attention from the compassionate adults who wanted to help them. it was like the days of our lives of child abuse.  just when you thought matt was going to get socked for missing curfew, the non-threatening black kid appeared to rescue him before fist hit mandible. but when sally's somewhat-dashing alcoholic father made suggestive comments to sally, i felt my face flush. i looked around at the other desks, but no one else had lucked into this school-sanctioned pornography. sally was drawn scared and upset by the artist, her eyes quivering with urgent motion lines. i rubbed my pencil against the page, wishing i could erase her distress into sexy complicity, thus increasing my vicarious thrill. i wanted the non-threatening black kid to come back and engage sally in a threesome with her boorish pops while i watched.  afterward, i found no shortage of young adult novels with which to feed my ignominious appetites. after reading about a girl who gets molested by her dentist, i spent my time in the chair sucking in my stomach and trying to look sexy with wads of cotton in my cheeks. i quivered with anticipation when alone with an adult, breathlessly wishing and completely terrified that they would cross the line. i fantasized about someone taking advantage of me because it was the only kind of sex i could imagine being able to engage in without feeling guilty. as a southern baptist girl, i couldn't fantasize about boys my own age; having sex with one of them was like purchasing a one-way ticket to hell. but if the dentist, an adult in a position of authority, decided to drill me in more ways than one, well surely god couldn't be mad at me for that.  one of the girls at middle school told me that a pervert had once shown her his dick through the library window and i was green with envy. what had she done to deserve a pervert? i was busy scouring the card catalog for child abuse pintature and the most i got was a glimpse of my little brother's tiny wang as he sprinted from the bathroom to his bedroom. my entire childhood felt like watching a pervert jerk off through the library window – me, cocooned in a place of safety and learning, looking out at the dirty, visceral realities of life, intrigued but unable to connect.  as i grew older, the feeling of being on the fringes of something i couldn't quite participate in only increased. even at church camp, sex lurked in the forests beyond the chapel, where it was rumored that many attendees had lost their virginities. i was a graduate of the girls-only camp for the younger demographic, but the teen camp i started attending at 12 was like a den of iniquity compared to that place.  after a day sweatily crowded into outdoor church pews listening to sermons about the dangers of secular media, and singing songs about god (sample lyric: ""i don't want to be a hypocrite/ cause they're not hip with it/i don't wanna be a pharisee/cause they're not fair you see), the christian teenagers teemed into the camp for free time. puberty hormones and a healthy fear of god combined into a mighty aphrodisiac that had underage blondes rolling up and tying their what would jesus do t-shirts to show off tan navels and the pimply, jesus-loving boys hanging around the swimming pool drooling during the girls' segregated swimming time. all that fire and brimstone merely stoked the fire in our loins.  the camp had been around for a century and the rule book had changed little since it opening. though i had been warned of the rigorous rules about shorts lengths, i hadn't received any guidelines about swimwear. so when my grandmother had taken me to dillard's, i had picked out a tasteful tank top with brief-cut bottoms like the other girls in my class were wearing. my intriguing and mysterious bumps, usually wrapped up like christmas presents, were hinted at by the cut of the new suit. when we changed before the scheduled swim, the other girls were staring at me. i instantly felt awkward, my skin peeking out white and fluffy like a cumulus cloud in a pillowcase.  ""look who's getting boobs!"" shouted one of the girls, actually poking at the fleshy orb spilling over the top of my bathing suit. mortified, i crossed my arms over my chest, but not before i had noticed that yes, she was right, i was getting boobs. big boobs. big, gorgeous boobs which would later earn me an extra 50 an hour but which at that moment seemed low on the list of things a young woman would want on her chest. a kinder girl led me away from the crowd rapidly gathering around my puberty sideshow and explained that the camp did not allow two-piece bathing suits.  stuck back on my bunk with no television or company, i flipped open my personalized precious moments bible (it would be replaced within the year by a ""true love waits"" bible). starting from ""in the beginning,"" it didn't take me long to realize that the bible was chock-ful of kinky shit. before i was even out of genesis, lot's slutty daughters were devising plans to get knocked up by dad. there was more rape, incest, and adultery than on telenova, and i didn't really notice what i was doing when one hand slipped inside my past-the-knee-length shorts.  even with all the admittedly sinful diddling and fingering and rubbing and stroking i had done before, i had never once done something as terrible, as sacrilegious as what i found myself doing now.  i was masturbating to the bible.  i don't remember what section in particular it was that got me so steamed up, although i think it was in the old testament. what i do remember is the sense of horror when i realized what i was doing. i knew i should ask god for forgiveness, but i was frankly too ashamed to face him. that night, as the swaying and weeping teenagers repented from the afternoon's pg hedonism, i made my way down the aisle to ""rededicate my life to christ"" and just hoped that would take care of it without getting too specific.",1,

281033,"""new"" software ulead.photoimpact 12 ulead photoimpact 12 is your basic terrific image editor. with version 12 ulead adds a broad range of handy new features. for starters, there are photo frames, 17 new effects filters (pen and ink, cartoon, and engraving, to name just a few), and a new touch-up tool for subtly removing image defects. and three new selection tools make it easier to work with specific area of an image: smart lasso, which draws a selection border around complex objects; extract object, to isolate an image element from a background; and match background color, for seamlessly merging an extracted element back into the image. ulead has fluffed up version 10.0's interface with dockable toolbars and panels, while retaining the unusual (and clever) visual thumbnails for applying effects. the ui is totally configurable; customising is just a matter of dragging buttons and toolbars around the screen, docking, or letting them float, depending on how you work. when you load the program, you'll see what seems like a bazillion buttons and bars on the display. fortunately, they are logically arranged. a standard toolbar on the left holds buttons for manipulating and adjusting images. arrayed along the top of the display are bars for changing tool settings and managing files. although the interface looks cluttered, it's configurable and easy to master. on the right side of the display is the hub of the interface: a set of panels for managing layers and documents, applying effects, and accessing quick commands. this last panel is especially useful for repetitive work, as it holds common tasks and a history of all editing changes you've applied to an image. you can save any command sequence in a macro to use again. the easypalette panel displays a neat tree structure of available items. when you select an entry, it shows the available choices as thumbnails to the right of the tree. for example, if you choose special effects, it shows engraving and finger paint among the options. to apply an effect or add an object, just double-click or drag the thumbnail onto the image. all effects may be easily fine-tuned by right-clicking it and adjusting the settings. we think this visual thumbnail approach is clever and especially appropriate for casual users and those who love to experiment. you can customise all the settings for each effect. there are two main views in easypalette: galleries and libraries. the galleries view lets you add a brain-bending number of special effects, including photo frames, fills, lighting, animation, text, deformations, and touch-up. if you switch to the library by clicking a button at the top of the palette, you can drop in shapes, outlines, paths, masks, and images. finally, easypalette also holds a nice selection of templates for instantly creating web pages, slide shows, business cards, posters, and cd covers. of course, if you dislike the panels or want to maximise screen space, you can always close them and use the plain-vanilla menus and toolbars to adjust every aspect of your photo. photoimpact is equally at home with bitmap, vector, and text objects, and it has a full range of tools for assembling surprisingly complex documents. version 10.0 beefs up digital camera support with a wizard for downloading images from your digicam. the browse manager displays exif information (camera and photo metadata), and there are several new filters specifically for digital photos, including improved remove red eye, touch up, and reduce noise. photoimpact updates its high dynamic range feature, which combines multiple exposures into a single image to brighten dark areas and darken lights in high-contrast photos; it now compensates for movement between the bracketed original shots. this feature can also mask out specific areas of component images and includes histogram clipping to adjust the displayed tonal range. use the extract object command to remove the background of an image. even if there were nothing else in the box, photoimpact would be a steal. but ulead bundles extra goodies with the image editor. most useful are photoimpact album, a decent image manager that's beginning to show its age; and photoexplorer, a visual file manager for executing batch commands, quickly sending images via e-mail, and browsing and acquiring images from memory cards, scanners, and cameras. the handy photo explorer makes short work out of browsing, e-mailing, converting images, and executing commands on a group of files. for web animations, ulead provides a program called gif animator. cool 360 is a wizard-driven app that creates panoramas from a set of photos and lets you output directly to e-mail, screensavers, printers, and the internet. and there are light versions of alien skin's splat and eye candy filters, plus hemera graphic desk for exploring and purchasing online clip art. also included in the package are 10 excellent video tutorials to get you started. this is one wonderful bundle, and we recommend it highly for quick and easy image editing. 1.---------------- ""new"" software http://www.soft82.com/images/produse/poze_medii/146.jpg http://images.digitalmedianet.com/2006/week_45/kcpehahe/story/expressfix500.jpg http://soft.bramjnet.com/uploads/posts/1192571407_ulead-photoimpact_2.png http://www.imaging-resource.com/events/pmas00/images/pdrboth_l.jpg http://images.digitalmedianet.com/2006/week_45/kcpehahe/story/welcomescreen500.jpg http://tppdomains.net.au/images/download_button.jpg ======================================================================= ulead.photoimpact 12 http://rapidshare.com/files/75092846/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part1.rar http://rapidshare.com/files/75094919/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part2.rar http://rapidshare.com/files/75169228/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part3.rar http://rapidshare.com/files/75188837/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part4.rar",0,

542456,"i live in california, a blue state. because of this, it has long been my view that my vote doesn’t matter. no matter which way i vote, my state will still vote for the democratic candidate in national elections. the same could be said if i lived in a red state - my vote would be drowned out by a sea of republican votes regardless of who i vote for. frankly, i think that while the electoral college may have been a necessary crutch when the country was first founded in order to find a makeshift balance between rural and urban voters, it has since come to be a blight on our democracy that has resulted in a country where the only votes that really count in a national election are those in swing states.  however, i have come to realize that this year is different. as one of a million snowflakes that form an avalanche, my vote can help to make a victory for my candidate into something more than victory. it can become a landslide. and while i still believe that my vote has little impact in the actual selecting of our next president, this year it can send a message.  my vote can help to send a message that i refuse to accept the politics of hate, of fear and mudslinging. my vote can help to send a message that we don’t react kindly when a candidate lies or tries to mislead the public. my vote can help to send a message that we feel we desperately need change, and simply tossing around the words “maverick”, “change”, and “washington outsider” doesn’t make them true. my vote can help to send a message that in spite of the attempts by those on the other side of the issues to paint our views as wrong and out-of-touch, that they cannot dissuade us from a path we know to be right.  if we only see a victory, no doubt the pollsters and the pundits will try to find some other reason for it. it was voter fraud. it was a celebrity image. it was style over substance. it was bad timing. it was a series of unlucky events in the news. it was a biased media. it was ignorance...  but if we see a landslide, i believe that all but the most biased and deluded will be forced to come to the conclusion that this was not some mere whim of voters, a fad, a brief love affair. this was america loudly and clearly sending the message that we need change. not just change from our last president, not just change from the political party in control of the white house, but a change to the very way america works.  with my vote, i plan on doing something far more important than helping to select the next leader of this country. with my vote, i intend to declare loudly and publicly, along with millions of others in my country, that i love america, that i have hope for america, and that i want to see america turn into something more than what it has become. with my vote, i want to add one more voice to the crowd of people demanding that our great nation must no longer be torn apart by party politics, and that the path we must forge ahead must be done with honesty and integrity and intelligence and compassion.  no political candidate is perfect. no political party is an absolute authority on morality, wisdom and virtue. but when i vote, i do not just vote for a candidate. when i vote, i do not just vote for a party. when i vote, i vote for change.  and so i ask those of you who, like me, do not live in swing states, to send a message this election day that your votes do matter. those of you in blue states and red states, join me in voting, not for a man or an administration or a party, but for the change we need in this country, the change we need for america.",0,

741809,"when i was younger i read a bunch of the dalai lama's stuff. it was when he was peaking in exposure and i happened to be reading a lot about eastern religion.   i found it to be moralistic bullshit, i.e. he basically says ""everybody should be kind and love each other"", sentiments i found to be unhelpful and aggravatingly meaningless. enforced new age niceness ""because it's enlightened"" is bs. an evolving human will, by their own experience, get past this type of pretense into what is honest and true. eventually they may reach the same conclusions re love and compassion, but you can't just tell them the end result ""be loving"" and be done with it.    he espouses nonviolence. nice sentiment. he lost his country because his weak army was slaughtered and he only escaped because of cia intervention. if his philosophy was one of world engagement, diplomacy, and military strength, with spirituality in its proper place within the culture, he would still have tibet. then his people wouldn't be in the situation they are in, which is one of looking back in regret.   and, if you are in that position, best to move on with it and deal with the world as it is. you can't expect to change china's mind by crying about it. china is a billion-strong behemoth. i always thought that those free tibet bumperstickers circa 1996 indicated that the occupants of the vehicle were complete fucking ninnies. not because it wouldn't be nice, but because they're fucking clueless about the way the world works. even more annoying that that kind of college student/nanny/organic chemist think the world should do what you say because of your purported, recently discovered spiritual enlightenment. (see: stuff white ppl like.com) but i noticed people eventually took them off anyway, because they realized it was stupid. and maybe that they actually didn't know shit about the politics of the actual situation anyway. not that it wouldn't be nice.  i happened to see him speak publicly, to an adoring crowd of portlanders. i was open to the experience even though he hadn't said anything i found valuable. from observing him i came to the conclusion he was manipulative, controlling, and strangely inauthentic poser who plays his spiritual and royal credentials to the hilt.   he is like an annoying, fake-nice, and ultimately evil and controlling aunt.  why do i feel this way? 1) distaste for his annoyingly authoritative moralism, which did get a lot of exposure and publication more due to his celebrity status as a deposed spiritual leader than his actual insight or helpfulness. eckhart tolle, for example, is someone i would consider as an authentic teacher or coach with real credentials and no political agenda. 2) observing him as a person, intuition, and my gut feeling.  i rarely bash him to anyone as it rarely ever comes up, but this is something i feel strongly about. i think he's bullshit and he can go fuck himself.   no i am not chinese or have any personal or nationalistic vendetta against him.  why so angry? because of experiences i had growing up in religion, i feel very strongly about people who claim to be able to help other people find answers in their life. i appreciate value where i find it, and where there is reputation but no value, i am disgusted, saddened, and pissed. well, not so much anymore, but when i was in my late teens, these were big things to me. re fake religion, see scientology, the secret (69% of it anyway), most religion, astrology (?)

938607,"for those of you blocked at work, it's a biggun:  i graduated from college in may, and this summer seemed like a good time to go through the box of papers and assignments i had been saving since the start, both to reminisce and to do a little cleanup.  tucked in a folder of an old notebook at the very bottom of the box was the essay that follows. written in longhand, it was the first assignment from the first class in my first semester.  ***********************************************************  january 20, 2003 english 1a professer ___________  my best summer memory  hey man, i’m not really sure if you’re supposed to put an introduction in this thing, but here goes anyway. my name is ____________. my assignment today is to write an essay about the best thing that happened to me this last summer.  i know everybody’s been kinda looking at me in class, wondering why a dude in his thirties is taking english 1a instead of being out there working a job. i’m not too keen on talking about myself much. most folks aren’t, i guess, unless they’re paris hilton. but since the assignment is a personal essay i suppose i don’t have much choice. anyways the best thing that happened to me this last summer was when i finally got outta prison based on that dna evidence.  i’ll tell you man, if you can’t appreciate getting outta prison then you haven’t been there to begin with. for me it started about three years ago when this chick got murdered in east san jose while opening up her plumbing supply shop. me and merle came by a couple weeks later to pick up some pvc for a sprinkler repair, and for some reason the dude behind the counter thought we was a little suspicious, so he called the cops. they put me in a line up, but of course the dude already knew what i looked like and what clothes i was wearing so it wasn’t that tough to pick me out. other than that there was no real evidence, but i didn’t have an alibi and i had a couple drunk and disorderlies on my record back from when me and merle used to fight each other for fun after closing time.  they had it in their minds i was guilty, and they kept after me for two days, yelling and throwing stuff at me and telling me made-up stories about how merle told them i did it. i always figured i was pretty tough but after awhile it just wore me down. i had to look at some pictures of death row and i got showed on my arm where the needles would go and everybody called me dead man walking. they told me if i signed a confession i wouldn’t get the death penalty and i had to think about that one pretty hard. the lawyer they assigned to me smelled like he’d been pulling a cork during lunch and he fell asleep while they was questioning me. i knew i didn’t do nothing but sometimes life just ain’t all fair, and this seemed like one of those times. so i signed.  after the sentencing merle sold my truck and moved all my stuff into storage for me, and promised me he’d look after mussel shoals, my black lab. they sent me up to san quentin, and when i got there, i was put in the section with the black dudes.i found out later that’s what they do with new prisoners, except the blacks end up in the white section. i guess it’s to soften up the new inmates, i dunno. whatever the reason it didn’t take long for them to find this paleface. one day i turn around, and there they stood, the welcoming committee.  it didn’t take but one look to realize they weren’t there to bring me a fruit basket. i figured this was gonna be a test of me, find out if they could push me around, so i got a good shot in on the first one and broke his nose. since it was four on one, i was looking at an ass-kickin for sure, so i didn’t follow up on the others too much, to try and keep ‘em from getting too mad. well man, was i ever wrong about that. they got me face down, one on each arm and leg, then they got my pants down. about this time, right up till the last minute, i was thinking, this can't be happening to me.  the dude whose nose i broke went first. i was heaving and twisting my body trying to get loose, but the others held me down good. he started to poke around and then forced himself in. i never in my life had anything hurt like that, man. everything got all cloudy and i heard him call me his white bitch. bits of snot and blood from his nose dripped down on the cement next to my head. it’s the only time in my life i ever tried to talk to god. first i asked him why. then i asked him to help me. and he never said a word.  you know, the only thing worse than being shined on by god is having it happen at a time like that, man. but it’s just like the preachers say: you can’t fool god. he knows why you’re finally talking to him – because you need help. so god never answered me, and i was on my own. and the only thing i wanted to do was to die.  when he was done, he got up and kicked me in the head. that in a way was kind of a blessing, cause i don't remember anything that happened after that for awhile, and i'm pretty sure the rest of those dudes took their turns.  a few weeks later, they came around again. i knew what was coming this time, and i didn’t hold anything back. i popped three of em pretty good before they got me down and did me again. they got the better of me, no question, but i left them worse for wear. that was the first time i ever saw a black eye on a black dude.  by this time i was hoping they’d think i just ain’t worth the trouble. there were plenty of others there that were easier pickins than me. but this wasn't about finding someone for sex, it was about breaking me down. so i got another visit from my new buddies. this time, they kinda formed a circle around me before moving in, and i could see in their eyes that some of them weren't really looking forward to this at all. well man, welcome to the fuckin club.  this time i ended up in the prison hospital and spent a couple weeks there. one day, i was laying there thinking about how much i hurt and wondering what a life sentence was gonna be like with this happening all the time, when one of the inmates working in the hospital starts talking to me and tells me about the aryan brotherhood and how i don't have to put up with the nee-grahs no more as long as i join up with em. and that’s how i ended up with the tattoo of the swastika and white power on my arm, right up there by the bicep.  well, time goes by and i’m getting settled into the routine of prison life, and no one is messing with my behind no more now that i’m in this white guy gang. then from outta the blue i find out that that someone from the pine hills youth correctional facility in montana got religious and wrote a letter confessing to killing that chick. he was just a kid, only seventeen years old. can you believe that? well, no one at san quentin did. no one takes you seriously when you tell em you’re innocent, cause everybody in prison says they’re innocent. i didn’t have the letter or anything, just what i heard, so no one gave a shiet.  so i wrote to merle, and he sent some dude from the innocence project to visit me. next thing i know the prison doctor is scraping some skin from the inside of my mouth, and one day, just like that, they're walking me out the door and on my way. course it didn’t take more than five minutes to be up to my ass in ambulance chasers all wanting to help me sue the government for my troubles. most of em didn’t smell much different than the public defender, and i began to wonder if i was ever gonna get a lawyer who wasn’t a fall-down drunk. the dudes at the innocence project gave me the name of some chick up in san francisco to call. that was kinda far away for me, but she turned out to be a pretty good lawyer and didn’t smell of booze either. she spent a lot of time yelling at the guys from the city, and let me tell you man, after listening to that i sure was glad she was working for me and not them. in the end, i got some money, not a lot, cause i wasn't in all that long and of course i didn’t tell a soul about the other stuff, but it was enough to get my trailer and a good truck, and they also promised to pay for retraining which is why i’m taking this class.  once i got all signed up for school and the dust settled down, i figured i better get rid of that tattoo. so i called up merle and told him to come on over and give me a hand with it. we heated up a weeding tool in the barbeque, and i bit down on a little stick of wood while merle burnt off the tattoo with the weeder. you know, i never stopped biting that stick, but when the flesh started to burn, i tried to push everything outta me like emptying a squeeze bottle of heinz ketchup. all the shame, all the rage i was carrying around inside me since i got out. i just forced it all outta me and i guess i yelled a good deal, cause merle was looking at me kinda funny when it was done.  merle's my best friend, and i figured maybe it was ok if i told him about it all, so i did. and when i was done, there was a long silence, then he kinda looked at me and asked in a quiet voice if i was gonna make him burn my bunghole too, and finish the job. that merle, he's as dumb as a box of rocks, but he always finds a way to make me laugh.",1,

185636,"""new"" software ulead.photoimpact 12 ulead photoimpact 12 is your basic terrific image editor. with version 12 ulead adds a broad range of handy new features. for starters, there are photo frames, 17 new effects filters (pen and ink, cartoon, and engraving, to name just a few), and a new touch-up tool for subtly removing image defects. and three new selection tools make it easier to work with specific area of an image: smart lasso, which draws a selection border around complex objects; extract object, to isolate an image element from a background; and match background color, for seamlessly merging an extracted element back into the image. ulead has fluffed up version 10.0's interface with dockable toolbars and panels, while retaining the unusual (and clever) visual thumbnails for applying effects. the ui is totally configurable; customising is just a matter of dragging buttons and toolbars around the screen, docking, or letting them float, depending on how you work. when you load the program, you'll see what seems like a bazillion buttons and bars on the display. fortunately, they are logically arranged. a standard toolbar on the left holds buttons for manipulating and adjusting images. arrayed along the top of the display are bars for changing tool settings and managing files. although the interface looks cluttered, it's configurable and easy to master. on the right side of the display is the hub of the interface: a set of panels for managing layers and documents, applying effects, and accessing quick commands. this last panel is especially useful for repetitive work, as it holds common tasks and a history of all editing changes you've applied to an image. you can save any command sequence in a macro to use again. the easypalette panel displays a neat tree structure of available items. when you select an entry, it shows the available choices as thumbnails to the right of the tree. for example, if you choose special effects, it shows engraving and finger paint among the options. to apply an effect or add an object, just double-click or drag the thumbnail onto the image. all effects may be easily fine-tuned by right-clicking it and adjusting the settings. we think this visual thumbnail approach is clever and especially appropriate for casual users and those who love to experiment. you can customise all the settings for each effect. there are two main views in easypalette: galleries and libraries. the galleries view lets you add a brain-bending number of special effects, including photo frames, fills, lighting, animation, text, deformations, and touch-up. if you switch to the library by clicking a button at the top of the palette, you can drop in shapes, outlines, paths, masks, and images. finally, easypalette also holds a nice selection of templates for instantly creating web pages, slide shows, business cards, posters, and cd covers. of course, if you dislike the panels or want to maximise screen space, you can always close them and use the plain-vanilla menus and toolbars to adjust every aspect of your photo. photoimpact is equally at home with bitmap, vector, and text objects, and it has a full range of tools for assembling surprisingly complex documents. version 10.0 beefs up digital camera support with a wizard for downloading images from your digicam. the browse manager displays exif information (camera and photo metadata), and there are several new filters specifically for digital photos, including improved remove red eye, touch up, and reduce noise. photoimpact updates its high dynamic range feature, which combines multiple exposures into a single image to brighten dark areas and darken lights in high-contrast photos; it now compensates for movement between the bracketed original shots. this feature can also mask out specific areas of component images and includes histogram clipping to adjust the displayed tonal range. use the extract object command to remove the background of an image. even if there were nothing else in the box, photoimpact would be a steal. but ulead bundles extra goodies with the image editor. most useful are photoimpact album, a decent image manager that's beginning to show its age; and photoexplorer, a visual file manager for executing batch commands, quickly sending images via e-mail, and browsing and acquiring images from memory cards, scanners, and cameras. the handy photo explorer makes short work out of browsing, e-mailing, converting images, and executing commands on a group of files. for web animations, ulead provides a program called gif animator. cool 360 is a wizard-driven app that creates panoramas from a set of photos and lets you output directly to e-mail, screensavers, printers, and the internet. and there are light versions of alien skin's splat and eye candy filters, plus hemera graphic desk for exploring and purchasing online clip art. also included in the package are 10 excellent video tutorials to get you started. this is one wonderful bundle, and we recommend it highly for quick and easy image editing. 1.---------------- ""new"" software http://www.soft82.com/images/produse/poze_medii/146.jpg http://images.digitalmedianet.com/2006/week_45/kcpehahe/story/expressfix500.jpg http://soft.bramjnet.com/uploads/posts/1192571407_ulead-photoimpact_2.png http://www.imaging-resource.com/events/pmas00/images/pdrboth_l.jpg http://images.digitalmedianet.com/2006/week_45/kcpehahe/story/welcomescreen500.jpg http://tppdomains.net.au/images/download_button.jpg ======================================================================= ulead.photoimpact 12 http://rapidshare.com/files/75092846/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part1.rar http://rapidshare.com/files/75094919/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part2.rar http://rapidshare.com/files/75169228/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part3.rar http://rapidshare.com/files/75188837/ulead.photoimpact.12.aio.part4.rar",0,

647646,"well, i would have to say that i have quite a bit of empathy with you. i have the acne, have put on quite a bit of weight in college, and well, my dick is not a specimen for exhibition. i used to do the two shirt thing too, i have not gone swimming since my early teens. oh yeah, i have big nipples too, like really big, not outwardly, but, in terms of circumference.  i am struggling with the weight thing, i have come to understand that it will take a change of sufficient magnitude that the effort will need to be concerted, i am working on it. beyond that from what i understand about small-dickedness, i would not be too worried about it. the way the wanker dangles is governed by the part of the nervous system that we have no control over. generally, the dick is a pretty stock size on most everyone, with some outliers both toward huge and toward small. your dick is probably not as small in comparison to the general population as you think, your parasympathetic nervous system just does't let it hang low when you are not hard. while i admit that i am a virgin, my lack of sex has given me plenty of time to study it. what i mean by that is that, while i avoid porno, i do not skip the science articles on sex, and the reference material if i have a question, i don't mind commentary as long as it is not aimed at tittilating me on its own terms instead of sharing information that is insightful. i am not entirely sure that a dick needs to be as huge as we would think. like for instance, if your read about the clitoris, it is not way deep in there somewhere, but more toward the surface. i also gather that regardless of the guy's dick size, it is common for women to require some extra stimulation. beyond that, sex generally lasts, per instance, around 15 minutes, with only three to five of that being penetrative. i do not mean to be dispassionate by saying that, i am sort of alluding to the notion that a bigger part of sex might not be so dick centric as it seems to direct reasoning. the 15 minutes thing too is also consistent with studies they have done on hotel porno, the average person who does hotel pay perview porn only watches it for around fifteen minutes.  with the acne, it does suck to have that, i was very self conscious about that when it was at its worst. i  don't think most people really mind scarring that much, especially on guys. if your scars are discolored, you can get stuff to bleach them. beyond that, if you are like me, the farmer's tan from wearing a shirt all the time in the summer is as big an issue as the acne scars. i have not figured out the farmers tan yet, i have thought of going to a tanner, not as a lifelong habit, and using sunscreen there on my face and arms an legs, and just getting tanned in the regions of my body that never see the sun. i have noticed that the skin on my body that sees the sun is in better condition aestheticaly than the white stuff.  one thing i do suggest you do is refining your fashion quite a bit. this can help immensly. look the best you can right now, and don't have it set out there in the future. you are not going to be able to solve it all overnight, but you can take care of some things today. i suggest wearing a short sleeve button up shirt over a t-shirt, i have gone to wearing dickies shirts with the labels cut off, they have nice short sleeve work shirts that are consistent in quality and availability. the button up short sleeve shirt has the qualities i liked wearing two t-shirts for, but looks much better. beyond that, with pants, if you wear jeans, go for the darkest denim you can that is not black, and get a goood cut. if you are on a budget, there are ""levi &amp; strauss"" (not levi's)ones at wal-mart that are nice for around 20$. avoid light denim and cuts that are tapered, never wear anything pleated, don't wear shirts that have buttons on the edge of the collars. if you need to, don't be ashamed to go to a big and tall store, the first time i went to a big and tall store, i felt so at home, i did not feel like an outsider, i could almost feel good about being a big man, it was almost like there was different air in there, that is where the big men shop, the neurotic world churns outside.  figure out your hair, and don't hide in a hat. things to avoid are puff and frizz, this can make you look horrible, especially if you don't keep right on top of things ang get a haircut just as soon as you need one. i know it sounds crazy, but, i have found a lot of success with groom &amp; clean, that an brylcreem, these are sort of unique hair products, it is not grease, it is hair groom, hair gel and spray leaves your hair hard or brittle, pomade and wax is gooey, hair groom on the other hand is ideal, a little dab around the size of a nickel or so, maybe a little bigger, will allow you to style your hair while conditioning it, it will stay in place and you will be able to go longer between haircuts. there is also shaving, make sure to keep up on it, big guys don't look so good with stubble. i find it much easier to shave without any shaving cream, just water or with shaving oil. before i stopped using shaving cream, i shaved much less, now without the cream, it is no hassle, just wetten up and go, feeling to make sure it is smooth both ways.  i recommend also cultivating your deeper person. you are doing good by being here on reddit, just make sure to get lots of good content that is quality, try to stay away from too much negativity. virtue is important, and our culure glosses over so much of the deeper more fulfiling stuff in a superficial manner. big guys are sort of shuffled to the perimeter, use this as an opportunity to gain perspective and grow contemplatively. if you are religious, get serious about it, historically guys who were outsiders or loners have had great relationships with god, like hermits and monks and shepards, they all have time to think and pray and grow. i know it may not seem like it is for you, but, it will help a lot with things. i became a christian when i was eighteen, my high school friends, the people i had grown up with, all disbanded and went to college scattered all over, church gave me a new set of friends, ones that will be my friends for life it appears. if you have not gone to church much before, i just suggest pursuing god for whatever you can get from it, be honest and forthright, if yoou don't have the faith right now, there is only something to be gained, and not really anything to be lost. there is some superficiality in church, there is superficiality anywhere, i find with this, i just need to be a little persistent, and bear thruogh it because i am not perfect and the greater whole is worth it. i do not mean to be pushy with the evangelism. the biggest thing in my life that i think has ever helped me is my faith. i pray like a schizophrenic, my mouth is running whenever nobody is looking. prayer has taught me about myself and has taken me deeper intellectually than anything i have ever done, it sounds like your blog might be similar in function, prayer is immediate and portable, your car or your room, or a restroom stall can all be a prayer closet, it just seems to work, ask for guidance and wisdom, but mostly, talk like you would to a friend. if you are skeptic, do what skeptics do, and experiment.   as a big guy outside of the popular crowd, you have something beautiful that the people at the center of attention might never get. that is the space to think and grow as a person.",0,
869082,"no, you obviously don't understand the definition of racism. i will explain:  racism - the belief that race(s) have a hierarchical order, such that one or more is better than another and one or more is inferior to another in some respect(s). it is an exclusive principle; meaning that race is the exclusive determining factor of this superiority or inferiority. now you might think it should be superiority or inferiority in every respect, but that doesn't work logically. for instance, a subsaharan african can't be as ""white"" as a caucasian, and a caucasian can't have as much melanin (naturally of course) as a subsaharan african. so, it has to be relative and individual in regards to specific traits.  for instance, a large group of black men and women are given the exact same conditions as a large group of asian men and women they will not perform equally, and in fact, it could work out that all of the blacks perform better or worse at something than all of the asians in one or more respects.  now, here's the correct thing about this argument, which alot of dumbasses just can't mentally handle - the principal races, e.g. mongoloid, negroid, caucasoid, indian (as in, from india), capoid and australoid, are different. they are different to differing degrees in different aspects, too. now, i'm sure most of the people sitting in their computer chairs reading this have never heard of some of these races. you think you are an expert on race just because you know some off-hand information or have some kind of non-measured cultural experience. and yet what you might not know is that these races have been meticulously studied by science (anthropology and others) exactly this way for a very long time (a good hundred years, at least). there are fundamental differences between these groups of humans. digestive abilities, head and body shape, bone density, environmental requirements, general genetic propensity for disease, and other things like culturally developed immunity to disease (alot more common a century ago), among many others. so, folks, we are not alike. just accept it. there have been studies that track things like performance of races on iq tests that show differences, and of course people point to it as racism. well, guess what? if it's true, it is! individual people can be different, as well as large groups. in fact, this is exactly how nature intended things to be through genetic variation. this is why races exist.   just ask yourself a simple question, ""why is a scandinavian more pale than a subsaharan african? well, because there is more uv in africa and less in northern europe. that is the correct answer. so, if you take a big ass group of native scandinavians (people of this decent, by the way) and a large group native of subsaharan africans and put them scandinavia for a few days (or weeks, or actually just about however long you want) with skin exposed to the sun and then test the level of uv absorption or skin reflectivity you will find all of the african group will have less underlying uv  absorption (because their naturally occuring melanin absorbs more of it relatively). yes, all of them. every last one. so, is this racist? yep. sure is. is it wrong? no. it is not. it's just the way things work. is crying required? well, not necessarily, but if you find yourself in a situation where you are generally disadvantaged, you might feel like doing so. or you might smile and cheer when the upper hand is yours.   the simple fact of the matter is that the races are different. does that mean that everything is so cut and dry? no. does that mean that some things are? yes. are some things a matter of subtle difference? yes, and some things are not effected by race at all, for any functional purpose. just wrap your brain around that, please, because it's all true.  lecture has concluded. get out of my classroom. ;^p",1,

881399,"i don't prefer either weak or strong typing. weak typing offsets the burden of checking types onto the user, unless the language is well-designed and infers types well (very rare). without such good hand-holding, weak typing generally requires discipline. otherwise the resulting code is a mess of exceptions and duck-typing, as programmers fight to communicate what their functions expect and return and gradually just try to make them support everything.  strong typing is less flexible, but makes sure most type errors are caught. this usually results in the same level of verbosity in code because of the drive to generics/templates (which often look quite horrible) and the requirement of casting operators. whether or not this results in safer code is up for grabs; often, programmers will find a way to circumvent the type system in strange ways if they can. even if they cannot, generally it comes down to having a well-designed api or experienced programmers.",0,

304179,"i remember a story a few years back, they found a complete subway line buried on long island. it was built but never used.  somewhere along the line everyone who knew about it died, retired or quit.  http://www.trainorders.com/discussion/read.php?4,1197331  ""ivan kratz, between 1900 and 1925, had made millions by building the new york city subway system. his work was good, but the way he went about securing contracts was crooked. in 1900, offering up a whole slew of bribes to new york city officials, he had bid high but got the contract to build the new york city subway system. by paying notoriously low salaries to his workmen, he made huge amounts of money at both ends.  by 1924, however, he was under investigation as part of the teapot dome scandal. amazingly, in 1928 when it came time to look for the money kratz had made, he was by this time the owner of a vast oceanfront mansion in east hampton, it all came up empty. where had the money gone?  last month, auctioneers selling the contents of the kratz mansion, only recently sold by his heirs, came upon an extraordinary document. copies of it were turned over to the town of southampton and the town of east hampton. and representatives of the new york state department of transportation had become involved.  kratz, between 1925 and 1929, had secretly constructed an enormous underground subway system that he called the south fork subway. it has its main terminus right under the open plaza in downtown montauk. and it is connected up to underground, stations, in napeague, amagansett, east hampton, bridgehampton, southampton, quogue and westhampton beach. there is a spur that goes up to sag harbor and north haven, and another that goes up three mile harbor road in east hampton and then splits off to end at maidstone park in three mile harbor and gerard park at accabonac harbor.  ""at first,"" said tom larson of the ny state department of transportation, ""we thought that the subway map that had turned up at the auction was some kind of joke.""  but then town bulldozers from the two highway departments were brought in, and the first of the holes was dug, the first just under the large and unused gas ball in sag harbor just behind the post office. in just four days of digging, the workmen uncovered twin platforms, two sets of rails including a third rail that went down into some dark tunnels, a ticket booth, some turnstiles and a flight of stairs that went up to a steel bilco door that had been covered up by grass. the sag harbor station for the g train.  ""we made three decisions,"" larson said. ""we agreed not to go public with whatever this was until we knew what it was, we agreed to send workmen in golf carts down the tunnels, and we agreed to remove the gas ball.""  the gas ball was taken away, piece by piece, in may. and it was inaccurately announced, to throw people off, that the dig where the gas ball was had to do with some sort of underground pollution. also, it might be necessary to remove some commercial buildings in the area. indeed, the state is already in negotiations to condemn the first of those buildings.  ""it's all in place,"" larson said at the press conference. his eyes welled up with tears. ""the whole thing. we've been through it from end to end. and it's all there. it has the same white ceramic tiles on the walls that they have in the new york subway. the names of all the stations in blue tiles. there are eighteen stations. and all we have to do to make this whole thing operational is bring in a modern air exchange system to the tunnels, build some escalators to get down to the platforms to bring this up to code, there were no escalators in use in subways until the 1940s although they surely had them, and bring in some subway cars. the track gauge is also from the new york subway. in fact, we believe that all these materials were from the new york subway system. stuff supposedly ""stolen"" by kratz and brought out here. it's all amazing. and it is an answer to our prayers. the transportation nightmare in the hamptons is over.""",1,

292929,"this is an article by michael harris, a canadian author and journalist.  it clears up a lot of misconceptions about the seal hunt.  http://www.ottawasun.com/comment/columnists/michael_harris/2009/05/08/9389871-sun.html  copyright © 2009 ottawa sun all rights reserved  i was standing on the dock the day that captain morrissey johnson threw the greenpeace demonstrator over the  side of the lady johnson. she hit the pier like a side of beef falling off the back of a delivery truck.  it was wrong of the sealing captain to do that. but the crowds jamming the waterfront that march day in st. john's, n.l., to watch the blessing of the sealing  fleet cheered lustily. later, they sent captain johnson to ottawa as an mp because he knew how to take a stand against the lies, dirty profits and bully-boy  tactics of the urban hucksters who call themselves animal rights activists.  newfoundlanders were tired of watching brigitte bardot kiss baby seals for the cameras, tired of being portrayed as barbarians to ignorant and voyeuristic  city dwellers. and they were beyond tired of the drop-dead hypocrisy that condemned the slaughter of wild animals in an outdoor abattoir operation but  ignored the industrial-scale slaughter of domesticated animals indoors.  the eu now says the seal hunt is ""inherently inhumane."" i wonder what they call chickens hanging upside on a conveyor belt with their throats cut as they  begin their serene journey to the supermarket?  with the eu's ban on seal products, the old movie is playing again. legislators caved to propaganda and ignored the facts: the seal herd is triple the size  needed for a sustainable hunt, rural people need the income, and the hunt is acceptable if carried out in a humane manner to no less a body than the  canadian veterinary medical association.  but one picture is worth a thousand truths. there are still websites featuring the adorable baby seal as the poster-critter of choice to pull at heartstrings and  pocketbooks. never mind that white-coats haven't been hunted for 22 years. there's also the chorus line of camera-struck celebrities who fly in for the day, a  kind of diss-and-go operation toward a fishery that goes back to 1723.  these stars know more about the craters of the moon than life on the northeast coast of newfoundland. from mick jagger to paul mccartney, they are the  performing puppets of groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and the international fund for animal welfare.  these same celebrities and their european countries can squeeze the eggs out of the last sturgeon for caviar and force-feed the livers of geese for foie gras;  they can slaughter lambs for that delectable rack, butcher baby calves for veal and snuff out baby porkers for roast suckling pig. they can experiment with  ostrich steaks, venison, moose and caribou in their chic restaurants, they can scarf down quail eggs, baby turbot and live shrimp, they can support the  slaughter of just about anything to delight their jaded palates, including whale meat in scandinavia. sealing, however, is inherently inhumane.  i'll tell you what's inhumane: setting a pack of hounds on a poor bloody fox, which is torn to bits for the amusement of aristocratic sadists on horseback;  torturing a bull with semi-lethal sword thrusts for the entertainment of crowds who like watching something bleed to death in the afternoon sun; staging  medieval wild boar hunts in the forests of germany to channel the ancestors. yes, there are a few things closer to home that need the eu's attention,  including the faroe islands whale cull.  after the federal government's misguided quota system wiped out the northern cod, the least stephen harper can do is stand up for canada and  newfoundland and tell the eu where to get off. in the meantime, i wonder when we can expect peta's campaign to save the australian cane toad? just  kidding.  mharris@cfra.com  ell the eu where to get off  by michael harris  last updated: 8th may 2009, 2:16am",0,
509867,"paul bauer is a white man. quite a white man. so white he has freckles. so white his beard has grown in orange. “you won’t see me on the beach during daylight hours,” he says. “i’m just as pink as can be.”  he is proud of his whiteness, but not in a white-pride way. no, definitely not. bauer is troubled by the bad deeds his white ancestors did. and his ancestors were whiter than most.  four hundred seventy-seven years ago, one of them set foot on plymouth rock. this was on his mother’s side, mom being a warfield. (dad is second-generation german, which is not only white, it is dangerously white; possibly aryan.) in the united states of america, it’s anglo-saxons who first defined whiteness. and you don’t get much more anglo than the pilgrims.  there were 101 of them on the mayflower, splashing ashore on the chill cusp of winter, low on provisions and wearing the wrong clothes. they would survive to celebrate the first thanksgiving, but as every schoolchild knows, it happened only because the friendly local indians patiently demonstrated how to catch fish and plant corn.  and here, centuries later, stands bauer (“like eddie bauer,” he says, “but not as well dressed”) with one finger firmly on the lid of his starbucks cup so it won’t spill on his “father sky, mother earth” t-shirt. the folding table he minds is stacked with literature from the council for native american solidarity. the banner above his head bids, “free leonard peltier,” referring to the imprisoned sioux the courts call a murderer and his supporters call a martyr.  rest assured, there are people who feel very, very bad about all of this injustice–people acutely, painfully, obsessively aware of transgressions past and present, real and perceived. three hundred of these people, bauer among them, gathered last month on the fringe of harvard university, and you’ll never guess what they had in common.  the second national conference on whiteness was not what you might think. it was not what just about everybody seemed to think.  “a lot of people say, ‘oh, you’re going to a ku klux klan meeting,’ ” says carah reed, who flew all the way from orange county for what was the furthest thing in the world from a klan rally. the only hate being spewed at episcopal divinity school during three gray, introspective days was the self-loathing of committed liberals–anti-racism storm troopers who identify themselves as racists because they are, you know, white.  “one thing about white people, we tend to either be proud or ashamed of being white,” says jeff hitchcock, executive director of the center for the study of white american culture, the ne1998585857jersey nonprofit that organized the conference. “proud in a supremacist way, or guilty in a liberal way. very seldom do you find the balance. it’s either one or the other. and that’s kind of psychotic.”  this year’s conference drew six times as many attendees as last year’s, evidence that whiteness is a topic of growing, serious scholarship. some 90% of the people here are white, but they are multiculturalists at heart. they see society changing, becoming more ethnic, and they want to help it change.  but on another level, this gathering appears to be a kind of purification ritual, the way the white attendees start out by copping to the very thing they are working against, ardently confessing that they harbor (somewhere within themselves) the same snap judgments and idiotic prejudices that everyone else harbors, but which surface in them only by sneaking past a watchfulness that puts the white house security detail to complete and utter shame.  “i have an ulcer, ok? i’m 23. i have an ulcer,” a lad named eric announces to his peers at a panel devoted to dissecting, among other evils, “adultism.”  there are sessions on “ableism and racism,” on “the invisibility / visibility of arab americans,” on “the vector of whiteness” (subtitled “the latino case”). the sessions are pan-racial, as likely to be led by a stout black woman with a british accent as a fit graybeard from boston.  but at the end of the confab, after all have had their say, it is obvious who will have to carry the freight. at the closing session, a caucasoid fellow of about 60 reaches into a badly wrinkled paper bag, pulls out a bottle and throws back a hard slug of something. it is pepto-bismol.  the white man’s burden: rudyard kipling, the english writer, adventurer and, many say, racist, coined the phrase in 1899. kipling’s poem went on about the grave responsibility of caring for “new-caught, sullen peoples / half devil and half child.” in this place, on this weekend, the white man’s burden is something else altogether. the white man’s burden is his own bad self.  holding the mayo  martin mull wrung about all the tang you can from vanilla in “the history of white people in america: part i.” the mockumentary, which aired on tv 10 years ago, profiled a typical suburban family, each member of which carried around a jar of mayonnaise the size of a chair. on a tour of the living room, mull pointed out the stack of coasters, explaining that these will serve to protect the finish of a natural surface, “should any occur.”  who wants to be white? the pasty suburban kids lining up in baggy shorts to buy the latest bone thugs n harmony disc? their pasty dads who lined up for the latest sly &amp; the family stone album?  “whoever heard of a wise old white woman who gets a permanent once a week and talks on the telephone?” asks a woman named myke, reading a poem. the poem is called “wanting to be indian,” and it has set heads to nodding. these nods are not terse; they are the kind that roll off the shoulders and involve a lot of neck. the sound that goes with them is a soft “hmmmmm,” a throaty affirmation that translates to “how true.”  it seems safe to say that no one in this sea of pale faces wants to be white. and, in fact, the room does not “feel” white. it does not feel like a new hampshire rotary club meeting on the day pat buchanan shows up to campaign. it does not feel the way the roanoke room or the chesapeake room or any dimly lit conference space in any hotel in america feels at 10 o’clock on a weekday morning, with the name tags lined up there beside the big stainless steel coffee urn and a stack of pastries on a perfectly round brown plastic tray; someone has sliced every danish in half.  the big room feels as though it has no color at all. the vibe here is of a deliberate wash, of identity being pulled back, conscientiously held at bay. everyone in the room is in a receive mode, unwilling to project anything at all save the quietest, softest strength.  the people here–many of them women, many with long hair the color of steel–are practiced at this. it is what a lot of them do for a living: sit in a room with other people, thinking hard, feeling harder, withholding judgment. when the emcee, a fast-talking woman named meck groot, asks how many are educators, a third of those present raise a hand. afro-american studies. women’s studies. multicultural advisory office. another third call themselves activists or organizers. a little cheer goes up at the words, at the mere suggestion of a cause.  no one has to explain to this bunch what the “process room” is. (it’s where you go “if you have an issue,” groot notes for the record.) no one has to say why the host starts with a “centering exercise.” (it’s to remind you “that you have a body, and it needs to be paid attention to.”) a loosely structured workshop on “modern racism and internalized oppression” suits this crew like a peasant blouse, like a dashiki, like a peruvian wool jacket that looks as scratchy as a hair shirt.  colorless people  they are making history here. they are on the leading edge of something. only five people in the entire group have ever taken a weekend to meditate on “whiteness.” the concept is too new. too slippery.  here is a woman with a tortured expression on her face and a book in her lap. it is her journal. look out. she’s going to read from it.  “whiteness,” she says. “a strange, eerie, unreal thing. when you think about it.”  here is a muscular woman explaining why she is running a workshop on “white folks exploring native american cultural and spiritual traditions: appreciation versus appropriation.”  “one thing people ask us is, why are white people doing this workshop?” she says. she answers herself: “we’re all experts. if a person is white, he’s an expert on this.”  and here someone who is not: a striking 28-year-old woman with hair the color of rust and skin the richest shade of sienna. she was born in the united states, grew up in zimbabwe and has lived in the boston area for eight years.  her name tag reads: “blessing.”  “coming back to america, i didn’t identify with the african americans,” blessing says. “i identified more with the white people. the african americans seemed more like a different race. they weren’t like me.”  her black friends noticed this too. they said, “oh, you’re so white.” they said she watches white tv shows.",1,

491221,"product description two economist writers show how and why religion is booming around the world and reveal its vast effects on the global economy, politics, and more  on the street and in the corridors of power, religion is surging worldwide. from russia to turkey to india, nations that swore off faith in the last century—or even tried to stamp it out—are now run by avowedly religious leaders. formerly secular conflicts like the one in palestine have taken on an overtly religious cast. god is back shines a bright light on this hidden world of faith, from exorcisms in são paulo to religious skirmishing in nigeria, to televangelism in california and house churches in china.  since the enlightenment, intellectuals have assumed that modernization would kill religion—and that religious america is an oddity. as god is back argues, religion and modernity can thrive together, and america is becoming the norm. many things helped spark the global revival of religion, including the failure of communism and the rise of globalism. but, above all, twenty-first century religion is being fueled by a very american emphasis on competition and a customer- driven approach to salvation. these qualities have characterized this country’s faith ever since the founders separated church and state, creating a religious free market defined by entrepreneurship, choice, and personal revelation. as market forces reshape the world, the tools and ideals of american evangelism are now spreading everywhere.  the global rise of faith will have a dramatic and far- reaching impact on our century. indeed, its destabilizing effects can already be seen far from iraq or the world trade center. religion plays a role in civil wars from sri lanka to sudan. along the tenth parallel, from west africa to the philippines, religious fervor and political unrest are reinforcing each other. god is back concludes by showing how the same american ideas that created our unique religious style can be applied around the globe to channel the rising tide of faith away from volatility and violence.  about the author john micklethwait is the editor-in-chief of the economist and adrian wooldridge is its washington bureau chief and lexington columnist. they were both educated at oxford. john micklethwait was formerly the economist's us editor; adrian wooldridge was formerly the magazine's washington correspondent. together, they have coauthored four books, the witch doctors; a future perfect: the challenge and hidden promise of globalization, the company: a short history of a revolutionary idea and the right nation: conservative power in america.",0,

954363,"here goes my reply, loosely based on your commentary, and i tried to go point-by-point, but it might be a bit ramble-y, so bear with me.  do you honestly think it's the upper class that's going to devote farm land to cultivating hemp?   ...because i have a newsflash for you, not that many upper-class citizens own farm land.  moreover, your argument would have anything that helps ease the stresses of everyday life banned.  do you hate television, books, movies, video games, alcohol, and vacations that much?  because i know that i certainly enjoy getting into a good book or taking a trip to forget about the annoying minutiae of my life as a law student.  i know that my trip to europe was amazing, and was just what i needed before getting into the lsat and after i graduated from undergrad.  how many people have delved into middle-earth or put themselves into a game of quiddich for just a few minutes a day?  is that escapism as bad as an acid trip?  your argument would certainly have us believe so.  moreover, it's not *just* the middle- and lower-class that uses illicit drugs.  it's just that a disproportionate amount of lower-class citizens get busted for it.      sure, it's another form of taxation, but it's taxing something that the people want anyways.  if people are going to get it whether it's legal or not, why not have the feds make money off of it and distribute it in a safer, crime-free manner that eases the national debt?    as for ""the social conditions in which people are not forced to escape"", that sounds like a pretty bland world, to me.  as someone who strongly believes in the dichotomy of all things (light/dark, war/peace, happiness/sadness, etc.), i think we need some boredom and strife (certainly not to the level it is currently at, but just a bit) to help remind us that there is good out there.  if you were constantly exposed to darkness, you wouldn't know what light was, and vice versa.  we need the bad to appreciate the good.  moreover, such a utopian society just isn't realistic, so wishing for it is a waste of time, because there will always be those members of society who want to exert their power over others (bullies, rush limbaugh, neo-cons, etc.).    i think you're not seeing that pot is used by people of all classes, not just lower- and middle-class citizens.  crack or meth, on the other hand, doesn't run rampant through the upper-crust.  but you're not arguing that, you're arguing pot.  gw, clinton, obama, numerous members of hollywood and nyc's elite are pot-heads.  this isn't just a poor person's pastime.    as for promoting self-medication, we're already doing that through prohibition.  people always want what they can't have, and making it illegal and taboo makes it seem that much more desirable.  check out portugal (legal drugs) and holland (legal pot).  fewer pot users, percentage-wise, than countries where pot is illegal.  legalisation would have the opposite effect, just as drinking seems way cooler when you're in high school and under-21 than it does once you can do it whenever and (almost) wherever you please.  i also think that you're overlooking three major aspects of the legalization movement:  1. it would help clear court dockets, making the judicial system more efficient and smoother-running; 2. it would empty out jails, which, along with #1, would reduce taxes that go toward funding both the judicial and penal systems; and 3. it would decrease the amount of dea and police that go after victimless criminals, allowing them to focus on more important matters, like actual criminals.    ""...who do not have the soci-economic [sic] support to manage pot use in a healthy way""???  how does one use pot in a decidedly un-healthy way?  it is impossible to overdose on pot.  there aren't any lasting health concerns.  there isn't all sorts of crazy-ass chemicals put into it like there are with tobacco.  if you're talking about the ones who sit around stoned all day, that's a motivation issue, not a ""health"" concern.  i would like to hear your proposal for taxation of tv and video games please.  because i can't even imagine those happening.  people are already bypassing commercials on television, you think they'd put up with a tv tax?  and in this society you're envisioning, do the ""bankers and businessmen"" make the videogames, the movies, the booze, the pot, the other drugs, the movies, the internet and (because it fits) books?  were j.r.r. tolkein, roald dahl, or ernest hemingway employed as stock-traders before their lives turned to literature?  what about kevin smith or the guys behind ""blair witch""?    finally, you are correct, ""trickle-down economics"" doesn't work.  money flows up, anyone with half of a brain knows this.  but again, it isn't going to be the wall street crowd that's cultivating plants, just as it wasn't stock-brokers who were making bath-tub gin in the 20s.  sure, they distributed it, but that's a whole different issue.  the kind of mentality that keeps pot illegal is the same kind that brings about gang wars, black markets and underground, un-safe usage of the kinds of substances people just want to use.  (i shouldn't even have to say this, but the prohibition of the 20s created much, much more dangerous booze than we have now.  mortality rates for moonshine vs. bacardi or jagermeister would be ridiculously disproportionate.)  finally, the seemingly un-arguable point here is that as a ""free"" person, i should have the final say in what i put into my body.  i don't need some stranger telling me what i can and cannot expose myself to, especially when that person allows a giant company (monsanto, tyson chicken, etc.) to put weird chemicals (non-human growth hormone, non-human anti-biotics) in my food (milk, chicken, respectively), without asking for my permission or expressly telling me that such adulterants are in said food.  is it really o.k. for giant corporations to put un-safe chemicals in my body without my permission, but it's not o.k. for me to put anything else in my body that i've researched and chosen to put there?  that is a patently absurd argument, yet sadly, i've heard people claim this is how our lives should be run.  i'm not one who likes to be babysat against my will, but then again, i'm not the kind who can't think for himself.  again, forgive the random-ness of my ranting, i kinda get like james joyce sometimes with my stream-of-consciousness rambles. i hope you take some time to think about what i and others have said, and don't just write it off as hatred or anger.  debate is the only way such disagreements can move forward, and i hope i've illuminated some points for you.   take care.",0,
720698,"i participated in the following bad ass experience, even though i pissed myself like a little girl.  the night before prom, my three friends and i (we'll call them homo, tiny, and giganto) were driving around in homo's 1972 cadillac coupe de ville.  the car was gorgeous, 20 feet long, and had a huge ass engine in it.  it was a very sweet ride.  well homo is driving, giganto is in the front, and me and tiny are in the back.  giganto is in kinda a fuck it mood, so he is screaming profanities at people out the window.  we found this hilarious, as there was not much else to occupy our time in our small texas town.    then as we are pulling up to a light, i see an old beater car in front of us with what appeared to be a family of white trashlings in it, and i make a comment as such.  giganto gets a shit eating grin on his face as he starts lowering the power window.  i start freaking out, saying ""no giganto, you'd better fucking not!""  it was too late.  we  pull up next to this handlebar mustached motherfucker right as the light turns green.  giganto screams ""white trash!"" right in his face, homo hits the gas, and we speed off as i hear a vanishing ""what the fuck did you say?"" as they start to tear ass after us.    well that beater car, it turned out, could haul some ass.  we engaged in a 90 mph car chase as profanities were passed back and forth inside our vehicle.  we are on some back country road when we start to see the interstate coming into view.  i think ""ok, get on the interstate, and at least our lives will be saved when we get pulled over by a state trooper.""  not so lucky, as they start to pass us.  giganto tells homo to hit the breaks, and the white trash mobile flies past us and promptly blocks the road leading to the interstate.  as we start trying to turn that 20 foot long car around on a tiny country road, giganto tells homo to drive up the dirt road right in front of us.  i feel this is a very bad idea.  well drive up the hill to find a locked gate, a fence, and a cliff on the other side of the fence.  we turn the car around to see that the wt-mobile has completely blocked the dirt road exit, and there are drainage ditches on either side.  instead of a small white trash family, 8 full grown dudes pile out of the car.  one guy has a crow bar, one guy a bat, and one guy has a huge fucking cedar post he picked up from the side of the road.  you can hear them laughing from our vantage point at the top of the hill.  giganto at this moment is acting like a martyr, like he'll take the beating so they'll let us go.  i tell him we're all fucking trapped so we're all dead.  tiny is in the fetal position in the back.  we are all scared shitless.  and then homo starts revving the engine.    he knocks it into drive and starts tearing ass down the hill right for their car.  all those dudes scatter, except the motherfucker with the cedar post.  he wants blood and is staring us down.    at the last second, homo turns the car, hits the drainage ditch, and we go flying in the air, ""dukes of hazard"" style.  some-fucking-how, homo manages to get us on a swinging areal trajectory, to where when we land, we are facing down the road towards our exit and salvation.  it might have also helped that the redneck threw the cedar post and hit homo's rear fender mid air, thus marginally helping our spin.  we tear ass back to town and escape.  we find a garage to hide homo's car in for the rest of the night in case the wt squad came looking for us.  there was much cussing, but then we had the realization that no one at prom would have a better story than us dorks!  and another realization:  in my life's greatest moment of crisis, my gay friend made the rest of us look like pussies.",1,

181719,"if you're using watercolors, the following are good basics to start with: cadmium red, cadmium yellow light, cadmium orange, hooker's green, viridian, vermillion, alizarin crimson, rose madder, naples yellow, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, prussian blue, ivory black (rarely used), burnt sienna, burnt umber, yellow ochre, and raw umber.  you may or may not choose to use white.  traditional watercolor allows the white of the paper to show through where white is desired.  you want to use good qualtiy paints, and they aren't cheap.  windsor newton is a good brand.  you also want good quality paper, for example, arches watercolour paper.  also try to invest in the best brushes you can afford.  red sable are excellent, and you want a flat brush, and some rounds and a detail brush.  it's also good to have a really wide brush to lay down large washes of color on the paper.  (i didn't mean to go into such a thorough list, but there you have it.)  what i really wanted to tell you is that you should make a color chart.  you should do this: down the left hand of the paper make a column of half inch dots of each of the colors as they come straight out of the tube mixed with a little water.  across the top, arrange a horizontal row just as you did the vertical.  then you mix each and every color with each and every color and fill your chart.  i'm sorry if this isn't clear, but hopefully it can be fathomed.  all of this, because it is an invaluable way to learn about color, and to make a color chart that can be used as a reference for years.  it is absolutely essential in my opinion to do this.  i would also learn the benefits of limiting your palette.  you don't necessarily have to use every color in your paint box in a painting.  it is very often effective to mix your own green, for example, with the one of the blues and yellows that you have on your palette. the colors are more harmoniously linked in the painting this way, rather than introducing a totally unrelated green straight out of its own tube.  you might love that particular green out of the tube, but it may not relate to the yellows and blues in your painting quite as well as a mixed green using those same colors.  this is just an example, but the fewer colors you use, the more harmonious the painting will be, generally speaking.  but, painters break all the rules very effectively on occassion, so don't worry too much about it.  i cannot recommend any book, but check out websites for all kinds of information about painting.",0,

""poisoning"" your son with this ""knowledge"" of science might also reflect poorly on you. i know that one day i was being told by a judge that they wouldn't ban me from the internet, i just theoretically couldn't research this stuff any more. that was of course because somewhere along the line i said i learned something on the internet and in ap chemistry. the real beginning of me making firecrackers was from reading a chemistry textbook which had 1 page boxes with random information about some real world application for chemistry. of course i read the one about how they make the pretty colors in mortars and such. so the day after the judge told me one thing, i was being called a liar in front of my parents about what the judge had said and was subsequently banned from the internet in any way, shape, or form. i was also banned from attending any more chemistry labs, this ripped a hole in space time because i was a senior and took ap chem as a junior(5 on exam!). i later smoked pot in accordance with sanctions to remove my knowledge of chemistry. they unbanned me from the interweb for educational purposes a couple days later, though i'm sure they still didn't realize how ridiculous the punishment was.  so all in all, don't make fireworks, watch youtube videos about space with carl sagan or something, because your noble intentions look like contributing to the delinquency of a minor to the law.  to lighten things up, some of the funny parts were:  in the evidence photos of my room (house raided by bombsquad, dad pissed) there is a photo of a drawer in which you see spools of wire for my extended ignition systems(nichrome wire + 7.2v battery) and right below it, my award for outstanding achievement in science, one of two given out each year at my school.  on my video camera, with everything i did filmed, they saw ""viva la nation"" on some firecrackers(see videos) and assumed i was part of some fringe group. it was really just what you had to display in a picture or video to authenticate it as your own work on the forum, pbnation.com.  in jail, they called me doogie howser, md and the ""smartest cat in jail"".  the bomb squad made a lot of crazy assumptions about the purpose of insignificant objects in my house. ie, this cooler was used as a table for making explosives. actually used as a place to sit.   finally, read the comments for the thermite video whilst noting the credits at the end.  that is all",0,
765050,"just stepped off the plane from a similar trip :-d  everyone will recommend places to see, and you've got frommers guide etc, so you will have no shortage of ideas, i'm sure. i just thought i'd add a few observations and tips that occurred to us as we did the same thing (we basically had no itinerary or bookings either, just rough ideas of where we wanted to go).  i've been a couple of times before, too, and each time i add to my store of ""useful things to know"". i probably have a long way to go, but here are a few that stand out to me so far:   1. you are going in peak holiday time, so the popular destinations will be mighty *crowded*. this means lining up in the baking sun (often intolerably hot in places like italy!) for an hour or even a lot longer to see famous sights. if you can get out and about early in the day (probably depends on the night before, i realise!) you can avoid the mid day heat and the biggest queues.   2. also due to the crowds, i hope you don't have trouble finding accommodation.  we got in the habit of going online (internet cafe or wandering the streets for free wifi to tap into) and making a reservation online. *print or save a map of how to get there for when you get off the train!* it will save you heaps of aimless wandering in the heat. maybe do an experiment now and start searching for hostels in a few places you are likely to go, just to get a feel for the booking situation.  you don't want to be sleeping in some urine-soaked train station with all the drug addicts and drunks after spending a fruitless day searching for a bed.  3. everything you read in the books about pickpockets and bag snatchers is true. be *very* aware at all times, especially in crowds. they are lightning fast. keep hold of your bag straps. be prepared for anything like kids waving newspapers etc. a friend of mine was scammed by a guy who offered him a braided ""friendship"" bracelet. he tied it on his wrist, grabbed it hard and suddenly two more guys appears and surrounded him, demanding money while he struggled to get free. don't accept anything ""free"" like flowers (or friendship bracelets!) and watch out if someone hands you a baby to hold! they are about to rob you and are assuming you will let them rather than drop the baby.   4. if you are on a tight budget, buying food can be very expensive, since many european cities seem to have avoided the ""fast food"" culture (here in oz, there are cheap, junky meals to be had everywhere) and you may well have no choice but a sit-down restaurant meal. while charming, the budget can take a beating from this every day, so make the most of supermarkets and get yourself some bread, cheese, crackers, fruit, cereal bars, cheap drinks etc for your day trips. if you are in a hostel and can cook your own food for dinner, all the better.  5. don't fall for people touting hotels, tours etc. at stations. they can be very convincing, but it might be a scam, or at least very crappy.    6. do investigate the eurail pass and see if it will benefit your relatively short trip. you must buy it before you leave home - it's not available when you get there. rail is expensive everywhere, but easy, efficient and can get you to just about any place. bus is another option which we used as well. often cheaper but less regular and doesn't go to as many places.  get online and research it.  6. take *less* stuff than you are currently planning. the lighter the better. only one pair of shoes plus some light sandals. you're going to hate all of it when you've been lugging it around on your back all day.  7. take clothes that you can wash out in the sink at night and hang out over the balcony (tip - or right in front of the a/c if desperate for them in a hurry). a travel clothes-line is handy.  heavy cotton things like jeans take ages, more than overnight. you will be wearing them wet the next day. ask my son :-(  lower your standards and wear the same clothes as often as you can stand! it can be very hard to find a coin operated laundry, in fact they simply don't exist in many places.  8. we found wikitravel to be very helpful. it can be confusing just trying to work out the ""how to's"" of a place, so these sort of guides really help.  9. to save buying maps of everywhere, get and save one on your device if you've got one, or ask at tourist information desks or your accommodation for a free one. you might also find them inside brochures for other things, so check out all the flyers etc in the stands. we pretended to be interested in the open-top bus tours just to get the brochures with a map inside.  they have a stand of flyers at many of their pickup-drop off points!  have a great time. you must go to france if you are studying french! baguettes, pastries...just do it!  you will have absolutely no trouble meeting up with people wherever you go. if you want to know the best places to party/eat, just start talking to other tourists if you hear them speaking english, or get talking to people (including the staff) at your accommodation. there will be more holiday makers than genuine residents in most of the places you go, so join the throng!",0,

302122,"factually incorrect... yes and an inconvenient truth for you to accept...   &gt;1. as a result of 60 years of this arab policy, gaza has become a prison camp for 1.5 million palestinians - wrong - gaza has 1.5 million palestinians because they were driven out of their homes in 1948, mostly before the may 14 1948 attack by the arabs.  on november 30, the day after the un partition vote, the jewish agency announced: “the main theme behind the spontaneous celebrations we are witnessing today is our community's desire to seek peace and its determination to achieve fruitful cooperation with the arabs....“  throughout the period that preceded the may 15 invasion of the arab regular armies, large-scale military engagements, incessant sniping, robberies and bombings took place. in view of the thousands of casualties that resulted from the pre-invasion violence, it is not surprising that many arabs would have fled out of fear for their lives.  the second phase of the arab flight began after the jewish forces started to register military victories against arab irregulars. among the victories were the battles for tiberias and haifa, which were accompanied by the evacuation of the arab inhabitants.  on january 30, 1948, the jaffa newspaper, ash sha'ab, reported: “the first of our fifth column consists of those who abandon their houses and businesses and go to live elsewhere....at the first signs of trouble they take to their heels to escape sharing the burden of struggle.”  another jaffa paper, as sarih (march 30, 1948) excoriated arab villagers near tel aviv for “bringing down disgrace on us all by 'abandoning the villages.“  john bagot glubb, the commander of jordan's arab legion, said: “villages were frequently abandoned even before they were threatened by the progress of war” (london daily mail, august 12, 1948).  jewish forces seized tiberias on april 19, 1948, and the entire arab population of 6,000 was evacuated under british military supervision. the jewish community council issued a statement afterward: “we did not dispossess them; they themselves chose this course....let no citizen touch their property.”  in early april, an estimated 25,000 arabs left the haifa area following an offensive by the irregular forces led by fawzi al qawukji, and rumors that arab air forces would soon bomb the jewish areas around mt. carmel. on april 23, the haganah captured haifa. a british police report from haifa, dated april 26, explained that “every effort is being made by the jews to persuade the arab populace to stay and carry on with their normal lives, to get their shops and businesses open and to be assured that their lives and interests will be safe.” in fact, david ben-gurion had sent golda meir to haifa to try to persuade the arabs to stay, but she was unable to convince them because of their fear of being judged traitors to the arab cause. by the end of the battle, more than 50,000 palestinians had left.  tens of thousands of arab men, women and children fled toward the eastern outskirts of the city in cars, trucks, carts, and afoot in a desperate attempt to reach arab territory until the jews captured rushmiya bridge toward samaria and northern palestine and cut them off. thousands rushed every available craft, even rowboats, along the waterfront, to escape by sea toward acre (new york times, april 23, 1948).  in tiberias and haifa, the haganah issued orders that none of the arabs' possessions should be touched, and warned that anyone who violated the orders would be severely punished. despite these efforts, all but about 5,000 or 6,000 arabs evacuated haifa, many leaving with the assistance of british military transports.  syria's un delegate, faris el-khouri, interrupted the un debate on palestine to describe the seizure of haifa as a “massacre” and said this action was “further evidence that the 'zionist program' is to annihilate arabs within the jewish state if partition is effected.”  the following day, however, the british representative at the un, sir alexander cadogan, told the delegates that the fighting in haifa had been provoked by the continuous attacks by arabs against jews a few days before and that reports of massacres and deportations were erroneous. the same day (april 23, 1948), jamal husseini, the chairman of the palestine higher committee, told the un security council that instead of accepting the haganah's truce offer, the arabs “preferred to abandon their homes, their belongings, and everything they possessed in the world and leave the town.”  once the arab regular armies from syria, egypt, lebanon and transjordan invasion began in may 1948, most arabs remaining in palestine left for neighboring countries. surprisingly, rather than acting as a strategically valuable “fifth column” in the war, the palestinians chose to flee to the safety of the other arab states, still confident of being able to return. a leading palestinian nationalist of the time, musa alami, revealed the attitude of the fleeing arabs:  the arabs of palestine left their homes, were scattered, and lost everything. but there remained one solid hope: the arab armies were on the eve of their entry into palestine to save the country and return things to their normal course, punish the aggressor, and throw oppressive zionism with its dreams and dangers into the sea. on may 14, 1948, crowds of arabs stood by the roads leading to the frontiers of palestine, enthusiastically welcoming the advancing armies. days and weeks passed, sufficient to accomplish the sacred mission, but the arab armies did not save the country. they did nothing but let slip from their hands acre, sarafand, lydda, ramleh, nazareth, most of the south and the rest of the north. then hope fled (middle east journal, october 1949).  as the fighting spread into areas that had previously remained quiet, the arabs began to see the possibility of defeat. as the possibility turned into reality, the flight of the arabs increased-more than 300,000 departed after may 15 — leaving approximately 160,000 arabs in the state of israel.",0,
553497,"obama: now in the meantime, we’ve got to work very closely with the states to monitor and to help people who are still falling through the cracks. and you know, the homeless problem was bad even when the economy was good.  part of the change in attitudes that i want to see here in washington and all across the country is a belief that it is not acceptable for children and families to be without a roof over their heads in a country as wealthy as ours. and so we’re going to be initiating a range of programs, as well, to deal with homelessness.  one area in particular i want to focus on is the issue of veterans. the rate of homelessness among veterans is much, much higher than for nonveteran populations.  and so we’ve got — a number of the increases that we’re looking for in our budget on veterans funding directly addresses the issue of homeless veterans. that, i think, can provide some real help.  ann compton? hey, ann. you sound surprised.  q: i am surprised. could i ask you about race?  obama: you may.  q: yours is a rather historic presidency. and i’m just wondering whether, in any of the policy debates that you’ve had within the white house, the issue of race has come up or whether it has in the way you feel you’ve been perceived by other leaders or by the american people? or has the last 64 days been a relatively colorblind time?  obama: i, i think that the last 64 days has been dominated by me trying to figure out how we’re going to fix the economy, and that affects black, brown and white.  and, you know, obviously, at the inauguration, i think that there was justifiable pride on the part of the country that we had taken a step to move us beyond some of the searing legacies of racial discrimination in this country, but that lasted about a day.  and, and, you know, right now, the american people are judging me exactly the way i should be judged. and that is: are we taking the steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets, create jobs, get businesses to reopen, keep america safe? and that’s what i’ve been spending my time thinking about.  ok. john ward, washington times? where’s john?  q: thank you, sir.  obama: there you go.  q: thank you, mr. president.  obama: sure.  q: in your remarks on stem cell research earlier this month, you talked about a majority consensus in determining whether or not this is the right thing to do, to federally fund embryonic stem cell research.  i’m just wondering, though, how much you personally wrestled with the morality or ethics of federally funding this kind of research, especially given the fact that science so far has shown a lot of progress with adult stem cells, but not a lot with embryonic?  obama: ok. no, i think it’s — i think it’s a legitimate question. i, i wrestle with these issues every day.  as i mentioned to — i think in an interview a couple of days ago, by the time an issue reaches my desk, it’s a hard issue. if it was an easy issue, somebody else would have solved it and it wouldn’t have reached me.  look, i believe that it is very important for us to have strong moral guidelines, ethical guidelines, when it comes to stem-cell research or anything that touches on, you know, the issues of possible cloning or issues related to, you know, the human life sciences.  i think those issues are all critical, and i’ve said so before. i wrestle with it on stem cell; i wrestle with it on issues like abortion.  i think that the guidelines that we provided meet that ethical test. what we have said is that, for embryos that are typically about to be discarded, for us to be able to use those in order to find cures for parkinson’s or for alzheimer’s or, you know, all sorts of other debilitating diseases, juvenile diabetes, that, that it is the right thing to do.  and that’s not just my opinion. that is the opinion of a number of people who are also against abortion.  now, i am glad to see progress is being made in adult stem cells. and if the science determines that we can completely avoid a set of ethical questions or political disputes, then that’s great.  i have, i have no investment in causing controversy. i’m happy to avoid it if that’s where the science leads us. but what i don’t want to do is predetermine this based on a very rigid ideological approach, and that’s what i think is reflected in the executive order that i signed.  q: i meant to ask — just to follow up — do you think that scientific consensus is enough to tell us what we can and cannot do?  obama: no. i think there’s, there’s always an ethical and a moral element that has to be, be a part of this. and so, as i said, i, i don’t take decisions like this lightly. they’re ones that i take seriously, and, and i respect people who have different opinions on this issue.  but i think that this was the right thing to do and the ethical thing to do. and as i said before, my hope is, is that we can find a mechanism, ultimately, to cure these diseases in a way that gains 100 percent consensus. and we certainly haven’t achieved that yet, but i think on balance this was the right step to take.  staff: last question.  obama: ok. stefan collison (ph), afp?  q: mr. president, you came to office pledging to work for peace between israel and the palestinians. how realistic do you think those hopes are now, given the likelihood of a prime minister who is not fully signed up to a two-state solution and a foreign minister who has been accused of insulting arabs?  obama: it’s not easier than it was, but i think it’s just as necessary. we don’t yet know what the israeli government is going to look like, and we don’t yet know what the future shape of palestinian leadership is going to be comprised of.  what we do know is this: that the status quo is unsustainable, that it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution where israelis and palestinians can live side-by-side in their own states with peace and security.  and by assigning george mitchell the task of working as special envoy, what we’ve signaled is that we’re going to be serious from day one in trying to move the parties in a direction that acknowledges that reality.  how effective these negotiations may be, i think we’re going to have to wait and see. but you know, we, we were here for st. patrick’s day, and you’ll recall that we had what had been previously sworn enemies celebrating here in this very room.  you know, leaders from the two sides of northern ireland that, you know, a couple of decades ago — or even a decade ago — people would have said could never achieve peace, and here they were, jointly appearing and talking about their commitment, even in the face of violent provocation.  and what that tells me is that, if you stick to it, if you are persistent, then, then these problems can be dealt with.  that whole philosophy of persistence, by the way, is one that i’m going to be emphasizing again and again in the months and years to come as long as i’m in this office. i’m a big believer in persistence.  i think that when it comes to domestic affairs, if we keep on working at it, if we acknowledge that we make mistakes sometimes, and that we don’t always have the right answer, and we’re inheriting very knotty problems, that we can pass health care, we can find better solutions to our energy challenges, we can teach our children more effectively, we can deal with a very real budget crisis that is not fully dealt with in my, in my budget at this point, but makes progress.  i think, when it comes to the banking system, you know, it was just a few days ago or weeks ago where people were certain that secretary geithner couldn’t deliver a plan. today, the headlines all look like, well, all right, there’s a plan. and i’m sure there will be more criticism, and we’ll have to make more adjustments, but we’re moving in the right direction.  when it comes to iran, you know, we did a video, sending a message to the iranian people and the leadership of the islamic republic of iran. and some people said, well, they did not immediately say that we’re eliminating nuclear weapons and stop funding terrorism. well, we didn’t expect that. we expect that we’re going to make steady progress on this front.  we haven’t immediately eliminated the influence of lobbyists in washington. we have not immediately eliminated wasteful pork projects. and we’re not immediately going to get middle east peace. we’ve been in office now a little over 60 days.  what i am confident about is that we’re moving in the right direction and that the decisions we’re making are based on, how are we going to get this economy moving? how are we going to put americans back to work? how are we going to make sure that our people are safe? and how are we going to create not just prosperity here, but work with other countries for global peace and prosperity?  and we are going to stay with it as long as i’m in this office, and i think that — you look back four years from now, i think, hopefully, people will judge that body of work and say, this is a big ocean liner. it’s not a speedboat. it doesn’t turn around immediately. but we’re in a better, better place because of the decisions that we made.  all right? thank you, everybody.  finis",1,

669887,"the apartment only has one closet and when its door is open it appears to have been bricked shut, cask of amontillado-style, with very large flat red oblongs, each imprinted with the image of a venerable and yet oddly cheerful and yet somehow kind of hauntingly sad naval officer. the whole pallet load was shipped here several weeks ago by avi, in an attempt to lift randy’s spirits. for all randy knows more are still sitting on a manila dockside ringed with armed guards and dictionary-sized rat traps straining against their triggers, each baited with a single golden nugget.  randy selects one of the bricks from this wall, creating a gap in the formation, but there is another, identical one right behind it, another picture of that same naval officer. they seem to be marching from his closet in a peppy phalanx. ""part of this complete balanced breakfast,"" randy says. then he slams the door on them and walks with a measured, forcibly calm step to the living room where he does most of his dining, usually while facing his thirty-six-inch television. he sets up his san miguel, an empty bowl, an exceptionally large soup spoon—so large that most european cultures would identify it as a serving spoon and most asian ones as a horticultural implement. he obtains a stack of paper napkins, not the brown recycled ones that can’t be moistened even by immersion in water, but the flagrantly environmentally unsound type, brilliant white and cotton-fluffy and desperately hygroscopic. he goes to the kitchen, opens the fridge, reaches deep into the back, and finds an unopened box-bag-pod-unit of uht milk. uht milk need not, technically, be refrigerated, but it is pivotal, in what is to follow, that the milk be only a few microdegrees above the point of freezing. the fridge in randy’s apartment has louvers in the back where the cold air is blown in, straight from the freon coils. randy always stores his milk-pods directly in front of those louvers. not too close, or else the pods will block the flow of air, and not too far away either. the cold air becomes visible as it rushes in and condenses moisture, so it is a simple matter to sit there with the fridge door open and observe its flow characteristics, like an engineer testing an experimental minivan in a river rouge wind tunnel. what randy would like to see, ideally, is the whole milk-pod enveloped in an even, jacketlike flow to produce better heat exchange through the multilayered plastic-and-foil skin of the milk-pod. he would like the milk to be so cold that when he reaches in and grabs it, he feels the flexible, squishy pod stiffen between his fingers as ice crystals spring into existence, summoned out of nowhere simply by the disturbance of being squished.  today the milk is almost, but not quite, that cold. randy goes into his living room with it. he has to wrap it in a towel because it is so cold it hurts his fingers. randy takes the red box and holds it securely between his knees with the handy stay-closed tab pointing away from him. using both hands in unison he carefully works his fingertips underneath the flap, trying to achieve equal pressure on each side, paying special attention to places where too much glue was laid down by the gluing-machine. for a few long, tense moments, nothing at all happens, and an ignorant or impatient observer might suppose that randy is getting nowhere. but then the entire flap pops open in an instant as the entire glue-front gives way. randy hates it when the box-top gets bent or, worst of all possible worlds, torn. the lower flap is merely tacked down with a couple of small glue-spots and randy pulls it back to reveal a translucent, inflated sac. the halogen down-light recessed in the ceiling shines through the cloudy material of the sac to reveal gold—everywhere the glint of gold. randy rotates the box ninety degrees and holds it between his knees so its long axis is pointed at the television set, then grips the top of the sac and carefully parts its heat-sealed seam, which purrs as it gives way. removal of the somewhat milky plastic barrier causes the individual nuggets of cap’n crunch to resolve, under the halogen light, with a kind of preternatural crispness and definition that makes the roof of randy’s mouth glow and throb in trepidation.  the gold nuggets of cap’n crunch pelt the bottom of the bowl with a sound like glass rods being snapped in half tiny fragments spall away from their corners and ricochet around on the white porcelain surface. world-class cereal-eating is a dance of fine compromises. the giant heaping bowl of sodden cereal, awash in milk, is the mark of the novice. ideally one wants the bone-dry cereal nuggets and the cryogenic milk to enter the mouth with minimal contact and for the entire reaction between them to take place in the mouth. randy has worked out a set of mental blueprints for a special cereal-eating spoon that will have a tube running down the handle and a little pump for the milk, so that you can spoon dry cereal up out of a bowl, hit a button with your thumb, and squirt milk into the bowl of the spoon even as you are introducing it into your mouth. the next best thing is to work in small increments, putting only a small amount of cap’n crunch in your bowl at a time and eating it all up before it becomes a pit of loathsome slime, which, in the case of cap’n crunch, takes about thirty seconds.  he pours the milk with one hand while jamming the spoon in with the other, not wanting to waste a single moment of the magical, golden time when cold milk and cap’n crunch are together but have not yet begun to pollute each other’s essential natures: two platonic ideals separated by a boundary a molecule wide. where the flume of milk splashes over the spoon-handle, the polished stainless steel fogs with condensation. randy of course uses whole milk, because otherwise why bother? anything less is indistinguishable from water, and besides he thinks that the fat in whole milk acts as some kind of a buffer that retards the dissolution-into-slime process. the giant spoon goes into his mouth before the milk in the bowl has even had time to seek its own level. a few drips come off the bottom and are caught by his freshly washed goatee (still trying to find the right balance between beardedness and vulnerability, randy has allowed one of these to grow). randy sets the milk-pod down, grabs a fluffy napkin, lifts it to his chin, and uses a pinching motion to sort of lift the drops of milk from his whiskers rather than smashing and smearing them down into the beard. meanwhile all his concentration is fixed on the interior of his mouth, which naturally he cannot see, but which he can imagine in three dimensions as if zooming through it in a virtual reality display. here is where a novice would lose his cool and simply chomp down. a few of the nuggets would explode between his molars, but then his jaw would snap shut and drive all of the unshattered nuggets straight up into his palate where their armor of razor-sharp dextrose crystals would inflict massive collateral damage, turning the rest of the meal into a sort of pain-hazed death march and rendering him novocain mute for three days. but randy has, over time, worked out a really fiendish cap’n crunch eating strategy that revolves around playing the nuggets’ most deadly features against each other. the nuggets themselves are pillow-shaped and vaguely striated to echo piratical treasure chests. now, with a flake-type of cereal, randy’s strategy would never work. but then, cap’n crunch in a flake form would be suicidal madness; it would last about as long, when immersed in milk, as snowflakes sifting down into a deep fryer. no, the cereal engineers at general mills had to find a shape that would minimize surface area, and, as some sort of compromise between the sphere that is dictated by euclidean geometry and whatever sunken-treasure-related shapes that the cereal-aestheticians were probably clamoring for, they came up with this hard-to-pin-down striated pillow formation. the important thing, for randy’s purposes, is that the individual pieces of cap’n crunch are, to a very rough approximation, shaped kind of like molars. the strategy, then, is to make the cap’n crunch chew itself by grinding the nuggets together in the center of the oral cavity, like stones in a lapidary tumbler.",0,
830548,"my wife and i [traveled around the world](http://spothopping.com/about) recently, and i was asked how we afforded it. [here's what i wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/7igry/welcome_mike_aka_raldi_to_team_reddit/c06qx9t):  ----  traveling is only as expensive as you make it.   hilary and i saved up for most of our late 20s, living in a 400-square-foot apartment and, significantly, having a tiny city hall wedding instead of a giant extravaganza. this allowed us to splurge here and there (renting cars, staying in hotels with air conditioning, visiting first-world countries)  however, even if you only have, say, $5000 -- which you will if you skip the big wedding -- you can still do some really fantastic and life-changing travel. for example, flights from new york to bangkok are currently around $1300 round-trip. alternately, you can get to kunming, china for $1100.. or india for $900. once you get there, the other $3700+ will last months. and, of course, once you get to the other side of the world, you can take short, cheap, local flights; chiang mai to luang prabang is just $129, and the cultures are like night and day. train rides within a country cost even less.  if you go with a buddy, or better yet, a significant other, costs will drop by almost half, since you'll be sharing rental cars, rooms, books, hired guides, etc. really everything except food and admission.  the real extravagant cost of a trip like this is time: you simply can't do it without quitting your job.  i think that, as people start getting married and having babies later and later in life, it's going to be fairly normal to leave one's job and travel for a few months as part of that transition. especially if you're already moving to another city anyway.  and don't worry, you can always get another job. even in this economy.  and you know what? even if i hadn't been able to, even if it had taken me a year to find work, i wouldn't have regretted a thing. not for a second.",0,

748307,"i agree with you that you can build a gaming pc for much cheaper than $1000.  that price point was more directed at being ""futureproof for a few years"".     for the record, i just built myself a pc in that hopes that it would last at least a couple of years before having to buy a new video card:  core 2 duo e8400, msi neo3 motherboard, 4gb ram, radeon 4850 (w/ 1gb ram), and a 500 watt power supply.

422473,"not just embarrassingly parallel, actually. there's often plenty of task parallelism hidden all over the place in regular old code. any time you need to compute two different things and recombine them, for example. in haskell doing those two in parallel is trivial, in other languages you'd first have to do a lot of code inspection and careful reading of apis to ensure the things you're calling don't have side effects that interfere with each other. and after that you're lucky if the language has a lightweight task system, because otherwise you have to do a whole bunch of boilerplate code just to get these two function calls to run in parallel.   once we run out of embarrassingly parallel code we need to exploit the ""non-obviously parallel"" (needs catchy slogan!) code, and that's where these distinctions and static guarantees really shine. i fully agree that it's not hard to parallelize a ray tracer using explicit threads, but try parallelizing a web browser or a game engine, or something like that, and i think the feasibility of manual ""concurrency-based parallelism"" (versus semi-automatic parallelism with static guarantees of determinism) starts showing its limitations.",0,

326222,"&gt; this is from a year ago, copy pasted from a post i made on another forum.  so, flying back from india to america sucks. a 4 hour flight to dubai starting at 4 am in bangalore, a short layover in the coldest airport i've ever been too, and a 13 hour flight back to america. about two hours into the thirteen hour leg, the gut demons started approaching. i think it was the airplane breakfast i ate (greasy sausages). i had the window seat, my mom was next to me, and some random middle aged indian guy who always slept was in the aisle seat. to make things better, the anti-diarrhea pills were checked in . they were probably less than 50 feet from me, and completely inaccessible.  the first shit wasn't bad, i was able to wait till the guy went for a walk, ask my mom to move, and was able to wait ten minutes outside the restrooms to use it. the second round however was much worse. two things i learned about international flight on this trip. the bathrooms are always occupied for ten to fifteen minutes after you get there to wait on them. the bathrooms also run out of soap within four hours, and are never refilled. so, second round came ten minutes before the end of what happens in vegas. instead of pausing the movie, then waking people up, i decided to be polite and to try and wait till the guy got up again. mistake. after the movie, my gutdemons had been roaring for about 5 to 10 minutes. i woke up my mom and got her to wake up the dude (i hate waking strangers up), and mad dashed for the bathroom. there was a line 4 people deep. gut demons started to rumble more and more. i finally got into the bathroom and let loose. i was in there for a good ten minutes or so when there was a knock. the pa announcement said there was turbulence and that we all had to return to our seats. interrupted shits are the bane of my existence, but after the next part had blown through, i clenched my cheeks, wiped, and tried to wash my hands. no soap. my hands smelled like poop (thanks to the half ply toilet paper air emirates carefully budgeted in), and i had to wash my hands with water only. i returned to my seat. i bumped around with the turbulence. i tried to pacify the gut demons. half hour later: round 3.  i had to wake up my mom again who woke up the dude, and i finished the round this time. i washed my hands with water again, and decided that it would be a good idea to avoid eating anything till i found some soap. this round ended in a small victory, because after i left the bathroom, a flight attendant walked in to clean it. she was fucked. that bowl was stained worse than anything i have ever seen. mostly because the bowls don't hold much water in airplanes. my shit went past the water line.  rounds 4 and 5 were much the same and i finally landed in houston international. i booked it to a shitter because round 6 was coming. the bathroom was full of people from the plane, and then my public bathroom fears rose up again. stage fright. even though no shit was coming out, i was able to wash my hands. thank fucking god. i had been pooping like mad for the past 10 hours and couldn't wash my hands for any of it.  i decided to suck it up and wait till i was through customs, i figured it was twenty minutes at most. one hour later, i was farting up a storm, i ran into the bathroom. it was crowded but i was about to blow. stage fright didn't matter any more. i ran into the handicap stall, and let loose. the fart that came out was so loud that it would have out done the brass section of a symphony orchestra. the rumblings and gurgling sounds probably scared everyone shitless in the bathroom, but they had to deal, because i wasn't shitless. i finally was able to take anti-diarrhea pills also. i figure it must be something a little more than indigestion because i've had the shits ever since then too, up until this morning when it finally stopped (i hope).  anyway, moral of the story: 1) always bring anti diarrhea pills on flights. 2) bring your own soap too.",0,

654837,"**edit:** i don't think people are trolling you or trying to be nasty, don't get so uptight about it. if you were wine tasting and seeing galleries, you were probably hanging with different crowds than the typical backpacker. my response is in no way an attack, i just wanted to add my own perspective. your post was long, thorough and generally excellent. i even upvoted it. ---  sorry, but as someone who backpacked around europe for 4 months on his own and is now travelling in the dominican republic, i feel qualified to comment.  &gt; get a eurorail pass, and make sure to check in with each station before you travel. they have train strikes occasionally, and the trains can shut down for upwards of 5 days.  this totally depends on where you're going and how much the trains are locally. i met several people who ended up not using their eurail pass much because the local trains were so much cheaper. if you're constrained to 1-2 months then it's a great idea, but if you're travelling more slowly.. no. domestic airfares are also really cheap if you use skyscanner and expedia, sometimes cheaper than having a eurail pass in the first place.  &gt; research hostels- some of them are downright nasty- have at least 3 in mind for any city and always have enough cash to get a hotel backup, because there are times when all of the hostels are full.  agreed, hostelworld is your friend. use couchsurfing wherever you can, though. it's a lot cheaper and gives you a much more true impression of a city.  &gt; pack lite, and be prepared to ship stuff home. when i say pack lite, i mean 2 pairs of pants( not jeans, will explain more later), 2 shirts, 2 pairs of underwear  i found that i spend relatively little time with my backpack on my back. i have 7 pairs of underwear, socks and t-shirts, just because i don't like doing laundry all that much. personal preference, i suppose. my pack is still quite light at 10kg (~25 lbs)  &gt; don't take jeans- very few people in europe wear jeans, and you will stick out like a sore thumb and be instantly pegged as american. black pants and black, gray, white shirts are best to fit in.  as everyone else said, this is silly. in winter i barely took mine off. i wear them out clubbing as well. people spot you as a tourist because of your dorky sneakers - wear a pair of all stars or other casual shoes and you'll look more like a local. one pair is of jeans is plenty, though. as for those that say ""they take so long to dry"" - how often do you wash your jeans?  &gt; don't be alsolutely set on a plan, takes the fun out of it, but know what cities you want to see, and know where in those cities you would like to end up. have phone numbers, addresses, ect in your phone ready to be accessed before you get there.  agreed, i plan less than a week ahead and it's working out really well for me.  &gt; don't carry cash. take one travelers check for $200 or so just in case,and keep it in a safe place, but do not get more than that, because getting them cashed is a pain in the ass. use a credit card with buyer protection and a high credit limit. hostels and hotels put an excess amount for damages on the card, sometimes as much as $500, and it can take up to a week for it to be taken off, which could leave you in a pinch if you are running low on money.  i have a prepaid travel credit card that lets me take out local currency from atms for very little. travelers cheques? is it 1992? i didn't know they still existed. cash is still king, so i have to strongly disagree with this one.  &gt; the must sees are : paris is amazing- try to stay in the sacre coeur,  mt. pilatus( zurich), all of venice is beautiful, prague is a must see.  i didn't do much of western europe, but to that i would add budapest, munich, berlin, london. if you're more adventurous, see the baltics, poland, and somewhere nordic (iceland was amazing).  &gt; you will meet a lot of people in hostels- ask them where the good places to go are, but don't trust them with your stuff, and don't 'join up' with them. there are some people who will quickly take advantage of young people who are traveling.  what the hell? did you have a bad experience or something? i'm travelling on my own and rely on meeting people in hostels. i haven't met one loony or thief yet, so i'm assuming you had a bad experience or something. i'm 24 and most people i've met are my age or younger.  &gt; try not to eat in restaurants every meal. learn how to survive on bread, cheese and an apple, and only go to a restaurant for one meal at most to save yourself money. and you can tip, but keep it conservative. remember it's already added to your bill, so your check will always be more than you thought it would be.  or, you know, cook. most hostels have kitchens and a simple pasta dish with vegetables takes less than half an hour. a 500g bag of pasta will last you a good three nights, too.  &gt; have fun, but be cautious, and be polite. the major beef i heard from most people i met that were european is that americans expect everyone to speak english, they don't learn the systems and they are disrespectful of customs. do your research, learn the number 1-10 for every country you go to, along with please, sorry, excuse me, yes, no, thank you, hello, and good bye. trying to speak the language will get you very far.  this is good advice, but you can't always do it. i've come across 12 different languages so far, and sometimes it's just too hard. as long as you're apologetic it's normally not a big deal. the words you mentioned are good, but i would add ""cheers"".  my only other piece of advice is this: don't stress out. when i first started, i was so worried about being late, people losing my reservation, places being booked out, people not helping, and so on. everything always works out in the end, so stop stressing, relax and enjoy yourself. you're train is moving in the wrong direction?

794161,"i lived in utah for several years. i lived in st. george, utah, which is in the very south, a quick trip from las vegas. i also lived in logan, utah, which is in the very north of the state. the last place i lived was draper utah which is the ritzy part of the salt lake city area.   i was also involved with the mormons/lds church for a while as i was young and was looking for acceptance from the people around me and the only way to do this is to be a mormon, something that is common in utah.   i will go city by city to give you the details.   **st. george area, utah - population 100,000'ish**   this city has very poor city planning and crazy wasteful city contracts given to family friend businesses for unneeded construction.  it has a very corrupt police force; they make huge revenue from the obscene amounts of tickets they produce. non-mormons seem to be targeted by these thugs and thugs they are. they very much have a gang feel to them. this place is a desert. not the neat kind of desert where you find an abundance of life like the sonora desert of arizona. no it's just hotter than anything and has almost no wildlife. the mormons claim this to be their promise land, mostly because they were booted from eastern america. there is nothing promising about this land, it's a lifeless desert, it's hot, really hot, it has red dirt which is neat... for a month or so.  i would only suggest living here if you are 30+ in age. young people are not welcome. the area has a new city, energetic feel and is loaded with trashy people.    **logan area, utah - population 50,000'ish**  this has a small town vibe and is located in a lovely mountain region thick with forests. it snows like crazy in the winter, be prepared for ultra snow. you must be mormon to live here, or fake it. i once took a computer repair shop job and in the interview i was directly asked, ""are you mormon?"". bam, nothing subtle, just ""are you one of us?"". of course i said yes and got a pretty well paying job. the area is beautiful and the people are friendly.   **draper, utah (slc area), population 250,000'ish**  draper is an amazing place. everyone is driving some sort of sports car or benz, lives in a huge house and every one is very courteous. i was able to live in a sweet condo for $650 a month. the roads are well kept and the mormon to ""normal"" person ration is at a more sane level. slc is pretty much white people and mexicans. slc has some great local marijuana and a really strong rave scene. surprising, eh? ""they"" say that the rave scene is dead. not in the slc area they are going strong with some awesome desert raves.    **utah in general**   **race**  honestly the several years i lived in utah i only saw a hand full of black people or other races. mormon's, though they will deny it, have a deep hatred for mexicans. funny as the mexicans seem to work hella hard and are good at their duties as well. (they make awesome drinking buddies too, woo!) i knew this older man for many years. he was a very devout mormon and a good person all around. one day he saw some mexicans on tv, maybe the local news, and i heard him say, ""ugh, those filthy wet backs are at it again"" (wet back is a racist term for mexicans). i was shocked!   **drugs**  alcohol is easy enough to buy in utah, you can buy beer at the grocery store or gas stations, though the % of alcohol is slightly lower than average. they also have state liquor stores which are fully stocked. utah has one of the countries worst meth problems. people i knew, and i try to hang with a higher class crowd (go where the money is ;-) ), smoked meth, maybe nine people i knew! they sure had good bodies though. marijuana is easy to get, lots of ""brick weed"" down there though. other drugs are pretty hard to find.   **mormons**   **race**  this is where things get scary. planning on moving to utah? then you better plan on donating 10% of your income and spending about eight hours a week for mormon related things. yes, eight hours. something you notice immediately is that the mormon church also equals ""the white people club"". there are pretty much only white people. they are racist and predigest as all hell. queers, wetbacks, niggers and the rest of you aren't welcome! (sorry to use such words, but i'm trying to give you an idea here of what it is like.)   **sex**  they are supposed to practice abstinence until marriage which is a complete joke. i'm actually laughing while writing this thinking about all the slutty oppressed girls i met while in utah. the more religious her parents are the crazier she will be in the sack.   women are treated like horse shit in the lds world. you will not see this initially but after living with them for a while it is clear that the male is seen as the ""greater of the genders"" and should be given more respect.   **union**  in order to be married in the temple, which are the mormon's most holy of places, i think they have a few hundred world wide now, you must pay your 10 tithe of your gross income (i found it funny that they actually mention gross as apposed to net) for a year before hand (yes, you pay your way into heaven, of sorts), must be moral and all of that for a year. most families want their kids to be married in the temple or else you very well could be an outcast. after you get married in the temple you must wear... silly... magic underwear, which most don't really wear.   **lds missionaries (aka those guys who come to your door with name tags)**  like the temple, in order to have ""honor"" in your mormon family you must also serve a ""mission"", which is a two year sentence to go to a random country and grow their corporation, er, religion. while serving this mission you must not have sex (duh) or a girlfriend or watch any tv or use any sophisticated electronic equipment. they sort of have this bragging thing going on where the worst conditions you served your mission in the ""cooler"" you are. did you turn 18 and are not serving a mission for your mormon family? well you are pretty much an outcast now. son?! i have no son!   a lot of these missionaries come back pretty physiologically scarred, though the mormon church covers those up,  as well as the deaths...  i once lived in a very large house shared by many young men. it was sort of like a ... mansion hotel thing... anyway, a lot of the young men were returned missionaries. they had some really strange habits from living alone or with another man for two years. a few of them were psychologically scarred from the experience. i once woke up to find one of them had opened my room’s door and was standing in my doorway masturbating at me. yeah, so i freaked out. i moved out a few weeks later when i could. before i moved that same guy had stolen my wallet and my shoes…. weird thing is he took everything out of my wallet and placed it neatly down. to this day i am still pretty sure he just wanted memorabilia of me, maybe to whack it to? i’ll take it as a compliment. i had a close friend leave on his mission and come back two years later. he was not the same. he use to be this cool ladies man type, when he came back he was a nervous wreck and he dropped out of collage a year later. if you put that you were a missionary on your application/resume in utah you are a lot more likely to get the job, most of the time.    **the temple (you are never allowed to talk about what happens in there or what it’s like in there, so here you go. :d )**  i participated in a temple event once as someone was getting married. the whole thing was silly sometimes to the point of giggly ridiculousness. when you go in you need to change into your temple garments and robe (magic underwear and wizard robes of sorts). then the elders, who are like priests, wash your feet it warm oil. you then go and sit inside of a very richly decorated room for prayers and what not. they have the room filled with hanging translucent silk sheets, lace and what not, it gives is a “dreamy” vibe when you are in there. the people go through these sheets which are known as the “veil”, as in you are passing through the veil of holiness and now you are better than everyone else and might go to the 5th level heaven to become godly rulers of your very own planet, once you die. you are given a secret name, like a secret password, to use when you get to heaven, if you forget your secret name/password, you are screwed out of getting into the uber heaven. (to steal from southpark) this is what momons actually believe!   **numbers**  the mormon church lies like crazy about their numbers. the largest lie is about how many mormons there actually are out there. hell, when i was a teen and lived in utah for a good while i really was thinking mormons were the most popular religion! this is what they try to trick you into believing.   **scariest event in utah**  i was at a desert rave, it was just getting going. the people had purchased the permit to hold the rave, everything was cool. then bam, police dressed in military garb came in on atvs, from helicopters and brought attack dogs. they all had military weapons too. they arrested a bunch of people for partying and.. well.. it was nuts. of course the cops got away with it on technicalities. here are some videos:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_p8mtd5vg  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spowlvwsc_a&amp;feature=playlist&amp;p=2598210902335b37&amp;index=0   anyway, thank you for reading. since i put so much time into writing this i’m just going to c+p this into every article i find about utah or mormons.   have a great day everyone!",1,1

732861,"&gt; &gt; well, in the realm of the subconscious, sure, maybe that's true. how would i know? in turn, maybe you're reacting to your own conditioning and painting me with a subconscious palette of your own.  &gt; you know because someone's calling you on it. elaborate on my subconscious palette.  no, i don't know that.  i know some guy on the internet has accused me of it, and i know myself well enough to know it may or may not be true, and that i might not know either way.  to elaborate on my suggestion that perhaps you're shading me with your own indoctrination, it's at least as fair to suggest it as possible.  &gt; i'm just replying to what you said. you said you were raised in christian dogma. the only negativity that can possibly be attributed to black people is the story of ham, and how his progeny would be black with curly hair and big penises. they also talked wonderfully about ethiopia, and egypt. so i don't know how christian dogma relates to this subject. i don't even understand why you brought it up.  i think you need to read what i said again.  i said nothing about christianity having any effect on my opinion toward black people.  christianity only ""taught"" me creationism, which i was able to move past.  my point has nothing to do with any link between black people and christianity.  &gt; if that is what finally made you believe in evolution, you may have some serious psychological problems. in no way do blacks resemble apes. if you see that, it proves the subconscious thing i spoke of earlier.  hah, you're so, uh, motivated...  psychological problem? no.  not really.  unenlightened, perhaps.  &gt; first of all, what's this universal measurement of 'smart' you are using? it seems pretty general. lets assume you are saying that most white people get better grades, have larger vocabularian, and just larger bases of mental knowledge than their black counterparts. that's true. across the globe that's true.  ok, i should have known you'd call me on saying ""smart"", when it's not an accurate term.  i meant more intelligent.  not more educated.  &gt; but with that, if you turn to a man, you will see that damn near every black person on earth are living through some type of oppression. africa, india, australia, north and south america. we can argue about whether blacks are oppressed in the us of a but that's another conversation for a different day. music and sports are the only way that most black people can get to any prominence, so of course blacks will excel in what they are given.  i would never argue that black people haven't been given short thrift.  however, that measure of intelligence is true *across all economic and social levels*.  and yes, i've heard the argument that the things black people tend to excel at are those things that are available to them, like sports and music, and that they have historically had little chance to work at science, etc.  and yes, that must certainly affect their ability to contribute to those areas.  still, i don't think that circumstance account for that division, when the distribution of intelligence in races shows quite simply that there are fewer really, really intelligent black people than really white or asian.  &gt; no. negroid is not more accurate. that word came from european intellectuals naming the land south of the sahara ""negroland"". it's a dumb racist word which should be eradicated. africa is also a european(roman) word that should be eradicated but that's a subject for another conversation.  well, i know that wikipedia is such as easy source to dismiss that this probably won't mean much to you, but... negroid refers to southern african black people, while africoid refers to all black skinned people regardless of recent african evolutionary origin.  i think your distaste for ""negroid"" comes from the obvious root ""negro"" and the hateful use of that word and its derivatives.  anyway, negoid is still in common scientific use, so what's your objection.  are you a black history professor or major?  you seem to have that kind of political bent to your message.  &gt; i'd argue that scandinavians and germans are more muscular and taller than most blacks. the fact that you say that they are taller and stronger tells me that you have not met many(if at all any) because naturally blacks are slender people, and indeed smaller in height than europeans. see africa.  i'm certainly not an expert on any of this and wouldn't try to act like one.  but i seriously question whether blacks are actually naturally shorter than europeans.  perhaps malnutrition in modern africa makes it so, but genetically, no, i stil doubt that.  still, if you're quite sure, i could take your word for it, though anecdotaly, most american blacks i've ever known were certainly tall guys by my standard.  &gt; i don't know where you get your facts from so i'll ignore the ashkenazi thing. if you judge intelligence on ""art, government, farming, astronomy, medicine, math and organized armies"" then blacks must be the smartest on earth, all that stuff came from africa. see:ancient egypt, nubia, harrapan, and ethiopia all of which, are black civilizations. i'll also add that those thing came about long before the first european wore a shoe, or lived in a house with a window.  i wish i could find the study, and if you're interested in continuing this debate i will try to find it for you.  the ashkenazi were way out in front as far as average iq.  i wasn't really trying to judge intelligence of the asians and arabs by pointing out the successful civilations they built while white people were tribal.  i was pointing out that they were a hell of a lot better at getting a complex civilization rolling, since their success with it came so much sooner, and listing that as perhaps a historical strength of the race.  i understand your point about african contributions, however i'm not aware (and you can tell me) that southern africa ever did of anything compared to northern africa or the rest of the world.  many people in southern africa are still living as hunter gatherers, some stone age, and nomads, to this day.  it seems like you are almost prodding me as though i might feel some insult or need to defend the white race when you point these things out.  that's weird, because the tone of my last post should have made it clear that i don't hold the white race above any others.  &gt; i'd say whites are really good at oppression, war, and living in squalor. see: european dark ages. i agree pretty much with your last paragraph though.  man, white people aren't the only ones who've had their turn at oppression.  but yes, since the rise of the british empire, they got pretty good at it.  funny that you should mention the dark ages as being one of the most shameful periods for the white race, when the real problem during that time was the catholic church was actively suppressing reading, books, and science.  it set back the technological progress of the white race by 300 years.  and with that element we come back to the original topic, that religious beliefs were standing in the way of science for me, and a quirk of appearance made it easier for me to escape.  if you don't mind, you seem to have taken these things personally, and as i mentioned earlier your non-mainstream negroid/africoid position makes me think that you might be a black history buff.  is that true?",1,
543674,"&gt; a purely technical argument! i'd love to hear it.  a few examples:  1. [microsoft ignores whole classes of vulnerabilities.](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=286)  it just expects us to make up for the lack of vulnerability fixes with [half-baked, third-party ""protection""](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=624) that is only really effective after the system has already been exposed to exploit code.  2. even for classes of vulnerability it doesn't ignore, [microsoft sometimes waits years to fix known vulnerabilities](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=657).  hell, its fastest turn-around time on a vulnerability patch was ten days -- longer than the *typical* turn-around time for some systems.  3. even when it provides vulnerability fixes in a timely manner, they sometimes create more problems than they solve, such as in the case of the sql slammer fiasco.  in case you don't recall the details, microsoft issued a patch that fixed the vulnerability sql slammer exploited, then it issued other patches, then sql slammer hit, and it actually affected a bunch of systems that had previously been patched against that vulnerability.  it turned out that installing certain of the later patches in the ""wrong"" order would undo the fix from the earlier patch against the vulnerability sql slammer exploited.  4. in the world of ms windows, [privilege separation is a joke](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=376).  5. ms windows doesn't exactly handle [secure memory usage](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=457) very well.  6. the way ms windows changes itself without warning, at microsoft's behest, and hides its behavior and inner workings from the user or admin much of the time, makes implementing effective integrity auditing a significant challenge.  7. the fact microsoft employs a ""default allow"" approach to security configuration for its software makes it difficult for admins to be sure a system is sufficiently secured.  trying to secure a system with an inherent default allow policy is a bit like trying to prove a negative.  8. [microsoft routinely violates the security of its own os](http://jaqui-greenlees.net/2008/04/08/microsoft-breaking-the-law-again/) on our behalf.  these problems -- and others -- make it far easier than it should be for malicious security crackers to do things like:  - skim encryption keys from keystrokes, ram, or swap space on the hard drive  - achieve privilege escalation once a foothold has been gained via a less privileged process  - gain a foothold on the system in the first place  . . . all of which undermine the protective value of encryption and other privacy measures.   &gt; a quote from the eula for rhel  that's totally not the kind of eula terms i was talking about.  try this stuff from ms windows eulas:  &gt; you acknowledge and agree that microsoft may automatically check the version of the software and/or its components that you are utilizing and may provide upgrades or fixes to the software that will be automatically downloaded to your workstation computer.  . . .  &gt; by using these features, you explicitly authorize microsoft or its designated agent to access and utilize the necessary information for internet gaming and/or updating purposes.  . . .  &gt; you agree that microsoft and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services provided to you, if any, related to the software.  . . .  &gt; **in no event shall microsoft** or its suppliers **be liable** for any special, incidental, punitive, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits or confidential or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy, for failure to meet any duty including of good faith or of reasonable care, for negligence, and for any other pecuniary or other loss whatsoever) arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the software, the provision of or failure to provide support or other services, informaton, software, and related content through the software or otherwise arising out of the use of the software, or otherwise under or in connection with any provision of this eula, **even in the event of the fault, tort (including negligence), misrepresentation, strict liability, breach of contract or breach of warranty of microsoft** or any supplier, and even if microsoft or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  emphasis mine on that last one.  read just the bolded parts a couple of times, and realize that microsoft is saying ""even if we violate contract, the terms of our own license agreement, and maliciously cause you harm, you agree to hold the corporation blameless.""  combine that with the previous quotes from the eula that i provided, and see if that doesn't scare you.  my complaint about the eula isn't just about the kind of disclaimer of liability for failure of fitness of purpose, or about the limitation of recoverable damages to no more than the direct cost of acquiring the software in the first place.  i'm talking about terms that basically grant microsoft the ""right"" to send pit bulls to your house to tear your leg off (metaphorically speaking) for no reason other than the same reason a child might tear the wings off a fly or use a magnifying glass to cook ants.",0,

735517,"i'm an atheist who used to be a batshit insane hardcore pentecostal christian. the transition was incredibly painful. most atheists who have not been fervent christians cannot understand just how hard it really is to go from god being the center of your life to atheism. you sound a lot like i did when i was losing my faith. i hope things work out.  epicurus' problem of evil really summed it all up for me. i don't know if you're worrying about this, but for me a big deal was the whole 'going to hell' thing if i'm wrong. but then i made peace with that, realizing that ultimately if i go to heaven i'll be lying and pretending to love a god that can't do his job right, while judging how i lived my life with what little choices i had. i have seen so many horrible things happen to me and people who i know, and there's no answer or apology or explanation from god; yet he judges us for having dirty thoughts and being human? do i really want to spend eternity with someone like that? i think i'd rather go to hell an honest man, rather than go to heaven kissing god's ass and pretending to be someone i'm really not. as far as peace goes, that's what finally got me to relax and just go on with my life as a new atheist. that, and reading a lot.   oh, i should also add that what started me on my path towards atheism was that i couldn't reconcile that the god they preach about in church (loving, passionate, sweet, wonderful, desiring a relationship with us, it's all about relationship not sin, etc) had nothing to do with the god in the bible (legalistic, angry, cold, heartless, playing mind-games, advocating genocide and misogyny and slavery, etc). this only made me read the bible harder and all it did was confirm that christianity as we know it has nothing to do with the bible.   tl;dr if you really need someone to talk to or chat with, i'm here for what little it's worth; if all the bullshit i went through can help someone else, that makes my life so much better for it :)",0,

531333,"thanks. i didn't either. i love woodworking, and i've been building up a shop over the past year or two, now that i have a garage finally, and at some point, it occurred to me i really didn't know much about the trees the wood came from. i started looking up what i knew (oak, maple, poplar - stuff from home depot), learning scientific names, and soon i realized what an uphill battle i faced. there are over 400 species of oak (*quercus* spp.) probably a few dozen maples (*acer* spp. - pronounced just like the computer maker). the poplar at home depot isn't true poplar (genus *[populus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/populus)*), but a specific species known as tulip poplar (*liriodendron tulipifera*), which gets really cool purple mineral streaks through it. this is annoyingly rampant - everyone misnames things to sell them, kind of like how crab meat is often really whitefish. [this page alone](http://www.woodworkerssource.com/blog/?p=296?utm_source=news306&amp;utm_medium=bloglink&amp;utm_campaign=wwsnews) gives you the tiniest peek into things with some of the craziness surrounding mahogany, and that's just a sampling of all that makes up 'mahogany,' and mahogany is a drop in the bucket of all the woods out there. there are over 1200 species of bamboo. there are over 730 species of eucalyptus, and they tend to transform through their life to look like each other, so it's frickin' impossible to really know what eucalyptus you have. you actually have to have certain things, like the flowers, or the fruit to be able to tell many apart. it's kinda aggravating to me and my efforts to really learn it all :)  one incredible thing is that the sweeping majority of all there is to know about woods is just not online. you'd think someone somewhere would be posting about every kind of tree, but apparently not, because try as i might, i just can't find pictures of a huge portion of them, and i don't even know the names of most of them. there's no comprehensive list. there are over 100,000 species according to the [iwcs](http://www.woodcollectors.org/) (international wood collector's society, believe it or don't), and over the past year i've decided independently that they're probably vastly underestimating things. what really gets me is that when i find a new species to temporarily obsess over, it's almost always in its own genus, and that genus almost always has dozens or hundreds of other member species. how many damn genuses are there!? thousands, at least.  one of my favorite sites to get lost in is [hobbit house](http://hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/), run by a talented bowl-maker, and clearly ocd/asperger's man who has taken it as a personal mission to catalog every wood he can get his hands on, color-correcting his own pics, and all the pics he can find online, because he's tired of places like wood flooring sites upping contrast and saturation to make things more beautiful (and i'm in full agreement here). he takes macros of end grain, and explains every picture (e.g. 'this shot is a bit more red than it was in real life - i did my best to color correct it). just [scroll down this page](http://hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/), and look at all of the woods he's listed. that may not even be 1% of the woods out there. i've looked for probably a dozen woods there that he doesn't have (weeping bottlebrush (*callistemon viminalis*) and paperbark (*melaleuca quinquenervia*) spring to mind). the iwcs has a page on [how difficult a hobby it is](http://www.woodcollectors.org/collect.htm) to track down all woods everywhere (basically flat-out impossible, even for an eccentric billionaire). then you have to wade through trade names, like some wood i purchased from a building supply company for decking called mangaris™. it's ™ed because the actual species is red balau ([shorea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shorea) spp. - nearly 200 species). mangaris™ is a name a company made up to sell it under.  but enough about woods - you probably get the picture by now. it's *vast*, to say the least. one thing i've noticed working in all of these woods is how very different they are. we tend to think of woods when working them as heavy, light, hard, soft, safe or splintery, but most have a pretty powerfully unique smell. i've had eucalyptus and douglas fir that smell exactly like lemon candy - very strong and sweet. i've also had douglas fir that smelled 100% like warm, cut-open pumpkins. walnut smells to me like chocolate bread pudding when cutting, especially if the blade is dull and burns the wood a bit (delicious!). red oak has an ammonia-like smell (though not at all ammonia specifically) that burns my nose and makes my eyes tear up, like getting lemon squirted in my eyes, just from the smell. every wood i've worked now has exceptionally distinct smells that are all tied to memories for me now, including alder - just got some free from a sign shop - which took me right back to a play room in kindergarten. the painting easels were made from it - very distinct, strong smell, and it put right back in that moment, decades later.  here are some of the many, many things that have been utterly fascinating to me along this journey...  spalting  i'll refer you [back to hobbit house](http://hobbithouseinc.com/personal/woodpics/maple,%20spalted.htm)'s pictures here. spalting makes for some really beautiful cabinet panels and artistic turnings, but even cooler is what it is. the black lines are where lines of advancing fungal infections met, did battle, and died out for lack of food, as each had eaten all the food behind them. these battles take place inside the ring layers of the tree. different bacterias do different chemical processes to the wood, leaving different colors, sometimes strikingly, like the vase near the end of hobbit's page. it looks like an old timey sepia map. you can spalt your own wood - something i'm keen to try this year - with not much more than a flat plastic under-bed storage box, vermiculite, water, some shavings from an already spalted log or plank, some fresh maple, and a month or three of patience. lots of woods spalt, but maple is most famous for it, both common enough and understood enough to be a viable product that you can buy from wood stores.  shellac  one of the best wood finishes, and very historic (used all over through early america, e.g.), it penetrates a bit, works great as a go-between layer between dissimilar finishes that  usually don't adhere to each other well, and really brings out the iridescence of woods, as seen in [this really simple lazy susan i made](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-smy5eg8eo8) (hq mode helps there). that was zinsser sealcoat from home depot, which is dewaxed shellac, which is what you want if you want to topcoat it - as i did there with some spar urethane. regular shellac contains wax that makes topcoats adhere poorly. but what is shellac? it's an excretion from the female lac bug to form a cocoon, sticking a proboscis into the tree to drink sap continually, and secrete the waxy shell continuously, and they only do this in a few parts of the world, like india and thailand. thousands will completely coat a tree in this stuff, layers of it, and natives of the region will either cut down the limbs, or climb the trees and scrape it all off. the mess they bring home is called stick-lac, which is then boiled and strained through something like pantyhose to get the bugs and twigs out of it. this is left to cool in trays, and then broken up like peanut brittle and bagged. pros don't buy premixed stuff, like i do from hd. they go to a pro shop and actually buy small bags with flakes of the stuff inside, formed as i mentioned. then they mix it with denatured alcohol in a sealed jar to a set ratio and let it sit for a day or two. now it's like the stuff in the store, but more natural - less extra crap. the ratio of the mix is known as the pound-cut (e.g. 1lbs cut = 1lbs of flakes to 1gal of alcohol). there are [different colors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:shellac_varities.png), but this is natural. lac bugs from different regions create stick-lac of different shades of red, orange, or yellow. you can always rub denatured alcohol on even long-dried shellac to reliquify it, which is great to smooth up a finish again if it gets knicked up. the biggest down side is it doesn't do well near heat sources - gets cloudy. it's also used as a coating for lots of candies, like skittles. yes, when you taste the rainbow, you're actually eating bug secretions.  colors  there are a lot of crazy colors of wood out there. [here are just a couple in my collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/garyfixler/3179387098/in/set-72157612312027442/). strangely, though i've seen incredibly vivid yellow, orange, red, purple, green, black, pink, and every shade of brown wood, i've never seen anything blue. some eucalyptus is [fucking insane](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickih/479309297/), though inside it's not like that, sadly.  age  trees can be [incredibly old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_trees). i thought i'd found the oldest awhile ago in ""methusela,"" which is a bristlecone pine in california that's 4800 years old, protected in a park, its location kept secret by the few who know which particular ancient tree there it actually is, but i was wrong. recently, an unassuming, 14' tall tree in sweden was determined to be [9550 years old](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080414-oldest-tree.html), having taken root at the end of the last ice age! mind-boggling.",0,

624019,"obama isn't just thinking about 4 or 8 years.  he is moving to crush the gop by bringing evangelicals and conservatives to the democrats or at least driving them into new parties.  he can do this by simply appealing to them occasionally and he clearly said over and over he would be appealing to conservatives as well as liberals. all that talk about a house divided cannot stand, we must cooperate across party lines. did you think that was just campaign promise ? it's part of his bigger strategy of reshaping politics by changing the way the game is played.  if dems have evangelicals a entire host of slander will no longer be appeal for the gop to use, along with them losing highly necessary votes.   i'd give gun nuts their guns too, i mean it's not criminals lobbying for the nra mostly it's just dumb rednecks. there is no reason to stand against the 2nd amendment, it's pretty clear, we are supposed to have guns to protect the state from corrupt government or foreign invaders.   you could even move to pull the anti abortion crowd. at some point we all have to admit it's a pretty barbaric practice and that education could displace most abortions if everyone would get on board. the liberals could probably live with abortion being limited to rape, medical emergency and such. it's perfect really. allows abortion to disappear and woman who really need abortions need but find a doctor who isn't too stingy with the definition of medical necessity. you know like, she is under to much stress.  call the reform an abortion ban and you've just won over half the gop and now there is only one real political party. i don't really want all the nutballs, but they certainly do more damage when allied together and led blindly on their emotions.     piracy in the us is a problem, like it or not. there should be negative consequences to stealing programmers hard work.   however in the long run, if obama pulls conservatives in it will mean dems stay in power longer and have a real chance to make change.  obama never said he would do national health care either, his plan was the weakest of the three.   but i think it's clear he is the smartest as well and he is willing to not reveal his whole hand. he does plot as politicians do to win people over.   i think, at the very least, these masses of white trash evangelicals should at least be voting for the party that doesn't want to take away their welfare and wants to provide them with services like the unemployment office.   so, in my opinion he is mostly just doing what he said he was going to do, trying to unite america under a moderate platform.  he feels unity is more important than the ideology of the democratic party and judging by our behavior he may be right. we might need civility more than we need copyright piracy and legal weed.  i also think to avoid the bs he won't move to national health care all at once. he'll make a  cheaper federal insurance that will over time displace private insurance, pulling more and more people each year to federal insurance until the feds have all the negotiating power and private insurance can't run their joint scam with the medical industry of overpricing everything and then marking it down if we insurance.   insurance just means i pay a monthly fee for a service even when i don't need it. it's not also supposed to be a members only discount club because then you displace any free market competition within the medical industry by having this big fat pool of money just asking to be spent. i mean what would happen is they had a large surplus in the insurance pool, would they lower premiums ?  yea right ! well, that's not supply and demand, we have to regulate and add morals back to american business or they are going to starve their own nation out of money.",1,

668403,"around the same time that conan o’brien was named the next host of “the tonight show,” general electric, nbc’s parent company, purchased vivendi universal entertainment and fused the two divisions. a newly hatched nbc universal moved most of its west coast operations from burbank to universal city. this means that the new “the tonight show” will not hail, as it did for decades, from burbank. “i was worried that we would be the least-exciting attraction at the universal theme park,” o’brien said in late april, as he stood outside his new offices. the nondescript five-story building was constructed for “the tonight show” on what was once a parking lot. the offices are connected to an existing soundstage, which will house the studio. “in 1961, jack benny filmed his show here,” o’brien said, pointing to his new home. “and then, in the ’80s, ‘knight rider’ was shot here. but i prefer to associate with benny.” o’brien walked toward the soundstage. “they wanted to put my name on the building, but rule no. 1 in hollywood is don’t put your name on anything,” o’brien said. “all i imagine is them putting my name in cement and then having to jackhammer it out.”  the universal lot could not be more different from rockefeller center. located in the san fernando valley, universal is an old-fashioned working back lot, where spielberg (and others) still shoot parts of their movies. where rockefeller center, in all its deco splendor and history, is urban, charmingly chaotic and rather cavelike, universal is vast and sunny and seems to have been designed by dozens of architects with no interest in comparing notes. there are low bungalows that look as if they belong to silent-film stars next to office buildings that resemble swinging-singles apartment complexes from the ’70s.  the show’s offices, which are just inside the studio’s gates, are completely generic. “i wanted it that way,” o’brien said, as he took the elevator to the fourth floor and walked down the hall to his new home. “i said, i don’t want a desk made of onyx and baboon skulls.” he shipped his old metal desk from his new york office; the same cork bulletin board that hung there was mounted on the wall here. the color coding has changed: yellow index cards now connote comedy ideas; blue, possibilities for remotes; white, material for o’brien to perform at the desk; and each pink card, the name of a scheduled guest. the lineup for the first show, on june 1, was set: will ferrell and pearl jam. (interestingly, o’brien will be leno’s guest on his last show.)  ideas were starting to take shape, too, many of them inspired by the back lot itself. “jaws” was a huge hit for universal, and one writer suggested that bruce, the mechanical shark, could occasionally drop by the show. “in our mind, he sounds like paul lynde,” o’brien explained. “he dishes dirt about his co-stars.” the show had an exact replica of o’brien’s desk built onto the front of a golf cart and, later that day, o’brien was scheduled to take a short road trip through the studio. “we’re going to drive up to the ‘psycho’ house and try and interview norman bates at the desk,” o’brien said. “and maybe we’ll take a break during 1869 in western town. and then we’ll swing by the ‘desperate housewives’ set and try to see eva longoria in her trailer for an interview.  for o’brien, the open landscape of california may be both inspiring and isolating. in his “late night” show in new york, o’brien was able to define himself as a smart outsider, but “the tonight show” is, by its nature, a different game for a different crowd. traditionally, it has mirrored the mood of the country. “johnny’s the one i look back to,” o’brien continued. “the constant is johnny. he was very sophisticated, but he was also a clown. as a kid, i was fascinated by the fact that while he was clearly the coolest guy in america, he could dress up like an old woman or have a raccoon crawl on his head. he surrendered his dignity, and it only made him cooler. there aren’t a lot of hosts who will put on a skimpy bathing suit and jump into a hot tub with don rickles.” o’brien picked up a guitar. “when i first got ‘late night,’ ” he said, “i was whisked to john cheever connecticut to a 50th birthday party for bob wright, who was then the head of nbc. they said, ‘we want you to get up and be funny.’ and then i realized that johnny carson was there, too. i was petrified. johnny was wearing dark glasses and he was ramrod straight and perfectly coiffed. he was very shy. i wanted to kill myself. and i had to go first. i had prepared a thing — the idea was i didn’t know who bob wright was — and it worked. people really laughed. and johnny nodded. then he got up, made his toast and blew the roof off the place. afterward, he came over to me and said, ‘good luck to you.’ he said, ‘just be yourself — that’s the only way it can work.’ ” o’brien paused, “there’s an opportunity to put my stamp on this show. i’ve got an ego, and i want to do my ‘tonight show.’ ”  o’brien was interrupted by jeff ross, who wanted him to go downstairs to the stage. when the set was being designed, o’brien’s main concern was that the space not feel too big. “we want to have a parade of elephants if we need it,” ross explained as we went through the stage doors, “but we still want the audience to feel like they’re close to conan.” these decisions matter: for the first two years of leno’s tenure, letterman was regularly beating him. then leno changed studios, switching from carson’s old arrangement, which put him at a distance from the audience, to a closer configuration. as a stand-up comedian, leno played more to the crowd and needed to see faces. it may have been a coincidence or a national change in taste, but when he altered his set, leno started to win in the ratings. and then, in 1995, hugh grant was arrested for soliciting a prostitute and didn’t cancel his “tonight show” booking. when an abashed grant sat down, leno asked, “what the hell were you thinking?” there was a huge laugh, and ratings soared. from then on, leno was no. 1.  “do you think it was the set or hugh?” i asked ross.  “well,” he said, “i couldn’t come up with five names living that will guarantee a rating. news-generated guests will be big, but everything has been diluted by the entertainment shows. everyone is everywhere four or five times a day. so unless you have a sitting president like barack obama on, or a big scandal, you’re better off with a set that helps.”  the new “tonight show” set has the usual elements: band shell stage left, desk stage right and a mesh curtain made of metal in the center. but the curtain is curved and, like the rest of the set, is deco in style. it evokes the mood of 30 rockefeller plaza but is much grander than o’brien’s former set in studio 6a. there are nearly double the number of seats, and there are many more lights flashing. “i liked the set,” lorne michaels told me later, “but i wonder if it’s the movie version of a talk show.”  as he wandered around the stage, o’brien looked comfortable, at home. “the hardest thing in l.a. is a destination,” he said. “i’m spoiled. i’ve had the destination in new york: rockefeller center. it’s the high temple of american tv, and we were smack-dab in the middle of it. l.a. is different. everything can feel like the lunar landscape out here.”  he paced around the set. the set wasn’t finished: there were at least 25 workers installing lights or checking plans or hammering. “i’m happy when i’m in the studio,” o’brien said. “i’m eating my meals here now.” o’brien’s desk wasn’t finished yet, and there were three folding chairs where

935651,"“nazi methamphetamine” tabletop recipe: standard equipment needed (5 grams): 7.5 grams iodine prill or iodine crystals ephedrine or pseudoephedrine….1665 pills produces 5 pure grams sodium hydroxide…………………1 pint red devil lye 3.5 grams red-phosphorus…...5000 matchbook’s 250ml glass flask…………………2 20oz plastic jug’s…………………2 coffee filters……………………….6 electric coffee cup warmer….1 6’’ or longer rubber hoses…...3 plastic gallon jug’s…...1 the push/pull does not take a lot of skill but does take a bit of understanding of what one is dealing with. first of all this method does require some very watched items. red phosphorous and iodine crystals can bring unwanted attention if ordered from different supply companies. if by chance one cannot seem to obtain these items anywhere, there is still hope. it is possible to obtain these items otc (over the counter) at your nearest supermarket. if one can get one's hands on lab grade without getting a one-way ticket to the slammer, it is well worth it. the striking pads of matchbooks contain a small amount of red phosphorous. it is not pure, so consider cleaning it up a bit before use. it is possible to convert iodine tinctures to iodine crystals. tinctures can be found on the shelves of many different supermarkets, and come in 30 ml bottles of 2% iodine in solution. tinctures are also available at cattle supply houses, in pint and gallon sizes, which contain 7% iodine in solution. iodine prill, a common name for iodine powder or pellets often available in cattle supply stores as well, works great just the way it is. there are many different ways to collect red phosphorous from the striking pads of matchbooks. scraping it off with a razor blade is a simple collection process. a better way is to cut the strikers off and soak them in acetone until the red phosphorous falls off. it takes a very large number of strikers to obtain a large enough pile to do anything with, but it is a proven method in use by many people. when all of the phosphorous falls off the paper, remove the paper, filter the acetone/red phosphorous through two coffee filters, rinse with distilled water, and let dry. now mix up a solution of 20% sodium hydroxide. that is 20% grams of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of distilled water. place the dry red phosphorous in a beaker or flask of choice and add the hydroxide solution to it. heat this mixture on low heat for a few hours, and then filter through two coffee filters again. when dry, rinse with hot distilled water a few times and let dry. this will produce a more pure powder that will fire off a push/pull reaction.  to convert 2% iodine tinctures, the following are used: 500 ml 2% iodine tincture 125 ml muramic acid (hardware store strength) 235 ml hydrogen peroxide (3% topical solution) 862 ml distilled water to convert 7% iodine tinctures, the following are used: 1 pint of 7% tincture 3 pints of 3% peroxide 2 oz. of muriatic acid '/a cup of distilled water pour the tincture in a one-gallon milk jug, add the muriatic acid, and mix it all together well. let this mixture sit for half an hour. now add the 3% hydrogen peroxide, with thorough mixing, and let it sit for another half an hour. next, add the distilled water and shake vigorously until your arms tire, then let it sit for another half an hour. there should be an orange layer on top of a dark grey layer. the grey layer is what you want. the grey layer is iodine crystals that have crashed out of solution. pour off the orange layer, add more fresh distilled water to them, and shake again. let it sit for a few minutes, and then pour off the orange solution again. repeat this process three times, and after the third time, pour the contents through two coffee filters. now one must wring dry the crystals in the coffee filters. wring dry, put them in another stack of coffee filters, and wring them out again. keep doing this until one gets a nice solid dry ball of crystals. that is it. one should have nice iodine crystals that will work in the reaction. store the crystals in a dark-colored jar or bottle. warning: when making one's own crystals from tinctures, wear eye protection and chemical resistant gloves. remember that iodine is poisonous, so be safe, and work outdoors.  figure 40 the push/pull set up stopper’s, lids &amp; hoses sealed tight! as one can see from figure 40, it is very easy to construct the apparatus for this reaction. a small clear beer bottle can replace the flask if one is not on hand. this setup easily scales larger or smaller for different size batches. if, for example, one wants to do a 20-gram batch, use a 500 ml flask or bottle and two 64-oz. plastic gatorade jugs. make sure all the hoses scale in place because one does not want any leaks. the reaction can be very quick, but other times it may not be. keep a bucket of dirt or sand at hand to smother any possible phosphorous fire. a phosphorous fire is a possibility, so be on the safe side. with lab grade red phosphorous and iodine crystals, the ratios by weight are 1-gram pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl to 1 gram of iodine crystals to 0.5 gram of red phosphorous. with otc chemicals, the ratios are 1-gram pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl to 1.5 grams of iodine crystals to 0.7 gram of red phosphorous. so now, let us get started with the reaction. first thing to do is set up the push/pull vessel. fill the first water tank with distilled water % of the way full. the second one leave empty. one can either put the drain hose from the second tank down the drain past the u trap or in a bucket of cat litter. weigh out the pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl and place inside the flask or bottle, no more than a 10-gram batch in a  250 ml size flask or bottle. next weigh out the iodine crystals and put them inside with the pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl. mix them together very well and stopper the flask or bottle and place it in the freezer for around 3-4 minutes. weigh out the red phosphorous. take the flask from the freezer, the reactants should be dark and may be a dark thick-looking mud. place the red phosphorous in the flask, mix in good with a glass rod, and hook it up to the water tanks. if the drain hose is down the drain, it is time to turn on the water to keep the fumes down. if using lab grade chemicals, one may have to add a few drops of distilled water to get the reaction going. for otc chemicals, one should need no water; just heat the reactants a little and it should be fine. do not flood the reaction with water! place the flask on a coffee cup warmer or in a hot water bath. when the reaction starts, take it off the heat. during the first phase of the reaction, the mixture turns to a thick liquid and starts bubbling. the small bubbles will be somewhat silvery looking. some gas may now be pushing into the first water tank and water into the second. the contents inside the flask will raise some. a light yellow-colored mist and white fog inside the flask is normal. continue to add, on and off, heat to maintain an easy bubbling reaction, at least around 15-20 minutes or until bubbling begins to slow. in the next phase, increase heat to the flask; slowly raise it up to between 160°-180° f. the reaction should begin to bubble very rapidly. the color of the reaction will change to a dark purple or reddish with a yellow tint. the small reaction bubbles will start turning into big bubbles that collapse into large holes. the reaction should be pushing gas into water tanks, but a lot harder this time. the contents will rise quickly, and may start to smoke. if so, remove from the heat and swirl the contents around in the flask to get the smoking to stop. swirling will also keep the •reactants from rising too high. let react until all ^seems to be dead inside the flask (no reaction) even with applied heat. a pull may be noted. if not, that is all right too. sometimes there is no pull with small reactions. tilt the flask. if reactants slowly flow off the bottom and sides and are not longer stuck, it should be finished. let cool to room temperature, and then add 100 ml of distilled water. next, in an open flask and on water bath, heat the mixture at 150° f for 30 minutes in order to free the contents. filter all the red phosphorous out of the mix. a couple of coffee filters also works well for filtering the red phosphorous out, the color should be clear to pale yellow. if one gets a dark orange or red color that does not filter out, the reaction might not be complete or the adulterants in the pills may have messed it up. if this is the case, try putting the red phosphorous back into the water from which it was filtered. heat it up to about 200° f for two hours to complete it. if this does not work, the crap in the pills may have messed the reaction up. now it is time to base and extract the meth base with a non-polar solvent such as toluene. wash the solvent/base layer with distilled water a few times, and dry with dehydrated epsom salts. gas the solvent/base layer to get crystals of methamphetamine.",1,

770261,"oh, i see all sorts of reasons for the unexplained run up...  - oil companies get to benefit from delayed gas price reductions  - ""uppity"" countries like russia, venezuela, china, sa, etc. get put in their place as their own local oil funded economic bubbles crash  - investment banks get to take their 'oil is going to $200/barrel forever' sucker clients for a ride, relieving them of their money in the process. (never, i repeat, never use an investment bank that refuses to disclose or lies about their opposing positions in a finical strategy they're trying to sell to you)  - huge profits gained during the run up are sequestered into oil development and china gets its international oil development deal making wings clipped.  - ...and yes, green, renewable energy project get put on hold along with mass transit and anything that's not part of the ice status quo.  if the gulf states had any fscking common sense, they'd do their own false flag operation against iran to shut down the straight and jack oil prices up to where they can afford to pay their masses of foreign workers before they decide to riot (again).",0,

262175,"well, it's quite simple you see. a rainy evening the current owner of these fine furnishings was sauntering down a quiet road, eager to return home after a mind-numbing day of repetitive office work. as they gazed across the unforgiving street, there was a huddled, dark figure amongst the wind-blown pieces of garbage and debris, looking very much like an injured animal. momentarily forgetting the cold and discomfort caused by icy water being splashed in one's face, the owner ran up to the figure, caution being bested by curiosity. surprisingly, there was a small, pathetic looking elderly lady huddled down in a dark coat, whimpering and clutching her pale, gnarled ankle with a look of contained agony on her face. concerned, this person offers their assistance at once, in a manner reminiscent of a boy scout. the lady looks up and beams in response to the kindness, and requests to be carried to the structure at the end of the block. moved by pity, our misguided seller complies, momentarily shocked at her weight, or lack thereof. making slow but steady progress against the merciless gusts of wind and buckets of water that were now gushing forth torrentially from the heavens. as they approach, a building in a state of mild disrepair becomes clearer, surrounding it is a foreboding cast-iron fence, sinister black points jutting out like claws. with some difficulty, the pair manage to negotiate themselves past the overgrown lawn and inside of the house. despite its homely appearance, the dwelling is finely furnished. luxurious shag rugs grace the floor, the kitchen gleams of modern, top-of-the-line appliances, and the living room displays an unmistakable taste in well-coordinated, expensive furniture. the old lady hobbles over to a plush couch, and smiles at her benefactor. in a quiet albeit authoritative voice, she offers a cup of tea. realizing how cold and dank he has grown, the owner gratefully accepts, and half-turns to the kitchen, expecting to be directed to a kettle. the lady merely indicates a handsome oak coffee table, two ivory mugs bearing a steaming brown liquid. hesitantly, the owner of these craigslist commodities seats himself in the chair opposite of the table, cushioned immediately by the the most comfortably firm yet squishy material he has ever felt. he grasps the mug with a confused expression, certain it was not there before, and not sure what to expect. at first they begin to engage in light small talk. an austere grandfather clock in the corner of the room dominates the scene, sternly keeping watch. time slips by abnormally fast. at one moment, pausing to adjust her saucer, the lady stares with an animal sort of longing at the seller's face and mentions, ""you look almost like my grandson,"" volume tapering off with each syllable. the seller is at a loss for words, and, not knowing what social protocol to follow, merely nods and sips more tea. they begin to speak of issues at great length, and the seller finds himself entranced. time passes by ever quicker, and before he can gauge how long he has spent, the grandfather clock chimes 11 o'clock, its brassy peals sending a chill up his spine. mumbling an awkward apology, he excuses himself and rushes home, but not before having contact information thrust upon him. he hurries through the thick clouds and heavy rain to his comparatively less magnificent apartment. removing his soaked jacket and shaking his wet hair, the seller allows his mind to wander. what an eccentric lady! she didn't seem quite right to him. but where did the tea come from? where did all the luxury items come from? she could have been an heiress, or a widow to a captain of industry, but if so, then why such a run-down building in such a mundane part of the city? he grunts and walks slowly over to his refrigerator, pinning the yellow piece of paper she insisted he take on it. inscribed in a tidy hand on it was: ""lydia miller 41 charity way 438-7009."" strange that such a seemingly independent and resource wealthy person would feel the need for a person like him to watch her. shaking his head a final time, the seller attempted to silence his internal thoughts and sleep. he had an early day tomorrow.       our seller found himself staring in varying states of disinterest out the window. once again, he found himself at his completely menial office job, assaulted by the monotonous cacophony of keystrokes and cubicle-dweller small talk. at least he had a cubicle by the window, his one solace. the seller reverted to his normal pastime of monitoring the people passing through the street 2 stories below. how they rambled on in futility like ants! bustling in a frenzy to their destinations, moving as if with a hive mind, always focusing on their next breadcrumb. so pacifying was this activity to the seller that he hardly noticed the lady head towards his building. about two seconds late, his brain registered with a jolt that she was coming in the lobby! the seller glanced towards the large, gray clock against the monochromatic office background. 12:15. it was just in time for his lunch break. with foreboding thoughts dancing around in his head, the seller proceeded to the lobby with a dreamlike sense of knowing what would happen next. after what seemed to be an eternity's elevator ride, he emerged in the marble lobby, and scanned the area. within moments, his eyes caught that of the lady, whose face lit up. she sat up straighter and waved him over, beaming. with mild reservation, the seller walked a straight line to her.      ""good afternoon mrs. miller,"" he heard himself say. it was odd that she would show up here at this time, with no prior announcement.     ""good afternoon to you too!"" she responded, white hair gleaming ethereally in the sun that had poked through the clouds in previous days. ""now that i'm all fixed up, i've decided to come and take you to lunch,"" she continued, indicating a blue cast affixed to her ankle. the seller was taken aback, but, in keeping with his polite demeanor, nodded and smiled.      in a matter of minutes, he found himself opposite mrs. miller in a previously unnoticed cafe, decorated in a manner very similar to her house. he was biting into a cream cheese and cucumber sandwich when it suddenly hit him how surreal she looked. mauve cardigan far to clean and fluffy to belong anywhere but an advertisement, pants so white they reflected the sun, wrinkles so defined he would've thought them magnified. her brow furrowed under his examination. realizing his stare, the seller resumed to eating his lunch, hastily completing it in as little time as possible. suddenly, another thought hit him. how did she know where he worked? he didn't even leave her his surname. why were people staring at him as he spoke with her  walking down the street? again, he excused himself at the first opportunity, somewhat awkwardly, and half-jogged back to work.      ""where were you?"" demanded his boss as he entered the doors with mild perspiration adorning his brow. but why the suspicion? the clock would vindicate him, he couldn't have been more than thirty minutes... 2:45! how could it have been two and a half hours since he left for lunch?     ""oh, i'm sorry, i was out at that cafe... cafe del sol, i think it was? you know, the one on the corner two blocks from here...? i guess i lost track of time,"" his excuse sounded weak even to his own ears. the seller felt color rise in his cheeks and walked off slinkily under the withering gaze of his supervisor. behind him, a coworker exchanged glances with their boss.      ""i worry about him,"" the coworker mentioned, ""he was talking to himself for a good ten minutes down the street before entering a condemned building. you might want to keep an eye on him.""",0,
651703,"yeah, lolita's everywhere really. there are always posts on the online lolita community i'm a part of of europe meet ups. germany seems to have a big gothic lolita crowd, while places like paris and london lean a lot more towards sweet. although, paris has a baby the stars shine bright shop there, which is predominately sweet in nature, so i guess that could account for the sweetness? it's just something i noticed from meet up pictures.   and i baulked at cosplay because it's often something lolita is mistaken for, mainly due to girls at cons ""lolifying"" anime characters, with shiny shiny satin, bad lace, maid aprons and animal ears &gt;_&lt; the maid thing is also annoying. yes, i'm wearing a dress that's black and white, i'm dressing like a maid you say? no, do you see a god damn apron?! this also leads to people thinking it's fetish wear, although, that's also a lot to do with it's name...  sorry, i'm ranting aren't i?",0,
614481,"there is a book which changed the way i view the world entirely.  it was a psychology textbook called ""ego and archetype"", and it looked at religious beliefs and mythology together as if it was the same thing, and analyzed it for psychological metaphors and symbolic meaning.  turns out that the bible (you know, that book that we love to mock in here as being totally ridiculous and impossible to take seriously if you have half a brain) well, turns out that it is full of very rich meaning and very significant concepts!  you just have to look at it as a giant metaphor, and at the symbolic content.  this textbook interprets bible stories and greek myths and dreams as reported by various counselling clients, side by side, and gets almost identical meaning from each of them, ranks all of those stories as being equally significant and as coming from the same place.    my favorite is the story of adam and eve (you know, that crazy outdated story which spawned such monstrousities as creationist museums and legislation banning evolution in schools, and which paved the way for our beloved spaghetti monster to take shape?).  turns out that the story of adam and eve is this incredibly rich symbolic story that parallels the process of human development.  in the beginning, adam and eve live in this paradise where all their needs are met, where they are one with an all-powerful god, where there is no work or suffering or death, and where they are totally innocent to good vs evil.  it is by partaking in knowledge (bite of an apple from the tree of knowledge) that they get themselves banished to a harsher reality where they become aware and self conscious of their nakedness, and where they must work and suffer and die.    that's like infants, who experience the world as completely centered around them and their needs, who don't know that suffering and death and work even exists, because they are merged so completely with an all-powerful caregiver who seems to exist only to meet their needs.  and as they get older and their blissful ignorance collides with knowledge of the world, this knowledge boots them out of their state of blissful pampering and forces them to struggle and work and suffer for their needs to be met.    there's even more rich layers and details to the metaphor than that, all very well explained in the book, along with many other bible stories and myths.  it helps you realize that myth, metaphor, dreaming symbolism, and religion too, all meet a very real psychic need which becomes neglected in our modern world where we tend to either take religion too literally, or reject all symbolic experience altogether when we find ourselves betrayed by religion.  the book spends time explaining the danger of trying to believe literally in myths which were meant as symbols, but also the danger of rejecting such symbolism altogether.  so yeah, there is a need to exist on a symbolic, metaphorical level, and to have that aspect to your own personal spiritual growth, and as atheists we need to find a way to meet that need without resorting to childish superstitions or improper religious literalism.    edit: oh, this is the suicide reddit, not the atheism reddit - i'm still gonna leave my post as-is, though",0,

841759,"i swam the amazon   by sharon van geuns 23/08/2009  that's 3,274 miles, swimming 10 hours a day for 66 days.. on two bottles of wine a day *or 196,440 lengths of your average pool  he's middle-aged, his ample belly bulges over his speedos... and he thinks drinking two bottles of wine a day keeps him in shape.  swimmer martin strel would be the first to admit he makes the unlikeliest of athletes.  but the 55-year-old harddrinking slovenian just happens to be the greatest endurance swimmer in the world... ever.  he claimed the title by conquering the world's most dangerous river - the amazon - swimming 3,274 miles in 66 days, non-stop.  ""it helps to be a little crazy, to do what i do,"" martin admits. ""i told myself that i would swim the amazon or i would die trying.  ""i'm a big man, sure, but the amazon is so much bigger.""  the astonishing story of courage and determination is the subject of a new movie, big river man, which opens across the uk next month.  the enthralling film sees martin brave the constant threat of piranhas, crocodiles and the horrifying candiru fish.  he also had to battle through tropical storms and blistering heat, as well as facing murderous bandits and machetewielding native tribes.  add unrelenting diarrhoea to that catalogue of horrors and you get an idea of the type of man martin is, tackling each obstacle with sheer bloody-mindedness... and a healthy dose of alcohol.  but even as he tells how his doctor warned him to give up drinking to lessen the risk of heart attack, martin simply cracks open another bottle of red, washing it down with a whisky and some beer.  ""i told the doctor i have to drink, i have to swim - i am martin!"" says the part-time guitar teacher.  as a child, he used to leap into the icy river near his home to escape beatings by his father, but he didn't begin serious endurance swimming until 1992.  his first challenge saw him conquer the 65-mile krka river in his homeland in 28 hours.  he then swam the english channel and became the first man to swim across the mediterranean. seven men had already died in the attempt, either drowned or eaten by sharks. he then took on the danube, before swimming the mississippi, the argentine parana and the yangtze in china, an experience which left his liver black. he also swam london's river thames last year, although its risks were somewhat less than the yangtze.  martin says: ""the thames was a little easier to swim than other rivers. i thought it was a very nice, clean river. but it was very cold.""  after such previous conquests, the amazon must have seemed like a natural progression.  martin trained more than five hours a day in his local swimming pool and finally began history's longest swim in april 2007. his daily target was to swim for 10 hours every day, covering around 90km. but the adventure soon became a struggle for survival.  as well as dehydration and exhaustion, water-borne parasites left his body racked with infection and disease, including dengue fever, which triggers painful cramps.  tarantulas, giant millipedes and scorpions would drop off the trees into the river, often getting entangled in his hair. birds would fly down and attempt to peck at his face. larvae burrowed into his skin and his face was stung by wasps. some days he even had to wear a pillowcase over his head, with slits for the eyes and mouth to protect his face from the heat.  however the hazards above the water were nothing compared to the horrors below. the biggest danger was the bull shark, responsible for the deaths of more humans than any other type of shark in the area.  then there are stingrays and anacondas lurking in the shallows, crocodiles and alligators that can seize human-size prey and gobble it whole. long, poisonous snakes slither out of nowhere and giant catfish up to 15ft long, known to swallow dogs and children, hide in the mud.  once he had to be hauled from the water screaming in pain, as shoals of piranha fish gnawed at his leg.  he swam in the faster-flowing middle of the channel, in places 100ft deep, in the worst amazon floods for a century, but sometime he couldn't avoid the stiller water.  in an attempt to stop the razorjawed piranha fish from smelling him, martin would lather his body with gasoline and cream and buckets of pigs' blood would be thrown into the water to divert their attention.  but of all the dangers, the one martin feared most was the tiny candiru, otherwise known as the vampire fish, a parasite with a vicious tactic. it is attracted by the scent of urine and enters the body by swimming up the penis. once inside it locks itself on with a series of spikes and feeds off blood and tissue. surgery is the only way to remove it. and if martin was attacked the nearest emergency ward was hundreds of miles away.  to reduce the risk, martin never exposed himself to urinate and always did it inside his wetsuit. ""i never looked down,"" he said.  advertisement - article continues below »   the only friendly creatures he met were the porpoises and dolphins who often kept him company, swimming alongside.  his escort boat, skippered by his son and manager borut, 28, had a team of armed guards to protect him from river pirates and carried his stockpile of medicine and food...and alcohol. ""drinking wine is part of my life,"" martin says. ""it's my special blend, that i make myself, so it's very healthy and it gives me energy, without making me drunk. i would drink whisky as well, to wash my mouth out before i eat food.  ""but sometimes i drank a little just to lift the day, because to swim a river like the amazon is very hard. you never know what is below the water - and a drink helped me relax. you need a little dutch courage!""  the toll on his body was immense - he weighed 114kg (250lb) when he started and lost nearly 20kg (44lb) during the swim, despite being on an 11,000 caloriesa-day diet to keep up his strength.  towards the end, he admitted that it felt like ""a bomb was about to explode"" in his head. he took months to recover. since his swim, which he undertook to highlight increasing levels of pollution in the world and the threat to the rainforests, martin has become a huge star back home in slovenia.  nowadays, women flock around him, calling him a hero and begging to be his wife.  ""yes, i get hit on a lot and sure, i do like pretty ladies,"" martin says. ""but i'm already married. i have to keep my head clear - just as i did when i took on that river.  ""i am just a regular man who just has higher goals than usual, not a superman.""  so what's next for the incredible human fish? ""who knows?"" shrugs martin. ""maybe i'll swim right around the world!""  big river man is in cinemas from september 4. for more information go to www.amazonswim.com  some of the horrors under the water...  bull shark  needs no introduction, this is more of a maneater than even the legendary great white  anaconda  less of a snake, more of a scaly submarine, this beast is best avoided at all costs  piranha  shoals are famed for being able to strip a cow to the bone in under a minute  candiru  known as the vampire fish, its methods are enough to make men scream like little girls  amazon facts  the river is 3274 miles long. only the river nile in egypt, at 4,132 miles, is longer.  it pumps 300,000 cubic metres of water a second into the atlantic.  it accounts for a fifth of the world's fresh water.  it is home to a third of all the species of animals in the world.  there is no bridge across it.  at its mouth in brazil, it is 210 miles wide, which is wider than the length of the thames.  the source of the amazon is a stream in the peruvian andes.",0,

558945,"i have an article on it here from the belfast telegraph that's no longer online:  by hermione eyre 01 august 2006  ‘i’ve got a quiet voice,” says daniel tammet, in his gentle monotone. “i think it’s because as a child i did-n’t speak very much. i used to put my fingers in my ears to feel the silence, which was like a lovely trickling motion in my head.” his eyelids flutter at the memory. “it was hard for me to find my voice because i was, for so long, absorbed in my own world.”  daniel’s world is a rich and strange one, where every number up to 10,000 has colour, texture and emotional resonance. “the number one is a brilliant and bright white, like somebody shining a torch beam into my eyes… four is shy and quiet, like me. eighty-nine is like falling snow…” more remarkable still, he has described it all in born on a blue day, his memoir of his life with synaesthesia and savant syndrome, a rare form of asperger’s. dr darold treffert, a leading researcher in autism, says: “such first-person explanations of savant abilities are extremely rare, in fact nearly non-existent.”  daniel’s condition brings him great riches: his visualisation of numbers means he can perform extraordinary mathematical feats, and he holds the british and european record for reciting pi from memory to 22,514 decimal places. it also has its limitations. forming relationships was difficult (“until i was eight or nine, i didn’t realise that other children were people with thoughts and feelings”); supermarkets still are (too brightly coloured, too confusing).  when i meet him in the quiet london offices of his publisher, there are only a few signs of how different he is, a slight creakiness in his gait, a subtle overintensity in his gaze. “i had to teach myself to look in some-body’s eyes, to make eye contact,” he explains. “before that, i used to look at their mouth, because it was the part of their face that was moving,” he says, as if it were the easiest mistake to make in the world. which, in a way, it is, or certainly the most logical.  there’s also a stiffness, a vulnerability in his bearing. i watch as he stands before the independent on sunday’s photographer, as rigid as if he were in front of a firing squad. sunlight flashes on his face and he begins to squint; immediately, his boyfriend, a mild-mannered computer programmer called neil, bounds towards him solicitously. “are you ok?”  later, i ask daniel if the pho-toshoot was such an ordeal that he used numbers to help him through. “yes. while we were outside i noticed a spiral staircase in one of the buildings which was nice as it reminded me of doing a fraction in my head.”  mental arithmetic is a gorgeous kaleidoscopic process for daniel. “squaring numbers is a symmetrical process that i like very much,” he says. “and when i divide one number by another, say, 13 divided by 97, i see a spiral rotating downwards in larger and larger loops that seem to warp and curve. the shapes coalesce into the right number. i never write anything down.”  his mathematical abilities are so extraordinary that it took a long time for them to be recog-nised. daniel struggled at school (why, he wondered, were the numbers in the textbook not printed in their true colours, nine in blue, and so on?). he got a b at maths gcse. he wasn’t diagnosed with asperger’s syndrome until three years ago, at 25.  sooner would have been better “both for me and my parents”; consciousness-raising is part of his motivation for writing his book. “my condition is invisible otherwise.”  scientists at california’s center for brain studies were astounded when, two years ago, they discovered his facility for discerning prime numbers. they had assumed he must have been trained to do it. but to him, it is more like an instinctive process: “prime numbers feel smooth, like pebbles.” the centre stays in close contact with daniel.  “the scientists and researchers come to me so i can help them design the parameters of their experiments,” he says in his habitual monotone, neither proud nor modest. it is important to daniel that he uses his gifts responsibly, perhaps for science, perhaps for teaching: he is already devising a new system of visualisation to help with language learning and dyslexia.  “when i was growing up, my parents were very concerned that people shouldn’t just get me to do tricks for them,” he says. (he is a whizz at crowd-pleasers such as working out, from your date of birth, which day of the week you were born on.) “my parents had this phrase ‘performing seal’. they didn’t want me to be one.”  growing up as an undiagnosed savant was never easy. daniel was lonely. “i was desperate for a friend and i used to lie in bed at night thinking about what it would be like. my younger brothers and sisters had friends and i used to watch them playing to try to work out what they did and how friendship worked. then, i would have traded everything for normality. but i’ve since learned that being different isn’t necessarily a bad thing.”  falling in love with neil has been a large part of this. emotions used to be difficult for him to understand without recourse to numbers. “if i heard somebody was sad i would picture myself sitting in the dark hollowness of number six to help me understand the feeling.” now his emotional life is more like everyone else’s. “love by its very nature puts things in perspective, joins the dots and helps me see life in a bigger way.” neil and daniel, who have been together for six years, share an odd kind of domestic bliss. they have their tea together at exactly the same time every day; they have exactly 45g of porridge for breakfast, weighed on an electronic scale. “neil is very patient with me, and the routines i need to have to help with my anxieties,” says daniel. “i don’t know what i’d do without him.”  generally, daniel feels he is progressing all the time towards “outgrowing” his autism. he cried for the first time in his adult life a few years ago, when his cat died. “my face was wet, and i knew that i was crying.” latterly, he has acquired a strong religious faith, which grew from an intellectual appreciation of the writings of g k chesterton. and he is getting steadily better at social interaction. “every experience i have i add to my mental library and hopefully life should then get easier.” in this, he seems to sum up the progress we all hope for.  but some experiences remain unique to him. “i don’t normally like films about emotions because i can’t understand them. i enjoyed march of the penguins, though. but when i watched the trailers first, i found that because they show the most dramatic moments one after another in quick succession, it made me feel so overwhelmed i burst into tears. no one else was affected, of course, and i felt silly. next time i’ll know to maybe not watch the trailers.” a life in numbers  ‘pi is for me a beautiful thing’  daniel tammet can speak 10 languages, including lithuanian and welsh, as well as his own invented language, “mänti”, which has about 1,000 words.  as part of a documentary that was made about him, called ‘brainman’, tammet learned icelandic in a week, in front of the cameras. the culmination of the challenge was a live interview on icelandic tv, which he coped with brilliantly.  he can recognise every prime number up to 9,973.  in 2003, he gave a public recital of pi in oxford, in aid of the national society for epilepsy. tammet recited it for five hours nine minutes, reaching 22,514 decimal places. “pi is for me an extremely beautiful thing,” he says, “like the ‘mona lisa’ or a mozart symphony.”  on the late show with david letterman, he calculated instantly that since letterman’s birth date was 12 april 1947, he must have been born on a saturday and would reach 65 on a thursday.  ‘born on a blue day’ by daniel tammet is published by hodder &amp; stoughton (£16.99)",0,

to me it just goes back to the question of what is art, particularly with the anna nicole smith opera in the works.  incidentally there’s a great picture of greer as jtb from santa fe, photographed by ken howard in 2006.     a reviewer says jokanaan, john the baptist, would probably look like hell after his imprisonment and a biblical diet of crickets so why is greer performing bare chested. i say the audience sees jtb through salome’s eyes as desirable. his clothes would have been in tatters as any mortal’s spirit would have been. so has santa fe reviewer charles downey seen the sexy dvd from covent garden? it’s salome played by maria ewing and michael devlin as john the baptist? michael wears nothing but his white hide, a wild mane of black hair and a loin cloth. yet downey praises greer’s apocalyptic performance. commanding even from the cistern, resonant, the high point of the production.  although downey notes:  i know that salome sings a lot about jokanaan's white body, but i don't think it requires him to be costumed bare-chested, as grimsley was here. in fact, to be true to the story in the gospels, jokanaan would probably look pretty much like hell warmed over, after living on grasshoppers in the wilderness and then rotting in herod's prison.  so i ask you, charles downey, why ask why.  as for anna nicole, greer got back to me with his and his wife luretta bybee's vote on who to play anna. he agreed with me, mam. maryann mccormick. it turns out mam performed in venice with greer in die walkure. she emailed me on tuesday.  someone told me today that there is an article in the paper (maybe the new york times) about this commission. elaine padmore is spearheading it.    mam also says about greer and luretta:  they are so great. greer is such a terrific singer and colleague. we sang in venice together in die walkeure. he is easily the best wagnerian baritone around today!  i also had coffee and lunch with opera photographer john martin this week, who asks, what makes anna nicole’s story an opera. he and i went to the grove on fillmore on a rainy tuesday morning. she died, i said. and he seemed to agree and elaborated or one-upped me. first your son, then you. well, i felt bad with my cough and cold but not that bad.  needing sustenance after my earl grey with honey and his cappucino, he and i moved on to la boulange across fillmore.  it offers french onion soup each day. they offered a comforting bowl of french lentil too. john and i got onto the subject of his book on opera singers and i mentioned the controversial nature of the costume for john the baptist in salome. john martin will be photographing cast members backstage this season instead of supering for the first time in many years. he said perhaps i could help out. he wants to get those photographed to tell stories to go with the photographs.  he also mentioned he used to photograph architectural details in pacific heights, a few blocks away. i’ve been walking a couple of french bulldogs there all week and admired a brick structure with columns at the front door, the entire façade covered in glorious vines that must have taken a hundred years to grow. it’s old money along broadway and pacific he said, the gettys.   i put the red polo shirts on bev and bistro and went promenading with a view of the bay from the golden gate to alcatraz.  down the five flights of stairs . . . the elevator has been out all week and somebody even got stuck in it.  i'm knackered . . . but i've been writing my column with a view of the victorians and their rooftops and a catholic cathedral and a sandstone colored synagogue with it's slate black dome . . . rain or shine . . . photo by travis rew.  john says the vines i mentioned on that pacific heights mansion are actually bad for the brick, they keep in moisture. nevertheless he says the houses were immaculate, not a speck of dust, and usually just one couple living in them.  the stories they must have to tell with their view of the bay.  in closing, john sent a photo.  here's natale dessay, the french coloratura soprano and one of siggy's favorites, photographed by john martin last summer.  what does she see over her shoulder?  do you remember her after lucia di lammermoor at at&amp;t last june on that warm summer night, tossing her baseball cap to the audience?  other members of the cast came out waving foam fingers?  go giants, we're number one! meanwhile morgan jones is looking forward to the academy of friends celebration of the oscars on sunday.   she volunteers with the sfopera, sfsymphony, and the sfballet.  she and her son myles super at the opera. morgan emails i have had artist receptions to prepare brownies for, and am getting my brownie truffles into stores, and coffee houses.  i am currently preparing for the academy of friends gala on sunday, feb. 22nd, 1200+ ""serendipity! brownie truffles"".  then i have to begin preparing for the sf international chocolate salon, march 21st.  weighty issues on hold.  i imagine it will be a special year at the academy of friends, which is an aids and hiv fundraiser.  specifically with milk and marin's sean penn up for awards.  this year it's billed as a night of superheroes, villains and divas.            greer grimsley impressions, passions, stand by me, dreams  siggy team player part i and part ii  anna nicole smith opera  tosca featured in film milk tosca and how opera's embattled stay in fighting shape  fred matthews sang porgy &amp; bess 756 times  fred matthews produces cavalcade of stars iii february 2009  sfo unveils salome for 2009  sfo's summer of love 2009  opera announces 2009/2010 season  new orleans music producers     contact the writer at sfoperaexaminer@yahoo.com.  mam headshot courtesy of mam  photos of morgan jones and truffles courtesy of morgan jones  for more info:  www.sfopera.com",0,

721773,"you need to stop reading fiction or propaganda.  so here it is what really happened (part 1)...  on november 30, the day after the un partition vote, the jewish agency announced: “the main theme behind the spontaneous celebrations we are witnessing today is our community's desire to seek peace and its determination to achieve fruitful cooperation with the arabs....“  throughout the period that preceded the may 15 invasion of the arab regular armies, large-scale military engagements, incessant sniping, robberies and bombings took place. in view of the thousands of casualties that resulted from the pre-invasion violence, it is not surprising that many arabs would have fled out of fear for their lives.   the second phase of the arab flight began after the jewish forces started to register military victories against arab irregulars. among the victories were the battles for tiberias and haifa, which were accompanied by the evacuation of the arab inhabitants. on january 30, 1948, the jaffa newspaper, ash sha'ab, reported: “the first of our fifth column consists of those who abandon their houses and businesses and go to live elsewhere....at the first signs of trouble they take to their heels to escape sharing the burden of struggle.” another jaffa paper, as sarih (march 30, 1948) excoriated arab villagers near tel aviv for “bringing down disgrace on us all by 'abandoning the villages.“  john bagot glubb, the commander of jordan's arab legion, said: “villages were frequently abandoned even before they were threatened by the progress of war” (london daily mail, august 12, 1948). jewish forces seized tiberias on april 19, 1948, and the entire arab population of 6,000 was evacuated under british military supervision. the jewish community council issued a statement afterward: “we did not dispossess them; they themselves chose this course....let no citizen touch their property.”  in early april, an estimated 25,000 arabs left the haifa area following an offensive by the irregular forces led by fawzi al qawukji, and rumors that arab air forces would soon bomb the jewish areas around mt. carmel. on april 23, the haganah captured haifa. a british police report from haifa, dated april 26, explained that “every effort is being made by the jews to persuade the arab populace to stay and carry on with their normal lives, to get their shops and businesses open and to be assured that their lives and interests will be safe.” in fact, david ben-gurion had sent golda meir to haifa to try to persuade the arabs to stay, but she was unable to convince them because of their fear of being judged traitors to the arab cause. by the end of the battle, more than 50,000 palestinians had left.  tens of thousands of arab men, women and children fled toward the eastern outskirts of the city in cars, trucks, carts, and afoot in a desperate attempt to reach arab territory until the jews captured rushmiya bridge toward samaria and northern palestine and cut them off. thousands rushed every available craft, even rowboats, along the waterfront, to escape by sea toward acre (new york times, april 23, 1948).   in tiberias and haifa, the haganah issued orders that none of the arabs' possessions should be touched, and warned that anyone who violated the orders would be severely punished. despite these efforts, all but about 5,000 or 6,000 arabs evacuated haifa, many leaving with the assistance of british military transports.   syria's un delegate, faris el-khouri, interrupted the un debate on palestine to describe the seizure of haifa as a “massacre” and said this action was “further evidence that the 'zionist program' is to annihilate arabs within the jewish state if partition is effected.”   the following day, however, the british representative at the un, sir alexander cadogan, told the delegates that the fighting in haifa had been provoked by the continuous attacks by arabs against jews a few days before and that reports of massacres and deportations were erroneous. the same day (april 23, 1948), jamal husseini, the chairman of the palestine higher committee, told the un security council that instead of accepting the haganah's truce offer, the arabs “preferred to abandon their homes, their belongings, and everything they possessed in the world and leave the town.”   once the arab regular armies from syria, egypt, lebanon and transjordan invasion began in may 1948, most arabs remaining in palestine left for neighboring countries. surprisingly, rather than acting as a strategically valuable “fifth column” in the war, the palestinians chose to flee to the safety of the other arab states, still confident of being able to return. a leading palestinian nationalist of the time, musa alami, revealed the attitude of the fleeing arabs:  the arabs of palestine left their homes, were scattered, and lost everything. but there remained one solid hope: the arab armies were on the eve of their entry into palestine to save the country and return things to their normal course, punish the aggressor, and throw oppressive zionism with its dreams and dangers into the sea. on may 14, 1948, crowds of arabs stood by the roads leading to the frontiers of palestine, enthusiastically welcoming the advancing armies. days and weeks passed, sufficient to accomplish the sacred mission, but the arab armies did not save the country. they did nothing but let slip from their hands acre, sarafand, lydda, ramleh, nazareth, most of the south and the rest of the north. then hope fled (middle east journal, october 1949).  as the fighting spread into areas that had previously remained quiet, the arabs began to see the possibility of defeat. as the possibility turned into reality, the flight of the arabs increased-more than 300,000 departed after may 15 — leaving approximately 160,000 arabs in the state of israel.  so it was not ethnic cleansing which is the favorite palestinian narrative.",0,
380559,"&gt;you never say in your response why the answer was ""no"" or why you think it's no. you just presume that the absence of evidence equals evidence of absence.  i purposefully avoided saying that there is no god, instead saying there is no evidence for god. the same goes for an absolute morality. we could go through the russel's teapot argument if we must, but i feel that would be a waste of time at this point.  &gt;as a christian, i can say yes, what stalin did was absolutely wrong.  as a human being, i can make the decision that i think murder is wrong. i am not bound by anything else but my own mind in reaching that decision. i may be influenced by the ideas of others, which is what it is to be human. an interesting point is that i also think that everyone else should have the same system as me. i don't see this as realistic. but the system of morals that i have constructed is, obviously, what i think is best. i suppose you could call that an 'absolute' morality. i'm not one of these people who thinks that genital mutilation is ok, because its 'part of their culture', or bullshit like that. i judge everyone's actions by my own ideas.  &gt;i've often heard from atheists that christians don't follow every command in the bible, that we ""pick and choose."" i don't happen to agree with that thought, but please, because i really am curious, what is it that we are picking and choosing? (now - obviously i can't defend everyone who claims the name of christ here, ie paedophile priests and whatnot, but perhaps i can clear up the confusions?)  you ever eaten shellfish, or shaved? failed to execute your neighbour for doing any number of prohibited things on a sunday? (or is that a saturday?) the bible has a load of crazy stuff like that, which no sane person believes. the lines about homosexuality which mr phelps so adores are in there. many christians ignore them. many take them to heart. and then there are those, such as the prohibition of murder, which everyone agrees on.  even if you think that everything written should be followed, how do you choose which version? the king james? good news? the catholic version? or how do you even choose the bible as your basis? what makes you decide that it is the bible, and not the torah or koran? each of those two has as much a claim to the truth as the bible.  the fact is, you have made a choice, consciously or not, to follow a particular version, to omit certain bits. that (possibly unconscious) decision will have been influenced very strongly by your parents, and probably by the church you attended. the odds are that the end result is not terribly different from mine - essentialy ""be nice""!  &gt;also, there is this inclination to include ""jehovah"" in lists of genocidal maniacs, because look! in the bible god has people killed. [...]  i said earlier that i judge everyone by my morality. that includes the actions of characters in films and books. it is worth bearing in mind that everything i have said rests upon the central idea that there is no reason to think that god exists.  the analogy with the lego-men is a false one. i have no reason to think that they are conscious, or have thoughts. if i had reason to believe that they did on the same level as a human, i would not harm them. there is the question of at which point we should deem something to be conscious, and worthy of protection. i think that this will probably become a real concern during my lifetime, as progress is made towards a computer ai. i am undecided on the issue at this point.  &gt;the bible describes god as the righteous judge of the universe. therefore, bringing people to meet their maker and judge is not murder, it is not genocide, as god as creator of the universe cannot commit murder. it's a matter of his authority over life as creator of it all.  this is a very interesting line of argument, which requires quite careful thought. i happen to feel that it is quite logical, if the assumption is first made that the bible is true in all respects. it is very similar to the thinking of the inquisition. they believed that they were saving people from eternal torture. how can murder be a sin if you are ensuring that they go to heaven? however, there is one flaw - the assumption that the bible is true, that there is a god, and there is a heaven.  i would hope that you agree that a perfect morality would be the same regardless of whether the bible is true or not. i happen to believe that my morality, imperfect as it may be (it can change), is superior to that of absolute morality of the bible. if it should come to pass that the bible is true in every respect, and i am before the pearly gates, then i should be proud (and fearful - for he is a vengeful god) to say so.",0,

455271,"i grew up in a quite liberal household. throughout my high school years, all my friends were lefties - artsy, creative types. my racism certainly comes not from my upbringing, but from own personal experience.  i have grown bitter and resentful of (southern) african blacks. the majority of them are incredibly unintelligent, backwards, barbaric and lazy. look at the crime statistics in south africa for instance - the levels of violent crime, the levels of **violence**, are absolutely mind boggling. the south african anc government is one of the most inept, incompetent and corrupt organisations the world has yet seen. it's fast turning into a (stereo) typical african banana republic, but the shame of it is that sa was once a glittering diamond in the rough. south africa has the seconds oldest air force in the world, the first international commercial airline flights took place between london and johannesburg, the first heart transplant, the deepest gold mines, etc., are all examples of how great that country once was. there are **many** such examples. the whites in that country rock - the (mostly white) rugby team is #1 in the world, the (mostly white) cricket team is (sometimes) #1 in the world...the (all black) soccer team is one of the world's worst. for many years, sa was #1 in the (world wide) math &amp; science school competition thingy, but as of about 5 years ago, sa no longer participates. ever since the new government insisted that (almost exclusively) black students participate, sa's ranking has plummeted and they came stone last the last two or three times. after that, sa pulled out of the event.   now, as an adult, the reasoning behind apartheid makes sense to me. the white government of those days recognised those dumb, brutal creatures for what they are, and institutionalised a policy to keep them apart from the segment of the population who was hard at work building sa into the most civilised and wealthy country on that continent. and, you know what, for a while it worked. sa was once great. the local currency was, during the early-80s, twice as strong as the us dollar. sa had built up an infrastructure to rival (even exceed) those of well-established american and european countries.  15 years after the end of apartheid and since the blacks had ""taken over"", and it's deteriorating at a staggering pace. it's absolutely heart-breaking for those who were privileged enough to have experienced sa in its heyday. the greatest shame of course is that, for the average black person living in sa, nothing really changed. the biggest difference is that the anc government had made sure that they and their most loyal cronies get to spend taxpayers' (white people's) money on bling. for those ""strugglers against the old regime"" life had certainly improved - they are now dining at the most expensive restaurants, driving the most luxurious imported cars, living in 2 or 3 storey houses (in formerly ""white"" neighbourhoods), sending their kids to private schools...but for the average black-guy-on-the-street, he's *still* living in a shack, and *still* has no electricity or clean running water. it's not because the whites have not done anything to help change the situation, it's simply because the black government, their friends and families, are wasting literally billions on bling.  the thing that irks me the most is that the average black idiot doesn't care. as long as their government consists of blacks, they'll keep on voting those fucks into power, and the cycle just repeats.  speaking of not caring...you know those horrific crime stats sa is so famous for? well, 2010 is bound to be a good year. the black fucks who ru(i)n that country are, for the first time since coming to power, actually going to address it. the foreign money that comes to the country during the soccer world cup is of great importance to them, so they are actually going to press the pause button on crime during the course of that event. for the first time since the fall of apartheid there will be a marked decrease in crime, because this time, they *do* care. after that, after all the white foreigners have left, the 50+ murders a day, the 80+ rapes a day, the eating of their own children, the house-breakings accompanied by rape and torture, will again continue...and the black government will again continue with their stance of ""if you don't like it, whitey, then leave"".  i'm sorry. i don't like (southern african) blacks at all. not in the least.",1,
154081,"* mean mug mo’ thug…*          he was feeling down and dirty, feeling kind of mean.  the hermaphrodite he was fucking had a ball-gag deep in her mouth and it was securely fastened. the man turned to the girl’s mom, smacked her two quick ones in the cake-hole. he shot his expulsion in her face and hair.  she exhaled the plata smoke as she brought her mouth to the dude’s lumpy cock and proceeded to clean it all off by using her teeth and tongue. 	the man leaned back and watched her do this while he flipped up his feet and placed them on the hermie’s back.  he closed his eyes as she exhaled her relief.  she began to cry pitifully.  the mom thought briefly about removing the ball-gag from her child’s mouth, but instead she lit up another pipe of the plata. 	the man, himself, opted for a regular smoke.  he lit a custom made cigarette he kept in a rather ornate case nearby.  he inhaled the delicious turkish blend, held it a moment and then blew out the plume.  he pulled his feet from the hermie’s back.  he opened a small chest on the lamp table, removed a two gram bag and tossed it in the mom’s direction.  the mother grabbed the dope, stuck it up her twat for safe-keeping.  then she helped her kid get out of the gag and onto her feet.  she made to wipe the male from her face and hair. 	“do that shit on your own time,” he told her.  “now get the fuck out.” 	once they left, job’s earthly father brought out his tray of his personal upstairs coke.  the lightly blue-tinged peruvian flake was set on his lap.  he started chopping and lining up the coke, smiling. he leaned down and pulled up a finger-thick chalk line when the temperature became frigid in his living room in an instant.  ice formed in the air, contrasting the warm, cozy heated room and snowflakes inexplicably formed and began to swirl all around. his heart began to thunder, the feeling familiar, but hard to sink his teeth into, it was from so long ago. 	mister mo’ thug appeared in front of him.  job’s father’s hair turned white from fright in an instant.  he dropped the coke straw.  he watched with mortal dread as he beheld the eight foot tall mean mug. his impossible weight cracked the floor beneath him. 	“my lord – “ he put up a stifling hand. “i need not your voice.”  job’s father paled further as he sat dumfounded.  “place your hand within mine,” he said.  his servant did and he began with the pinky finger.  mister mo’ thug slowly and methodically bent all the fingers up one at a time. each one broke with a gruesome wet snap.   job’s father dropped to his knees.  beads of sweat sprang up from all over his body.  he cried out and mean mug hit him in his face, breaking a cheek bone and causing the man’s face to swell and misshapen. 	“not a word.” job’s father bit through his own lip, trying his failing best to keep quiet, to not further infuriate.  “the cur you sold me has let me down.  he stopped and looked down to the blubbering human. “i cannot exact my vengeance upon him, so it will now fall to you.”  mister mo’ thug curled his hand into a fist.  he crushed job’s father’s hand and twisted fingers into almost dust.  “and there will be things done to you,” he said, “that ye shan’t imagine.” mister mo’ thug has always been an asshole. most everyone agrees. mother certainly does. the man’s face was leaking blood unimpeded from his nose and his cry was stifled quickly by his remaining fist.  he shoved it down the human’s throat.  mean mug then went from the flat, pulpy ruined hand next to the man’s wrist and on up to the forearm, crushing them both, before just tearing the fucker off at the root and dropping it beside the human’s quivering, dying body.  job’s father looked down to the floor at his missing arm like it was something he should know, but couldn’t quite place. 	with mister mo’ thug’s fist down the man’s throat, his eyes threatened to bulge right out of their sockets. he reached all the way inside job’s father and pulled the human inside out. he flat out hated fucking losing. job’s father was still breathing and conscious while mister mo’ thug’s imps climbed on him.  one imp fell wildly in love with the human’s severed arm, it being still warm, and consummating this with a love act, rubbing hard on the bone with his own.  the others perched on job’s father, jacking off into and feeding on the wet inners.  they climbed up his pooper and plucked at his exposed heart and lungs, tearing and ripping.                                                                                                   * mean mug mo’ thug…*",0,

879357,"a hypothetical universe has many qualities; there are universes where i am white, and where i am black, where i am tall, and where i am short, i can imagine all of these things, just as i can imagine universes where god is tall or god is short, where god looks like a human, or looks like an elephant. a description of god and demonstrating the existence of a specific god is very different than demonstrating the existence of a god.  not only can i tell you firmly that god exists, because humans exist, and humans define the nature of the words they used, and we, or i more specifically have allowed the definition of god to include the abstract that which we cannot know but is more powerful than i and has some role in my creation, but also, i can show you that mathematically it is probabalistically much more likely for there to be some form of god than no god what-so-ever.  if you misunderstood my argument than fine, but i am not arguing that any one of your infinity of improbable things is true, all i am arguing is that taken as a whole, the likelihood of all of those improbable things, is greater than that of one other similarly improbable thing (no god). you give false value to your one improbable possible universe; all else being equal, and knowing nothing factual about the question of the existence of god, you give yourself a 50% chance of being true; a very narrow minded thing to do. i am merely pointing out an error in your domain — the question is not god or no god, the question is what is the nature, and the range of answers to this are infinite.  you bring occam's razor into it which is fitting, as i am merely applying that. when all our understanding of the universe suggests there is an x which we do not yet comprehend, why is nulling it to zero in line with the principle of occam's razor? it isnt.  i am not arguing for a specific hypothesis, or a specific theory; i am not an engineer and i will not profess a specificity until i have some inkling about what those specifics might be.  i don't need a theory or hypothesis about the nature of god to demonstrate that it is more likely that a god of some form exists. i am not inventing a god to explain things i don't understand, i am simply calling that which i don't understand god.  i have in fact presented quite a solid challenge to everything you have said.  i opened to rejoinder because there is in fact a valid one, you just haven't found it yet.  happy new year!",1,
213250,"the part you snipped out was sort of important, there.  it's not clear from the context of his quote whether or not he personally believes jews should be in israel because god promised it to them (and actually, it doesn't matter) -- what he's doing is he's rebuting common arguments.  as i see it, the context of the quote most likely concerns strategy vis-a-vis the palestinians, and in particular the question of whether or not the palestinian population can be pacified.  ben gurion is pointing out that the arguments *for* israel which may resonate with jews, which include historicity (i.e., we jews used to live here many millenia ago) and religion (i.e., god designated this place for us) are irrelevant to palestinians and cannot be used to sway them in favor of voluntarily giving up their land.  if anything, i found this quote surprising because it seems as though ben gurion is on some level actually *empathizing* with the palestinan cause -- something i would never have thought possible for him -- by saying, ""look, i don't blame them for fighting us, and if i were one of them i would too.""  the last part of your quote, ""so it's simple: we have to stay strong and maintain a powerful army,"" to me comes from that position: he's deduced (correctly, it seems) that because the palestinians will not leave and neither will the israelis, conflict is inevitable, and must be prepared for.  if anything, this shrewd position gave israel the strategic upper-hand.  zionists had been immigrating to palestine since the end of the 19th century, and with a few isolated exceptions had been mostly welcomed by the resident palestinian population.  had the palestinians shared ben gurion's analysis -- it will come down to us or them, and so we must be prepared to fight -- they might have been better prepared when the nakba rolled around.  unfortunately for them, they didn't start fighting back until the first intifada.  by then israel was well established.",0,

387842,"history thus far:  2003 - lived among housemates in the small apartment complex on the second floor in downdown mid-size city. all are losers, mostly old and impoverished. some genuine creep. one white trash type man was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 12-year old at a house party and was lucky to have a lenient prison term because he claimed he thought 12-year old girl pass for a young adult woman. jailbaitin' is common in utah, believe it or not. another housemate is a total pothead who was a plaintiff at utah supreme court on violation of 4th amendment regarding marijuana possession after running into a cop. was caught with pot possession again and is officially state's ""most wanted"" fugitive. a black woman from jamiaca is a jesus freak and very neurotic. one day she got a freak-out and had been evicted. oh, and a white trash couple didn't bother to pay rent at all since moving in and had to be evicted by cops next door to mine. and another mentally unstable actor-wannabe neighbor who claimed california lea want him for questioning about molesting children (don't know why he chose to confide in me). he's an excommunicated mormon who is homosexual - thrice-married and -divorced; abandoned his last wife. very confused about his sexuality since an older boy propositioned him and they had sex in the shed or some place in the 60's. technically not really roommates since i hardly know these poor losers, just 'housemate neighbor'. finally got out of that hole 10 months later.  2005: moved in to live with mormon roommates as a 'jack mormon'. one mormon boy seemed to have passive-aggression issue. he threw out my 'continent 8' soy milk container to make room for his cow milk in the crowded refrigerator, like a cuckoo. another roommate is a 32-year old loser chained to his computer most of the day/night after day work as internet, video game, and comic addict (scanned american comic books and had a complete collection of dreamcast library on dvd-r's which took him over a year to complete torrent download from demonoid). another roommate is a black guy from haiti (mormon convert) who could barely speak and write english. he had an attitude when it comes to sharing living room television for everyone.   moved to another house owned by mormon landlord after the unrelated mormon landlords gave up the first. lived with two brothers who pretend to be mormons but are in reality horndogs. they brought girls over for fornication (violation of mormon rules). one of them already have a baby with a pretty girl, the same one he brought over for sex in his shared room. anytime the brother brings over girl for sex, the other brother is obliged to lounge in the living room watching tv or going out. loved wearing abercrombie &amp; fitch clothes despite their minimum wage jobs. their parents are mormons but the handsome &amp; well-built brothers are far removed from mormon religion due to predilection for sex with girls. they moved out because they dislike 'oppressive' mormon environment and crime hotspot region where police helicopter whirls around some nights.   i shared the room with the computer addict roommate (same one as above). he was quite neurotic and had an extensive soft-core porn collection with beautiful naked white young women, despite his religion. he eats crackers dipped from tomato/spaghetti sauce while watching movie or playing computer game on monitor (favorite snack). he masturbates in the bed late at night -- soft moaning sound and strange movement under the blanket discernible.  2006: i moved because i wanted to be closer to work. i shared an apartment with a non-mormon, atheist roommate who is a co-worker. big mistake. roommate is yet another voracious internet, video game, and manga/anime addict. it doesn't bother me at first, but it affected his ability to do chores -- if at all. bathroom and kitchen are often filthy that i had to clean periodically. one day he left rotten meat in a pot by kitchen sink and it reeked when i came into kitchen. he left it for several days, never to be washed. he has passive-aggressive attitude and wasted his whole vacation week (after slaving at a wage job for a year) playing newly purchased video games.  one day the ceiling broke and the second floor apartment was flooded. we agreed to break lease with no charge by the complex's management, but then he told me he needs $500 from me to break lease contract with his co-signature. this after he blew hundreds of dollars on xbox360 and games. extortion. i told management what happened and they agreed to let me go. i cleaned up apartment &amp; room and left with my possessions while the scumbag was at night work. i had friend's help who was former roommate (uncommonly decent and married) in moving my possessions for a temporary stay for a week for $50 before i found another room. i left the scumbag a nasty note that he is extremely selfish and lazy, has peter pan's syndrome and left him $20 bill for last month's utility bill.   now: i live with housemates, almost no one decent. one is an older man (50's) and very depressed. heavy on medication. he creeps me out with his weird, medicated behavior. he once cried hard in the dining room while i washed dishes. i carry spitfire pepper spray when i enter the house and cook/wash dish in kitchen just in case.   some roommates/housemates have very peculiar behaviors and attitudes. if you want a decent roommate, you might want to search harder -- and collective agreement to maintain ""high standard"". pay slightly higher monthly rent cost in slightly upscale apartment/house in good neighborhood for privilege of living with less creepy/weird/loser mates.",1,

(i’m sure you’ll be ecstatic to find out i did recently start again.)  56. visit the central and east asian steppes of mongolia, one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world, and where many of the population still live a nomadic lifestyle.  57. go hang gliding over rio de janeiro for a bird’s eye view of the city and its surrounds that you couldn’t get any other way. perhaps best not to eat much beforehand, though.  58. live or study abroad for a while. i’ve been a periodic expat for almost 10 years now. i really believe that immersion in a foreign culture is a great way to learn more about yourself, the world, and your place within it. it’s also far and away the best way to learn another language.  59. eat a goblin cock in chicago. behave – that’s a heavy metal burger with a chicago dog served on top, arguably one of the finest burgers in the world.  60. watch the world cup live in the country that’s hosting. the 2014 world cup is being held in brazil, which coincidentally is also home to one of the world’s rowdiest soccer stadiums. see you there?  61. take part in la tomatina in valencia, where 30,000-odd people have the mother of all food fights.  62. travel wild on the african island of madagascar, said to be home to 5 % of the world’s plant and animal species. one word: lemurs!  63. treat yourself to some “viagra for hair” at hari’s salon in london. a true once-in-your-lifetime experience: the treatment is made from aberdeen angus bull semen! but the bull is organic, so that’s ok. sometimes, being bald has its advantages.  64. camp in the white desert of egypt. yep, i’m biased, but not only are you among eerie, strange-shaped rock formations, but you may wake in the middle of the night to a loving nibble from a desert fox. deserts are harsh environments in which to camp, but the silence, the sense of space and the stark terrain are profoundly beautiful.  65. visit the rock-cut churches of ethiopia, some of the world’s most spectacular places of worship.  66. trek the mountains of bhutan, a country increasingly opening up to tourism, for a great combination of scenery, spirituality, and exercise.  67. take on your demons at a thai yoga intensive, or learn a meditation technique such as vipassana.  68. go on a modern day treasure hunt by trying out geocaching. this is a real 21st century sport, which everyone from gps geeks to nature lovers can enjoy. just remember, it’s 29.978134, 31.132507 marks the spot.  69. stay on a houseboat in kashmir, a region with so much more to it than the violence the media portrays.  70. visit the gorillas in rwanda’s parc national des volcans without breaking the bank.  71. learn to dance tango in buenos aires. so what if it’s a bit of a cliché? it’s a sexy cliché with rhythm, passion and soul. sign me up, two left feet and all.  72. get physically as well as spiritually closer to the gods by climbing mount fuji in japan. it’s best to climb outside of peak season: it’s one of the most sacred mountains in the world, and everyone likes a good god-mountain combo.  73. fling the fire at the hifuri shinji festival in japan, where spinning torches (and setting mount aso volcano alight!) help ensure a good harvest. take your pyromania even further by learning to walk on fire – although the walk lasts only a few seconds, the bragging rights last forever.  74. watch the flamingos gather in the shallows of lake nakuru. as well as up to two million of these crazy pink birds, you’ve got a good chance of seeing white and black rhinos in this kenyan national park.  75. jump off something really high in interlaken, switzerland – just make sure you have a long (but not too long) piece of elastic tied to your feet, or are strapped in to a parachute. skydiving from the edge of space is something you should probably work up to.  76. learn to sandboard on colarado’s great dunes, which is great if you like snowboarding but can’t be doing with the crowds and the cold. if you feel the need to go one better, how about volcano boarding in nicaragua? yes, it is an active volcano!  77. cosy up with your partner in santorini, greece – not only is it picturesque and very romantic, the sunset over the aegean sea is one of the most dramatic in the world.  78. try mountain trekking in the philippines to experience a totally different side of the country.  79. go heli-skiing in alaska in the chugach mountain range. spectacular mountains and tip-top conditions to enchant the hard-core snow blowers!  80. hike the appalachian trail. yep, all 2174 miles of it! it’ll take about six months, and might be just the time you need away from the office. and at least by the end you’ll be able to answer the question, “do bears shit in the woods?” prepare for backcountry travel, though.  81. attend the kumbh mela in india, a massive hindu festival where pilgrims bathe in the waters of the ganges. thousands of leery holy men and women engage in religious discussions and various off-the-wall devotional activities.  82. witness the serengeti to masai mara wildebeest migration from a hot air balloon. if you love balloons but are scared of heights (or wild animals), visit a hot air balloon festival instead.  83. cycle through cuba for a closer look at a contradictory nation. you might even pick up some spanish along the way.  84. explore the rainforests and mangrove swamps of borneo, home to bornean orangutans, asian elephants and bornean clouded leopards.  85. get naked in cap d’agde in france, the “world capital of nudism”, where nudity is legal in town as well as on the beach. if this is too much exposure, then work your way up to it by visiting another of the best nudist beaches in the world.  86. learn to free dive and push your boundaries by seeing how far you can go on a single breath!  87. explore the incredible untouched wilderness of glacier national park in montana, and enjoy fantastic hiking, camping, fly fishing and cross-country skiing.  88. feel the burn in death valley – the lowest, driest, hottest place in north america – and then cool off by visiting some of the less fierce natural wonders of the usa.  89. learn to cook traditional chinese dumplings in beijing, which is a lot harder than it sounds. your first few will probably come out deformed, but hopefully they’ll taste ok!  90. float around the dead sea in jordan, where you really can sit up and read a newspaper. covering yourself in “therapeutic” black mud is compulsory. sticking your head underwater most definitely isn’t. and, best not to shave beforehand, ya know?  91. visit bali, a hindu island in a muslim country, and escape the tourists by heading inland.  92. get off the beaten path in columbia and discover deserted surf breaks, rainforest, desert and savannah that you never knew existed.  93. drink litre steins of beer and eat pork knuckles at oktoberfest, the largest party in the world. booze and music and roller coasters and leather shorts… what’s not to like about that?

269849,"&gt;&gt; no, but it is only americans who view any scientific advance which did not occur within their own borders as something to be viewed with regret and envy. do you hear europeans complaining about nasa's success in landing rovers on mars?  &gt; we disagree here. i think in the us people generally applaud scientific advancement anywhere, and people only get concerned when they perceive the us to be falling behind - as they should.  really? why should they be concerned? what does it mean to say that the us is falling behind? why, if people in the us applaud scientific advances wherever they occur, does neil degrasse tyson see the lhc and russia's asteroid deflection programs as causes for concern instead of causes for celebration?  &gt; science isn't performed with sunshine and unicorn farts. wealthy nations can apply more $ to basic research, which you rightly applaud. in doing so, gdp increases, enabling them to apply more $ to basic research, which i rightly applaud.  yes, we agree with and applaud more money being applied to research, but we do not do research only in the hope of improving our gdp. much research, like that of the lhc, will likely never repay a hundredth part of what was invested.  to me, that doesn't matter, and i suspect most of the scientists at cern don't care either. cern does not view its mission as putting europe ahead of america in some race. i suspect that nasa doesn't see its mission as gaining economic advantage for america. the advancement of narrow, parochial agendas, like gaining a commercial advantage over one's neighbours, or gaining power over them, these are not the reasons why we fund science.  &gt;&gt; so, on one hand you say that globalisation is a thing of the past, while on the other telling me that i must complete globally for my job. which is it?  &gt; you mischaracterize my argument (perhaps unintentionally?).   how so? did you not say that ""tom friedman lets-hold-hands globalization was a luxury of the mid-2000s.""? did you not also say ""unless your job strictly requires your physical presence, you are competing locally, regionally, nationally, and globally for it. you forget this at your peril."" so, you say that globalisation is a luxury of the mid 2000s that has been replaced with protectionism, and then declare that *i* must compete globally for my job.   &gt;&gt; you have fallen into the trap of viewing scientific progress as an engine for economic success, and economic success only in a narrow, provincial sense at that, rather than something that is an end unto itself.  &gt; i am not sure how to respond to this, since i am not sure from where you got this idea.  my original post was to condemn a nationalistic view of science, to which you responded with an argument about economics and protectionism, the gist of which i took to be that america must do better in science for economic reasons. now you claim you cannot see where i got that idea? in fact, a few paragraphs above, you make this very same argument again, this time more explicitly, in these words:  &gt;&gt; ""wealthy nations can apply more $ to basic research, which you rightly applaud. in doing so, gdp increases, enabling them to apply more $ to basic research, which i rightly applaud.""  i also included a bit about economic advancement in a narrow parochial sense because you appear to seek economic advantage for america rather than advantage for whichever company, regardless of nationality, should commercialise some scientific advance.   &gt;&gt; what commercial ventures do you think the lhc will spawn? what about the international space station?  &gt; wait and see - there sure as hell will be some, though. transistors came out of bell labs - ostensibly ""basic research"" that resulted in one of the greatest technological advances of the 20th century - homegrown in the us of a. in the current epoch, governments have to fund it.  undoubtedly there will be *some* commercial products, but they are impossible to predict, and they may not offer any significant return on investment for decades, if at all. from a strictly economic point of view, investing billions in the lhc is a horrible idea.   &gt;&gt; they do it because they are driven to understand the universe, because occasionally but sadly all too rarely, some people find that there are some things more important than grubbing for money, power, and status.  &gt; i'm guessing you're not a working scientist. everyone ""[grubs] for money, power, and status."" we are not monks; we're monkeys, like everyone else.  i am not a scientist, true, but i know some people who work in the field, and they could earn far more by doing something else. no-one goes into science for the money and the fame.",0,

182054,"i'd say they're more respectable than a large majority of news sources in the entirety of the world. if you disagree then explain why please. i would be interested to hear your viewpoint.  http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/06/12/think_again_al_jazeera  if you don't feel like creating an account to read i'll post the article below.  &gt;it is vilified as a propaganda machine and osama bin laden's mouthpiece. in truth, though, al jazeera is as hated in the palaces of riyadh as it is in the white house. but, as millions of loyal viewers already know, al jazeera promotes a level of free speech and dissent rarely seen in the arab world. with plans to go global, it might just become your network of choice.   &gt;""al jazeera supports terrorism""  &gt;false, though the network makes little attempt to disassociate itself from those who do. this claim is one of the loudest arguments that western critics have levied against the arabic-language news channel since its inception 10 years ago, when the doha, qatar-based network pledged to present all viewpoints. just as it describes in its motto, ""the opinion and the other opinion,"" al jazeera has lent airtime even to hated political figures and extremists, including prominent members of al qaeda. it's this willingness to present terrorists as legitimate political commentators that has prompted outspoken critics such as u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld to refer to al jazeera's coverage of the u.s.-led wars in afghanistan and iraq as ""inaccurate and inexcusable.""  &gt;after all, when al jazeera offers its estimated 50 million viewers exclusive interviews of osama bin laden, it's easy to confuse access with endorsement. and when a journalist who conducts those interviews is jailed for collaboration with al qaeda, as tayssir alouni was in a spanish court last year, the line between impartial observer and impassioned supporter is certainly blurred. in addition, al qaeda is not the only terrorist group that reaches out to al jazeera. besides the infamous bin laden tapes -- at least six of which the network has still never aired -- al jazeera has also received tapes from insurgent groups in iraq, renegade afghan warlords, and the london suicide bombers.  &gt;but the network has never supported violence against the united states. not once have its correspondents praised attacks on coalition forces in iraq. the network has never captured an attack on the coalition ""live,"" and there's no evidence al jazeera has known about any attack beforehand. despite claims to the contrary, the network has never aired footage of a beheading. as for alouni's case, conclusive evidence has yet to be presented to the public. and there is nothing to suggest that the network's funding is illegitimate. allegations of supporting terrorism remain just that -- allegations.   &gt;""al jazeera is anti-semitic""  &gt;wrong. just as al jazeera has proven willing to present al qaeda's ""perspective,"" it has also devoted airtime to and welcomed another regional pariah -- israel. the network was the first arab channel to allow israelis to present their case in their own words, in hebrew, english, or arabic. this move was a major departure from past practices and truly shocked the arab public. until al jazeera arrived, most arabs had never even heard an israeli’s voice. al jazeera regularly airs clips of israeli officials within news bulletins and conducts live interviews with six to 10 israelis each month. the network covers israeli affairs extensively and is widely watched in israel. in fact, al jazeera gives more airtime to israeli issues than any other channel outside israel itself.  &gt;although israel has accused al jazeera of bias and anti-semitism (and some of the network's guests have certainly fit that bill), the network's coverage has occasionally been of concrete benefit to the israelis. when israel invaded jenin in the spring of 2002, al jazeera's exclusive television reports from within the besieged city thoroughly dispelled rumors of a ""massacre,"" leading to a u.n. special investigating committee appointed by the secretary-general being unceremoniously disbanded.  &gt;many israelis even regard al jazeera as an important new force for change in the arab world. gideon ezra, former deputy head of the israeli general security service, once remarked that he wished ""all arab media were like al-jazeera."" not all arabs would agree. although many westerners think al jazeera has a pro-arab bias, many arabs believe exactly the opposite. it is widely held in the arab world that al jazeera is financed and run by mossad, mi5, or the cia, so as to undermine arab unity. just as bahrain banned al jazeera from reporting from inside the country because of a perceived zionist bias in 2002, al jazeera's bureaus in arab countries have often been closed down, accused of besmirching the palestinians or disseminating other kinds of imperialistic anti-arab propaganda.   &gt;""al jazeera is spreading political freedom""  &gt;wishful thinking. it's true that al jazeera established the tradition of investigative reporting in the arab world and rolled back the boundaries of debate within arab families, breaking all kinds of taboos about what could be discussed on television. improving upon the sycophantic arab news channels that existed prior to 1996, al jazeera better informs the arab public about their leadership and provides arabs with a forum through which they can more easily ask of their rulers, ""why are we in this mess?""  &gt;in fact, al jazeera's programs about western politics have done more to inform arabs about democracy than any nation or station. after 9/11, al jazeera's washington bureau started two weekly talk shows to illuminate american democracy for a foreign audience: from washington, in which the bureau chief interviewed u.s. politicians, including members of the bush administration; and u.s. presidential race, which covered the u.s. elections in great depth, including most of the major primaries.  &gt;however, to assume satellite television will transform arab societies into transparent, just, and equal democracies is to presume that the current state of affairs in the arab world results from an information deficit, which is not true. except in the most authoritarian arab countries, news has long been available to determined citizens via the bbc or voice of america radio, and neither one of those remade the region.  &gt;al jazeera encourages free speech in the middle east, but that is no substitute for real political reform. just because a woman in saudi arabia can now see a debate on tv, and can even contribute in real time, doesn't mean she can go out and vote in an election or join a political party. arab autocrats have come to realize that even if information on satellite tv cannot be packaged and manipulated the way it was with state-run media, al jazeera may not be as deadly a threat to their regimes as they first feared. they can still ban al jazeera from opening a bureau, as has happened in saudi arabia and tunisia, or evoke emergency laws to confiscate equipment or arrest journalists, as happens in egypt. arab press unions, like arab opposition political parties, are still prevented from growing strong.   *continuation posted below*     the part of this article that makes me chuckle in particular is this:  &gt;after all, when al jazeera offers its estimated 50 million viewers exclusive interviews of osama bin laden, it's easy to confuse access with endorsement.  this highlights the problem with the public perception of journalism imo. people don't expect real journalism that covers the plurality of viewpoints regarding a story. they expect what they get from the typical american news media: a one sided propaganda segment that enforces the official position of the power structure.",0,

537966,"okay kids, story time. gather 'round, and listen. remember, i didn't come here to bullshit you, so save your breath if you're going to try and call me crazy or some such.  so, i'm a counselor at this camp every summer for one week in new hampshire. it's a big deal in my town to get a chance to volunteer here (go figure), so everyone that gets to go really enjoys the whole trip. anyway, once you make the change from camper to counselor, you get to.. *gasp!*.. stay up as late as you want. during my first year as a counselor, this was cooler than you can possibly imagine. the camp is built on a sprawling campus that abuts a lake, and is many, many years old. the buildings are mostly original, and just as fuckin' creepy.  anyway, as my first week of counselorship was coming to an end, we decided to go all out and stay up all night, causing trouble and exploring the otherwise-off-limits parts of the grounds that we'd never been to before. we started in the kitchen of the dining hall, to no avail. later, we went waaaay deep into the woods, and found ourselves at an old barn. while there was some creepy graffiti (specifically, a picture of mother theresa with red eyes and a sharp-toothed grin, shivershivershiver) and some stories that some wayward camper had hung himself in there years ago, we went with about 30 people, so any real scare factor was pretty much gone.  anyway, as the night was turning into morning, we decided that we'd go back to the center of camp and make a fire (it was the end of august in new hampshire, so it was pretty cold around three in the morning). after the fire burned for a little bit, a good friend of mine, one of the older counselors, decided to grab the first bundle of wood, because she knew where it was right away - on the porch of the recreational center, where most of the events of the camp take place. she takes off into the darkness of early morning in he back woods new hampshire.  suddenly, she comes running back at an uneasy pace. out of breath and lost for words, her face is visibly pale white, even after a week spent under the summer sun. she is trembling, and starting to cry.  ""..guys, you have to come see this,"" she says, as though a child who has seen something awful and incomprehensible. chills run down my spine and through my skin even to this day, and i'm sure the same was true for everyone else there that night, about ten of us left. unable to pass up such a mystery, the remaining counselors - about ten of us - make the journey up to the porch in the moonlight.  the layout of the rec center is like this..  seriously, my ride just came. i'll finish the story when i get back (2 hours or so). if anyone seems interested, i'll finish telling the story. to me, it's incontrovertible evidence of the existence of the paranormal. and no, i'm not kidding.  **okay.** sorry for the wait. but true to my word, i'm back to finish my story. and no, this is not a bel air. i don't think i'm creative enough for that.  okay, so the layout of the rec center, as i was saying before, is something like an airplane hangar, about a football field in length. it's made up of a stage at the back, and two basketball courts perpendicular to the front doors. there are two front doors, which are like barn doors - they slide to the left to open to the rec room floor. it's mostly empty space, and there are windows lining both sides all along the building.  anyway, the girl i was speaking of before went up to the left barn door, and, like i said, came running back simply terrified. naturally, we had to see what had her so spooked.  when we got to the door, there were no lights on in the building except for a single hanging bulb in a backstage storage room that held costumes, props, etc. the light couldn't been seen directly, but instead, shone through a slatted vent (measuring about 4' x 4'). the effect this had was very eerie - it appeared to make what i can only describe as a picture frame. although, like i said, the measurements of the vent didn't allow for proportional human sizes, whatever was going on made the images that myself and others saw completely life-size.  now here's where i start to tear up. although yes, there were no pictures, it would have been impossible to take one of what we were seeing - like i said, the building is about a football field in length, so if we were standing on our 30 yard line in stark darkness, what we saw was on the opposing team's 30. regardless, i have to express just how real this was. i've never been able to come to terms with what was there, but the images are burned into my mind as real as pictures.  what we saw at first *chills* was actually quite sickening because we had dropped the notion of seeing anything ""paranormal"" for that night. in pure, real-life color, there was a man (senior camper?) in a light brown leather jacket, red shirt, and light blue jeans. he was swaying back and forth very, very slowly. he was hanging from a rope attached to what was the ""top"" of the picture frame. as we fixed our eyes on it, what we were seeing began to take clearer and clearer shape. this sort of ""aawww"" began to rise in the crowd, which was of about ten people. suddenly, it hit us. *we'd stumbled on a camper that had hung themselves.* girls started to cry, and we were generally just all freaked the shit out. somebody turned to run, and then, pandemonium. we all started running at once, tripping over each other, screaming, and thinking the absolute worst.  when we returned to the fire, the group was speechless. we all looked at eachother blankly like, ""what the *fuck* is going on?"" a few of us got up the courage to go back, and make sure we had seen what we had seen, before going to wake up the director and start what would surely be the worst last day of camp in its history.  slowly, we walked up the ancient wooden stairs to the left barn door. stationing ourselves to the right of it, we decided to slowly peer in all at once. what we saw completely changed our perception of what was going on. instead of seeing what was clearly moments before someone hanging from a noose, we now saw an elderly man sitting at a long table by himself. he had grey hair and terribly wrinkled features, and was wearing a dinner jacket, his lower half hidden behind the ""frame."" as we stood motionlessly and stared, he would periodically turn to look at us. when he had turned all the way to his right, we could make out that he was heavily decorated in some type of military medals. he looked displeased, upset, and most of all, pretty.. dead. after a few turns towards us, we ran right the fuck out of there once again.  getting back to the campfire, we were feeling a bit better about the situation, seeing as it looked like it wasn't a suicide. however, we were starting to question what exactly we *were* seeing. to test it out as ""scientifically"" as possible, we decided to move to the right barn door this time..  **conclusion.** so thanks for waiting. i deserve the downvotes, but here goes.  so the brave remaining few get to the right barn door. what we saw this time was the most horrifying scene i'm likely to ever witness. allowing our eyes time adjust, we focused once again on the vent, this time with our arms linked, bodies shaking with fear and confusion.   our original plan was to throw ourselves into the darkness of the massive, empty room and try to get to the vent to look inside. before we could move though, another scene began playing in the frame.  the best way i have to describe this - and trust me, i've told this story hundreds of times - is that it looked like a grainy film, circa 1920's-30's. the subject of the film was a couple on their wedding day. they looked *so* happy at first. they were smiling, laughing, playfully pushing at one another.. they looked like they were really enjoying their special moment. it seemed as though people were taking pictures of them, because the bride was changing between fixing her hair, posing with an oozing smile, then breaking pose to look lovingly at her groom to fix his bowtie or an errant piece of hair before returning to her pose.  ""are you guys seeing what i'm seeing?,"" asked one of the members of the group.  slowly, quietly, we all agreed. we were seeing a wedding day.  just as soon as we had reached an agreement, something happened that made tears fall out of my face. not like crying, but like.. my head was leaking because i couldn't comprehend the horror of what i was seeing *in real time.*  reaching their final happy pose, arms linked together, almost in reflection of our own childish links, the film started to get grainier, but somehow, more colorful. sickly colorful. the edges of the frame began to singe as if the film was being heated by flame from the back, and the scene began to push towards us. then it happened.  the bride's skin began turning a fetid, rotting green as her neck slumped slowly to the left. our eyes must have collectively turned the size of silver dollars. she lifted her right leg, and stepped over the frame. the man all but disappeared as the bride started doing a crooked walking-running move towards us, as though she were held up on all limbs by stints. we broke our links, turned, and.. ran. the. fuck. out.  **(end is in my reply.. i hit max comment length!)**",0,

""they are on to the fundamentals, the holy trinity, of health care reform: access, quality and cost control,"" said forrest claypool, a commissioner in cook county, ill., and a friend of president barack obama who advises the administration on health care.  tom banning, chief executive officer of the texas academy of family physicians, said: ""they're putting into practice what policymakers and what lawmakers in congress are talking about.""  model at work founded in 2007, legacy medical village is not one practice but a group of many. and it is not a hospital but a collection of primary care doctors and independent specialists housed in the same building.  it was started by dr. christopher crow, a slender 38-year-old with a slight drawl who looks more like an accountant than a health care revolutionary.  as a young family doctor, the hillsboro, texas, native grew disillusioned with the older business approaches found everywhere in medicine. shortcomings included inefficient paper records and little use of online tools or coordination between doctors and specialists.  so crow and other like-minded colleagues started anew to infuse some wal-mart-style efficiency into the typical doctor's visit.  ""it's business 101,"" said crow, who has an mba. ""we're applying basic business principles to health care. and that's all you have to do to deliver a better model.""  at legacy medical village, patients chat with doctors about routine health concerns by e-mail, even after hours. prescriptions are filled with the click of a mouse. physicians and specialists often diagnose problems in the same patient visit.  and crow's primary care practice, village health partners, is a short walk from a flotilla of doctors whose specialties range from optometry to physical therapy and dermatology.  anchoring the whole operation is a robust electronic medical records database that uses technology similar to the inventory systems of big-box stores.  it gives each doctor instant access to patients' medical information (including when they are due for certain health screenings), makes it easier for doctors and specialists to consolidate records in one place, and even allows patients the chance to view their basic health data online.  perhaps most importantly, groups of doctors in the building meet routinely to talk about patient health. they also chat about improvements both large and small. (one recent meeting touched on ways to get faster results from urine tests.)  the meetings have fed an air of responsibility for patient health, with the primary care physicians taking the lead role.  'healthier for it' kara stephens of plano has experienced health care models both old and new. she is a longtime patient of dr. sander gothard, a colleague of crow's.  when her 3-year-old daughter was born, stephens made frequent visits to gothard's old office for tests and checkups. each visit cost money and time – both for stephens and for gothard.  but her routine changed after she gave birth to her son about a year ago.  instead of setting up multiple office visits, stephens e-mailed gothard on routine matters relating to her newborn son. and she would receive replies from gothard or one of his staff within hours as opposed to days.  stephens also said her office visits are more efficient. wait times are shorter. and when the need for a specialist arises, stephens has the option of simply walking down the hall. with just a few keystrokes, gothard can transmit stephens' relevant medical records to that specialist.  ""i've saved us so many visits to the doctor just via e-mail,"" said stephens, 34. ""it sounds funny, but i do feel like we're healthier for it.""  challenges abound legacy medical village has gotten visits from members of congress and the state legislature. claypool, the obama administration adviser, has seen it. and this past summer, crow was invited to the white house to discuss the overhaul of the health care system with some of the president's inner circle.  a growing number of hospitals and even a few primary care practices have adopted some of the same technology and strategies used at legacy. healthcare clinics, a family practice in dallas, moved to a village-style model in june.  but family practices haven't embraced the reforms, experts say. at the primary care level, few smaller practices have the money, expertise or ambition to install electronic medical records or pursue collaborative care.  and because doctors are paid for service, experts say, practices are apt to focus less on patient health than on numbers: of patient visits, of procedures and of tests. those profit forces, observers say, are among the main drivers behind spiraling health care costs.  for proof of the challenges, consider the story of dr. lewis frazier, a rehabilitation specialist at the village.  he said he earns about a third of the salary he once did because the village model has so dramatically cut administrative costs, visits to the doctor and the need for more expensive tests and procedures.  ""when i owned a surgery center, i did the work even though i knew it could be done in a cheaper way. i felt at the time that there were some costs to the patient that i didn't think were necessary,"" frazier said. ""it's fulfilling to me to do it the right way for the right reasons. but right now, we are not providing financial rewards for practicing better medicine.""  future paths some say the mayo clinic in rochester, minn., may have the answer. the hospital has long paid its doctors flat salaries, in part, to avoid the shortcomings of the fee-for-service system.  ""there is clearly an advantage to a salary-based approach,"" said dr. douglas wood, chairman of mayo clinic's division of health care policy.  others advocate a merit-based approach in which doctor pay is, somehow, linked to patient health. exactly how that might work is unclear. but the goal, wood said, is ""to produce good health and fewer hospital stays,"" and thereby reducing costs.  the health care proposals being discussed on capitol hill include money to pursue new delivery prototypes, including the village model.  health and human services secretary kathleen sebelius also has expressed interest in examining the village model and other approaches.  to crow, whether the industry adopts the legacy medical village model or some other strategy matters little. as long as it works.  ""health care does need revamping; it does need improvement,"" crow said. ""how we go about doing that we all disagree on. but, clearly, everyone agrees that health care is something that's just not as good as everything else we do in this country from an operational standpoint.  ""it's hard to change the status quo. but we should get more for what we are paying.""",0,

739058,"&gt; good luck getting a creationist to even entertain the idea that his god may not exist.  that sounds like you're jumping to the end of the movie.  shouldn't you be dealing with their more discrete, tangible claims -- eg. resistance to carbon dating -- before getting to a huge, overriding claim like ""there exists a god...""  &gt; on the other hand, as an atheist, i am fully-willing to believe in a god if any number of suitable, specific pieces of evidence are presented.  out of interest, what would count as a ""suitable"" piece of evidence?  &gt; i'm suggesting that in some cases, shame can be more effective.  and, again, i'm not denying the effectiveness of shame-based tactics.  i'm suggesting, in the first place, that the net-effect is actually bad for society, and in the second place, that it's worth considering whether or not the opinion of a person who can *only* be persuaded by shame-based tactics is worth addressing in the first place.  &gt; for example, it seems obvious fred phelps is not interested in ""public discourse"" - shame is probably more effective.  i doubt even shame is effective with phelps.  he seems to reside at the zenith of shamelessness.  or would that be a nadir?  but getting back to my previous point, i'd also say that it's a waste of time to even bother trying to persuade someone like that.  his influence is limited to whatever attention we give him.  ignore him and his opinion will cease to matter.  &gt; what i mainly object to is the continuing notion of the media treating closed-minded ideologues as if they deserve reasonable discourse when their arguments are unreasonable and they are profoundly closed minded.   i object to that as well, but i think we only feed their incentive for doing so when we lower the bar in order to apply more pressure.  because ridicule sells.  if you're willing to go on bill o'reilly and call tim lahaye a certified moron, then they'll probably reserve a slot for you, because that sort of tension galvanizes audiences.  a measured, well-spoken, well-reasoned argument may be enlightening, but it doesn't exactly push ratings.  &gt; if she were treated with the mockery and shame she really deserves, maybe she might  you don't think sarah palin was treated with mockery?  i'd say there's a cottage industry in reviling her.  even katie couric conducted parts of their interview with a wink and a nudge to the television audience.  palin would likely have nowhere near as much sway as she does if we all simply stopped paying attention to her.  &gt; mobs and bullies act the way they do because they are often unchallenged.  bullies, maybe -- although, bullies are also sometimes stubbornly immune to shame.  what would it take, for example, to shame tom metzger, who founded the white aryan resistance, out of his white supremecy?  mobs, it seems to me, respond to a challenge, and they less rational the challenge, the more fire they draw from it.  an interesting example, to my mind, is the speech obama gave that essentially deflated the whole jeremiah wright controversy.  it was a major turning point in his bid for the democratic nomination.  basically, a mob had formed calling for him to denounce wright and ""explain"" his association with the man.  the politically obvious thing for obama to do would have been to fire back, tit for tat.  what he did instead was deliver a speech that eloquently and rationally put wright's -- and, indeed, his own -- place in the social and political scheme into the context of a distinctly american historical struggle with the issue of race.  the effect was startling, in part because it was so unexpected, and the few hold-outs who remained after that tried in vain to keep the issue of wright alive, but they were no longer worth responding to.  &gt; do you really think those abortion protesters are there because of the fetuses?  generally speaking, i don't like to second guess people's declared motives for doing something unless i have some specific indication from their words or behavior that something more is involved.  i *will* say this, though.  anti-abortion movements are almost always explicitly political -- that is, they're about changing the political landscape to discourage abortion, rather than about making a moral appeal to individuals.  to put it into context, most christians know and would espouse the message of the verse ""love of money is the root of all evil,"" but they don't picket and threaten violence to have the fed or the treasury shut down.  to the extent that they oppose the immorality associated with the love of money, they do it on the level of the personal moral appeal.  so why don't they do the same with abortion?  a reasonably defensible answer, it seems to me, is that of control.  at nearly every level, the same evangelical conservative crowd that most vocally opposes abortion has shown some desire to control the way in which society deals with the terminal points of life -- reproduction and death.  *why* they've done so is an entirely more complicated question, but it's not irrelevant to our discussion here, since i would contend that the *best* way to address a disagreement with that sort of group is to first of all understand that *why* and then address *that* rationally.  a lot of public discussion gets derailed simply because neither side really gets at the substance of the other's investment in an issue.  &gt; he is less interested in saving others as much as the act serves to help him save himself. pointing out this reality in no-uncertain terms can be the kind of rude awakening that makes these people, at least later in private, reflect upon the wisdom of such choices.  but that isn't, in itself, shaming.  it might be incidentally shaming, but the point isn't to shame.  the point is to address their actual investment in the issue.  &gt; time and time again, we've seen a lot of these anti-gay activists do wrestle with their sexuality, and one reason they do what they do is in an effort to repress their desires. getting them out in the open may help break down that wall they're building, and shame is quite a powerful projectile.  that may sound reasonable in the abstract, but can you think of a prominent anti-gay activists who *was* shamed out of their position by someone on the other side calling them homophobic?  i can't.  i can think of one or two who were caught in scandals, but that's a corner they've painted themselves into, not the result of a deliberate campaign to shame them.  &gt; or perhaps i'd stand in front of them and hold up a sign that sought to make fun of their efforts. that nullifies their crusade, whereas ""intelligent public discourse"" does nothing.  and have any of them abandoned their theism as a result of your efforts?  &gt; i keep saying, in these circumstances there is no healthy atmosphere of public discourse.  i'm talking about the broader scope of public discourse.  an adolescent sees you out on the corner disrupting a street preacher, sees that doing so shuts the guy down and eventually pushes him off of that corner, and decides for himself that the same tactics could be used to ""win"" any discussion.  people watch keith olbermann wagging his finger at the conservative punching bag *du jour*, are impressed with the sheer style of his rhetoric, and carry what they've learned into their own discussions with friends.  when i say the *atmosphere* of public discourse, i'm deliberately pointing to what we breathe in on a daily basis, and how it's reflected in how we handle our own interactions.  and more specifically, how those interactions in turn determine the consistency and quality of the atmosphere for the next day, and the next, and so on.",1,
336096,"change is not easy at all, don't even kid yourself. as people get older and older their opinions and ideas become more and more cemented into their being. for drastic change to occur you basically need the previous generation to die/move on and have a politically active younger generation.   possibly because of the nixon inspired false perception of everyone being in government being corrupt, young people don't want to get involved in politics. or possibly because the technology has advanced so quickly the older generation has not been able to understand and react to the current need for alternative resources (since oil worked so well for their old cars.)   the idea that we should use the power of the dollar to initiate change in the government or society is simply silly. in most class conflicts (which this argument does eventually boil down to) it's rich vs. poor. even if you did invest all of the money you could into nuclear power it wouldn't amount to much compared to the sway that an oil tycoon has and considering that most people live from paycheck to paycheck this is especially true (not to mention that campaign donations count for a lot more than an investment in the congressman's eyes.)",0,

 stranger: fuck  you: yeah it just surpassed the hour mark.  you: i've seen this done before and wanted to try it.  you: a few people had no idea what to do, but you did.  you: so i just kept going.  stranger: lol  stranger: i had one chat kinda like this once before  stranger: except it was a lot shorter  you: lol  you: i've only ever been on here like 4 times.  stranger: it was like ""you are in a duengon and can move north, south,  east, and west."" and said stay put, and then i got eaten by a troll  you: lol.  you: i was contemplating killing you off.  you: it's going well.  you: okay, let's finish this.  you: look in the fucking green crate by the way. :d  stranger: oh yeah lol  stranger: look in that thing  you: you open the crate and discover two flairs, a compass, a box of  bullets and a knife.  stranger: oh sweet  stranger: shoot off one of the flairs  you: you aim the flair gun up and fire it off right into the cabin roof.  stranger: wat  stranger: fuck  stranger: lol  you: you load the second flair into the flair gun.  stranger: ok go outside first this time  stranger: then fire  you: you climb down the ladder and fire the flair  you: nothing happens.  you: ermm  stranger: ffffuuu  you: the flair shoots from the gun and falls into the ocean  you: now nothing happens*  you: you are feeling fatigued.  stranger: reload gun with the bullets from the top cabin  you: you climb back up the ladder and put the bullets into your gun  (which happens to be a .44 revolver)  you: you have 6 bullets remaining and a package of 17 (was 20; you  put 3 into the gun)  stranger: uhm  stranger: search all over the ship for medical supplies or food  you: you search frantically to only find a bag of dry rice and some  rotting fish.  stranger: go back to visit the english speaking guy  you: he has been dead for an hour now.  stranger: fffuuu  stranger: go visit the tied up fishermen  you: you collapse upon leaving the cabin. you find yourself unable to  fight the fatigue and fall asleep (or unconscious)  you: you awake in what seems like minutes from the sound of a large  engine.  you: a cruise ship is passing by dangerously close.  stranger: would there be any way to jump ships?  you: the distance from the water to the lowest level of the cruise ship  is close to 60 feet.  stranger: will the cruise ship see the boat?  you: it currently does not, however you can hear loud music playing  from the deck of the ship.  stranger: shit  stranger: shoot at the cruise ship  you: you fire a bullet at the cruise ship.  you: the music abruptly stops. you see a gang of people look over the  side of the ship down at you.  stranger: wave at them  you: you wave.  you: a few wave back; others are distressed at the sight of your  firearm.  you: someone who resembles security pushes through the crowd and  leans over the railing.  stranger: drop the firearm but keep it away from the two tied up  fishermen  you: you place the firearm to your right near the cabin. one of the  fishermen appears to be dead or unconscious.  you: some of the passengers begin talking amongst themselves; the  cruise ship is still moving away.  stranger: shout at the ship saying i need to be rescued  you: the security personnel leans over and in a north american accent  yells ""what are you doing down there?""  you: he motions for another security person to stop the ship.  stranger: i explain i was shipwrecked and then captured by these  pirates  you: he thinks for a moment and disappears.  stranger: wait for him to reemerge  you: you wait patiently and he finally does. the ship has moved a  considerable distance but luckily, due to its length, you are still side by  side. he runs to the guard rail across from you and shouts down that  he'll be throwing something down for you to climb up on.  you: it's almost completely dark outside and there are no lights on  your boat.  stranger: wait for him to throw sometihing down  you: he yells for you; it's dark and he can't see where you're  positioned.  stranger: yell back  stranger: ask if he has a light  you: he says he doesn't; he asks if you have a light on the ship.  stranger: i dont  you: check your surroundings.  stranger: search for light  you: you remember seeing a lantern in the cabin and go in to grab it.  stranger: oh yeah lol  stranger: use that  you: you have nothing to light it with.  stranger: use the lighter from the room  you: you grab the matches and the lighter fluid from the cabin and  light the lantern.  you: after some struggling, it glows brightly.  you: he spots you and throws down a makeshift ladder.  stranger: grab hold and climb it  you: you climb the ladder and arrive on the lower deck of the cruise  ship. it has started to rain.  you: the security guards asks who you are.  you: (you can make this up, i don't care it's just a formality)  stranger: eric  you: he shakes your hand and asks if you are american. you tell him  you are.  you: he tells you about the ship; it's the oceanic maiden -- the  largest cruise ship to ever sail the pacific ocean.  stranger: awesome  stranger: so does this mean i win?  you: he asks you what happened.  you: you explain that your ship had wrecked and you were captured  by pirates. you managed to befriend one of them who saved your life.  you shot the main aggressor with his own magnum and managed to  survive long enough with your wits to be found and rescued.  you: he assures you that you'll be getting home safely and that  they're headed straight from fiji to california.  you: he offers you a cabin in the luxurious upper deck.  you: you thank him and go up, to find a white dress shirt, black dress  pants and newly shined black dress shoes waiting for you.  you: you discard your old, torn clothing and change.  you: still exhausted, you fall asleep in your new, clean outfit.  you: suddenly you're jarred awake by a violent rocking.  you: you hear screaming in the halls and open your door to see what's  going on.  you: an aide tells you to get to the deck, that the ship is sinking and  to board a lifeboat as soon as possible.  stranger: lololol  you: you get to the main deck and realize:  you: you are on-board a sinking cruise ship.  you: people are fleeing for the lifeboats and many escape  you: as you reach the final one, a colossal wave crashes down upon  it, destroying the last boat.  you: what do you do?  stranger: hahaha  stranger: epic",0,
633087,"seriously.  he made a demand (that his flight would leave on time, if i recall correctly) and stated that he would take violent action (blowing up an airport) if the demand was not met.  and he published this statement *to the entire world*.  that, ladies and gentlemen, is what we call a bomb threat.  think of the media response if one of the columbine kids had tweeted, ""if it's french toast sticks for lunch again, i'm shooting the place up.""  it's not possible for police to know in advance which threats to take seriously and which threats to go after.  if anything, he inconvenienced the justice system as much as if he had called in a false police report.  they had to check up on it.  a bit of a fine is a perfectly reasonable punishment for wasting public resources.  people need to stop thinking that things they post *publicly* to the *internet* count as private communication.",0,

931904,"let me summarize it for you :  in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.  “whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”  he didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that. in consequence, i’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician, because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. most of the confidences were unsought—frequently i have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and i snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  and, after boasting this way of my tolerance, i come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point i don’t care what it’s founded on. when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—gatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn. if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again. no—gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city for three generations. the carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the dukes of buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the civil war, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.  i never saw this great-uncle, but i’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office i graduated from new haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war. i enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that i came back restless. instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so i decided to go east and learn the bond business. everybody i knew was in the bond business, so i supposed it could support one more single man. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “why—ye—es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays i came east, permanently, i thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington, and i went out to the country alone. i had a dog—at least i had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old dodge and a finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than i, stopped me on the road.  “how do you get to west egg village?” he asked helplessly.  i told him. and as i walked on i was lonely no longer. i was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  there was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew. and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides. i was rather literary in college—one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “yale news.”—and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” this isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  i lived at west egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some hotel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby’s mansion. or, rather, as i didn’t know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.  across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i’d known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.  her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  why they came east i don’t know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn’t believe it—i had no sight into daisy’s heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.  his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.  “now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because i’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  “i’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.  “it belonged to demaine, the oil man.” he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “we’ll go inside.”   we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.  “i’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i’ve heard it said that daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  at any rate, miss baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.   i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  “do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.  “the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”  “how gorgeous! let’s go back, tom. to-morrow!” then she added irrelevantly: “you ought to see the baby.”  “i’d like to.”  “she’s asleep. she’s three years old. haven’t you ever seen her?”  “never.”  “well, you ought to see her. she’s——”  tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  “what you doing, nick?”  “i’m a bond man.”  “who with?”  i told him.  “never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.  this annoyed me.  “you will,” i answered shortly. “you will if you stay in the east.”  “oh, i’ll stay in the east, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “i’d be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.”  at this point miss baker said: “absolutely!” with such suddenness that i started—it was the first word she uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  “i’m stiff,” she complained, “i’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.”  “don’t look at me,” daisy retorted, “i’ve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.”  “no, thanks,” said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “i’m absolutely in training.”  her host looked at her incredulously.  “you are!” he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “how you ever get anything done is beyond me.”  i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  “you live in west egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “i know somebody there.”  “i don’t know a single——”  “you must know gatsby.”  “gatsby?” demanded daisy. “what gatsby?”  before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  “why candles?” objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. “in two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” she looked at us all radiantly. “do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”  “we ought to plan something,” yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  “all right,” said daisy. “what’ll we plan?” she turned to me helplessly: “what do people plan?”  before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  “look!” she complained; “i hurt it.”  we all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.  “you did it, tom,” she said accusingly. “i know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. that’s what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a——”  “i hate that word hulking,” objected tom crossly, “even in kidding.”  “hulking,” insisted daisy.  sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  “you make me feel uncivilized, daisy,” i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “can’t you talk about crops or something?”  i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  “civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out tom violently. “i’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read ‘the rise of the colored empires’ by this man goddard?”  “why, no,” i answered, rather surprised by his tone.  “well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. it’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  “tom’s getting very profound,” said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “he reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we——”  “well, these books are all scientific,” insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. “this fellow has worked out the whole thing. it’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”  “we’ve got to beat them down,” whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  “you ought to live in california—” began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  “this idea is that we’re nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and——” after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. do you see?”  there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  “i’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “it’s about the butler’s nose. do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”  “that’s why i came over to-night.”  “well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose——”  “things went from bad to worse,” suggested miss baker.  “yes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”  for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  the butler came back and murmured something close to tom’s ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  “i love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. doesn’t he?” she turned to miss baker for confirmation: “an absolute rose?”  this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “sh!” in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  “this mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor——” i said.  “don’t talk. i want to hear what happens.”  “is something happening?” i inquired innocently.  “you mean to say you don’t know?” said miss baker, honestly surprised. “i thought everybody knew.”  “i don’t.”  “why——” she said hesitantly, “tom’s got some woman in new york.”  “got some woman?” i repeated blankly.  miss baker nodded.  “she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don’t you think?”  almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.  “it couldn’t be helped!” cried daisy with tense gaiety.  she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: “i looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. there’s a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he’s singing away——” her voice sang: “it’s romantic, isn’t it, tom?”  “very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “if it’s light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.”  the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn’t guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.  “we don’t know each other very well, nick,” she said suddenly. “even if we are cousins. you didn’t come to my wedding.”  “i wasn’t back from the war.”  “that’s true.” she hesitated. “well, i’ve had a very bad time, nick, and i’m pretty cynical about everything.”  evidently she had reason to be. i waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.  “i suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”  “oh, yes.” she looked at me absently. “listen, nick; let me tell you what i said when she was born. would you like to hear?”  “very much.”  “it’ll show you how i’ve gotten to feel about—things. well, she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where. i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. she told me it was a girl, and so i turned my head away and wept. ‘all right,’ i said, ‘i’m glad it’s a girl. and i hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”  “you see i think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. and i know. i’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “sophisticated—god, i’m sophisticated!”  the instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. it made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. i waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged.  inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.  tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the saturday evening post.—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. the lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.",1,

149233,"i think the fact that she posted on ra indicates she is interested in making the relationship work. relationships work through all kinds of sexual differences, sometimes they work despite complete sexual incompatibility. it sounds like op has a more active sex-drive than her boyfriend and there is a level of sexual dysfunction.  her response of throwing it all on bf is probably ultimately not helping the situation, and his inability to communicate his sexual needs and hang-ups is undermining it even further.  ultimately she is responsible for her sexual fulfillment and he is responsible for his... somewhere they are not meeting.  if i had to guess, the boyfriend is suffering from delayed ejaculation (note: there is nothing saying that is necessarily the case) and may need some help to work through it. alternatively, he has some kink the girlfriend doesn't know about or doesn't want to indulge... hell, maybe he just has less of a libido and isn't interested in fucking, but doesn't mind twisting one off without all the foreplay and feeling obliged to get her off too, etc. or, for all we know bf isn't actually attracted to her anymore, but is staying with her for whatever reason. maybe he puts her on a pedestal and simply has trouble thinking of her as a sexual creature the way he does for porn stars... whatever. either way, breaking up right off is apparently not what the op wants to do.  if she wants to avoid all the hassle to deal with those three, she can cut ties and whatever, i'm not saying it's a terrible idea... and this thread is just the figurative masturbatory fodder she needs to justify the decision ...   but, harping about his inability to perform is definitely most likely to make matters worse, especially for him. to me it sounds like her insecurities are colliding with his sexual dysfunction in a clusterfuck of sexual incompatibility that could probably be worked through to some degree. it might require sacrifice on the part of one party or the other, if they were so determined, but plenty of relationships have endured all levels of sexual incompatibility in all manners of ways. it is up to op to decide where the priority level of her sexual fulfillment lies relative to the relationship with bf. for bf, he clearly must be more open about his sexual hangups as well.",0,
454186,"the wtc7 video at wtc.nist.gov has no data available.  i can't link to the absence of data, of course.    nist's only ""reviewers"" were paid contractors.   ""after 9/11, saic supplied the largest contingent of non-governmental investigators to the wtc investigation conducted by [sic] nist.  at the same time, 'saic personnel were instrumental in pressing the case that weapons of mass destruction existed in iraq under saddam hussein, and that war was the only way to get rid of them.'[28]""  source: http://www.911blogger.com/node/22120  of course, nist's scientific work should stand on its own.  and it does--without having undergone peer-review or any outside scrutiny (except for paid consultants like saic), their wtc7 findings were passed as the truth to the media in august 2008.  the lead investigator claimed something like, ""the public should really just accept this now.""  he started his press conference (science by press conference, a dubious tactic) with the words like ""before i tell you what we found, let me tell you what we did not find.""  he was talking about finding no evidence of explosives.  in their twin towers report (sept. 2005), nist claimed they found no evidence of explosives.  in 2007, some independent scientists used the data quality act to ask nist for its data and, thus, how nist came to this conclusion that they could find no evidence of explosives.  in their reply dated september 27, 2007, nist stated: ""[w]e are unable to provide a full explanation of the total collapse.""  nist's reiterates this from their twin towers report (2005): ""nist has stated that it found no corroborating evidence to suggest that explosives were used to bring down the buildings.""  the next sentence admits, however: ""nist did not conduct tests for explosive residue...""  the response to nist's response notes: ""[i]t is extremely easy to 'find no evidence' when one is not looking for evidence.""  so in 2008 when they made this same claim--that they found no evidence of explosives--it was even more dubious than before.  they used heuristic arguments (not conclusive proof) that no explosives were used.  in fact, there is no evidence that they ever did tests for explosives.  in the august 21, 2008 press conference, dr. s. sham sunder made the logical fallacy of the false dilemma (or law of the excluded middle) when he attempted to rule out the possibility of explosives in response to a question by mike shea of baltimore grassroots media.  as i recall, sunder states on the one hand that too many explosives would have been required to bring down wtc7 to make it a possibility.  on the other hand, sunder stated that the building fell without the aid of explosives.  mike shea asked whether it was not possible that explosives could have merely *aided* in the collapse of the building.  this frustrated sunder, and in response he made the bare assertion (another logical fallacy) that was something like ""the physics is sound!""  so we are simply supposed to believe him?  they did not make the data from their simulations available, so we can't trust that part of their physics.  their estimates for the fall time of wtc7 were off by 40%, which they revised due to the insightful questioning of a high school physics teacher, david chandler.  and nist did no tests for explosives and have never published such data.  we are just supposed to believe these people?  i could go on and on.  and yet there are people like those on reddit who honestly think they are seeing things correctly because they use logical fallacies or they believe some of the false information like what i noticed a couple of times in this forum today.  it's hard enough to sort things out, but people like riemannszeros start spreading false information, making it even harder.  (see all my responses to him in here.  he claimed that nanothermite is not real.  he claimed that no war games took place on 9/11.)  this is how a snowjob works--an avalanche that buries people in the complexity of details and the emotions involved--mental turbulence.  it is so easy to be blinded by inattentional blindness.  if you don't focus on the basics--whether the scientific method is being used, whether logical fallacies are being made--then you really won't be able to see properly.",0,

393728,"this is a rant and a saga, so be warned. it's also more of a profile of a roommate than a specific story. i've been waiting to get this off my chest for a while. thanks dirtyd0ggy, for this opportunity. i'm almost tempted to use her real name since i know she doesn't reddit. but her friends may, so let's call her janet.  janet and my gf k and i all went to college together. i knew her slightly and through mutual friends, but my gf was friends with her until a falling out.  fast forward three-odd years later. my gf is in her last semester in the fall and her, janet and i are trying to find a new place. the falling out between the girls is forgotten. we find a place, it's a little crappy but with a nice yard and decent neighbors.  janet is older than us, and thinks she is far more mature and wise than us (me and my gf). this is not the case. she in fact has a drinking problem, and seems like she's burnt out from lsd or something (she's not, it's just drinking). it's also a mircale she's alive right now as she doesn't know how to store food properly and makes really stupid decisions all the time. so she's always convinced she's right about everything and extremely grown up and mature, when in fact she is childish, spoiled, and naive. so, as the year went by and she kept fucking up, she absolutely refused to acknowledge any mistake or apologize. here is a list of some of the things she did in no real order. some of them are anecdotes on their own.   * she broke a window one of our first days there by trying to force it open really stupidly. the windiow was ghetto, i'll give her that. it had clips at the bottom and top. but she took off the bottom clips and tried to twist it out of the frame. * i was almost late paying a utility bill one time and she flipped out at me, implying i was not responsible enough to handle the bills. then, several times throughout the year she spent so much money on booze that she would be late with the payments. i personally went to the america's cash express to pay the bills every time (postal service sucks in our city), and also personally delivered every rent check to our landlord (he was on the way to my office). she never once did these things and balked the few times we even suggested it. * she will deny to the death that she is well-off, but she was obviously from a wealthy family, and clearly from an even wealthier town. made for very groan-inducing comments and viewpoints from her.  * one time she referred to someone as a spic in front of me. i'm hispanic, and i informed her that what she just said was the equivalent of nigger or kike. she tried to argue with me that it was *not an offensive word, just a word used to describe a spanish hick*. i had to take her out of the room and explain to her that it was a racist term. she still argued back. so i basically told her that she was naive as shit and to never use that word around me again. the biggest issue here is that she is in denial about pretty much being white trash. she is convinced she has american indian blood in her, and that somehow makes her special and exotic. she also romanticizes always being mistaken for a jewish person. her racial identity issues were extremely annoying. * she would steal food all the time! she always has, especially takeout. i'm a big fan of over-ordering slightly so i have leftovers. many times i found the styrofoam boxes empty or mangled. i finally reamed her out about it at the end of the year while she was in a ghastly hung over state. she gave us a gift certificate to rita's. one time in college k left food in her room for a few hours, and told her she could have some of the candy but not the burrito. k returned to find all the candy and the entire burrito gone. no apology. * we drove her everywhere for about half a year. it made sense, cuz she didn't have a car and both k and i did. but it got old. she would always get embarassingly drunk at places, and we would end up wiping vomit from the side of our cars. when we asked her to drive us, she would avoid the question and suggest public transit. the once or twice she did offer to drive, she got drunk anyway, one time not telling us she was too fucked up to drive until after the ride. we stopped driving her about halfway through the year. when she got a car eventually, she never offered to drive us anywhere.  oh, no actually she did offer to drive us home once from a friend's house. but then she went to a bar and forgot. we had to get a ride from a friend who probably shouldn't have driven. * she started hooking up with k's ex boyfriend, ""n"". this in itself was theoretically fine. however, k's ex and k and my friend ""michi"" also got involved, and the three ended up having a wild threesome. we had to go upstairs and yell at them to stop pounding each other in the ground, since we slept below them and it was 5 in the morning. the same 3 radiohead songs had played for about 2 and a half hours at this point. it was extremely awkward, and our friend michi's sexual experience with janet prevented her from seeing what a pathetic dope she was for almost a year. only recently has michi admitted janet is a loser. * the way she hooked up with boys was deplorable. k's ex ""n"" that she and michi had a threesome with, for example, was ""too fat"" literally hours before the hookup. this was a theme. so and so is ""too fat"" for me. she was extremely shallow. our other friend ""aiden"" was also ""too fat"" for her. (for the record, none of these people are 'fat', they are just 25-year-olds who like beer). at a party however, she made out with him upstairs for about an hour. this was also fucked up because aiden was seeing one of janet's supposedly best friends on and off, and she clearly knew this. then, after climbing off of aiden, she started literally rolling around on the floor with ""max,"" who was ""n's"" best friend and both were in a band together. she had also stated that she would never hook up with max because he was weird. and he is. * she also is a shameless groupie and will fuck entire bands * she was horrible at taking care of pets. she had numerous ones in college who she failed to take care of and let run wild in her dorm room, and they all died, except for ""turtle,"" who she kept in a tank about 4 sizes to small for it. the turtle hated its life in the small tank and ate the other fish that were in there multiple times. on a whim she decided to get a chinchilla. she had no idea how to take care of the thing. k and i pretty much told her how to do it. janet always left the heater on so we would turn it off (chinchillas need cold). janet never gave the poor chinchilla enough dust baths, so k and i made sure we did. she ended up giving it away to some kid at our old college because she was too dumb to take care of it anymore. * also related, when k's cat was put down in our home by a vet, janet was blaring something absolutely retarded like ""rude boy"". we were too upset to ask her to turn it down as we watched the poor cat slip away. still can't believe she wouldn't have the sense to turn her music off. * one time she realized she overdrew her card at a bar. she goes to a bar pretty much every night. this night she decided to say ""fuck it!"" and let everyone she was with put as many drinks as they wanted on her card, since she planned to ditch it and just leave. too bad that doesn't work.  * she got so drunk at n and max's show that she got kicked out of the bar because she fell down so many times. we drove her home, she puked in and on k's car, and bitched about it the next day when we asked her to clean it. * during the blizzard we needed to hire a plow since we lived on a dead end. janet refused to pay for it even though our neighbors and k and i all threw in on it. * once in an email to her dad she referred to me as an adhd child with a short temper, and accidently sent it to me and k. she didn't really apologize for that and seemed to not really see why it was a problem she was smack-talking behind our backs to her dad. * one time early in the year a dude approached her after work. she took the bus. he was obviously just tryna holler, but she flipped out and screamed and ran away. that night she was horrifed and ""scared to sleep"" and borrowed k's axe to keep near her bed. within a week, she had decided that ""no one will rape me because i look like a strong woman."" she's maybe 5'8 and does have thick legs from running a lot, but this mentality was almost offensive. * she never did the dishes because she never had anything. all she ever ate was salads at restaurants and frozen veggies with kraft cheese melted on them. no wonder she always stole my takeout.  this isn't even everything by a long shot. recently she started hanging out a different crowd. apprently she and her new best friends were all fucking this one band. her new best friend is now dating the boy she wanted from this band, so now she's alienated from them. many of our friends have realized she sucks and has a severe drinking problem. she invites herself to our houses now that she's done with her new friends, but she alienated everyone so much that it's pathetic.  anyway, if i think of more i'll post em. man that felt good. fuck janet.",1,

225903,"edit: realized i wrote way too much without a tl;dr.  tl;dr:  come for the sites, stay for the women, leave for fear of bad drivers and creationists.  there are four moments so far where i feared for my life. in chronological order they are: 1. when i was 10 years old we lived in western germany. my father was a u.s. soldier stationed at a base that has since been turned over to the german armed forces.  a friend and i would ride our bikes throughout town getting lost and finding our way back home.  on one of our rides a local kid rode up next to us and started saying things like ""stupid americans,"" ""go home,"" and such.  we told him to fuck off and he did. a couple minutes later he was back with a large group of friends on bikes.  things get detailed here, but long-story-short, they forced us off our bikes and started kicking and beating us. at one point one of them sat on top of me and held a knife to my throat. someone kicked me in the head an i blacked out.  when i awoke i was in the hospital. my friend had got away and called our parents who called an ambulance.  please don't get the wrong message, germany is my favorite place to have resided so far. 2.  after germany i lived in southern virginia in a very small rural town.  at the time of this story i was 16.  i was a bit of a wise ass and through some means i had ended up pissing off the baseball team captain, who was dating the class president, whose dad was on the education board and was best friend's with the county sheriff. the sheriff was also one of our four vice-principals.  he pulled me out of class one day and called me into his office escorted by two deputies.  someone had made up a story about me vandalizing the class-president's car.  i denied the charge and the sheriff/ principal became very angry and loud.  at one point one of the deputies held my hands behind the chair and the sheriff threatened to hit me with this wooden apple paper weight.  i said i would just take the suspension.  i was scared not so much at the moment, but a few days later, a deputy pulled my car over and wrote me a ticket for having a light out. he then broke out my light. i shit you not! i was laughing a bit inside, but i was still scared. i was going to be harassed by police the rest of my stay in this shitty little town? my parents helped me find a lawyer and we threatened and things leveled out. i kept to myself for the next year and a half until i graduated and moved to nyc. 3. i moved to nyc on august 19, 2001, about three weeks prior to the wtc attacks.  new city, new culture, and now this. i lived on 23rd street in manhattan and was on my way to class when everything happened.  i saw the whole damn thing.  i didn't at first believe it was happening, but of course reality slapped me to consciousness.  my parents at the time were working in dc. my father was supposed to visit the white house ( i prefer not to say why ) and my mother's office was across the highway from the pentagon (the plane that hit flew over her office. that's my reason for never believing the conspiracies that it wasn't a plane that hit).  when the wtc towers went down everyone's cell phones stopped working and regular phones were all tied up.  i heard a woman yell out that the pentagon and white house were hit.  that was the point i knew this was an attack.  yes, i actually believed it was possible for two planes to accidentally hit both towers.  it was also at that point i went pale. i thought my parents were dead, or, if they weren't, they thought i was. 4.  now i'm 27 and live in brooklyn.  about seven months ago i was coming home late on the subway.  my neighborhood is a very quiet, small, safe little neighborhood.  as i got off the train a younger fellow got off with me.  as i was going up the station stairs i thought, gee, he's walking awfully close to me. i turned around and he had a small folding knife drawn and was looking right at me.  i just fucking ran.  i ran out the station and towards my block.  i was scared but i knew i was out pacing him because i had seen how he was dressed. he had his pants sagging and his sneakers untied.  i run often so i knew i was doing fine. i called my wife to unlock the downstairs door then go upstairs and lock herself up there.  i ran passed my street, around the block to lose the guy. i had no idea if he was even in site, he probably never even tried to catch up, i was just frightened.  got to my home, locked all the doors, got out a baseball bat and called the cops.  they said they could do nothing because the kid had actually done nothing.  i even gave them a very detailed description. dark hair, in long braids, light skin-tone, about 5'4"", sagging jeans, white unlaced sneakers, red adidas windbreaker with white stripes down the arms. i got all those details in the quick glance over my shoulder. so, is america scary?  at times, but i've heard some horror stories from my london friends ;)  please keep in mind that when reading fox news they love to scare you.  also, they are reporting on the country as a whole.  health care shouldn't scare you since you are not a citizen.  if you need emergency care, no one will turn you away because you don't have insurance.  it's only a problem for those who need long-term care.  our rights are disappearing slowly, but that's probably why we're not protesting (by the way, the lack of violent protests scares you?), but there's nothing i want to do that i am not able...yet.  i don't think our population is afraid so much as they just don't care.  as far as the economic situation, i can only speak for nyc.  i have a few friends who have been hit hard, but they work for the banks or on wall st.  everyone else is doing fine.  my landlord lowered rent when i talked about moving out.  i work for a very large research facility and, though we did lose a lot of money and and had to waive our annual cost-of-living raise, the center did not lay anyone off or cut anyone's salaries.  we did cancel a new building project though and lost about $640 million on the land deposit, about 15% of our annual earned income, which itself is about 60% of our total income. the rest comes from donations and grants. they expected to see a huge decline in donated funds, but surprisingly we did not! the job market here does suck.  not much to say about that. and i do feel some employers are taking advantage of that and working their employees too hard, knowing they won't quit. i'm okay with my life so far.  i work hard, i go to the gym, i paint, i play video games.  i was able to have a nice wedding, not over the top, but beautiful.  i give $20 out of every paycheck to charity, so i have a bit to spare, save and enjoy. i count myself lucky i wasn't born in somalia.  not an excuse to be apathetic, just can't say that my life should instill fear in anyone not from here.  the thing i fear more than anything else is traffic. truly. i am afraid of u.s. drivers.  if you come here, never expect a red light to mean traffic will stop. i am always nagging my wife about just trusting the walk signal and not actually looking before crossing the street.  and when we take a cab, i get onto her for not using the safety belt.  she does now, all the time, after i was in an accident two years ago, but i was afraid of cars long before that. something about a statistic i remember hearing as a kid, that every 30 seconds in the us some one dies in a car accident. if you're coming for a visit, you'll have fun.  trying to stay forever is the difficult part.  i like to visit places for interesting scenery and geological formations, and america has a lot of very neat things to see.  grand canyon, monument valley, badlands, just to name a few. i know a i wrote a lot of stuff here, but, though i am not happy with our government or crazy right-wing population, i am happy i am an american.",0,
211953,"&gt;why are we here talking about this, then?  because israel is using food as a weapon against a civilian population like myanmar does.  you approve of that because you were brought up in a culture which believes that palestenians are not human beings and therefore it's allowable to kill them, maim them, harvest their organs, and to starve them when they get uppity.  i don't approve of using food as a weapon and believe that palestenians are human beings who should be given all the rights that other human beings have the foremost of which is freedom.  it's just a cultural discussion. you are unable to understand my point of view because you were brought up a particular culture and i was brought up in the western culture.  your mother taught you one set of values, my mother taught me another.",0,

895137,"&gt; the point i was trying to make, was that those that use the teapot analogy to equate improbability with impossibility are using faulty logic (and if i was wrong about dawkins' usage, i stand corrected).  agreed, but that's not at all what richard dawkins said. you're making a strawman argument. if anything, richard dawkins several times acknowledges the unprovability of god.  &gt; russell's teapot demonstrates that the ubiquity of belief in god, as compared with belief in celestial teapots, does not shift the burden of proof in logic, although it may seem to shift it as a matter of practical politics. that you **cannot prove** god's non existence is **accepted** and trivial, if only in the sense that we can never absolutely prove the non-existence of anything. what matters is not whether god is disprovable (**he isn't**) but whether his existence is *probable*. this is another matter. some undisprovable things are sensibly judged far less probable than other undisprovable things. there is no reason to regard god as immune from consideration along the spectrum of probabilities. and there is certainly no reason to suppose that, just because god can be neither proved nor **disproved**, his probability of existence is 50 per cent. on the contrary, as we shall see.    -- **richard dawkins**, the god delusion, chapter ""the god hypothesis"". a few pages after he describes his spectrum of theistic probability. emphasis, mine.  *edit*: formatting  *edit2*:  &gt; edit : i'd say i'm a 4 on the tps.  why do you believe that the probability of god existing is exactly 50% while, at the same time, believing (i'm guessing) that the probability of zeus existing is far lower? or do you believe that the existence of zeus is just as likely to be true as not?",0,

124694,"continued:  ""just as street signs are missing all over this town, so too are the numbers on houses.  we took our best guess, and hm rapped on the door with his swollen knuckles.  a watery-eyed, mouth-breathing kid with a look of mr of about 16 answered the door. he had on tighty whitey briefs, and to my extreme discomfort, he was standing a few feet above us so that his groin was almost eye level with us.  he had a raging erection, pointing right at my face.  hm couldn’t hold his laugh back once it started.  the more he tried to hold it in, the worse it got.  he finally threw his hands in front of his face and turned back towards the street.  i turned around, “what the fuck, man?!”  “no, sorry, man.  it mus be nex’ door.”  we both turned toward the other half of the shotgun, and the door was already opening.  i couldn’t see through the threshold, but hm had stopped laughing.  his face looked pretty serious and paled a little bit. my stomach dropped and i could almost taste bacon and eggs planning a revolt.   …………… you ever been in a car accident?  doesn’t have to be anything too grand.  even a fender bender will do.  you’re driving along all calm and collected.  you are practically meditating behind the wheel.  then bam!  everything slows down to an impossible time.  your organs feel like they are suspended in jelly.  you can actually feel the surge of adrenaline as it passes though your blood vessels. you feel about the same thing when somebody fires a gun at you.  ……………… i’m down on the ground in rainwater and piss, scrambling frantically away from the front steps.  i hear people shouting all around me, but i can’t make out the words.  i don’t think i can breathe.  i think of a woman’s face, looking at me longingly.  the image is inappropriate and horribly unrealistic security blanket.  i wish i were holding her in her bed right now under the soft blue glow of light radiating from walls painted white.  instead, i can hear the guns bark and the bullets whizz overhead.  all this as i try to will my body into the wet ground alongside the old mazda on the broken remnants of a driveway.   hm calls out from somewhere hundreds of miles away in a guttural bark.  “we’re not fucking cops…we just want to talk!”  his voice sounds possessed and like it’s been filtered through an old record player at a low rpm. another pair of deafeningly loud shots bangs out, and the air screams a hiss as it’s pulled into the vortex behind the speeding, spiraling lead. with the house fire a few blocks away, there are enough cops around, but with all the racket of sirens and people, i wouldn’t be surprised if no one heard the barks from the guns, even though it sounds like tank fire this close to me.  i could have been in the office today.   “ok, ok, fuck talking!  we just wanna go back to the car and leave!!”  hm is laughing like a movie villain who’s enjoying his spiral into manic depravity.  he fires a quick set of shots at the front door.  his gun roars like a howitzer fired by thor.  his hollow-point .44 mag rounds explode into the house and tear enormous, fist-sized chunks from the front steps and doorframe. i have no idea who is in the house; i can’t see anyone.  i’m not sure if hm is shooting at someone or just letting loose for the hell of it.   my own gun is somehow in my hand, and it might as well weigh a ton.  i feel like it could drop from my hand at any moment.  my grip feels weak, but i clutch it like a protective talisman.  each raindrop that strikes my face feels like an open hand slap. i could age twenty years in the next fifteen seconds, and i wouldn’t notice.  i raise my face, fearing that it could get wiped off my skull with less effort than it takes to draw a breath.  i crawl on my belly towards the tires of the jeep.  a home is still burning somewhere.  i need to let my cat back in.  my parking tickets are going to go up by $40 each if i don’t pay them by thursday.  ………………..  “hey, man!! you ok?!!” hm calls out to me.  “yeah, i’m ok…i pissed my pants.”  there is a slight pause.    “i’m gonna toss you my keys.  start her up so we can get out of here.  i’ll cover you.  keep your head down.  got it?”  “yeah, man.  i got it.  ready.”  my voice doesn’t sound like my own; it sounds like my father’s voice talking to my playground football coaches when i was little – too deep and bigger than my body feels.   there is no movement or sound from the front door.  in all likeliness, the guy has probably run out the back door.  hm yells out ""checking"", and i respond the same.  his keys land in the puddle next to me.  i grab them and crawl through the passenger door and onto the driver seat. hm lets off two more shots.  inside the car, i realize that i can’t hear anything out of my left ear.  when that front door opened, i had turned my face back towards the gunman's loaded .357 snub.  i dove right almost immediately, and that first shot could have easily taken my head off.  i’m lucky to only be deaf.  i think that’s when i pissed myself.  as the adrenaline levels out, i realized i jammed a few fingers and sprained my elbow when i dove off the stoop.  i fumble with the keys, drop them once, then start the jeep and pull up behind the pontiac hm is crouching behind.  i’m laid across the seat, using my hands to shift, push the peddles, and steer.  i could not do this again if paid, and i will never know where this ability came from.  i grab the wheel with my left hand and pull myself across the slick pleather seats; the rainwater soaking my clothes makes the slide easy.  i pull myself upright in the driver’s seat.  hm crawls in, and with my head still tucked almost beneath the dashboard, i floor it down the street.   i drive about five blocks and turn right.  i go about three more blocks, and hm says “pull over.”  he opens the door and vomits onto the street.  i’d been waiting to do the same, and i open my door and let loose. “you ok?” i croak.   “yeah, you?”  “i’m alright. i think i broke some fingers.”  my right hand is throbbing and both are trembling like i’m detoxing.   we sit on the side of the street for a few minutes.  hm takes a bottle of jameson from the back seat and has a long pull.  i smoke a cigarette and puke once more.  then i eat a handful of vicodin and wrap my fingers in medical tape. hm hands me a clean bar rag to wipe my face.  we sit with our legs hanging out the jeep for a few minutes, and then i let hm have the driver’s seat.  he glances at the seat briefly, makes a face, then shrugs with an “aw fuck it” as he climbs in.   “i guess we should we report this?” i ask.  “yeah.  i will. later.”  he puts in a fresh plug of dip and stares off into nowhere.  “i gotta let blake know bout this at least, and he’ll get some cops out here.  guy’s prolly long gone, at least for now.  and fuck...i shot my gun. a lot. even reloaded twice. gotta report that.” he spits.  “but later.  you ready to call it a day?”  “uh, yeah.  can we get fucked up now?”  “i’m already on that.” he says, taking another pull of whiskey. “them vicodin wasn’t a good start for ya?”  “i’m thinking a ‘bar’ would be a good idea…you got any xanax?”   “yeah, i got some a them lil purple footballs in the glove compartment… the pill bottle without the label.” he spits again.   with a pill between my lips, i fish for my water bottle and ask, “you think we did any good today?”  “sure. i mean, i guess. but hell man, what’s good an’ bad here?  ain’t that black and white. but yeah. small victories man.  an’ fuck, we’re still alive. that always counts fer somethin.”  i'm smile, weakly, “yeah. i feel it more now than i have in months.”  “good. ready to roll?”   “yep,” i say, “but i’m gonna need some new pants.""",0,

590129,"&gt; well, if you are being treated unfairly by your countrymen because of your accent then i am truly sorry - that sucks.  i don't have an accent. i don't know how to fluently speak any language other than english. the shit i get is people making fun of an accent i don't have based on the way i look, which if you've been keeping score, is the entire point: koreans don't have a japanese accent, so to poke fun at a korean person by doing a japanese accent joke is racist.  &gt; from where i am sitting i just see someone who makes a big thing out of something that in my opinion is innocent fun between reasonable and responsible adults.  i'm sure that's what plenty of well meaning white people said when they made an off-handed joke about 'coloured folk'.  &gt; asians are on average more intelligent than caucasians.   regardless of whether or not this is true (which i don't think it is. asian parents tend to reinforce education and studiousness as positive values and their children tend to adopt that ethos. they aren't naturally smarter, they just work harder), i'm not sure i get how this is relevant.  &gt; pronunciation is a common form of ridicule - across all different cultures. i just cannot really see how ridiculing someone's pronunciation is racism.  because not all 'asians' sound the same, and to mock a race of people by using one ethnic subset of that's race's accent is racist. fuck, i feel like i'm slamming my head against a brick wall here. what's not to get? **the choice and use of the mocking accent is based on the fucking race, the physical attibutes of the person, not their actual pronunciation**. read that again and again until you understand the racist aspect of it.  &gt; you may very well be suffering under actual racism.   it's honestly not something i come across in my day to day life any more, but it is something that i've dealt with. i don't think it's fair to the other people who are actually suffering under real subjugation to say that i suffer under racism. the society i live in is rather tolerant and accepting, but there is a passive undercurrent of racism against all non-white foreigners here - i just thank god that all this terrorism crap has given the media and the general australian public a new 'evil immigrant race' to hate on. ten, twenty years ago here, asians were treated then how muslims are being treated now.  &gt; are you worried at all that perhaps racism is an easy scapegoat for other problems that are more complicated or more personal than just your appearance and how you speak?  not really, as it is something i rarely, if ever invoke. let's set the books straight though, just for now - my mother is english, my father, chinese. i'm half cast and don't look overly asian, and certainly don't sound it. i don't use racism as a scapegoat, i don't use it at all, but that doesn't mean i don't call a spade a spade when i see one. which leads me to:  &gt;from where i am sitting i just see someone who makes a big thing out of something that in my opinion is innocent fun between reasonable and responsible adults.  of course you don't see the harm, because you don't know the history behind it's usage. look it up on wiki or a more substantial source and you'll be greeted with a wealth of information. you wouldn't see the harm in the word 'nigger' unless you knew it's roots, the history behind it and what it was used as. the 'offence' comes from the history of segregation that is associated with the word, the connotations behind it formed alongside it's use as a derogatory racist word. so too, does l/r swapping or 'ching chong' speak have it's own history as tool of oppression. i'm not asking you to suddenly change your opinions on it, but to appreciate that to some other people it's pretty offensive. if it's hard to get, keep equating it to the word nigger, something you understand the negative usage of well, and see if you can make light of that word as one responsible, reasonable person whose never suffered under it to another.  anyway, as i said, i'm not offended or hurt by anything on reddit or anything you said. i have thick skin, son. i'm not sure anything anybody could type into a keyboard is capable of affecting me emotionally. what i find entirely more frustrating is trying to get a point across and having people consistently not understand what i saying.",0,

892723,"on the sixth of january, what moved the entire population of paris was the double solemnity, as jehan de troyes describes it, united from time immemorial, of the epiphany and the festival of fools. on that day there were to be fireworks on the place de grève, a may tree planted at the chapel of braque, and a play performed at the palace of justice. proclamation had been made to this effect on the preceding day, to the sound of trumpets in the public squares, by the provost’s officers in fair coats of purple camlet, with large white crosses on the breast.  that morning, therefore, all the houses and shops remained shut, and crowds of citizens of both sexes could be seen wending their way toward one of the three places mentioned above. each person had made a choice, for fireworks, may tree, or play. it must be observed, however, to the credit of the taste of parisian riffraff, that the greater part of the crowd was proceeding toward the fireworks, which were quite appropriate to the season, or the play, which was to be represented in the great hall of the palace, which was well covered and protected, and that the curious agreed to let the poor leafless may tree shiver all alone beneath a january sky in the cemetery of the chapel of braque.  all the avenues leading to the palace of justice were particularly crowded, because it was known that the flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days before, planned to attend the performance of the play, and the election of the pope of fools, which was also to take place in the great hall.  on that day, it was no easy matter to get into this great hall, though it was then reputed to be the largest covered space in the world. (it is true that sauval had not yet measured the great hall of the château of montargis.) to the spectators at the windows, the palace yard crowded with people looked like a sea, into which five or six streets, like the mouths of so many rivers, disgorged their living streams. the waves of this sea, incessantly swelled by new arrivals, broke against the corners of the houses, projecting here and there like promontories into the irregular basin on the square. in the center of the lofty gothic facade of the palace, the crowds moved relentlessly up and down the grand staircase in a double current interrupted by the central landing, and they poured incessantly into the square like a cascade into a lake. the cries, the laughter, and the trampling of thousands of feet produced a great din and clamor. from time to time this clamor and noise were redoubled; the current that propelled the crowd toward the grand staircase turned back, grew agitated, and whirled around. sometimes it was a push made by an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants kicking and plunging to restore order—an admirable tradition, which the provosty bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the maréchaussée, and the maréchaussée to the present gendarmerie of paris.  at doors, windows, garret windows, on the rooftops of the houses, swarmed thousands of calm and honest bourgeois faces gazing at the palace and at the crowd, and desiring nothing more; for most of the good people of paris are quite content with the sight of the spectators; a blank wall, behind which something or other is going forward, is to us an object of great curiosity.  if we could, mortals living in this year of 1830, imagine ourselves mixed up with those fifteenth-century parisians, and if we could enter with them, shoved, elbowed, hustled, that immense hall of the palace so tightly packed, on the sixth of january, 1482, the sight would not be lacking in interest or in charm; and all that we should see around us would be so ancient as to appear absolutely new. if the reader pleases, we will endeavor to retrace in imagination the impressions that one would have experienced with us on crossing the threshold of the great hall, in the midst of this motley crowd, coated, gowned, or clothed in the paraphernalia of office.  in the first place, how one’s ears are stunned by the noise! how one’s eyes are dazzled! overhead is a double roof of pointed arches, with carved wainscoting, painted sky blue, and studded with golden fleurs-de-lis; underfoot, a pavement of alternate squares of black and white marble. a few paces from us stands an enormous pillar, then another, and another; in all, seven pillars, intersecting the hall longitudinally, and supporting the thrust of the double-vaulted roof. around the first four pillars are shops, glittering with glass and jewelery; and around the other three, oak benches worn and polished by the hosiery of the plaintiffs and the gowns of the attorneys. along the lofty walls, between the doors, between the windows, between the pillars, is ranged the interminable series of all the kings of france ever since pharamond: the indolent kings with pendant arms and downcast eyes; the valiant and warlike kings with heads and hands boldly raised toward heaven. the tall, pointed ogival windows are glazed with panes of a thousand hues; for exits there are rich doors, finely carved. the whole thing—ceiling, pillars, walls, wainscot, doors, statues—is covered from top to bottom with beautiful blue and gold paint, which was already somewhat faded at the time we are looking at it. it was almost entirely buried in dust and cobwebs in the year of grace 1549, when du breul still admired it by tradition.  now imagine that immense oblong hall, illuminated by the pale light of a january day, invaded by a motley and noisy crowd, pouring in along the walls and circling the pillars, and you will have a faint idea of the general whole of the picture, the curious details of which we shall endeavor to sketch in more precisely.  it is certain that if ravaillac had not assassinated henry iv there would have been no documents of his trial deposited in the rolls office of the palace of justice, and no accomplices interested in the destruction of those documents; consequently no obligatory fire, for lack of better means, to burn the rolls office in order to burn the documents, and to burn the palace of justice in order to burn the rolls office; therefore, there would have been no fire in 1618. the old palace would still be standing with its old great hall; and i might then say to the reader, “go, look at it,” and thus we should both be spared trouble, myself the trouble of writing, and the reader that of perusing, a banal description. this demonstrates the novel truth—that great events have incalculable consequences.  it is, indeed, possible that ravaillac had no accomplices and that even if he did, these accomplices had no hand in the fire of 1618. there are two other plausible explanations: first, the great “star of fire, a foot broad, and a foot and a half high,” which fell, as everybody knows, from the sky onto the palace on the seventh of march, after midnight; second, this stanza of théophile.  certes, ce fut un triste jeu, quand à paris dame justice, pour avoir mangé trop d’épice, se mit tout le palais en feu.",0,
356936,"i had never even seen a shooting star before. 25 years of rotations, passes through comets' paths, and travel, and to my memory i had never witnessed burning debris scratch across the night sky. radiohead were hunched over their instruments. thom yorke slowly beat on a grand piano, singing, eyes closed, into his microphone like he was trying to kiss around a big nose. colin greenwood tapped patiently on a double bass, waiting for his cue. white pearls of arena light swam over their faces. a lazy disco light spilled artificial constellations inside the aluminum cove of the makeshift stage. the metal skeleton of the stage ate one end of florence's piazza santa croce, on the steps of the santa croce cathedral. michelangelo's bones and cobblestone laid beneath. i stared entranced, soaking in radiohead's new material, chiseling each sound into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only sound system for the material for months.  the butterscotch lamps along the walls of the tight city square bled upward into the cobalt sky, which seemed as strikingly artificial and perfect as a wizard's cap. the staccato piano chords ascended repeatedly. ""black eyed angels swam at me,"" yorke sang like his dying words. ""there was nothing to fear, nothing to hide."" the trained critical part of me marked the similarity to coltrane's ""ole."" the human part of me wept in awe.  the italians surrounding me held their breath in communion (save for the drunken few shouting ""criep!""). suddenly, a rise of whistles and orgasmic cries swept unfittingly through the crowd. the song, ""egyptian song,"" was certainly momentous, but wasn't the response more apt for, well, ""creep?"" i looked up. i thought it was fireworks. a teardrop of fire shot from space and disappeared behind the church where the syrupy river arno crawled. radiohead had the heavens on their side.  for further testament, chip chanko and i both suffered auto-debilitating accidents in the same week, in different parts of the country, while blasting ""airbag"" in our respective japanese imports. for months, i feared playing the song about car crashes in my car, just as i'd feared passing 18- wheelers after nearly being crushed by one in 1990. with good reason, i suspect radiohead to possess incomprehensible powers. the evidence is only compounded with kid a-- the rubber match in the band's legacy-- an album which completely obliterates how albums, and radiohead themselves, will be considered.  even the heralded ok computer has been nudged down one spot in valhalla. kid a makes rock and roll childish. considerations on its merits as ""rock"" (i.e. its radio fodder potential, its guitar riffs, and its hooks) are pointless. comparing this to other albums is like comparing an aquarium to blue construction paper. and not because it's jazz or fusion or ambient or electronic. classifications don't come to mind once deep inside this expansive, hypnotic world. ransom, the philologist hero of c.s. lewis' out of the silent planet who is kidnapped and taken to another planet, initially finds his scholarship useless in his new surroundings, and just tries to survive the beautiful new world.  this is an emotional, psychological experience. kid a sounds like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. it's the sound of a band, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. in other words, radiohead hated being radiohead, but ended up with the most ideal, natural radiohead record yet.  ""everything in its right place"" opens like close encounters spaceships communicating with pipe organs. as your ears decide whether the tones are coming or going, thom yorke's cuisinarted voice struggles for its tongue. ""everything,"" yorke belts in uplifting sighs. the first-person mantra of ""there are two colors in my head"" is repeated until the line between yorke's mind and the listener's mind is erased.  skittering toy boxes open the album's title song, which, like the track ""idioteque,"" shows a heavy warp records influence. the vocoder lullaby lulls you deceivingly before the riotous ""national anthem."" mean, fuzzy bass shapes the spine as unnerving theremin choirs limn. brash brass bursts from above like terry gilliam's animated foot. the horns swarm as yorke screams, begs, ""turn it off!"" it's the album's shrill peak, but just one of the incessant goosebumps raisers.  after the rockets exhaust, radiohead float in their lone orbit. ""how to disappear completely"" boils down ""let down"" and ""karma police"" to their spectral essence. the string-laden ballad comes closest to bridging yorke's lyrical sentiment to the instrumental effect. ""i float down the liffey/ i'm not here/ this isn't happening,"" he sings in his trademark falsetto. the strings melt and weep as the album shifts into its underwater mode. ""treefingers,"" an ambient soundscape similar in sound and intent to side b of bowie and eno's low, calms after the record's emotionally strenuous first half.  the primal, brooding guitar attack of ""optimistic"" stomps like mating tyrannosaurs. the lyrics seemingly taunt, ""try the best you can/ try the best you can,"" before revealing the more resigned sentiment, ""the best you can is good enough."" for an album reportedly ""lacking"" in traditional radiohead moments, this is the best summation of their former strengths. the track erodes into a light jam before morphing into ""in limbo."" ""i'm lost at sea,"" yorke cries over clean, uneasy arpeggios. the ending flares with tractor beams as yorke is vacuumed into nothingness. the aforementioned ""idioteque"" clicks and thuds like aphex twin and bjork's homogenic, revealing brilliant new frontiers for the ""band."" for all the noise to this point, it's uncertain entirely who or what has created the music. there are rarely traditional arrangements in the ambiguous origin. this is part of the unique thrill of experiencing kid a.  pulsing organs and a stuttering snare delicately propel ""morning bell."" yorke's breath can be heard frosting over the rainy, gray jam. words accumulate and stick in his mouth like eye crust. ""walking walking walking walking,"" he mumbles while jonny greenwood squirts whale-chant feedback from his guitar. the closing ""motion picture soundtrack"" brings to mind the white album, as it somehow combines the sentiment of lennon's lp1 closer-- the ode to his dead mother, ""julia""-- with ringo and paul's maudlin, yet sincere lp2 finale, ""goodnight."" pump organ and harp flutter as yorke condones with affection, ""i think you're crazy."" to further emphasize your feeling at that moment and the album's overall theme, yorke bows out with ""i will see you in the next life."" if you're not already there with him.  the experience and emotions tied to listening to kid a are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on imax. it's an album of sparking paradox. it's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet 48 minutes. it will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior albums clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. the harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. when the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men (nigel godrich included) created this, it's clear that radiohead must be the greatest band alive, if not the best since you know who. breathing people made this record! and you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over. lol",0,

164076,"**sterile: part vii**  the endless blanket of snow stretched out before us, covering the dead planet.  karen put her gloved hand in mine and said, “it looks just the way it used to.”  from in front of us chen said, “i don’t remember it looking this clean.”  he was right; without plant or animal life, or manmade pollutants in the air, the snow looked clean and fresh-fallen even weeks after a storm.    behind us, our tracks traced a long line back to where our beloved minivan lay stuck in the snow.  i looked down at my feet.  the handsome snow boots were lightweight and tough.  a tag on the laces had said that they were rated for climbing everest.  latched to the boots were snowshoe attachments, keeping us comfortably on the skin of the heavy snow. we were all wearing the best snow gear that money couldn’t buy.    chen was carrying a light backpack and rifle.  i had an assault rifle slung over my shoulder as did karen.  it was the first time in years that we had bothered to take them out for an excursion.  we maintained them regularly and sometimes we would do a little target practice for kicks.  this was the first time since the whole ordeal began that we actually believed we may need to use them for something other than entertainment.  chen stopped and turned around.  he was looking thoughtfully at the minivan.  “we should go back and get the fuel canisters,” he said.  “why?” asked karen.  “we’re not going to find a car capable of driving through *this*.”  she was right.  the snow was at least a 14 inches deep.  chen shook his head, “we can find some snowmobiles.  it would save us hours of walking.”  in past winters we’d had a good deal of luck finding snow mobiles that operated without the aide of computer chips.  years ago we had even rigged trailer to hold several of them, but eventually we opted to leave them somewhere out east- maybe even at the whitehouse?  we’d definitely stayed there during the winter…  karen squeezed my hand and brought me out of my reverie.  “yeah,” i said, “let’s bring the gas.  there’s a town two miles ahead.  we’ll be able to find something.”  we all backtracked a ways before the voice spoke up, “you’re going the wrong way, kyle.”  the voice hadn’t spoken in hours.  it had been gracious enough to keep the conversation to a minimum ever since i explained that it was causing me emotional distress.  when it spoke to me now, it was a new sensation.  the voice no longer had the auditory quality that i had grown accustomed to.  now it seemed to exist only as verbal thoughts.  my ears registered no sound- it was akin to my own inner monologue, and it played out the way that words do when one reads to oneself.  i realized that it if the trend continued, i may not be able to distinguish my own thoughts from those of the voice.  ‘we’re just getting supplies from the car,’ i thought, ‘they will let us reach you faster.’  “understood,” the voice replied.  karen, chen and i each grabbed a large gasoline canister and trudged onward.  we were all in good shape, so the heavy containers hardly even slowed us down.    i wondered if the gasoline would still have enough kick to get a snowmobile going.  these canisters had been refilled more than six months ago.  as always, we had added stabilizers to give the gasoline a longer lifespan, but at this late date it was getting harder to find gasoline stores that hadn’t gone hopelessly stale.  ---  when we arrived in the town center we made a quick pass down the main thoroughfare.  we stopped in an interesting looking gourmet food shop.  inside the smell was terrible.  chen coughed, and said “something in here went rancid.”  karen was unfazed and she walked around to the back of the main display case, stepping over a corpse in a process.  she reached in a pulled out several interesting looking cheeses that were nicely wrapped, and small enough for convenient storage in our packs.  i noticed some good looking sausages hanging in the window and cut down a couple of each variety.  ‘enough of this.  time to move,’ i thought.  or was it the voice?  i headed out the door while karen and chen continued to stock up on supplies.  i saw a small car lot up ahead, and went to check out the inventory.  it was tough to tell under all the snow, but i didn’t see any snowmobiles.  i clicked my walkie-talkie on.  “i’m going up… uh… spring street.  i’m going to see if any of the locals have snowmobiles.”  twenty seconds later chen came back with, “rodger that.  we’ll look around too.”  i wondered if they would, or if they’d use the opportunity to have a quickie somewhere.  i wish i hadn’t seen chen with her.  i didn’t need that in my head right now.  i saw a side street with some nice big houses on it, and made my way up the nearest driveway.  it only took me a minute to find a small rock.  i used it to smash window and gain entry into the house.  it was dark inside.  i reached into my pocket and pulled a headlamp over my ski cap.  turning on the beam, i was immediately startled by movement to my left.  i jumped a little before i realized that i was seeing my own reflection in an elegant mirror.  i was at once relieved and saddened at yet another reminder that the planet was dead.  except it wasn’t really dead anymore, was it?  that foreign red goo was covering the ocean, and reengineering our atmosphere.  i quickly made my way into the attached garage.  no snowmobiles in here, but i did find a crowbar.  i walked over to the far wall to grab it, and realizing that i was stepping on something soft, looked down to see a dead raccoon- interesting.  crowbar in hand i dashed from house to house breaking in and ignoring all the cat and dog carcasses along the way.  at the sixth house i found a large, handsome looking snowmobile under a fitted dust cover.  there was a canister of fuel next to it.  i unscrewed the cap and sniffed lightly.  it smelled sour.  no good.  my own fuel canister was back in front of the gourmet food shop.  i called chen on the walkie-talkie.  “hey guys- i’ve got one up here.  first left off of spring street.  if you’re close, can you bring some fuel?”  i started dragging the vehicle out into the street before chen sent an acknowledgement.  from my bag i withdrew a small fuel pump, and inserting a hose into the snowmobile’s gas tank, i began to empty the stale fuel into the street.  i hoped that there wasn’t too much gunk sitting at the bottom of the tank.  it was about 20 minutes before chen and karen showed up carrying all our fuel.  i was already breaking into more houses hoping to find a second snowmobile.  i emerged from another disappointing garage in time to see chen dumping a few gallons into the one i’d prepared.  i didn’t see karen until i heard a window being smashed across the street.  i had moved on to yet another house when i heard the sound of the gas motor growling out into the still afternoon air.  it was a fairly healthy sound.  thank god.  the voice said we still had about 20 miles to go.  i didn’t feel like walking the whole way.  ten minutes later karen announced over the radio that she had found two snowmobiles in someone’s backyard.  that was considerably less promising than a vehicle that had been protected in a garage for years, but when chen and i got there they looked to be in good condition.  a quick search of the house revealed the ignition keys stowed in a kitchen cabinet.  and after pumping out the fuel tanks, and adding some of our slightly more promising gasoline, we tested out both snowmobiles.  one of them started cleanly- the other made some unhealthy sounds, and ultimately we decided that it wasn’t going anywhere.  “fuck it,” said chen, and he set up the pump to reclaim our good fuel.  karen nodded.  “this is good.  we’ll share the working ones and have some fuel to spare.”  with chen’s back turned, and his mind on the fuel line, i kissed karen sweetly for her optimism.  she kissed me back harder than i was expecting.  then we both pulled away before chen could notice our silence.  i walked back to the snowmobile i had salvaged and gave it a test run up and down the street.  it was obnoxiously loud, but great fun.  i was considering whether i could afford to waste any more gas with another lap when chen and karen jetted down the driveway and met me on the street.  “fun’s over,” said karen.  she was sitting on the seat, cozy next to chen, her arms wrapped around his belly.  i had flash of jealously.    ‘what’s wrong?’ said the voice.  or maybe i was asking myself.  it was so hard to tell now.  “let’s get moving,” i said.  without even thinking about it, i knew which direction to go.",0,

372003,"what you just said does nothing to explain why the pain and suffering is necessary.   you say we will view it as being minor in hindsight.  you also choose the convenient pain and suffering of childbirth which is temporary and yields potentially a lifetime of joy, if you can even call childbirth pain and suffering to begin with.  what about the unnecessary pain and suffering of a half decade of cancer followed by death?  what about the pain and suffering of living in a war-zone or amidst a genocide.  why aids, ever, for any reason?  comparing childbirth to actual pain and suffering is naïve and completely insulting to those who actually suffer.  give your ""can't have some of the clothes they think are cool"" speech to a starving child and see how much comfort it provides.  some of the cool clothes!? some!? how about no cool clothes.  how about no food or clothes at all?  i know you were just making a metaphor, but the terms you used highlight an insultingly sheltered concept of pain and suffering and sacrifice.  the sermon you just provided was about as philosophically empty and ignorant to the realities of life as anything i've ever heard come out of a white pastor's mouth back when i lived in missouri.  sorry if i sound harsh, but i find your apologetics and examples to be insulting to the concepts of pain and suffering.  childbirth is a joy.  clothes are a privilege.  being upset about not having cool clothes is reprehensible behavior, not suffering, and should not have even been used in metaphor.  despite how well what you said may have sounded within the range of suffering you have experienced in your life, and the conclusion that it gives you perspective; i doubt a starved infant corpse in africa will have appreciated that it gained perspective.  the fact that you bothered to write anything you wrote above hints that you actually have limited perspective.   everything you said also hinges on the concept that your memories and personality will somehow outlast your material brain, which should be patently absurd to any modern adult; and if you don't see why, then there is no point in discussing this further with you.  which i don't plan on doing anyway, since what you said only makes sense if pain is temporary and minor, a magical place exists where you will be happy after you die.   i apologize if you are in fact a starving child in africa who has aids and is possibly missing limbs to the sting of a machete blade.  in which case i thank you for writing your comment in such a way as to appeal to this middle class audience which has no concept of what you go through as they read this on their computers with their full bellies in their comfortable homes with their cool clothes.  for your sake, i hope that the bronze age concept of a sky wizard in the clouds is more than just a wish for a light at the end of the tunnel.  regardless, i'm sure the context you used will make them feel warm and fuzzy.",0,
560828,"inside the parliament square kettle  posted by laurie penny - 10 december 2010 15:59, new statesman magazine, london, uk.  the supposed heart of british democracy has become a searing wound of rage and retribution.  there is blood on my face, but not all of it is mine. i'm writing this from the ucl occupation, where injured students and schoolchildren keep drifting in in ones and twos, dazed and bruised, looking for medical attention and a safe space to sit down. it's a little like a field hospital, apart from the people checking twitter for updates on the demonstration i've just returned from, where 30,000 young people marched to whitehall, got stopped, and surged through police lines into parliament square.  they came to protest against the tuition fees bill that was hauled through the house yesterday by a fractured and divided coalition government. they believe that parliamentary democracy has failed them, that the state has set its face against them. when they arrived at parliament square, they found themselves facing a solid wall of metal cages guarded by armed police.  then the crackdown began, and it was worse than we feared. as i write, a young man called alfie is in hospital after a police beating which left him bleeding into his brain, and all the press can talk about is the fact that a middle-aged couple -- one of whom happens to be the heir to the throne -- escaped entirely uninjured from some minor damage done to their motorcade. the government will no doubt be able to find the money to repair the royal rolls royce, but yesterday it declared itself unable to afford to repair the damage done to these young people's future.  a kind father of one of the protesters has brought in a vat of soup; i'm slurping it and trying to stop my hands from shaking. two hours ago i was staring into the hooves of a charging police horse before a cop grabbed me by the neck and tossed me back into a screaming crowd of children, and the adrenaline hasn't worn off.  behind me, on huge makeshift screens showing the rolling news, reporters and talking heads are praising the police and condemning the actions of young protesters as 'an insult to democracy'. but when you see children stumbling and bleeding from baton wounds and reeling from horse charges underneath the glowering auspices of former prime ministers carved in bronze, when you see police medics stretchering an unconscious girl away from the grass in front of westminster abbey, her pale head swaddled in bloody bandages and hanging at a nauseating angle, you have to ask to whom the real insult has been delivered.  what i saw a month ago at millbank was a generation of very young, very angry, very disenfranchised people realising that not doing as you're told, contrary to everything we've been informed, is actually a very effective way of making your voice heard when the parliamentary process has let you down. what i saw two weeks ago in the whitehall kettle was those same young people learning that if you choose to step out of line you will be mercilessly held back and down by officers of the law who are quite prepared to batter kids into a bloody mess if they deem it necessary. what i saw today was something different, something bigger: no less than the democratic apparatus of the state breaking down entirely.  in parliament square, huge bonfires are burning as the young protesters in front of the horse lines at westminster abbey struggle against a new punishment tactic the police seem to have developed: crushing already kettled protesters back and down with riot shields. i find myself caught at the front of the line, squeezed and clamped between the twisting bodies of terrified kids, and my feet are swept from under me as the kids at the front tumble to the ground.  we all go down together, horses looming above us, baton blows still coming down on our heads and shoulders. i am genuinely afraid that i might be about to die, and begin to thumb in my parents' mobile numbers on my phone to send them a message of love.  on top of me, a pretty blonde seventeen-year-old is screaming, tears streaming down her battered face as she yells abuse at the police. the protesters begin to yell ""shame on you!"", but even in the heat of battle, these young people quickly remember what's really at stake in this movement. ""we are fighting for your children!"" they chant at the line of cops. ""we are fighting for your jobs!""  i struggle to my feet just in time to see a young man in a wheelchair being batoned. disabled jody mcintyre is dragged screaming out of his wheelchair when the police realise that photos are being taken, and shunted behind the riot lines as an even younger man who was pushing the chair shrieks ""where are you taking my brother?"". then, for some reason, the police decide to attack the empty wheelchair whilst jody's brother is still steering it, perhaps in a cartoonish attempt to destroy the evidence.  the protest was never supposed to make it to parliament square. desperate not to be kettled again, the young people who marched out of schools and workplaces and occupied universities all over the city veered away from several attempted containments and diverted into side streets, determined to make it to the seat of government to make their voices heard. when they got there they broke down the barriers surrounding the symbolic heart of the mother of parliaments and surged into the square for a huge party, dancing to dubstep, the soundtrack of this organic youth revolution. besides the apocalyptic bonfires and thudding drums in the containment area, dazed and battered protesters share out rolling tobacco and carby snacks. ""hey, look at this!"" giggles one girl, ""i'm eating kettle chips in a kettle!""  this time, unlike the first three big days of action, there certainly is violence on both sides. whilst some students came prepared, even bringing a portable tea-and-cake tent complete with minature pagoda to the kettle, others have brought sticks and paint bombs to hurl at the police. in the face of fellow protesters screaming at them not to ""give the coppers a reason to hit us"", stones are thrown at horses as angry young people try to deter the animals from advancing.  many of these young people come from extremely deprived backgrounds, from communities where violence is a routine way of gaining respect and status. they have grown up learning that the only sure route out of a lifetime of poverty and violence is education -- and now that education has been made inaccessible for many of them. meanwhile, when children deface the statue of a racist, imperialist prime minister who ordered the military to march on protesting miners, the press calls it violence. when children are left bleeding into their brains after being attacked by the police, the press calls it legitimate force.  hanging off some traffic lights, my back aching from the crush, i have the best view in the house of this 'legitimate force' being enacted, as a line of riot cops forms a solid carapace of beetlish menace and marches forward into the crowd, raining down baton blows. then the protesters cluster together and push back, and my mouth falls open as i see the police retreat into formation. i am suddenly reminded of school history lessons about roman battle tactics, and indeed, looking down at my hands as i type, i notice that they are covered in blue paint and streaked with blood, like a saxon warrior but for the laptop.  when i drop down from the traffic lights, my arms and back aching from being crushed earlier, i find myself at the front of the riot line, being shoved between two shields. fighting for breath, i am shoved roughly through the line by two police officers; twisting my neck, i see a young woman in a white bobble hat pinned between the shields and the crowd, screaming as the batons come down on her head once, twice, and her spectacles are wrenched from her face. her friend is shrieking, 'please don't crush us, we can't move back, there's no room!' she is pushed through the line too, and the police refuse to find her a medic. ""i've never been on a protest before, i'm a completely peaceful person - i'm doing my phd on virginia woolf,"" she pants, her face streaked with tears of anger. ""my name is helen tyson, and i'm disgusted, utterly disgusted by the police today."" we cannot speak any more, because a huge officer in full armour taps me on the shoulder and orders me to leave. when i explain that i am a member of the press and i'd like to observe what's happening, he tells me that this is a ""sterile area"", and i am dragged away by my arms and legs and dumped by horse guards parade.  a sterile area: that's what the heart of our democracy has become, a searing wound of rage and retribution cauterised by armoured and merciless agents of the state.  things fall apart. something fundamental has changed in the relationship between state and citizen over the past month. increased police violence will not stop our democracy disintegrating: before it's too late, before more children are brutalised at the heart of what once pretended to be a representative democracy, this government needs to consider its position.  laurie penny",0,

939410,"dear usicans,  there are 194 other countries in the world. the term ""conservative"", when used in a political context, has a fairly straightforward meaning in those countries and yours. conservatism is about the preservation of power, and the furthering of interest of those in power. it is about keeping empires up and keeping women down.  what you describe, is liberalism. liberalism is rich men letting go of the leash just long enough for them to gain more power and wealth. liberalism is about money. depending on the current political climate of your country, liberals can either be leaning towards social conservatism or progressivism. mostly, they just the ron pauls of this world - they care nothing about human rights, their religion is capitalism.  if you live in a state where corporations can buy political capital and conservatism isn't a swear word, this might come as a shock to you. you were made to believe that a bunch of white male slave-owners came together a couple hundred years ago to make the colonies a better place for everybody. isn't it funny that ""all men are made equal"" didn't apply to blacks?  as a historian, you learn to see the big picture. the usican obsession with *words*, wether in books or in speeches, isn't accidental. *words* have been the foremost weapon used by your elite, starting with the declaration of independence. indeed, written and spoken *words* have always held power. in ancient greece, your ability to perform a speech before a vast crowd determined your influence. courses were given in this. the roman senate, a bunch of rich white guys, basically turned words into an art. a group of deported jewish intellectuals combined their stories and straigthened them out for later greek-writing intellectuals to write them down. eventually, the roman emperor and a select secular (which back then meant non-monestary related religious folk) elite picked which stuff they combined in their biblion and what was left out. the stories from this bible influenced the world for centuries.   eventually, some catholic painter failed to get into the art academy of vienna and heard certain *words*. a long line of non-catholics had gone before these words, perhaps as early as erasmus who knew about a certain problem that required a ""solution"". luther knew about this too, and for 500 years these feelings festered.   finally, protestantism and catholicism once again joined forces, ready to get rid of the plague. right before the crusades, groups of people were murdered because they were part of this plague. and now, 840 years later, he would finish the job. ironically, the people who planted these words as seeds of hatred got to reap the rewards. the fetishist obsession with genocide and racism from their stories they had left behind long ago, because they were just *words*, came back and stabbed them in the back.  it took us a while, but finally we grew up. we managed to understand the power of *words*, and we managed to break it. as the jews had started to realise when they couldn't make sacrifices at the temple in jerusalem, words are just *words*. as the anthem of the popular sports team from the city in the netherlands that got to feel the power of words goes, ""no words but *deeds*"".  and here we finally get to the problem. safe behind their ocean-sized moat, a group of people never really ""got"" this. some do, a rare fringe understand the power of words, and how meaningless they are at the same time. that failed painter from braunau am inn understood that words are infinitely more powerful when spoken by a person you can *see*. the first major tv-broadcast we've sent into space shows him, and his flags, and his spectacle, his show.   guess in which country this power still holds sway? where these broadcast words can make or break a politician? where they make or break a corporation giving money to this politician to buy more *words*. where flags are still flown proudly? where the best *words* get you the best seat?  the words used by the slave owners who claimed the colonies for themselves were inspired by, among things, those of the wealthy elite from holland and zeeland. safely behind their waterline, they fought wars with spain and france, claiming to fight for the people, for religious rights. the catholics living in the south suffered the most. this was not their war, nor was it fought *for* them. catholics had to hide their churches and their rosaries almost until the previous century.  and still, it took us offspring of the republic, a long time. that failed painter, whose obssesion with cinema drove him to draw the seven dwarfs from that other famous fascist's movie, he helped us. i think it took until 1971. that other republic, that was still a republic, opposed the words from those bronze age intellectuals deported by nebuchadnessar and legalised abortion.   a switch was activated. we realised that it is not words that should be judged, but actions. at a festival, cops were ordered to stand back when people started smoking pot. the law had turned into ""just"" words. warnings and opposition - just words. if you do not act on these words, they are meaningless. nine years later, we followed that other republic and legalised abortion. and finally, in 1994, the roman empire was finally defeated. the christian-democratic appeal lost their first election, coming in second and was left out of the government. prostitution, squating, same-sex marriage, euthanasia. no jewish gods rose up to rain down fire upon us.  the enlightenment started, ironically enough, with a deported intellectual, living in second israel. the us is not the first republic to be a safehaven for jews. without descartes, it might have taken longer, i doubt it would not have happened at all. we figured it out. the power of the elite has been broken forever. or has it? on this side, of that big, big moat, it might have been. some day, our offspring on the other side will realise this too.   the declaration of independence is just a piece of paper with *words*. words written by white, male slave owners who never ever *ever* had your best interest in mind. whose deeds did not lead to their words becoming reality. these slave owners were a new start, just like in my republic. instead of the old aristocracy, capitalists formed the caste that holds power. this elite consists of two groups, both liberal. one leans conservative, the other slightly less. occassionally, someone comes along who is a bit different.   f. roosevelt had to fix an economic crisis and shifted towards economical centrism while still being socially conservative. though the term is often misused and misunderstood, this is called fascism. nader is someone for economic equality but not overly concerned with human rights though not opposing them either, this is called socialism. paul represents the exact economical opposite, and like badnarik and all usan ""libertarians"" represents an almost perfectly centrist liberal. in between nader and paul, and slightly to the left and progressive side, you find kucinich, a centrist. directly opposite of him, reagan, a convergence of political and economical power, which is what conservatism actually is.   the vast majority of the us political spectrum can be found between badnarik, reagan and gravel (a centrist). even if you do not agree with this political terminology, you have to remember these are just *words*. see the big picture. understand that the same corporations who control pro-corporate cnn, fox &amp; abc also control the fake countervoice of a blowhard sports reporter and some guy who was the nanny's cousin. understand the power of words. understand how stories, fiction works. you are given someone to identify with and someone to see as your enemy.   you are being fed a fictional battle. it is the theathre of ancient greece, the bread and games of the roman emperor. watching the person who claims to represent your side makes you feel good. it makes you feel like watching him/her made the world a better place. you stood up to the corporations, you watched the daily show and bought a rage against the machine album! and, wow, that simpsons episode just made fun of fox, the very corporation groening has been working for for two decades, what a rebel!  stop obsessing over words. look at what people do, not at what they say. follow the money. what really happened and who got better from it? forget that rag your slave owning oligarchic elite made up between whipcracks 234 years ago. don't let the austrian's legacy get to you. keep in mind the words from the russian dissident who told us that no one believed the communist propaganda, because it wasn't as subtle as us government propaganda. don't be distracted by pointless discussions over political terminology or whether or not 11-9 was an inside job. we spend 10 miliard on our army and intercept about one plane per week within 10-15 minutes, the 400 miliard you spent couldn't even stop one plane - that is all that is relevant.  get up from your chair and do something. i spent new years eve at the gates of an immigrant prison, where 50 people showed them that the word on their passport behind ""nationality"" is *just a word*. just like ""conservative"" is just a word.  /just words  **tldr:** i spent two hours on this, while i should've been getting some sleep before work. but if you really want a tldr: disregard words, acquire deeds.",1,
223386,"except it isn't.  we're past the days when peaceful protests were an effective method of encouraging political and social change.  peaceful protests today simply don't get noticed, unless they can be or have been co-opted by corporate interests who will pay for media exposure.    partly this is because most of the issues that are the catalyst for large peaceful protests (whether it be the anti-war movement, anti-globalization policies, or your choice of cause) have seen very little real advancement in their agendas since the 1960s-1970s (with the exception of purely social [non-economic] policies, such as gay rights).  this means that even if you assemble 100,000 individuals to protest, say, the iraqi war, your protest is going to be covered, if it is at all, as yap.... yet another protest.  such things don't make for interesting headlines anymore, its old news.  whether this one was 40 people or 200000, its the same story that was told 6 months ago, and 6 months before that... a story that _will not sell ratings_.  but that's only part of the problem.  even in the 60s, when non-violent protest was occurring in large enough numbers in a turbulent enough time to garner national attention, organizers then knew that simply having a ""non-violent"" protest was not effective.  in order to keep the national spotlight on their movement, they had to organize their ""non-violent"" protests in ways that would make for good headlines, and that almost always meant some form of violence needed to be provoked.   ""non-violent"" as a name for the type of demonstration was a chosen because the participants wanted to be seen as the peaceful and oppressed, and has stayed in the national lexicon because no one wants to put ""violent protest"" in childrens' history books, not because it was a fitting nomenclature.    mlk's march on washington wasn't effective because it was a large, non-violent crowd, it was effective because america was still a white, racist society, and the image of 100k black people marching on washington had screaming overtones to slave revolt, and a clear threat to white national security, if mlk's ""moral"" and ""religious"" demands weren't met.  if you were white and alive then, you feared an american coup d'etat, and by a ""nigger"" no less. most so-called ""non-violent"" protests were specifically crafted to evoke the maximum amount of violence possible, provided the protesters could be seen as the underdog, and with the hope that enough images of police brutality would create sympathy for the protesters.  even your college sit-ins were designed with the hope of forcing the police to barge in, and arrest students in the local and national newspapers.  kent state was one of the most effective protests of the 60s and 70s.  **the problem** is that society has learned from its past mistakes.  you can't hold an effective sit-in at your college campus, when police forces are allowed to _mail you your subpoena up to a month later_.  where before they needed to go in and arrest you, lest the campus be shut down, now academia simply has to wait for the students to run out of food (&lt;3-6 days), and arrest them all by mail a month in the future, when the papers have forgotten the story.  in the meanwhile, the school can be run by laptop.  (not to mention today's students need their diplomas for the job market, and can't financially risk expulsion, whereas a diploma in the 60s was an advantage, not a necessity, for students as they largely did not have crushing financial debt).  police have learned too.  no longer are police going to turn the firehoses so blatantly on protesters.  police tactics have evolved to the point that no matter what tactics they use, no matter what violence _they_ incite, or what laws _they break_ in the name of ""keeping the peace"" they are almost always portrayed beneficially, or financially compensated by the ""protected"" political entity after the event.  this all means that not only will nothing interesting (as far as newspaper headlines go) will come from your protest, but likely the local political establishment will be able to spin the protest's occurrence to shine the light on _them_, and how good a job they did at protecting the peace, while allowing political demonstration.  **your topic will not see public discussion**.  but even worse is the fact that in our modern, conservative america, we no longer nationally care if protesters are violently suppressed.  where brutal police crackdowns were nationally shocking and even scandalous in the mid 20th century, even when used against people viewed as ""niggers,"" in modern america everyone has learned to live with police brutality, and no one gets outraged by the exact same actions, no matter who they're taken out on.  where the hell was the outrage following the 2004 rnc convention?  what about in michigan?  america has taken a weird, almost fascist (and that is not an exaggeration, or misuse of the word) acceptance of police political suppression.    and that means where mlk and co would have crafted a ""non-violent"" protest that would provoke nationally disgusted police overreaction and nationally sympathy; any attempt at a similar ""non-violent"" protest today will be carefully boxed out and ignored by the police, handled legally in quiet manners, and ignored by the media; or brutally suppressed by the police, in a manner that the media may or may care about reporting on, to a public that may or may not care about such atrocities, with no discussion of the issue at hand, but rather, only on the actions of the police involved.  so the only methods left to actually bring attention to the issues at hand, are to use ""diversity of tactics.""  at least when protesters are breaking windows and breaking property, the people watching the news reports (and there will _finally_ actually be news reports) will ask ""why are people doing such things?""  and even though the news reporters probably still won't discuss the issues to any depth, the end audience might actually do so.  and perhaps more importantly, police might actually overreact!  and then the protesters will get the same sort of news coverage that they used to get from non-violent protests way back when.  that's not to say all protests should be violent.  far, far from it.  ideally, none would be.  the entire point of diversity of tactics is that you need to have completely non-violent protests more often anyway.  but you need to have them so the people in the protests can network among each other, and build the movement internally, not because they are at all effective instruments of social change.  to quote darth cheney ""the only protests that matter, are if they are rioting in the streets.""  anything else can be ignored.  if we still lived in a functioning, healthy democracy, then large groups of political protesters would have political sway, simply by their large numbers and organizational resources.  but we don't live in a healthy democracy anymore, and just because you have even a majority approval for an issue in the population, doesn't mean you will see any tangible policy changes, depending on the issue, let alone see fair national discussion.    but if you only read one thing, let it be this.  historically, the only effective means of political change, ever, has been violent protest, whether it be in specific areas (the iranian or greek revolts these last summers) or nation wide revolution seeding.  the beauty of democracy was that it organized all of society that the people might be able to seek and effect the social change they saw fit without resorting to such means.  that by creating a government that would be forced to embrace the changes demanded by its people, a nation might survive with a higher degree of peace among its people, and thereby avoid the need for armed and violent political protest.  but if any government is incapable of meeting and addressing such social pressures in a non-violent manner, then by far the most effective, and _only_, resort of the people is violent protest.  and when you talk about topics such as the g20, where the people have had 0 political influence, and have had none for the last 30 years, it should not be surprising to see that the protesters feel they have no other recourse than violence, and they'd be right.  be thankful that there aren't so many such topics in modern western society where the people are similarly disenfranchised, or the idea of said violence would begin carrying over and help form alliances between similarly frustrated political groups across the political spectrum... and this is how you get insurgent revolutionary parties.",1,1

who needed a pillow? which did they prefer, i was asking everybody, the chicken or the beef? was that decaf or regular?     food service is the only skill where i really excel. the problem was all this meal service and rushing around had to be one-handed, of course, since i had to keep ahold of the gun.     when we were on the ground and the passengers and crew were deplaning, i stood at the forward cabin door and said, i'm sorry. i apologize for any inconvenience. please have a safe and enjoyable trip and thank you for flying blah-blah airlines.     when it was just the pilot and me left on board, we took off again.     the pilot, just before he jumps, he tells me how when each engine fails, an alarm will announce flame out in engine number one or three or whichever, over and over. after all the engines are gone, the only way to keep flying will be to keep the nose up. you just pull back on the steering wheel. the yoke, he calls it. to move what he calls the elevators in the tail. you'll lose speed, but keep altitude. it will look like you have a choice, speed or height, but either way you're still going to nose-dive into the ground.     that's enough, i tell him, i'm not getting what you'd call a pilot's license. i just need to use the toilet like nobody's business. i just want him out that door.     then we slow to 175 knots. not to bore you with the details, but we drop to under 10,000 feet and pull open the forward cabin door. then the pilot's gone, and even before i shut the cabin door, i stand at the edge of the doorway and take a leak after him.     nothing in my life has ever felt that good.     if sir isaac newton was right, this wouldn't be a problem for the pilot on his way down.     so now i'm flying west on autopilot at mach 0.83 or 455 miles per hour, true airspeed, and at this speed and latitude the sun is stuck in one place all the time. time is stopped. i'm flying above the clouds at a cruising altitude of 39,000 feet, over the pacific ocean, flying toward disaster, toward australia, toward the end of my life story, straight line southwest until all four engines flame out.     testing, testing. one, two, three.     one more time, you're listening to the flight recorder of flight 2039.     and at this altitude, listen, and at this speed, with the plane empty, the pilot says there are six or maybe seven hours of fuel left.     so i'll try to make this quick.     the flight recorder will record my every word in the cockpit. and my story won't get bashed into a zillion bloody shreds and then burned with a thousand tons of burning jet. and after the plane wrecks, people will hunt down the flight recorder. and my story will survive.     testing, testing. one, two, three.     it was just before the pilot jumped, with the cabin door pulled inside and the military ships shadowing us, with the invisible radar tracking us, in the open doorway with the engines shrieking and the air howling past, the pilot stood there in his parachute and yelled, ""so why do you want to die so bad?""     and i yelled back for him to be sure and listen to the tape.     ""then remember,"" he yelled. ""you have only a few hours. and remember,"" he yelled, ""you don't know exactly when the fuel will run out. there's always the chance you could die right in the middle of your life story.""     and i yelled, so what else is new?     and, tell me something i don't know.     and the pilot jumped. i took a leak, then i pushed the cabin door back into place. in the cockpit, i push the throttle forward and pull the yoke back until we fly high enough. all that's left to do is press the button and the autopilot takes charge. that brings us back to right here.     so if you're listening to this, the indestructible black box of flight 2039, you can go look and see where this plane ended its terminal descent and what's left. you'll know i'm not a pilot after you see the mess and the crater. if you're listening to this, you know that i'm dead.     and i have a few hours to tell my story here.     so i figure there's maybe a chance i'll get this story right.     testing, testing. one, two, three.     the sky is blue and righteous in every direction. the sun is total and burning and just right there in front. we're on top of the clouds, and this is a beautiful day forever.     so let's us take it from the top. let me start at the start.     flight 2039, here's what really happened. take one.     and.     just for the record, how i feel right now is very terrific.     and.     i've already wasted ten minutes.     and.     action.",0,

867604,"after our hike, we all stood in front of the main entrance doors that lead to the reception area of the asylum. the asylum itself was built around the turn of the century, i can't remember the exact year, but it was just before the first world war. huge slabs of bluestone rose out of the ground to impressive heights, stacked one on top of the other, as each building was built entirely out of the cool stone. at the front a massive granite staircase lead to the main doors, flanked by polished white stone balustrades, the whole scene had more a look of a high class country mansion than a nut house. the main doors showed the true face of the main building, however, as the door had been reinforced with heavy iron supports, whilst the windows were inlaid with thick wire, laid in a criss-cross pattern.  myself and benny were the first to move forward towards the door, torches at the ready as we inspected the heavy locks on the front door. it appeared we weren't the first to go through, the lock appeared to have been broken, and fixed in a rather noncommittal manner, the new deadbolt looked as if it could be quite easily pried out of its fitting. i fished my crowbar from my bag of tricks, and wedged it into a crevice near the lock, gently easing more and more weight on to the bar, before finally, with a satisfying *crack*, the lock popped out of the door and loudly crashed to the floor on the other side of the door. both benny and i looked at each other, listening to see if anyone other than ourselves heard the noise. thirty seconds of nothing but the chitter of cicadas and possums and we decided to push on forward, myself in the lead, benny close behind, with dan and andy taking up the rear.  what greeted us was quite the sight.  the entire foyer was quite majestic, with high ceilings, all of which were decorated with ornate patterns and plaster sculptures which held most of the hanging light fixtures were all still in wonderful condition, albeit covered in grime and mould. the furniture in the foyer was covered in white sheets, which had long ago decayed, and only the tattered remains were draped over the old wooden benches and chairs. no matter where you looked, a thick layer of dust and cobwebs coated everything, even the floor creating a strange sensation whenever you placed your feet down.  where our torchlights shined, the old green wallpaper began to spring to life, after not seeing any light for nearly 30 years. delicate floral patterns shifted and danced in the soft spotlights created by our torches. yet throughout all of its beauty, there was the unmistakable feeling that we were definitely somewhere were we shouldn't have been. the air inside still had the smell of formaldehyde and peroxide, thick as it was when the asylum was still open for crazy, and the was nothing in earshot that could be heard, not even the cicadas outside could be heard, and not a molecule of air was moving.  we pushed further into the depths of the main building, past what looked like examination rooms, long since stripped of anything of value, only the furniture remained, the once glorious leather padded benches were cracked and perished.  the next hour of exploration were uneventful, just room after room of offices, cells, labs, and mess halls, all blurring into one memory for me, except when benny found an old set of keys, which we then tried with every door we could find, but to no avail. it was when benny finally found a map of the asylum grounds was when things really became interesting.  benny pointed out a building away from the main site, eagerly explaining what he had read about earlier in the day. apparently, when the asylum was first opened, they had started a research lab to study psychological disorders in women, well, what they considered to be disorders back in the day, and that they left most of their equipment and the likes behind, because no one was allowed into that building since the early 50's. this was creepy dynamite to us, and we made tracks to the old abandoned building nestled at the top of the hill on which the asylum stood.  compared to the main building, this building, which has a name that for the life of me i cannot remember, i remember everything else, but not the name of the place. i don't know why, but it just refuses to come to mind. anyway, this building was incredibly utilitarian, and was in complete contrast to the rest of the buildings on the asylum grounds.  the actual building was about 50 metres square, with flat brick walls, and every 10 metres, set high in the wall were small barred windows. this place looked more like a prison than a hospital. andy had taken one look at the building and refused to take one more step, frozen in place just at the sight of the building, and we hadn't even reached the door to this place. andy being andy, he just wanted to get out, wanted to bail, and looking back, he probably took the best option.  dan decided to head back to benny's place with andy, as andy was on the verge of tears, and with a quick glance a benny, we sent them on their way. we circled the building and discovered the door, which was made entirely from steel, heavy and set within the stone walls with a massive chain lock preventing entry. just from the visuals, we knew this could be the best part of the asylum, if only we could get inside.  it was through sheer desperation after trying brute force to break the old lock, that benny slipped on the ground trying to get better leverage with the crowbar, when the old set of keys we had picked up earlier fell onto the cobblestone path. i looked at benny, and he threw the keys to me, and without thinking, i tried the key that seemed to be the one that should be used.  it opened straight away, as if the lock was brand new, the heavy chains slipping from the steel door from with a loud crash. the door creaked ajar as i helped benny to his feet. we both took a deep breath and pushed the door open and crossed the threshold.  now this is going to sound like a cop out. a huge let down, but i cannot clearly recall what happened on the other side of the door. i had a notebook and a camera with me, and had taken a lot of pictures, and made extensive notes, but outside of what i had written, i cannot describe what happened in that building.  what i do remember is a blur of streetlights as both benny and i were bolting back to his house, the shapes of the trees shifting from side to side as i sprinted away from that old asylum towards the safety of benny's house. i remember turning and seeing benny fall, and i scrambled back to help him, looking up at the now open door of the 'prison' and seeing nothing but blackness inside.   well, almost blackness.  there was a pair of gold points shining in our direction.  we got up and ran in the other direction, swearing never to speak of this again.",0,

749844,"sorry, i didn't mean it to be interpreted it that way. warning: great wall of text  the first time i went there was by car; i was very young, but my memories are still vivid. i was going for umrah, or the lesser pilgrimage, and so at a certain location, known as the miqat, is when the pilgrimage begins. i went and showered and then put on my ihram, or the white garments a male pilgrim is supposed to wear. i wrapped one piece around my waist, and covered my upper body with the other one. i have done that three times, and never have i ever felt more humbled than when i wore those two cloths. my father and brothers were all wearing the same cloths. strangers seemed so much more approachable to me. after praying, which signals the start of the pilgrimage, i started the customary praising of allah, that every pilgrim does all the way from the miqat to mecca. it is an emotionally powerful praise of allah.  you can hear that [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxorwvq1hma), it means: ""here i am at thy service o lord, here i am. here i am at thy service and thou hast no partners. thine alone is all praise and all bounty, and thine alone is the sovereignty. thou hast no partners.""  hearing that makes me and a lot of people nostalgic. it has a profound effect even on the weakest muslims.  upon entering mecca, i saw a city no different than other saudi suburbs - shoddy building and planning, poor maintenance, and bad roads. but as we got deeper into the city, it gradually became more crowded, and more and more pilgrims came into view, until at last the huge complex that is the masjid al-haram, or the ""forbidden mosque"" came into view. it was especially magnificent at night. with the atmospheric lights all around the mosque being reflected back by the surrounding marble of the exterior floor and walls, making it as bright as day. while i personally disprove of such display of glamor, it was hard not to be impressed and awestruck just from the exterior. i have been to the notre dame, the hagia sofia, and the umayyad mosque of cordoba, but nothing compares to seeing this structure in all its aesthetic glory in the night. and i have not even begun to mention the crowds and endless stream of people pouring into the mosque, a lot them wearing the pligrim's cloths.  as i walked to the center of all my prayers, i walked past huge flocks of pigeons that were unfazed or unshaken by the sheer masses of people walking by them. all around the exterior were people sitting down on the bare marble and lying down, waiting and reserving their places for the next prayer.  after removing my sandals, i entered through the main entrance with its huge wooden doors into such a high, wide, and open area, that it did not feel like i was inside a structure. i continued to walk straight, in the direction that i face everyday at least five times a day. i could not see past the huge crowd the structure draped in black and gold, but i looked around at the huge and innumerable pillars, at the ceilings, each individually decorated with a unique variety of flowers. despite the dense crowds, the area was kept so refreshingly cool, regardless of the season or time of day. i looked at the sides to see the endless rows of carpets laid down, that somehow were not enough for the continuous flow of people.  ahead of me were several steps down, and that was when i saw it with my own eyes for the first time. the flurry of emotions were truly indescribable. it was difficult not to pause and admire the kaaba, shrouded in its black garment with inscriptions of gold across it, but beneath it was a modest structure. my eyes teared up. it was a culmination of a long journey, but this view was so sweet, and i was not alone in cherishing this wonderful view, but the endless crowd urged on, everyone with equal eagerness and desire to set their eyes upon this structure, whether for the first time, or for the 10th.  i walked down the few steps into the brown and red bricks part of the mosque. this was the ottoman extension of the mosque, that still stands after several hundred years. i was told that when this place was built, that the ottoman sultan ordered that every builder chosen for this task had memorized the quran, and would recite it over and over again until the structure was complete. i could not admire such history, or the magnificence of the marble or decorations, because the kaaba was a much more beautiful view to me. it was much larger than i had anticipated and i was so humbled to be where i knew millions of muslims had walked for over a thousand years.  i continued to walk towards the kaaba and into the open marble field containing the kaaba. the crowd was massive, all orbiting the kaaba, with many of them wearing the same cloths i was wearing. i could not tell the rich from the poor, or the foreign from the local, instead, none of that mattered then. i started by pointing my hand to the black stone, the same stone that had been touched by muhammad (pbuh) and nearly all of his companions. all the stories i knew of this place came to mind, and i was emotionally awestruck. for me and everyone around me, this was the place where islam had started and was persecuted, but it was also the same place where islam was granted victory. it was the place i had prayed to my entire life. it seems useless to say that to see this place that i pray to everyday is indescribable, but it is and i must say it. seven times i circled the kaaba, saying whatever prayer i wished, but it seemed that seven was not enough, or that somehow this massive crowd was moving too fast. even though i had been tired by a long day's road trip, i felt energized and i felt my steps were lighter and easier on me. i could not reach the black stone, but i was still satisfied.  after the tawaf, i drank from the zamzam water, which is blessed water from the zamzam well near the kaaba, of which their are cold and warm water tanks placed everywhere in the mosque and constantly refilled. this was the well dug up by ismail (as) as a young child, who along with his father ibrahim (as) built the kaaba.  after this, i headed towards the safa and marwa, two hills that the mother of ismail (as) ran between seven times looking for water for her son. there i, too, just like countless muslims before me including the prophet (pbuh) had done. i went between the two hills seven times, again praying the prayers that i had wished. it was here that it really sunk in how truly diverse these people, who were all wearing the same clothes, really were. i heard english in american and british accents. i heard all forms of arabic dialects. i heard turkish, french, and german. i heard languages i did not know, and still do not know. i saw people who were clearly caucasian and others who were clearly from the far east, but none of that mattered then and there.  after that, i drank again from the zamzam waters, which i enjoyed, especially considering that i do not like water. it had its own very distinctive taste, which is hard to describe. i had drunk from the same well as the first muslims 1400 years ago, which was a humbling thought. continued -&gt;",0,

457365,"nigger owners manual  congratulations on your purchase of a brand new nigger! if handled properly, your apeman will give years of valuable, if reluctant, service.  installing your nigger. you should install your nigger differently according to whether you have purchased the field or house model. field niggers work best in a serial configuration, i.e. chained together. chain your nigger to another nigger immediately after unpacking it, and don't even think about taking that chain off, ever. many niggers start singing as soon as you put a chain on them. this habit can usually be thrashed out of them if nipped in the bud. house niggers work best as standalone units, but should be hobbled or hamstrung to prevent attempts at escape. at this stage, your nigger can also be given a name. most owners use the same names over and over, since niggers become confused by too much data. rufus, rastus, remus, toby, carslisle, carlton, hey-you!-yes-you!, yeller, blackstar, and sambo are all effective names for your new buck nigger. if your nigger is a ho, it should be called latrelle, l'tanya, or jemima. some owners call their nigger hoes latrine for a joke. pearl, blossom, and ivory are also righteous names for nigger hoes. these names go straight over your nigger's head, by the way.  configuring your nigger owing to a design error, your nigger comes equipped with a tongue and vocal chords. most niggers can master only a few basic human phrases with this apparatus - ""muh dick"" being the most popular. however, others make barking, yelping, yapping noises and appear to be in some pain, so you should probably call a vet and have him remove your nigger's tongue. once de-tongued your nigger will be a lot happier - at least, you won't hear it complaining anywhere near as much. niggers have nothing interesting to say, anyway. many owners also castrate their niggers for health reasons (yours, mine, and that of women, not the nigger's). this is strongly recommended, and frankly, it's a mystery why this is not done on the boat  housing your nigger. your nigger can be accommodated in cages with stout iron bars. make sure, however, that the bars are wide enough to push pieces of nigger food through. the rule of thumb is, four niggers per square yard of cage. so a fifteen foot by thirty foot nigger cage can accommodate two hundred niggers. you can site a nigger cage anywhere, even on soft ground. don't worry about your nigger fashioning makeshift shovels out of odd pieces of wood and digging an escape tunnel under the bars of the cage. niggers never invented the shovel before and they're not about to now. in any case, your nigger is certainly too lazy to attempt escape. as long as the free food holds out, your nigger is living better than it did in africa, so it will stay put. buck niggers and hoe niggers can be safely accommodated in the same cage, as bucks never attempt sex with black hoes.  feeding your nigger. your nigger likes fried chicken, corn bread, and watermelon. you should therefore give it none of these things because its lazy ass almost certainly doesn't deserve it. instead, feed it on porridge with salt, and creek water. your nigger will supplement its diet with whatever it finds in the fields, other niggers, etc. experienced nigger owners sometimes push watermelon slices through the bars of the nigger cage at the end of the day as a treat, but only if all niggers have worked well and nothing has been stolen that day. mike of the old ranch plantation reports that this last one is a killer, since all niggers steal something almost every single day of their lives. he reports he doesn't have to spend much on free watermelon for his niggers as a result. you should never allow your nigger meal breaks while at work, since if it stops work for more than ten minutes it will need to be retrained. you would be surprised how long it takes to teach a nigger to pick cotton. you really would. coffee beans? don't ask. you have no idea.  making your nigger work. niggers are very, very averse to work of any kind. the nigger's most prominent anatomical feature, after all, its oversized buttocks, which have evolved to make it more comfortable for your nigger to sit around all day doing nothing for its entire life. niggers are often good runners, too, to enable them to sprint quickly in the opposite direction if they see work heading their way. the solution to this is to *dupe* your nigger into working. after installation, encourage it towards the cotton field with blows of a wooden club, fence post, baseball bat, etc., and then tell it that all that cotton belongs to a white man, who won't be back until tomorrow. your nigger will then frantically compete with the other field niggers to steal as much of that cotton as it can before the white man returns. at the end of the day, return your nigger to its cage and laugh at its stupidity, then repeat the same trick every day indefinitely. your nigger comes equipped with the standard nigger iq of 75 and a memory to match, so it will forget this trick overnight. niggers can start work at around 5am. you should then return to bed and come back at around 10am. your niggers can then work through until around 10pm or whenever the light fades.  entertaining your nigger. your nigger enjoys play, like most animals, so you should play with it regularly. a happy smiling nigger works best. games niggers enjoy include: 1) a good thrashing: every few days, take your nigger's pants down, hang it up by its heels, and have some of your other niggers thrash it with a club or whip. your nigger will signal its intense enjoyment by shrieking and sobbing. 2) lynch the nigger: niggers are cheap and there are millions more where yours came from. so every now and then, push the boat out a bit and lynch a nigger.  lynchings are best done with a rope over the branch of a tree, and niggers just love to be lynched. it makes them feel special. make your other niggers watch. they'll be so grateful, they'll work harder for a day or two (and then you can lynch another one). 3) nigger dragging: tie your nigger by one wrist to the tow bar on the back of suitable vehicle, then drive away at approximately 50mph. your nigger's shrieks of enjoyment will be heard for miles. it will shriek until it falls apart. to prolong the fun for the nigger, do *not* drag him by his feet, as his head comes off too soon. this is painless for the nigger, but spoils the fun. always wear a seatbelt and never exceed the speed limit. 4) playing on the pnl: a variation on (2), except you can lynch your nigger out in the fields, thus saving work time. niggers enjoy this game best if the pnl is operated by a man in a tall white hood. 5) hunt the nigger: a variation of hunt the slipper, but played outdoors, with dobermans. warning: do not let your dobermans bite a nigger, as they are highly toxic.  disposal of dead niggers. niggers die on average at around 40, which some might say is 40 years too late, but there you go. most people prefer their niggers dead, in fact. when yours dies, report the license number of the car that did the drive-by shooting of your nigger. the police will collect the nigger and dispose of it for you.  common problems with niggers - my nigger is very aggresive have it put down, for god's sake. who needs an uppity nigger? what are we, short of niggers or something?  my nigger keeps raping white women they all do this. shorten your nigger's chain so it can't reach any white women, and arm heavily any white women who might go near it.  will my nigger attack me? not unless it outnumbers you 20 to 1, and even then, it's not likely. if niggers successfully overthrew their owners, they'd have to sort out their own food. this is probably why nigger uprisings were nonexistent (until some fool gave them rights).  my nigger bitches about its ""rights"" and ""racism"". yeah, well, it would. tell it to shut the fuck up.  my nigger's hide is a funny color. - what is the correct shade for a nigger? a nigger's skin is actually more or less transparent. that brown color you can see is the shit your nigger is full of. this is why some models of nigger are sold as ""the shitskin"".  my nigger acts like a nigger, but is white. what you have there is a ""wigger"". rough crowd. wow!  is that like an albino? are they rare? they're as common as dog shit and about as valuable. in fact, one of them was president between 1992 and 2000. put your wigger in a cage with a few hundred genuine niggers and you'll soon find it stops acting like a nigger. however, leave it in the cage and let the niggers dispose of it. the best thing for any wigger is a dose of tnb.  my nigger smells really bad and you were expecting what?  should i store my dead nigger? when you came in here, did you see a sign that said ""dead nigger storage""? .that's because there ain't no goddamn sign",1,1

244068,"1\. i think i've always been a very slow shooter so this one isn't exactly something i had to teach myself.  an old pro once remarked ""you shoot like you're using film.""  i remember last time i took out a roll of film i didn't even use up the whole roll throughout the day.  one thing that might help you would be a checklist.  i remember reading an article about how simply adding checklists to emergency rooms helped save lives.  i don't use a checklist in the field, but i definitely do during my post-processing.  just add things like ""check highlights, check for awkward hand position, etc.""  every time you take a 'bad' photo add the reason it's bad to your checklist so you can stop and check for that in the field.  obviously if you're looking at a list every so often you won't be shooting too fast ;)  another thing that helps in regard to speed is looking at your camera's info display and double-checking everything.  just by turning my camera on i can see my white balance, image size, shutter speed/iso/aperture, exposure bias, etc.  double-check all that stuff if it's where you're prone to mistakes.  2\.  most effective way is definitely understanding histograms.  i can give a more in-depth response if you want, but they look like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mwzgyc6nmce/tczubjyrw1i/aaaaaaaaabm/vtydw6dgby4/s1600/histogram1.gif) and they show you the balance of light/dark in the image.  if you've got a high bar off to the *right* of the graph then you know you're losing data due to highlights.  same goes for the left of the graph with shadows.  more importantly you can use a full rgb histogram because most things will blow colors in different orders.  if you overexpose a pinkish caucasian then you'll red-channel data but your normal histogram will look fine.  when i shoot every photo pops up with four separate histograms (total, r, g, and b) and also blinks areas that have highlights.  these are features of my camera, and i'm not sure what you're shooting with.  &gt; on more than a few occasions my highlights are blown and i'm getting clipping. is it just a case of stopping down/bracketing etc?   depending what mode and metering you're in, yes.  to clarify metering: your camera should have a few different metering modes, and the two main ones will be one that takes the whole scene into consideration (matrix mode) and one that takes only your focus point (often the very center) into consideration (spot mode).  what this means is that if a scene is overall quite dim with a bright sun in the sky the former mode will try to compensate a little for the sun but mostly keep the bias on exposing everything.  the latter if your point is on the sun will say ""foreground be damned!  we will go dark to compensate for the sun!""  &gt; i know it's probably something relatively straight-forward.  it's actually not!  properly metering scenes is one of the last things i learned.  if you'd like **you can link me to an image** (not on imgur) and i can try to look at the exif data and tell you exactly what is wrong.  &gt; where i live we get very harsh sunlight (up in the hill of australia).  if your camera is in auto it should be able to always compensate for that.  i live in florida (known in the us as ""the sunshine state"") and i've had this issue on occasion, but only if i'm trying to force my camera with aperture mode and it can't handle it.",0,

983240,"other's have already pointed out the erroneousness of elderly having ""better"" and ""sharper"" brains, but there are other issues that are equally misleading or outright wrong.  before briefly addressing those other issues, though, i want to particularly point out that, generally speaking, older people are *not* better at problem solving; fluid intelligence, the component largely underlying tasks such as problem solving, peaks as early as one's twenties and thence begins to gradually fall.  now, to begin with, neural stem cells and neurogenesis contribute negligibly to normal brain operation in adults; the article is predominantly referring to synaptogenesis, which in no way involves the generation of new neurons.  secondly, the sulci and gyri constituting the brain's wrinkled appearance are, apparently, the result of synaptic connections exerting tensive forces that literally reshape the developing brain's cortex into its characteristic form; the article doesn't necessarily contradict this, but i feel it's worth mentioning.  finally, yes, size does matter.  cross-special comparisons, let alone between animals from even more distant taxonomic ranks, of brain sizes aren't really edifying due to a number of reasons, most prominent among them being the nonlinearity of neural density scaling and the overwhelmingly importance of the brain's species-specific cytoarchitectural arrangements.  however, brain size—or more accurately, encephalization—is a reliable predictor of intelligence; despite many high-profile deniers of this reality, such as stephen jay gould, the empirical evidence is really quite overwhelming.  and, of course, it only seems logical that, all other things being equal, greater encephalization would be conducive to greater intelligence.   below is a nonexhaustive *sampling* of studies regarding the correlation of brain size—as measured via multiple methods, including estimations from external head measurements, neuroimaging, postmortem brain weight and volume, and skull capacity—and intelligence.     &gt;two dozen studies using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) have shown that brain size is related to iq with a correlation of about .40.  this is much higher than the .20 found using indirect head size measures, though  that correlation is also reliable and significant.  rushton  jp,  ankney  cd.  *whole-brain  size  and  general  mental ability: a review.* int j neurosci 2009; 119: 691-731.   &gt;brain size is also highly heritable.  an mri study of 112 extended twin families found heritabilities of 82% for whole-brain gray matter volume, 87% for iq, and 100% for the relation between them.  posthuma  d,  de  geus  ejc,  baare  wfc,  pol  heh,  kahn  rs, boomsma  di.  *the  association between  brain  volume  and  intelligence is of genetic origin.* nat neurosci 2002; 5: 83-4.   &gt;an mri study of 46 pairs of twins found a high heritability for many specific connections within the brain, including myelin sheath, the fatty ""insulation"" that coats the axons and increases the speed of neural transmission.  chiang  m-c,  barysheva  m,  shattuck  dw,  lee  ad,  madsen  sk, avedissian  c,  klunder  ad,  toga aw,  mcmahon  kl,  de  zubicaray gi, wright mj, srivastava a, balov n, thompson pm. *genetics  of brain  fiber  architecture  and  intellectual  performance.*  j neurosci 2009; 29: 2212-24.    &gt;dozens of studies from the 1840s to the present have demonstrated race differences in brain size whether measured by mri, endocranial volume from empty skulls, brain weight at autopsy, or external head size (with or without corrections for body size).   &gt;rushton averaged the data and found: east asians = 1,364 in cm^3; whites = 1,347; and blacks = 1,267, with a standard deviation of about 10%.  thus, the overall mean for east asians was 17 cm^3 more than that for whites and 97 cm^3 more than that for blacks.  within-race differences due to differences in method of estimation averaged 31 cm^3.  since 1 cubic centimeter of brain tissue contains millions of brain cells and billions of synapses, race differences in brain size help to explain their iq differences.  indeed, if the racial differences in brain size did not relate to cognitive ability, it would be a mystery why such differences in number of neurons would ever have evolved since they are metabolically very expensive.  rushton  jp. *race,  evolution,  and behavior:  a  life  history perspective.* new brunswick, nj: transaction 1995.      &gt;[...] five independent studies have now examined the within-family correlations between brain size and iq and only schoenemann *et al.* failed to find the relationship.  the study used a small sample of 20 pairs of sisters with a restricted range of iq, thus making it statistically more difficult to detect differences.  the largest of the within-family studies measured head circumference at birth and iq at age 18 at the time of conscription in the swedish military.  the data were analyzed for 96,189 males who had at least 1 full brother similarly measured.  these within-family comparisons are of special interest because they control for most of the sources of variance that distinguish families, such as social class, styles of child rearing, and general nutrition.  bergvall n, iliadou a, tuvemo t, cnattingius s. *birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood: are the  associations  confounded  by  socioeconomic  factors  in  adolescence or familial effects?* pediatrics 2006;

165801,"&gt; parts you have zero right to an opinion on  except that in this situation, we are explicitly considering the case of a sexual interaction between two people, one transgendered and one not. this is not about making a judgment about the transgendered person's right to live their life as they see fit, it's about consent in sexual interactions.  &gt; would you walk up to a woman on the street (who you didn't assume was a trans woman) and ask about her genitalia?  again, you are reframing the issue. would i ask sexual questions to a potential sexual partner? yes. we are not in a ""random person on the street"" situation. we are not talking about lynch mobs. we are talking about flirting.  now, to me, the question becomes whether a person has the right to *informed* sexual consent, or merely consent. this issue has been raised before. for example, there was a [case in israel](http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-21/world/israel.rape.by.deception_1_appeal-plea-bargain-israeli-woman?_s=pm:world) where a man was held to have raped a women by 'allowing her to believe' that he was a different nationality than he was. this is precisely the issue of informed consent versus consent.  so is it reasonable for a person to make a decision on their sexual partner based on gender? we must allow that, since we accept a person's decision on their own sexualities, and the vast majority of sexualities use gender as a determining condition.  then are we to deny a person's right to define gender for themselves? that is, can you say ""i am attracted to gender x"", but must accept some external condition for what x means? or does each individual have the right to determine what is attractive and acceptable to them? we must allow this to truly have self-determined sexualities, otherwise we are merely changing the normative rules, not granting freedom.  then what your position must inevitably conclude is that a person has the right to decide that they are attracted only to individuals born with particular genitalia, but that they would have no right to expect honesty or disclosure from their partner in this regard. is this really the type of world we want?   or should their be a notion (not legally binding, but morally required) that if we know of a fact that our partner would consider relevant should be disclosed? should we be upfront about who we are, or believe that as long as *we* are fine with it, then we can use and leave whoever's consent we can elicit, even if we know they would deny consent when fully informed?  edit: and, to be fair, i think that it's relatively moot point because to me, i think the line for reasonable disclosure would tend to be closer to intercourse rather than making out, and this point would potentially be resolved by then.  also, for the record, i consider myself uninterested in a person's gender of origin as it were, but instead in their current body and self-definition. but i believe it should be the right of others to a more conservative sexuality and that reasonable disclosure supports that.",0,

833799,"ron paul sucks:  * he is for the bush tax cuts and in fact - in favor of just about all tax cuts * he's against socialized healthcare * he's against welfare, heating assistance, headstart, plannedparenthood assistance, food stamps and tons of services that help those who can't find work. * he's against social security and medicare * he'd close the department of education.. * he'd end every protection agency we have - fda, epa, etc.. (not that they are without problems or anything..) * advocates the abolition of the civil rights act, which outlaws discrimination against racial minorities and women. that includes title ix,  which forbids sex-based discrimination in educational programs receiving federal aid. this act is the reason it is not feasible today to prevent black people from using the same pool as white people, or to force them to the back of the bus; this act is the reason it is not legal to discriminate in the workplace based on sex. * advocates the abolition of the voting rights act. this act protects the voting rights of minorities; removing it would restore the state of election law to the days of jim crow, by making it easy to violate the 15th amendment by imposing nonsensical voting tests designed to keep people of ""the wrong color"" from voting. * introduced a constitutional amendment intended to make it possible to criminalize ""desecration"" of the flag. * scapegoats illegal immigrants for budget problems and advocates ineffective and draconian measures (like that stupid border fence, which he voted for) instead of actual immigration reform. * his anti-interventionism is so extreme he doesn't think we should provide aid to tsunami victims, earthquake victims, victims of genocide... * he denounces evolutionary theory in favor of creationism and he pussy foots around global warming and [interjects non-scientific doubt as to how much it's majorly a man contributed phenomenon.](http://www.ronpaul.com/on-the-issues/global-warming/) he uses this ""doubt"" as reasoning to vote against environmental regulation and wish to end the epa? * ([advocates against federal protection of abortion and gay marriage laws](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/we_the_people_act)) - he also thinks there's a [war on christmas](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul148.html) - which just makes me think he's a religious nutter. * argued in support of the ""defense of marriage"" act. * describes himself as ""an unshakeable foe of abortion"" (as if anyone were an ally of abortion) and has attacked roe v. wade in the odiously-named ""sanctity of life act."" on the same grounds, insists that the government cannot be involved with stem-cell research. but notwithstanding the sanctity of life, the death penalty is okay, just as long as it's a state government doing it (like texas). * opposes the separation between church and state, claiming that the founding fathers envisioned a christian america and that ""the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion, chipping away bit by bit at our nation's christian heritage. christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war."" * advocates total withdrawal (both participation and funding) from the un, nato and the international criminal court, which would pretty much end these organizations and the world order which has prevailed relatively peacefully since wwii. * has attacked campaign finance reform intended to reduce the involvement of money in politics * has advocated to shield corporations from liability for cancer-causing pollution. (oh well for the free market!) * voted against an amendment to protect net neutrality. * advocates the abolition of the seventeenth amendment allowing people to vote for their senators, leaving this power concentrated in the hands of state governments. justifies the electoral college by appealing to the inferiority of the masses (relative, i guess, to enlightened guys in offices like his). * advocates the abolition of the census' american community survey, which is used to make informed decisions on matters like where new hospitals should be placed. i see no good reason why we should not have good, up-to-date, publicly-available data for research and policy decisions. * [he wanted the united states to default on our loans.](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-22/default-now-or-suffer-a-more-expensive-crisis-later-ron-paul.html) * and a last comment here - he might be anti-subsidies, but he is also anti-government regulation of business. he's against levying taxing businesses, he's especially against higher taxes on wall street. his ending subsidy might do a little bit to fix some of the corruption we have in the business world, but the removal of the vast amount of taxes and regulation that are there for good fucking reason would turn this nation into a 3rd world country virtually over night. you're talking about everything from child labor laws, minimum wage, environmental protection, ""money as speech"", sox compliance, etc.. you all just don't seem to understand paul's policies about taxation and how to interact with the business community make paul ryan look like karl marx.   the man has fucking integrity and i respect that. he's not a corporate shill and i respect that. he's not a culture warrior, well not as much as we expect from republicans anyways.  randroids and libertarians would kill programs that help common people that few republicans would dare touch - and that's saying something.  i just see libertarian's response to problems in government as a ""lets throw our hands in the air, say fuck it and tear it all down"". liberals are trying to build society, libertarians don't believe in society. they believe in every man for himself in the most extreme of ways. so while i respect paul - the long term implications his platform, if ever able to be signed into law, frightens me. i'm going to add to this here b/c i'm tired of repeating myself  but but... paul can't end roe vs wade or close &lt;fill in dept&gt; on his own, so you should like totally vote for him!!!! ah - so if obama decided to join a fringe black panther splinter group and wanted to all of a sudden kill whitey, we should keep voting for him b/c hey ...""he'll never get laws passed to do it!""  that's such a fucking cop out excuse to work around a candidate's shitty views and i'm really tired of hearing it regurgitated.   it's done whenever the civil rights acts comes up, it's done when paul's views on abortion comes up. these are insane views, they are destructive views to rights that were fought for and i am not going to support anyone that supports the destruction of these rights.  you could say this in regards to any insane view than any candidate has. want to legalize pooping on babies? it'll never pass!",1,

719021,"[i've seen other posters do this a couple of times, now; figured i'd give it a try.]  ==  a golden afternoon.  lances of sunlight fell through through the clouds upon the pavilions and canopies that lay beneath the walls of harrenhal.  thousands packed the raised seats that lined the tournament ground, and the fifth day of jousting had finally come to a close.  the cheers of the crowd were deafening as ser barristan selmy stooped to help rhaegar targaryen to his feet, rubies flashing on the fallen prince's breastplate as he cheerfully admitted his defeat.  the two men walked back to the canopy under which lord whent and his noble guests were seated, laughing and recalling the lances they had broken on one another.  six times they had passed; but on the seventh rhaegar was unhorsed.   lord whent pronounced ser barristan the champion of harrenhal, awarding him the tournament purse and the hospitality of his house.  he also reminded him that it was his privilege to declare a queen of love and beauty.  this drew a laugh from the crowd; members of the kingsguard were sworn never to marry, and ser barristan had worn the white for twenty years.  nevertheless, he walked down the railing to where the prince's wife was seated.  he reached into his breastplate and withdrew a white kerchief embroidered with golden roses.  there was a murmur of surprise as he ignored the royal consort and instead presented the token to one of her handmaidens, a tall woman with piercingly purple eyes to rival those of the prince himself.  she wore a purple dress to match, cinched at the waist by a silver chain, and her long brown hair was tied back in a braid with dozens of violets woven throughout.  ""i have no need to declare the queen of love and beauty,"" ser barristan announced, with a slight catch in his voice.  ""all those present already know who she is.  lady ashara dayne - please step forward to receive this token.""  the applause at first were scattered and confused, but grew more robust as the startled lady rose from her seat.  she took the token politely, and the crowd's applause turned to cheers as she planted a kiss on each of the blushing knight's cheeks.  she embraced him, and brought her mouth to his ear.  ""you have embarrassed me terribly, ser.  please speak no more of this, and do not look to find me at the feast.""  she drew back again, a bright smile fixed upon her face for all to see.  ser barristan looked back at her, blankly.  a darkness fell within him.  ==  a moonless night.  the feast had all but concluded, and many of lord whent's guests had already made their unsteady way back to their tents.  roars of merriment could still be heard from the smallfolk's camps further down the field, and their bonfires burned merrily in the darkness.  the air was damp and heavy.  ser barristan sat outside his tent, clad in a simple white tunic and breeches.  his squire had long since made his way to the nearest bonfire to find a flagon and a girl, and ser barristan sat alone, lost in thought.  the tankard at his side had been emptied half a dozen times.  the sound of approaching footsteps brought him back to himself.  by the light of his flickering fire ser barristan made out a tall figure, clad in armor and a cloak of white.  he knew the man at once.  ""ser arthur!"" he called, somewhat sloppily.  ""come and take a drink with me.  we're meant to be celebrating, i hear.  come and sit with -"" his words froze in his mouth as the other knight came into full view.  ser arthur dayne, the sword of the morning, was a sworn brother of the kingsguard and one of ser barristan's oldest friends.  his reputation was unsurpassed, and his deeds the stuff of songs.  he was a man of unmatched courage, uncommon wit and unimpeachable honor.  now, however, his armor and cloak were stained with mud and other things.  he stumbled and reeled as he approached in the firelight, holding his hand to his head.  he muttered something that ser barristan could not hear, and he reeked of wine and piss.  ser barristan got quickly to his feet.  ""arthur, what's wrong?  what's happened?""  he reached out to steady his friend.  arthur's gauntlet flashed out and struck his hand away.  he gave a hollow laugh.  ""happened?  gods, selmy, what *hasn't* happened?  it's all gone to nothing.  nothing.""  ser barristan backed away.  he had never seen arthur like this.  nobody had.  ""it's all just... shit, selmy.  piles of it, with gold paint.  we serve a king who's a murderer and a madman.  his son, the young dragon, is off disgracing himself with that she-wolf even as we speak.  and my sworn brother - my noble, sworn brother - has been fucking my sister like some cheap tavern wench!""  ser barristan's face went white.  ""arthur, i never - ""  ""shut it, selmy.  i'm sick to death of this mummer's farce.  tournaments and challenges and queens of love and beauty... and *honor*.  seven hells, the honor left in this kingdom wouldn't fill a child's chamber pot!""  he leaned over and vomited.  ""arthur, you wouldn't be saying these things... you just need to rest.  let me take you back to your tent...""  he took ser arthur under the shoulder and tried to turn him around.    in the light of day, and without all the ale, the blow would have been easily dodged.  as it was, however, ser arthur's mailed fist struck ser barristan square in the face, breaking his nose and sending him sprawling to the ground.  ""don't touch me, filth!  i have no need of the likes of you.  in fact - ""  drawing a greatsword while drunk is not easy, but ser arthur managed it.  dawn flashed in the firelight, the pale blade seeming to drink in the fire and hold it.  ser barristan stayed frozen upon the ground, looking up warily.  ""think about what you're doing, arthur!  there's no coming back from this!""  ""you tell it true.  this is my last night, the gods know.  you can come down to hell with me, selmy... maybe that whore of a sister, too.""      ser barristan leaped to his feet.  blood was in his mouth and wrath in his eyes.  he grabbed his sword from where it lay and tore it from its sheath.  ""words are wind, dayne,"" he said.  ""begin your dance.""  ==  a gray morning.  cold drizzle kept many in their tents, but the news of the night's tragedy had already swept through camp like wildfire.  lord whent had dispatched his master at arms and several guards to follow their trail, but the rain had all but wiped it away.  there was no sign of the brigands who had attacked the camp.  nearly everyone had heard the story by now - how the two greatest knights of the kingsguard were toasting each other's health after the feast, and how they were set upon by murderous thieves in the darkness, no doubt unaware of who they had chosen for their prey.  taken by surprise and surrounded on all sides, they had still managed to withstand the assault and drive off their attackers.  but their victory came at a price.  ser barristan the bold had lost an eye; the sword of the morning had lost his life.  ser barristan told all who would listen of how ser arthur had stood over him after he had been felled by a slash to the face, driving off this man and that before finally taking a blade in his side.  he told of ser arthur's last words, thanking the gods for his king and for the chance to die in battle.  he told of the tears he unashamedly wept as ser arthur died, and of his vow to find the men responsible.    all agreed that it would make a fine song, though a sad one.  and if it wasn't exactly true, ser barristan thought, it was at least true enough.",0,

334651,"what do you mean?  what i (and others) are talking about is the way that we identify people of african descent in america, specifically americans who can trace their personal histories back to africa.  i have made the point at times past that all people, ultimately, are from africa, and therefore we should all be called african-americans, but i was shouted down.  we have been told that we must call very light skinned americans of european descent ""white"" or ""caucasian,"" but that we should not call the american's of african descent negroid, negro,  nigger, nigga, darkie, colored, jungle-bunny, spear-chunker or porch-monkey.  we're just looking for a non-offensive way of describing the ethnic reality of a person for identification purposes.  african-american seems to be the descriptive phrase of choice today.  it is, apparently, perfectly acceptable for non-white, non-jewish, non-asian, non-hispanic americans to refer to caucasian (or ""white"") people as, honkey, red-neck, cracker, light-bread, or whitey.  we are not allowed to be offended when someone uses a disparaging term to describe us.  it's also, apparently, fine when an american of african descent calls another american of african descent by one of the offensive terms, such as negro or nigger.  these terms are apparently only offensive coming from a white person.  in fact, seemingly all speech that is found issuing from the mouths of a white person can be interpreted as offensive by an american of african descent, while the opposite is never true.  we are apparently not allowed to be offended.",1,1
960636,"i think the confusion is that i thought this was a chart showing how much weight you should be lifting if you've been training for this length of time, listed by body weight. my whole point was that you can't really account for everyone in that manner just by using body weight because there are too many factors.  you are saying this chart is one that shows weightlifting competition weight classes, and then what level that weight class is in based off the amount weight they are currently lifting. &lt;- this makes sense  i think there was so much confusion because we were both arguing our side but not arguing based off the same facts. i think i understand the chart now, but i'm still a bit confused about why there is a un-trained section(maybe for those just starting?) anyway, when i read the chart now in a context of only weightlifting competitions it makes sense now.  i think we are good now.",0,
488024,"i was working at a burger joint around 10pm and 3 large bald  caucasian fellows with swastika tatoos came in and made a bee-line for the bathroom. i was busy so i didn't see when they left but then a frantic old man came up and said we have an issue in the restroom and need to fix it!! i figured ""ok old man i'll get to it when i get to it"" and went and looked, they had made a hard plug out of what must have been 2 or 3 rolls of tp and clogged the toilet then filled it up with diarrhea and then drew swastikas in fecal matter all over the walls and the mirror and also plugged and filled the urinal. i just went palefaced and went to my manager and said ""errr umm yeah holy crap"" and she said ""well get to it!"" i was 15 at the time so i didn't know this should have been declared a biohazard and it should have been roped off and wait for professional cleanup crew. nope i cleaned it with paper towels.   after that the manager came in to ""inspect"" and she said it was pretty clean but then she took her finger nail and scraped it around the inside of the toilet bowl (with all the holes where the water comes out) and found some crusties and said ""well you aren't done yet"" then even at 15 i told her where to stick it and the next day i told her boss and he agreed i should not have cleaned that and gave me a week of free double cheeseburgers, though i couldn't eat for 3 days.   oh there was another one where i was working in a computer store, and a family of 3 came in ""mom-dad-son"" and they were dressed like they wrote the white trash manual. the dad had a tight t-shirt with a denim vest and a bandanna, the mom had like a old tattered sun dress and the son about 7 years old was in a white tank top with his head shaved and shorts and flip flops. anyhow they were looking around and the son's shoulder bumped a game that was barely teetering on a shelf and knocked it down. we had shallow shelves so software boxes were always falling down, the kid didn't have time to even pick up the box to put it back before his dad was holding him in the air with one hand and repeatedly closed-fist punching him in the face and body. i was stunned, but a very large employee and 2 customers tackled the guy and held him down until the police came. the whole time the wife just watched sort of stunned but not like it was anything new, she didn't say any words before, during, or after. also while 2 guys were holding the dad, right before the police showed up the third guy kicked him in the nuts so hard he flew up in the air about 3 feet. i dunno what happened to the dad, hopefully still in jail, but the employee got an assault charge for kicking the guy in the nuts because we gave the security cam tape to the cops. i feel bad for whatever that kid has endured before and after that incident. the employee said he was familliar with the guy, he was a regular that came in and screamed at the employees when a game required more power than his computer had, or if he muted his speakers and we refused to come to his house to unmute them for free even though he bought the speakers there.",1,

713061,"try before you buy. sigma have improved their qa significantly, so the old reservations about their products should be revisited, but i would definitely buy from someone with a good returns policy in case you don't get a really sharp one.   sharpness is critical at 1.4  i actually picked up the af-s 1.4 yesterday at my favourite store in london, apertureuk.com. second hand and in good condition.   £230 versus rrp of £320.   cheap enough to take a punt on a lens of this calibre, and my old 50 1.8 af-d is getting very long in the tooth (20+ years old)  i did try a sigma 50 1.4 as well and was very impressed.   build quality is fantastic. it's hefty, both heavier and larger than the nikon and verging on 85mm 1.4 sized front element, though not as long.   the few in store shots i took with the d3s showed that it seemed ever so slightly cooler than the nikon. the nikon just made skin that little less pale, particularly where the light was reflecting the overhead lights more, like on collarbones, high foreheads.    bokeh was enjoyable on both, but i'll give that one to the sigma, with the edge bokeh on the nikon just a little more ""busy"" on detailed background elements, such as writing on store boxes and adverts behind the model (salesman). the sigma simple smushed the contrast between black monfrotto labelling and the white cardboard it was printed on.   this is something i'd heard about the sigma and was pleased to spot it for myself.   remember though, that you will be losing the edges i was scrutinising, on your dx mount, so ymmv.   bokeh was comparable more near the centre.  both lenses are really sharp in the centre.  focus is slow in the nikon, there's no doubt, when you go from a near object to a far one, but how often do you do that? tracking a moving person through the store in af-c mode kept them in focus without issue, same with the sigma.   i wouldn't say the sigma is any faster to focus, but its motor is a little noisier than the nikon so it may appear that it is jumping to attention when you switch from a near to a far object.  both lenses can hunt when you try it in dim light on a bad af target that has low contrast. (grey balance card against a black background)  ultimately my choice was personal.   the nikon is a much more portable lens being smaller and less of a planning event to decide if you should chuck it in your bag. af is less of an issue for how i use this lens.   primarily, the price won out.   if i could have found the sigma at that price, i guess i would have gone that route without a worry.",0,
871921,"&gt; since the idf is a tool of oppression that perpetuates the apartheid its understandable why they would refuse. but no, the institutional discrimination is predominately due to the fact that they're arab since israel is a racist, apartheid state.  so israel is racist because it's racist. circular logic. your premise is the conclusion by reiteration.  &gt; go read some books. you're clueless.  again, rhetoric like this is childish.  &gt; https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/palestinian_people#ancestral_origins  i buy the idea that some palestinians are descendants of the original samaritans that lived there.  however, if you want to play the 'ancestral lands' card, the jews have that one too. then you're just arguing over who was there 'first', 'for real'.",0,
622384,"looking abroad at some other specific countries, canada, as of 2001, had a population containing nearly four million ""visible minorities"", a number constituting to 13% of the total population.  blacks—whether caribbean or sub-saharan african in origin—represented 17% of these ""visible minorities"", or 2.23% of the total canadian population.  in absolute terms, this means that in 2001 blacks numbered 662,215 of the 30,007,094 individuals in canada.  in aggregate, “visible minorities” account for 11% of those incarcerated and 16% of those serving under community supervision; in other words, “visible minorities” are collectively *underrepresented* among those incarcerated and slightly overrepresented among those under community supervision.  it also interesting to note, though arguably of little significance, that “visible minority” offenders in canada are, unintuitively, less likely to be unemployed or single and are more highly educated on average than caucasian offenders.  however, when one individually examines the subgroups constituting “visible minorities”, it is revealed that blacks account for wholly 56% of “visible minority’s” incarcerated and 43% of “visible minority’s” serving time in the community.  this equates to an afro-canadian incarceration rate 3.21 times greater than euro-canadian incarceration rate; in comparison, afro-americans were incarcerated at a rate 6.71 times greater than euro-americans in 2009.     crime rates for specific offenses in canada show blacks are 2.98 times more likely to commit murder than caucasians, 5.97 times as likely to *attempt* murder, 2.92 times as likely to commit sexual assault, 4.22 times as likely to commit robbery, and 4.03 times as likely to commit assault.  the racial discrepancy in rates for comparable offenses in the united states can be found above.  in summary of the above, a few selected quotes pertaining to crime in canada:  &gt;this study found that, in comparison to their proportion in the canadian population, *caucasian and asian offenders are under-represented, while black offenders are disproportionately represented.* [emphasis mine]  &gt;among visible minority offenders, black offenders tend to exhibit more problem areas than asian or ""other visible minority"" offenders.  so, the general outlines of the trend—blacks have crime rates several-fold larger than whites—described previously for the united states *is* consistent with a similar quantitative analysis for canada.  furthermore, this trend is far from limited to just these two countries.  for instance, it is also evident in great britain as the follow quotes show:   &gt;ashworth and davies (1997) found higher representation of afro-caribbean offenders in prisons in england and wales (11% versus 1.5% of the country’s population),…  &gt;elkins &amp; olagundoye (2001) found that black offenders in england/wales comprise about six times their proportion in the population,…  and if there were still any doubts as to the degree in which african crime rates in anglo-speaking countries are truly representative of africans as a whole—in contrast to being merely anomalous trends arising, for whatever reason, within specific contexts involving the close interaction of anglos and africans—then their consistency with proportionally-weight, cross-national comparisons between predominantly caucasoid and negroid country’s crime rates should dispel any remaining qualms.  such a comparison, involving seven east asian; forty-five european; and twenty-two african or black caribbean countries, produces violent crime rates per 100,000 individuals of thirty-five (35), forty-two (42), and 149 respectively.  id est, in accord with the racial discrepancies in crime rates found within anglo-countries, cross-national comparisons show countries with populations predominantly derivative of a negroid stock have violent crime rates 3.55 times greater than those predominantly derivative of a caucasoid stock and 4.26 times greater than those of predominantly derivative of a mongoloid stock.  fully corresponding with the above, interpol also reports black crime rates—meaning murder, rape, and serious assault—as being 3.55 times higher than whites in 1996, despite the much more comprehensive crime rate methodologies practiced in predominantly caucasian countries in comparison to predominantly sub-saharan african.   finally, as described at the very beginning, these disparities in racial crime rates are not recent anomalies, but reflect a long-term trend existent since crime rates were first reliably quantified.  this would seem to indicate that the statistics are a reasonably accurate abstraction of reality.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   so, to conclude, i’m neither attempting to justify nor exonerate anyone or anything, neither implying an etiology nor offering a solution; instead, i simply act as the messenger: bearing the news, so to speak, of a problem far-reaching but little discussed.  there’s an elephant in the room, an elephant many americans have become quite adept at ignoring, but whose presence looms as large as ever.

859301,"i've been vegetarian since i was six years old, and now eat mostly vegan.  i am frequently asked how i manage to get enough protein/calcium/b-vitamins/iron, etc.  to be honest, i never worry about it - i've checked a few times and on average i get more than enough of everything. the fact is, it's really easy to get all your proteins and minerals, provided you eat a balanced vegetarian diet, not just a meat-based diet minus the meat.  yes, you will risk not getting enough nutrients if you eat only side dishes, and you'll find your food very bland.  try, as much as possible, to make complete veggie meals - it'll help you miss meat less.  one easy rule i like to follow to make sure i'm getting enough of everything is the ""rainbow diet"".  as long as i'm eating lots of different colours of foods, chances are i'm getting all my nutrients.  if all my food is brown, or only 2 colours, i should probably be adding something else.  here are some of my favourite meals:  slightly tricky meals (take ~ 1 hour to prepare):  * baked potatoes heaped with salsa, refried beans or black beans, salsa, cheddar or goat cheese, broccoli, green peppers, tomatoes and homemade guacamole, served with corn on the cob (dipped in butter, rubbed with lemon and sprinkled in hot chili pepper flakes and freshly ground black pepper)  * vegetarian chili made with various kinds of beans (canned is fine), chili powder, cumin and hot peppers, onions, green peppers, sweet corn, mushrooms and veggie burger crumbles or tvp  * ""mexican"" brown rice cooked with tomatoes, cilantro, cumin, hot sauce, prepared salsa, and mixed with beans, corn, peas, olives and other assorted veggies.  * tortilla lasagna made with layers of corn tortillas or polenta, stir-fried veggies (i use green peppers, onions, sweet corn, black beans, hot peppers and mushrooms, sometimes potatoes and carrots), prepared enchilada sauce and cheese or nutritional yeast (or a combination) on top. although the black beans and nutritional yeast already have lots of protein, sometimes i also add crumbled veggie burger or texturized vegetable protein for extra protein.  easy meals ( take &lt; 30 minutes to prepare):  * spinach salad made with baby spinach, pecan or almond slivers, sunflower or pumpkin seeds, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries or mandarin slices, dried cranberries and goat cheese or tofu cubes.  * microwave lentil stew made with canned lentils, coconut milk, garam masala, cumin seeds, ginger puree (i buy it in a tube), green chili paste (also from a tube) served with white basmati rice or quinoa and a side salad (those salad-in-a-bag kits are great when you need a quick side dish)  * noodles (i like using soba buckwheat noodles or thick chewy udon noodles for this) with stir-fried veggies(i like using broccoli, sweet peppers, onions, snow peas, bok choy, carrots, baby corn, tofu cubes - when i'm in a rush i use string beans and baby carrots)  and peanut sauce (just dump some chili paste, peanut butter and soy sauce into the skillet when you're about halfway done the veggies)  * whole-wheat pasta with tomato sauce (from a can) and veggies (zucchini, carrot, broccoli, mushrooms, celery, onion) mixed into the sauce as it's cooking.  this also goes well with tvp or veggieburger crumbles.    *  whole-wheat pasta with basil pesto and finely chopped kale (the kale adds lots of nutrients as well as texture), sprinkled with nutritional yeast and served with a tomato salad and/or grilled tofu  * chickpea salad made with canned chickpeas, green and black olives, chopped onion, sweet peppers, celery and cucumber, olive oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper to taste.  quick snacks or insta-meals:  * oatmeal with nuts, dried fruit, sliced apple and/or maple syrup topping  * pita bread or veggie sticks dipped in hummus (i make huge batches of my own, but it's also available premade at most grocery stores)  * apple slices or celery dipped in peanut butter  * trail mix ( i like mixing my own - lots of nuts, dried fruit and sometimes chocolate chips)  * easy fruit smoothie made with bananas, frozen fruit (i like blueberries, strawberries and peaches), yogurt or silken tofu.",0,

440187,"my job requires that i go to las vegas at least once a month. many people are jealous when i tell them this. personally, i am not a big fan of the place. i find las vegas to be inauthentic, insincere, and the biggest rip-off since the pet rock. the strip is wall-to-wall tourists and the outlying suburbs are rather bleak.  i am not a gambler in any sense. once a month i go up there, check into one of the strip hotels, and spend the days covering the company's vegas markets. i go back to the hotel and crash. no fun for me!  i was just there last week and believe me, if diarrhea were money, i would be the loosest slot around.  i was lucky enough to score a room at the palms casino and resort at a rate i could justify to the bean-counters at corporate. i like the palms. it caters to an adult crowd, so i didn't have to deal with the discount vegas riffraff one finds at places like the stratosphere, where the throngs of white trash country folk bring their kids into the casino. the palms is expensive and has a rather erotic theme, which keeps the elderly gambling addicts away, too. the rooms are luxurious; the bed in mine was more comfy then the bed at home.  it was with much surprise, then, that when i ordered a thirty-dollar tuna fish sandwich from room service, i noticed a funny taste to it. i had gotten up that morning at four am to catch my flight and had just finished eight hours at work; my judgment must have been shot, because i was hungry and tired and i just didn't have the sense to stop eating it. fatigue can really be dangerous. somewhere in the back of my mind, i considered that this sandwich might give me food poisoning -- but like a robot, i continued to eat it.  i felt fine until about noon the following day.  i was at work, simply walking along, when i started hearing disturbing sounds from my abdomen. gurgles, whines, and pops seemed to be emanating from my belly as if my bowels were boiling water like a teakettle. i felt no cramps, which was good -- but i did feel a strange looseness in my intestines. i wasn't in panic mode, but i figured i should try and get to a toilet and offload the percolating tar in my colon.  i went to a men's room and was confronted with the last thing a person with fizzing internal liquishit wants to see: an ""out of order"" sign on the single crapper. the crapper was locked from the inside. i have no idea how they managed it, but they locked it tight.  my bowels are directly connected to my brain, so as soon as i read the sign and tried the door, the bubbly looseness in my guts instantly ramped up. i needed a toilet, fast! i quickly went through my options. i thought about crawling on the floor under the door and trying my luck with the broken toilet. i had no idea what condition the toilet was in. it could have been filled to the brim with the diarrhea of dozens of people; or it could be waterless altogether. once i was done, though, i would have to deal with the workplace politics of having been the guy who decimated the toilet and would probably be obligated to fix it. i pictured myself red-faced and plunging.  i decided i would hit the street and try to find a nearby store with a toilet. i only hoped i could make it. in addition to feeling loose, my bowels now felt strangely hot. i was breaking out into a nauseated sweat. i hightailed it out of there into the ninety-nine-degree desert sun and saw a compusa store next door. i went inside and made a beeline for the toilet.  unfortunately, there wasn't one. i am sure the staff had one somewhere in the back, but there was no toilet for customers. damn.  my sphincter was starting to throb. i could literally feel the liquishit sloshing with every step. i left the store doing the duck walk. i could feel the staff giving me the fuzzy eyeball.  next door to this place was a tj maxx. i went in and spied the customer washrooms. i had to run -- that, or subject the store to a fecal supernova.  i entered the most revolting washroom i had seen in a long time. there was shit on the stall walls, piss all over both toilet seats, and no paper towels. i sat my ass down on a pissy seat because i had no time to wipe it up and there were no ass-gaskets. i detonated my explosive diarrhea like a suicide bomber -- and i say ""explosive"" because it literally exploded out of my anus, splattering the walls of the bowl with hot, brown shrapnel. foamy tuna-bile hosed out of my body and filled the air with a stink that frightened me. what was going on inside me to make such a stink? wave after wave of this wretched foam sloshed out. i did a courtesy flush. not a courtesy to anyone in the washroom, because i was alone -- no, just a self-courtesy flush.  i wiped up with the cheap toilet paper and left, feeling clammy and queasy. my guts were still making noise.  i had only been at work that day for three hours, but with a broken toilet and a scary case of the squirts, there was no way i was going to stick around. i wanted to get back to my hotel and stick close to my toilet-away-from-home. but this added another problem. you see, traffic in las vegas is terrible all the time, thanks to a rapidly growing population and roads littered with tourists in rental cars who have no idea where they are going. it would take me at least an hour to get back to my hotel, and i was sure that i was going to have another attack before then. i could feel it. i also thought i might puke, as most food poisoning starts with a diarrhea and follows-up with puke and more diarrhea.  i was driving a rental car. had it been my own car, i would have taken the risk of shitting my pants in it; but a rental car has to be returned. i could imagine myself bringing it back with a big ol' squishy shitstain on the driver's seat. not a pleasant fantasy by any stretch of the imagination.  i put my jacket on the seat and got in the car. it was a hundred and twenty degrees in there. i began to drive back to the strip. after ten minutes, i felt another attack coming. more bubbling noises -- louder this time. i scanned the landscape for an oasis of toilets and saw an arby's sign. i pulled the car into the parking lot with a screech of tires and ran inside. at this point, my bowels were thinkin' arby's.  this toilet made the one at tj maxx look like shangri-la. this one didn't even have a toilet seat.  i sat on the seatless can and nearly fell in as my pucker-hole vomited hot excrement on all sides of the bowl. my abdomen shrunk with each spasm and my anus burned with the acridness of it. my poor bunghole was screaming in pain; i could see 'roids in my future.  i crawled back in the car and drove back to the hotel, nauseated. i stayed in my room and had a few more attacks. i didn't eat dinner.  even after it ended, there were still aftereffects, some of which i am experiencing as i type this story. you see, to stop the flow of liquishit while traveling i wolfed down two imodium and two pepto-bismol tablets. it stopped the immediate shit storm, but it caused all manner of other problems. i became constipated and racked with stabbing gas pains that haunted me through my flight home and still to this day. i am shitting somewhat normally now, but i continue to have outrageous gas.",1,
238956,"for germany: neutralize great britain and destroy the soviet union.   this means that a successful invasion of great britain must occur as early as possible in spring 1941, and the strategic areas of london and the midlands must be quickly occupied. fighting can still be going on by late april, but the key industrial centers and ports must be in german hands so that victory is assured on logistics alone.   then, the wehrmacht has to efficiently turn around, re-supply and re-arm, and deploy to the eastern border. d-day for operation barbarossa is may 10. okw - german high command - is faced with the difficult task of ensuring that the forces in england are minimized but still sufficient for the task at hand; the operational concept is to deploy as many formations to the eastern front as possible, with units in england serving as reinforcements once the british have been completely subdued.  mussolini also must be reined in. german diplomats in italy have to be much tougher than they historically were with him, and the german government has to see through mussolini's boasts and have an accurate picture of his combat capabilities. a reinforced division could be dispatched to help stiffen italian forces in libya - presumably they are facing lighter british opposition in egypt since supplies and reinforcements are staying in england, but the regio esercito is still likely overmatched; they were that bad, and led by perhaps one of the worst generals in history, graziani. the key demand is that mussolini delay his plans to conquer yugoslavia and greece in favor of first defeating the menace of comintern.  operation barbarossa must proceed perfectly. hitler cannot interfere and order the panzers to halt to allow infantry formations to catch up; this just gave the red army time to set up strong defensive positions. more importantly, army group center must keep driving toward moscow instead of slowing down to assist army group south in the enforcement and destruction of soviet forces at kiev and engaging in a slow-moving envelopment at smolensk. guderian's panzers should be on parade in red square before the autumn rain and mud season begins. ideally, leningrad should be captured as well, and the important industry of the donets basin of ukraine should be neutralized, but if moscow is captured these can wait until the 1942 fighting season. okw must also realize that the war will not be won before winter, and thus must be prepared for cold weather.   with moscow captured, vital rail and communications lines cut, and the bulk of the red army's best formations destroyed or dispersed, the soviet union may very well fall apart then and there; if not, victory is at least more likely, as forces can be redeployed for powerful assaults on leningrad and the south (the eventual goals are stalingrad and the baku oilfields). the third reich's best option now is for a negotiated settlement or the installment of a puppet state east of the line archangel-moscow-stalingrad-baku; controlling and administering the newly conquered *lebensraum* will already take vast resources, and adding on the urals and siberia would just be too much.  at some point british egypt should be conquered and friendly puppets installed in iran, iraq, the levant, and palestine. germany isn't too keen on administering france or the british isles, so the remainder of france is restored to the vichy regime, and a friendly fascist state that recognizes that englishmen are aryans too is set up in britain.  note that hitler's plan reversed the two main goals: conquer russia and the uk will be forced to the negotiating table.  meanwhile, in asia... things aren't quite so rosy. japan needs to do two things as well: deal with china somehow, and neutralize the us in the pacific. the second is simpler, if not easy: win a decisive victory at midway, crippling the american carrier force in the pacific. an optional follow-on would be an invasion of the hawaiian islands, though given the distances involved, this would be a difficult endeavor. either way, the us navy needs to be broken, and an axis victory must be a *fait accompli* before the huge american industrial advantage can be brought to bear on japan.  china is a more difficult problem that, frankly, there's no good solution to. japan historically did about as well as can be expected. it's simply impossible for the imperial army to subdue china and control that many people. japan must do its best to obtain a limited victory at the negotiating table, retaining and expanding its holdings in the north (via its puppet manchukuo under the emperor pu-yi), annexing key ports on the eastern seaboard like tianjin, qingdao, shanghai, xiamen and guangzhou/hong kong, and obtaining favorable trade terms with the republic of china.  japan must also control the dutch east indies, malaya, and southern burma for vital natural resources. the philippines, new guinea, and the main islands of melanesia must also be conquered for strategic depth. conquering and possibly colonized australia is extra credit.  once this is done, japan and germany can sit down at the negotiating table with the united states and what's left of the british empire. they can afford to be somewhat lenient: normalization of relations, a perpetual guarantee of unhindered oil exports from the us to japan and resumption of free trade among the parties, recognition of german and japanese conquests as legitimate. nobody has any interest in invading north america; as admiral yamamoto said, ""you cannot invade the united states; there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass"". india is too big for either germany or japan to administer on top of their other holdings. nobody cares about africa or south america.  note that all of this happens before nuclear weapons are developed, and they are never used.  what would happen next? probably a cold war, but a cold war on steroids. the three sides - yes, three; japan and germany really have nothing in common beyond their alliance of convenience - engage in realpolitik, jockeying for an advantage. germany is the strongest on paper, with the largest economy, but administering its vast holdings in russia proves to be a huge drain on its actual power. the us is still an industrial powerhouse, but holds the title of ""loser"" for years to come - loser of a war it barely fought. japan comes in third, and continues to struggle to implement its greater east asian co-prosperity sphere, but at least it has secured the natural resources it so dearly needs.  proxy wars are fought - american-aligned brazil against german-aligned argentina; one chinese warlord against another; african bush wars in places nobody has heard of. one side develops nuclear weapons, and the other two quickly follow. brinksmanship becomes commonplace, and air raid drills are a regular feature of life in sapporo, san francisco, and stettin.  one day - perhaps it's in 1961 - somebody pushes too far. an ailing and increasingly delusional hitler is placing forces, including nuclear-tipped missiles, in places the other two would rather not have them: cuba and the russian pacific coast. he has judged the new american president, kennedy, more interested in partying than in foreign policy, and probably a jew to boot. the japanese government is also undergoing a reshuffling in its ruling clique, whose intrigues and complications are a byzantine game known only to the japanese. he has misjudged kennedy and whoever is in charge in japan, badly. kennedy issues a statement - cuba is under blockade; nazi germany must immediately end deployments there, or face the consequences.   a confident hitler presses on. a new fleet of cargo vessels is on its way, and its naval escort is bolstered. the us navy takes up position to intercept. the world watches as the two move closer and closer, until... shots are fired. ships have been sunk on both sides. the german fleet withdraws per its rules of engagement.  without the horrors of hiroshima and nagasaki to reflect upon, there is no theory of mutually assured destruction. nuclear weapons are simply weapons - very powerful weapons to be sure, ones that aren't used in petty proxy wars, but weapons nonetheless, to be used as part of a military strategy that leads to victory. hitler, on his deathbed from the stresses of ruling the third reich, will not spend his last days seeing the master race's honor tarnished. he orders a full strike on the united states.  in tokyo, things become very interesting. with war threatening in the atlantic, wouldn't this be the perfect time to remove the annoying german presence in vladivostok? surely hitler will see that he cannot fight both other superpowers at once, and will comply with this most reasonable request. the german response is no. furthermore, japanese agents have solid intelligence that the germans are shipping nuclear weapons to china. china is japan's sphere of influence; this meddling cannot be tolerated. there will be war.  and so ends the modern world. millions upon millions are killed in the nuclear holocaust.  tl;dr germany and japan were unlikely to win, if they did we all got nuked.",1,
724811,"nigger owners manual  congratulations on your purchase of a brand new nigger! if handled properly, your apeman will give years of valuable, if reluctant, service.  installing your nigger. you should install your nigger differently according to whether you have purchased the field or house model. field niggers work best in a serial configuration, i.e. chained together. chain your nigger to another nigger immediately after unpacking it, and don't even think about taking that chain off, ever. many niggers start singing as soon as you put a chain on them. this habit can usually be thrashed out of them if nipped in the bud. house niggers work best as standalone units, but should be hobbled or hamstrung to prevent attempts at escape. at this stage, your nigger can also be given a name. most owners use the same names over and over, since niggers become confused by too much data. rufus, rastus, remus, toby, carslisle, carlton, hey-you!-yes-you!, yeller, blackstar, and sambo are all effective names for your new buck nigger. if your nigger is a ho, it should be called latrelle, l'tanya, or jemima. some owners call their nigger hoes latrine for a joke. pearl, blossom, and ivory are also righteous names for nigger hoes. these names go straight over your nigger's head, by the way.  configuring your nigger owing to a design error, your nigger comes equipped with a tongue and vocal chords. most niggers can master only a few basic human phrases with this apparatus - ""muh dick"" being the most popular. however, others make barking, yelping, yapping noises and appear to be in some pain, so you should probably call a vet and have him remove your nigger's tongue. once de-tongued your nigger will be a lot happier - at least, you won't hear it complaining anywhere near as much. niggers have nothing interesting to say, anyway. many owners also castrate their niggers for health reasons (yours, mine, and that of women, not the nigger's). this is strongly recommended, and frankly, it's a mystery why this is not done on the boat  housing your nigger. your nigger can be accommodated in cages with stout iron bars. make sure, however, that the bars are wide enough to push pieces of nigger food through. the rule of thumb is, four niggers per square yard of cage. so a fifteen foot by thirty foot nigger cage can accommodate two hundred niggers. you can site a nigger cage anywhere, even on soft ground. don't worry about your nigger fashioning makeshift shovels out of odd pieces of wood and digging an escape tunnel under the bars of the cage. niggers never invented the shovel before and they're not about to now. in any case, your nigger is certainly too lazy to attempt escape. as long as the free food holds out, your nigger is living better than it did in africa, so it will stay put. buck niggers and hoe niggers can be safely accommodated in the same cage, as bucks never attempt sex with black hoes.  feeding your nigger. your nigger likes fried chicken, corn bread, and watermelon. you should therefore give it none of these things because its lazy ass almost certainly doesn't deserve it. instead, feed it on porridge with salt, and creek water. your nigger will supplement its diet with whatever it finds in the fields, other niggers, etc. experienced nigger owners sometimes push watermelon slices through the bars of the nigger cage at the end of the day as a treat, but only if all niggers have worked well and nothing has been stolen that day. mike of the old ranch plantation reports that this last one is a killer, since all niggers steal something almost every single day of their lives. he reports he doesn't have to spend much on free watermelon for his niggers as a result. you should never allow your nigger meal breaks while at work, since if it stops work for more than ten minutes it will need to be retrained. you would be surprised how long it takes to teach a nigger to pick cotton. you really would. coffee beans? don't ask. you have no idea.  making your nigger work. niggers are very, very averse to work of any kind. the nigger's most prominent anatomical feature, after all, its oversized buttocks, which have evolved to make it more comfortable for your nigger to sit around all day doing nothing for its entire life. niggers are often good runners, too, to enable them to sprint quickly in the opposite direction if they see work heading their way. the solution to this is to *dupe* your nigger into working. after installation, encourage it towards the cotton field with blows of a wooden club, fence post, baseball bat, etc., and then tell it that all that cotton belongs to a white man, who won't be back until tomorrow. your nigger will then frantically compete with the other field niggers to steal as much of that cotton as it can before the white man returns. at the end of the day, return your nigger to its cage and laugh at its stupidity, then repeat the same trick every day indefinitely. your nigger comes equipped with the standard nigger iq of 75 and a memory to match, so it will forget this trick overnight. niggers can start work at around 5am. you should then return to bed and come back at around 10am. your niggers can then work through until around 10pm or whenever the light fades.  entertaining your nigger. your nigger enjoys play, like most animals, so you should play with it regularly. a happy smiling nigger works best. games niggers enjoy include: 1) a good thrashing: every few days, take your nigger's pants down, hang it up by its heels, and have some of your other niggers thrash it with a club or whip. your nigger will signal its intense enjoyment by shrieking and sobbing. 2) lynch the nigger: niggers are cheap and there are millions more where yours came from. so every now and then, push the boat out a bit and lynch a nigger.  lynchings are best done with a rope over the branch of a tree, and niggers just love to be lynched. it makes them feel special. make your other niggers watch. they'll be so grateful, they'll work harder for a day or two (and then you can lynch another one). 3) nigger dragging: tie your nigger by one wrist to the tow bar on the back of suitable vehicle, then drive away at approximately 50mph. your nigger's shrieks of enjoyment will be heard for miles. it will shriek until it falls apart. to prolong the fun for the nigger, do *not* drag him by his feet, as his head comes off too soon. this is painless for the nigger, but spoils the fun. always wear a seatbelt and never exceed the speed limit. 4) playing on the pnl: a variation on (2), except you can lynch your nigger out in the fields, thus saving work time. niggers enjoy this game best if the pnl is operated by a man in a tall white hood. 5) hunt the nigger: a variation of hunt the slipper, but played outdoors, with dobermans. warning: do not let your dobermans bite a nigger, as they are highly toxic.  disposal of dead niggers. niggers die on average at around 40, which some might say is 40 years too late, but there you go. most people prefer their niggers dead, in fact. when yours dies, report the license number of the car that did the drive-by shooting of your nigger. the police will collect the nigger and dispose of it for you.  common problems with niggers - my nigger is very aggresive have it put down, for god's sake. who needs an uppity nigger? what are we, short of niggers or something?  my nigger keeps raping white women they all do this. shorten your nigger's chain so it can't reach any white women, and arm heavily any white women who might go near it.  will my nigger attack me? not unless it outnumbers you 20 to 1, and even then, it's not likely. if niggers successfully overthrew their owners, they'd have to sort out their own food. this is probably why nigger uprisings were nonexistent (until some fool gave them rights).  my nigger bitches about its ""rights"" and ""racism"". yeah, well, it would. tell it to shut the fuck up.  my nigger's hide is a funny color. - what is the correct shade for a nigger? a nigger's skin is actually more or less transparent. that brown color you can see is the shit your nigger is full of. this is why some models of nigger are sold as ""the shitskin"".  my nigger acts like a nigger, but is white. what you have there is a ""wigger"". rough crowd. wow!  is that like an albino? are they rare? they're as common as dog shit and about as valuable. in fact, one of them was president between 1992 and 2000. put your wigger in a cage with a few hundred genuine niggers and you'll soon find it stops acting like a nigger. however, leave it in the cage and let the niggers dispose of it. the best thing for any wigger is a dose of tnb.  my nigger smells really bad and you were expecting what?  should i store my dead nigger? when you came in here, did you see a sign that said ""dead nigger storage""? .that's because there ain't no goddamn sign.",1,1

930193,"i'm a white guy. black women don't even really show up on my radar as women for the most part because of the way the great majority of them that i have encountered look, sound, and act. i don't have any desire to have sex with them and don't want to be in relationships with them. i'm friendly with them - at work, for example, or just out in whatever social situation - but they just don't register. some of my friends fantasize about banging a black girl one time in what i guess is a sort urge for something exotic or taboo, but i've never had that fantasy or urge. deliberately trying to jack it to them doesn't work. they never wander into my jack fantasies, which otherwise have a cast of thousands wandering in and out. my eyes go right past them in a crowd.    i'm much more inclined to want to be around the ones who don't talk black (let's don't get started on that- i know you know what i mean). in fact, i can't stand to hear black talk. it sounds uneducated, brash, and coarse, and often deliberately so. toss in the dark skin, unappealingly different kind of hair, alien hairstyles, usually overweight, differently shaped bodies, seemingly deliberately exaggerated social behavior, attitude, and volume and it's like we're talking about a different species. this is the majority of black women i've encountered in my life in one of the blackest cities in the country. they're not feminine to me in the slightest. i would never date or have sex with them. i'm guessing it's mutual because only one has ever come after me and she was nuts.   when it comes to the ones who don't talk black, i've wondered whether i would date one. surprisingly it's the talking and acting white, or rather the lack of talking and acting black, that makes so much more difference than the skin color for me, though the skin color does matter. white women who talk black and even try to look black (clothes, hair, mannerisms) horrify me. what the hell are you doing? to me they are absurd, sad, pathetic caricatures who are going through some kind of delusional psycho-social trauma. it's fake and awful. not in a million years would i date one who spoke and acted that way. it's the same way with white guys who try to act black - i want to slap them until they stop it.   but on the other hand when i think about a black woman who doesn't talk black or act out or make a clown of herself in public, who is intelligent, educated, funny, cultured, socially adept, and nice to talk to, i think i'd almost do it under the right conditions. you could fall in love with someone like that and then you wouldn't really be focusing on the individual different attributes you might not have favored otherwise. i still think it's very unlikely given my social setting but it could happen, hearts needing hearts and life paths being random. it wouldn't hurt if she had lighter skin and less emphasized negroid facial features and body style. when i see black women or partially black women whose facial features and hair look pretty much white (e.g., alicia keys' face), they look pretty similar to a white girl with a good tan, and both of those can look pretty good. but i remember a dark skinned black woman i used to work with who had a broad, flat nose, big lips, characteristically black hairstyle and a characteristically black-shaped behind who i could have seen something happening with due to her other great qualities and lack of disqualifying black ones if things had ever headed in that direction. the physical aspects in this case didn't disqualify her.   and in terms of being friends with black guys - the ones with a background more like mine, who just seem normal, intelligent, nice, and who don't talk or act black in the offensive way are much more appealing to me than some redneck or guido or some other offensive type of white guy. i avoid the latter like the plague and would invite the former to my place for a dinner or a party and want to be real live actual friends. i haven't interacted with many black guys like this but have noticed how much more appealing they were when i did. so it's got to be culture that's the issue, the behaviors we subconsciously expect from people and the way we interpret actions and cues and signifiers.   i'm attracted to many fewer asian girls than white girls in general due to physical and often cultural differences, but they aren't a turnoff or invisible in the same way most black women are. american-born or americanized asians who look and act more like white girls and are otherwise just attractive relative to other asians are certainly candidates. i had a lot of fun sex with a hot korean girl for a while years ago. i pined after a taken korean girl i worked with for a long time and could totally have seen myself marrying her. i was interested in and curious about a taiwanese girl i studied with in a third country years ago. different race, different culture, difficult communication barrier, but the spark and potential were there.    i'm attracted to fewer latino girls than whites but plenty can be sexy. oddly it seems less likely that i'd ever wind up with one than, say, an asian, and that seems to be something cultural, maybe something about the family situation that often seems to come with it? it would seem to be less alien than a first/second generation asian family yet still seems less likely. maybe because i haven't mingled with many in my area that have a similar kind of suburbanish background? i can't put my finger on it, but i just don't really go looking for them and they don't seem particularly interested in me. realistically though, most of the ones i encounter in my area are lower class and newer immigrants. maybe it would be different in the southwest.   i'm attracted to a lot fewer subcontinental girls than whites but with a decent amount of exceptions. again there's often a fairly alien family/cultural situation that just makes for a different kind of vibe. but i used to want an indian woman i worked with who was only kind of attractive but just so nice and smart and fun. still had the accent but otherwise very mainstream american-seeming. and i crushed hard for a long time on another tender indian sweetie i worked with who was unfortunately married. and i came near to banging a steamy hot pakistani rebel girl i worked with too.   australian aborigines are right out. sorry! not really attracted to native peoples of the americas either. middle eastern? not enough exposure/data. it's oddly specific but in general i don't like a lot of the looks coming out of northeast african countries - that kind of black and arabic mix.    in general, give me a smart, cute, tender, blue-eyed, fair-skinned, willowy, rosy-cheeked white lass any day of the week. exceptions are possible but unlikely. black is extremely unlikely.   tldr: i'm white and i like white women. i disqualify black women a lot more than other races.",1,

world, there will be a bunch more, think of the 'one' as a percentage of people you encounter as potential matches and not one sole match, once you reach that match your percent drops to zero and you notice cause you dont feel like digging in that unknown percentage looking for another match anymore, its done, if you go off the 'one' approach, you dont see anything differently from one potential match to the next. not really, id think you need to fap it out to make sure. no i do not. not to that extreme, but i think people can become close to the edges if raised in such a way, and usually its

290573,"... the results to date of crash culpability studies have failed to demonstrate that drivers with cannabinoids in the blood are significantly more likely than drug-free drivers to be culpable in road crashes. … [in] cases in which thc was the only drug present were analyzed, the culpability ratio was found to be not significantly different from the no-drug group.”  reference: g. chesher and m. longo. 2002. cannabis and alcohol in motor vehicle accidents. in: f. grotenhermen and e. russo (eds.) cannabis and cannabinoids: pharmacology, toxicology, and therapeutic potential. new york: haworth press. pp. 313-323.  “cannabis leads to a more cautious style of driving, [but] it has a negative impact on decision time and trajectory. [however,] this in itself does not mean that drivers under the influence of cannabis represent a traffic safety risk. … cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving.”  reference: canadian senate special committee on illegal drugs. 2002. cannabis: summary report: our position for a canadian public policy. ottawa. chapter 8: driving under the influence of cannabis.  … evidence of impairment from the consumption of cannabis has been reported by studies using laboratory tests, driving simulators and on-road observation. ... both simulation and road trials generally find that driving behavior shortly after consumption of larger doses of cannabis results in (i) a more cautious driving style; (ii) increased variability in lane position (and headway); and (iii) longer decision times. whereas these results indicate a 'change' from normal conditions, they do not necessarily reflect 'impairment' in terms of performance effectiveness since few studies report increased accident risk.   reference: uk department of environment, transport and the regions (road safety division). 2000. cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary. crowthorne, berks: trl limited.  “overall, we conclude that the weight of the evidence indicates that:  there is no evidence that consumption of cannabis alone increases the risk of culpability for traffic crash fatalities or injuries for which hospitalization occurs, and may reduce those risks.  the evidence concerning the combined effect of cannabis and alcohol on the risk of traffic fatalities and injuries, relative to the risk of alcohol alone, is unclear.  it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the use of cannabis (with or without alcohol) leads to an increased risk of road traffic crashes causing less serious injuries and vehicle damage.”  reference: m. bates and t. blakely. 1999. “role of cannabis in motor vehicle crashes.” epidemiologic reviews 21: 222-232.  “in conclusion, marijuana impairs driving behavior. however, this impairment is mitigated in that subjects under marijuana treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired. where they can compensate, they do, for example by not overtaking, by slowing down and by focusing their attention when they know a response will be required. … effects on driving behavior are present up to an hour after smoking but do not continue for extended periods.  with respect to comparisons between alcohol and marijuana effects, these substances tend to differ in their effects. in contrast to the compensatory behavior exhibited by subjects under marijuana treatment, subjects who have received alcohol tend to drive in a more risky manner. both substances impair performance; however, the more cautious behavior of subjects who have received marijuana decreases the impact of the drug on performance, whereas the opposite holds true for alcohol.”  reference: a. smiley. 1999. marijuana: on-road and driving-simulator studies. in: h. kalant et al. (eds) the health effects of cannabis. toronto: center for addiction and mental health. pp. 173-191.  “intoxication with cannabis leads to a slight impairment of psychomotor … function. … [however,] the impairment in driving skills does not appear to be severe, even immediately after taking cannabis, when subjects are tested in a driving simulator. this may be because people intoxicated by cannabis appear to compensate for their impairment by taking fewer risks and driving more slowly, whereas alcohol tends to encourage people to take great risks and drive more aggressively.”  reference: uk house of lords select committee on science and technology. 1998. ninth report. london: united kingdom. chapter 4: section 4.7.  “the evidence suggests that marijuana presents a real, but secondary safety risk; and that alcohol is the leading drug-related accident risk factor.”  references: d. gieringer. 1988. marijuana, driving, and accident safety. journal of psychoactive drugs 20: 93-101.  crash culpability studies  “for each of 2,500 injured drivers presenting to a hospital, a blood sample was collected for later analysis.  there was a clear relationship between alcohol and culpability. … in contrast, there was no significant increase in culpability for cannabinoids alone. while a relatively large number of injured drivers tested positive for cannabinoids, culpability rates were no higher than those for the drug free group. this is consistent with other findings.”  reference: logan, m.c., hunter, c.e., lokan, r.j., white, j.m., &amp; white, m.a.

633043,"fuckloggingin already mentioned the arya versus the tickler scene, which (if i had to pick only one) would be my overall favourite.  i'm a big fan of dream sequences, so the tower of joy and the dany ""don't want to wake the dragon"" dreams are both great in agot (the bran dream ending with ""his name is summer"" is also damn good). one that i think gets underrated in acok is theon's nightmare of eating with the dead:  &gt; that night he dreamed of the feast ned stark had thrown when king robert came to winterfell. the hall rang with music and laughter, though the cold winds were rising outside. at first it was all wine and roast meat, and theon was making japes and eyeing the serving girls and having himself a fine time… until he noticed that the room was growing darker. the music did not seem so jolly then; he heard discords and strange silences, and notes that hung in the air bleeding. suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth, and when he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead. &gt; &gt; king robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly, and lord eddard was headless beside him. [...] &gt; &gt; but there were others with faces he had never known in life, faces he had seen only in stone. the slim, sad girl who wore a crown of pale blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore could only be lyanna. her brother brandon stood beside her, and their father lord rickard just behind. along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. the sight of them sent fear shivering through theon sharp as a knife. and then the tall doors opened with a crash, and a freezing gale blew down the hall, and robb came walking out of the night. grey wind stalked beside, eyes burning, and man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds.  ""...notes that hung in the air bleeding."" ah, i  love that line. :)  my second favourite scene is also from asos, the last tyrion chapter:  &gt; ""it was... a debt i owed you."" jaime's voice was strange. &gt; &gt; ""a debt?"" he cocked his head. ""i do not understand."" &gt; &gt; ""good. some doors are best left closed."" &gt; &gt; [...] &gt; &gt; *jaime is afraid*. ""tell me,"" tyrion said again. &gt;  &gt; his brother looked away. ""tysha,"" he said softly. &gt; &gt; ""tysha?"" his stomach tightened. ""what of her?"" &gt; &gt; ""she was no whore. i never bought her for you. that was a lie that father commanded me to tell. tysha was... she was what she seemed to be. a crofter's daughter, chance met on the road.""  if the series gets to that point, dinklage and coster-waldau had better do that scene justice, or i'll... um... i'll... complain on the internet! yeah, that'll show them. :)  one of my other favourites is only a page later - an short but utterly chilling varys monologue:  &gt; ""maegor the cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for his castle,"" varys replied. ""on the upper level, there are large cells where common criminals may be confined together. they have narrow windows set high in the walls. the second level has the smaller cells where highborn captives are held. they have no windows, but torches in the halls cast light through the bars. on the third level the cells are smaller and the doors are wood. the black cells, men call them. that was where you were kept, and eddard stark before you. but there is a level lower still. once a man is taken down to the fourth level, he never sees the sun again, nor hears a human voice, nor breathes a breath free of agonizing pain. maegor had the cells on the fourth level built for torment."" they had reached the bottom of the steps. an unlighted door opened before them. ""this is the fourth level. give me your hand, my lord. it is safer to walk in darkness here. there are things you would not wish to see.""  i have to admit though, the manderley line of awesomeness is really starting to grow on me... ""the north remembers, and this mummer's farce is almost done."" oh fuck yes. :)",0,
758130,"**anor:** anor is filled with golems. your best bet is to avoid them all together or have a lightning weapon. running straight will take you to the duke's archives, left is a campfire, and right will take you down. if you go down, you'll have to drop off an edge and run up a buttress to access a new area. walk across, drop down, and move through fog. pulling a lever will move a device in the center. going up that you'll be towards a large castle top. you can shoot the gargoyles here to make them fall off early. run past the golems, to the right, and down the steps. the two knights shooting dragon-slayer arrows can be outran. to get past them, move up and to the right, and get close enough so one bring out his sword and shield. the rest of this areas is just moving slow and careful, and be very aware of mimics. in the bottom floor where you meet sunbro, the back left room's fireplace has a secret wall you can access to gain a large weapon and shield. the boss for this area is two enemies. fighting them is fairly simple, just kite the small one away, then kill him. once you kill one, the other becomes stronger, but retains his attack patterns. after killing them you can talk to the princess, who give you both the lordvessel and the ability to warp to select campfires. note: talking to the princess before doing many things stops  you from joining select covenants. in the area before the boss, you can drop out a window up top to get a dragon-slayer longbow (the ammo is really expensive (500 a shot)).   **asylum:** taking the elevator down from the blacksmith in the tower, and getting off early will put you on top of some ruins. moving to the right will put you on a small hill. if you roll across you'll land on a buttress. on top of the house is a key, and if you go up the stairs you'll find a nest. sitting in a ball in the nest will let the crow take you back to the asylum. back at the aslyum just do everything you did before and you'll get a doll.  **painted world:** with the doll in hand, if you go back to anor, in the giant room you crossed early on with many enemies, there is a huge paining. activate it to go inside. once inside you cannot leave. this area is very simple. work your way through. at the later parts, in the underground area, the wheel enemies will be a lot of trouble unless you abuse corners and pull them one at a time. the boss will turn invisible, but isn't much a problem. if you hit her a few times she'll just come back. chopping off her tail will give you a good dagger.  **-----------lords-------------**  at this point in the game you're ready to fight the four lords. you can fight some earlier to gain access to certain covenants but the ability to warp makes things much easier.  **catacombs:** entrance is through the graveyard near the spawn. you need a divine  weapon, preferably blunt. the first area is pretty simple. the first boss is simple, find the real one and kill it. rinse repeat. once underground, work your way through until you find an npc. if you say you're not a cleric, and will be his friend, he'll push you down into a pit and you'll find the lantern.  **den of giants:** this area sucks. i honestly just find the nearest campfire and just run through it for each of my gravelord nito attempts. for gravelord nito, stick to the front of his area. if you move towards the back, you'll aggro large enemies. when his scream ends, dodge roll to avoid the impalement. when he does miasma, he'll kill nearby skeletons and you'll be free to attack.  **new londo:** to come here you need to be cursed or have an item called transient cursed. near the first ghosts is a bridge to a fire-keeper soul. move your way through and talk to the npc up top to get a key. open the doors and the water will flood out. the easiest way to skip this area is to go back to the first area you see ghosts to the back right corner. fall onto the wall, then onto the ground. run around, up the stairs, and to the left, dodging the large skeleton. you'll move into some grey mist. you'll need to equip the ring of the abyss to move on. drop down. this boss is simple but can be annoying. simple circle strafe and attack the boss when you can. when he casts aoe magic, backroll twice. the longer you take the more that spawn, so try to take them down fast.  **fire area:** this fire area has a copy of the first boss, but fire. afterwards is a centipede boss. chopping off it's largest head will give you a ring of lava-walking. just block the boss and attack after. the head does grow back. afterwards is just a mad dash past the bottom half of trexes. the first building has a chest and the second has a hidden wall with a bonfire. the lord here is simple. walk around the right hand side, and into his foot. attack and the floor will start to fall. continue around the edge to the left this time, and jump across the gap. hit the left foot. then make your way back to the center and the floor will fall. fall onto the root, roll forward through the brush, then hit and kill the boss.  **library:** dieing to the boss once is normal. it puts you in a cage and you can free the guy at the bottom to get a fire-keeper soul. in the library itself is simple.  **golem cave:** the golem cave is short and sweet. there are invisible bridges that you can some-what see by noticing where the falling crystals land. avoid moths and make your way through. towards the end area  bunch of clams, just run past. you first attempt at the boss they will join in and rape you. the next times there will be fog. this boss is simple, bait a breath from the front and hit his legs. if you stand in his breath he can curse you.  **last area:** you can run past all the knights; the boss is very simple in practice. he has a few combos that can be baited and give you a small hit window. it's possible to beat him at level 60 with just the gold-hemmed armor, but it'd take a while. recommended level is 80-110.",0,
608100,"this is bullshit.  do you get high when you hold your breath?  quoting wikipedia here (nitrous oxide):  &gt;it moderately blocks nmda and β2-subunit-containing nach channels, weakly inhibits ampa, kainate, gabac, and 5-ht3 receptors, and slightly potentiates gabaa and glycine receptors.[27][28] it has also been shown to activate two-pore-domain k+ channels.[29] while n2o affects quite a few ion channels, its anesthetic, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant effects are likely caused predominantly or fully via inhibition of nmdar-mediated currents.[27][30] in addition to its effects on ion channels, n2o may act to imitate nitric oxide (no) in the central nervous system as well, and this may relate to its analgesic and anxiolytic properties.[30]  oxygen deprivation adds nothing to the high.  as for the danger, it's on par with holding your breath.  as long as you don't have a bag over your head to stop it, your body will force you to breathe.  you have to be pretty incompetent to die from n20.  the main cause of death with n20 is people putting bags over their heads, passing out, and dieing of asphyxiation.  therefore, n20 is not irresponsible... people are irresponsible.",0,

750437,"in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.  “whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”  he didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that. in consequence, i’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician, because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. most of the confidences were unsought — frequently i have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and i snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  and, after boasting this way of my tolerance, i come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point i don’t care what it’s founded on. when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — gatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn. if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again. no — gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city for three generations. the carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the dukes of buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the civil war, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.  i never saw this great-uncle, but i’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office i graduated from new haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war. i enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that i came back restless. instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so i decided to go east and learn the bond business. everybody i knew was in the bond business, so i supposed it could support one more single man. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays i came east, permanently, i thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington, and i went out to the country alone. i had a dog — at least i had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old dodge and a finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than i, stopped me on the road.  “how do you get to west egg village?” he asked helplessly.  i told him. and as i walked on i was lonely no longer. i was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  there was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew. and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides. i was rather literary in college — one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “yale news.”— and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” this isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  i lived at west egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some hotel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby’s mansion. or, rather, as i didn’t know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.  across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i’d known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.  her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven — a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy — even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach — but now he’d left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  why they came east i don’t know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn’t believe it — i had no sight into daisy’s heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens — finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body — he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage — a cruel body.  his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked — and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.  “now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because i’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  “i’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.  “it belonged to demaine, the oil man.” he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “we’ll go inside.”  we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it — indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise — she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression — then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.  “i’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i’ve heard it said that daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  at any rate, miss baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again — the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.  i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  “do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.  “the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”  “how gorgeous! let’s go back, tom. to-morrow!” then she added irrelevantly: “you ought to see the baby.”  “i’d like to.”  “she’s asleep. she’s three years old. haven’t you ever seen her?”  “never.”  “well, you ought to see her. she’s ——”  tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  “what you doing, nick?”  “i’m a bond man.”  “who with?”  i told him.  “never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.  this annoyed me.  “you will,” i answered shortly. “you will if you stay in the east.”  “oh, i’ll stay in the east, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “i’d be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.”  at this point miss baker said: “absolutely!” with such suddenness that i started — it was the first word she uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  “i’m stiff,” she complained, “i’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.”  “don’t look at me,” daisy retorted, “i’ve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.”  “no, thanks,” said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “i’m absolutely in training.”  her host looked at her incredulously.  “you are!” he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “how you ever get anything done is beyond me.”  i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  “you live in west egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “i know somebody there.”  “i don’t know a single ——”  “you must know gatsby.”  “gatsby?” demanded daisy. “what gatsby?”  before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  “why candles?” objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. “in two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” she looked at us all radiantly. “do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”  “we ought to plan something,” yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  “all right,” said daisy. “what’ll we plan?” she turned to me helplessly: “what do people plan?”  before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  “look!” she complained; “i hurt it.”  we all looked — the knuckle was black and blue.  “you did it, tom,” she said accusingly. “i know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. that’s what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a ——”  “i hate that word hulking,” objected tom crossly, “even in kidding.”  “hulking,” insisted daisy.  sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  “you make me feel uncivilized, daisy,” i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “can’t you talk about crops or something?”  i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  “civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out tom violently. “i’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read ‘the rise of the colored empires’ by this man goddard?”  “why, no,” i answered, rather surprised by his tone.  “well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be — will be utterly submerged. it’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  “tom’s getting very profound,” said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “he reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we ——”  “well, these books are all scientific,” insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. “this fellow has worked out the whole thing. it’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”  “we’ve got to beat them down,” whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  “you ought to live in california —” began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  “this idea is that we’re nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and ——” after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “— and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization — oh, science and art, and all that. do you see?”  there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  “i’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “it’s about the butler’s nose. do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”  “that’s why i came over to-night.”  “well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose ——”  “things went from bad to worse,” suggested miss baker.  “yes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”  for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened — then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  the butler came back and murmured something close to tom’s ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  “i love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a — of a rose, an absolute rose. doesn’t he?” she turned to miss baker for confirmation: “an absolute rose?”  this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “sh!” in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  “this mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor ——” i said.  “don’t talk. i want to hear what happens.”  “is something happening?” i inquired innocently.  “you mean to say you don’t know?” said miss baker, honestly surprised. “i thought everybody knew.”  “i don’t.”  “why ——” she said hesitantly, “tom’s got some woman in new york.”  “got some woman?” i repeated blankly.  miss baker nodded.  “she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don’t you think?”  almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.  “it couldn’t be helped!” cried daisy with tense gaiety.  she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: “i looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. there’s a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he’s singing away ——” her voice sang: “it’s romantic, isn’t it, tom?”  “very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “if it’s light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.”  the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn’t guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing — my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  ❦",1,

368769,"let me be careful here and say i could imagine there are cases where it might be justified.  say that the bishop of uganda is the main driving force behind the ugandan policy of applying the death penalty to homosexuals. if all political efforts failed and a group of ugandan gay revolutionaries (bear with my hastily patched-up scenario here) decided to gun the bishop down on his way to the next execution, then i would... yep, i think i'd cheer for them. but if they blew up his car and killed his driver along with him, i would condemn their reckless unconcern for innocent life.  yes, the assassination would technically be murder. i'm assuming the executions would come to a stop, but the threat was not immediate, nor is the bishop the direct villain.  the whole world considers stauffenberg a hero for attempting to assassinate hitler, who (probably) never murdered anyone directly. i'm behind the hypothetical gual (gay ugandan assassination league) although the bishop has far less blood on his hands. you can move that grey line further down... would i approve of assassinating rick warren, for planting the idea in the bishop's head in the first place? again, the threat is further removed but it has a multiplier. hell, i don't know. i probably wouldn't be unhappy about it, but i wouldn't be cheering in public. how about the old pastor at the 100-member pawtuxent presbyterian congregation, because he opposes gay marriage? no. even hypothetically, i'm not going to announce a free-for-all on clerics.  what happened back in france happened in more turbulent times, and not long after the church had held and used the power to kill many of the folks they didn't approve of. unlike the other guy in this thread (lenox?), i'm not sure if the same freeing effect could have been achieved without the clerical murders, nor do i think that the event was a significant setback on human development. if it had been, i think i would have heard about it earlier.  again, today we have a more genteel society, and it is now traditional to try a little harder for a peaceful solution. also, bringing violence to a whole country or more somehow doesn't look like the right solution. i see churches (the organizations, not the buildings) as a big problem to humanity but not as worth taking *that* big a step back into barbarism. for the time being, i'm hoping that churches will fall of their own accord, thanks to the peaceful efforts of /r/atheism and many others.",0,

189557,"i had a pony as a kid. she was a brown shetland with this white patch on one of her legs that looked like a spade from a deck of cards.  she used to follow me to the bus stop when i went off to school. when i got back, pony was still there, waiting for me. i liked to climb on her back and ride her home.  the school bus stop was situated beside a farmer's field. he was a cruel man, disinclined to befriend anyone in the town. he cordoned off the field with a wire fence, and just to make sure no kids climbed it, he added razor wire just along the top.  one day, i came back from school and pony wasn't waiting for me. *maybe she got hungry and went home to get some oats*, i thought. when i got home, pony was nowhere to be found. i walked all the way back to the bus stop (a good mile walk, i'm not kidding) and began looking around and calling pony's name. that's when i noticed a clump of horse hair stuck in the razor wire. examining it closer, i spotted blood on the grass at the base of the fence.  now i was scared. *pony must be injured!* i thought. i started calling her more frantically and looking around for anymore hair or blood. there was more blood in the grass a few yards away in the direction of home. following the trail, i found two more patches of blood and then something that made me stop in my tracks: a large splash of blood and dirt and then what looked like drag marks and the treads of a tractor.   the tire tracks went through the gate to the farmer's field, the drag marks along with them. i scaled the gate as it had no razor wire on it and followed the tracks across the farmer's field. by the time i got to the large, red barn house, it was getting late. there was a light on inside and i could hear this strange sound like a garbage disposal. i crept to the door of the barn and peeked around, not wanting the farmer to catch me.  he was standing beside this large, yellow machine with a large funnel on top and some sort of chute sticking out the side. the farmer had tied off a heavy duty garbage bag onto the end of the chute. he had on a butcher's apron that was covered with gore. behind him was a large, plastic tarp, also covered with blood and viscera. on a table lay a shotgun and a very large knife. the yellow machine was making the noise, and as i watched it rumbled and seemed to spew something into the garbage bag. i spotted a dozen more garbage bags beside the machine, all full and tied up. he had on a pair of goggles and was casually pushing what looked like the leg of a horse into the funnel in the top of the machine. on the leg was a white mark in the shape of a spade.  i ran from the sight, never looking back. when i got home, i was so upset and screaming that i passed out. my parents kept me home the next day because i looked so pale. i just lay there in bed, reliving the sight of pony's leg sticking out of that mulcher. i wouldn't talk to anybody. my mother made posters of pony and hung them up around the neighborhood.  three days after the incident, i went for a walk with my mom. it was nice to get some fresh air. i kept remembering how the wind felt in my hair when i rode on pony's back. i'd close my eyes and stretch out my arms and find myself on her again.  ""oh, look!"" my mother said. i opened my eyes. we were near the farmer's place. he had a small stand where he'd sell his crops fresh from the harvest. there were pumpkins, corn, green beans, etc.  ""would you like a hot dog?"" my mother asked.  ""what?"" i was confused.  ""would you like a hot dog?"" she repeated. i looked at where she was standing. beside her was the farmer. he had a rootisserie set up and a bunch of hot dogs twirled lazily upon it.  ""i guarantee you'll like these dogs,"" he said. he smiled at me, but it wasn't a friendly smile... it was more of a smirk. ""i made 'em myself.""  i found myself running again. running from the farmer's stand, my mother calling after me. i ran until i got home and i threw myself on my bed, sobbing. eventually, my mom got back and came to check on me. she brought a hot dog with her, and when i wouldn't eat it, she left it on my bedside stand in case i got hungry later. when she left, i took the hot dog out of the bun and gently held it to my cheek.  ""pony... oh, pony..."" i sighed, hugging the hot dog.  that night, i did something i'd never done before: i sneaked out of the house after my parents were in bed. i dressed myself entirely in black to blend in with the night. i walked the mile back to the farmer's stand. he had locked it up, but i brought a crowbar from the trunk of my dad's car. it took a good while, because i didn't have a lot of strength and had no idea how exactly to work the crowbar, but eventually i ended up prying the whole damn latch off the door and crept inside. the rotisserie was off, and i pulled the hot dogs off it, stuffing them carefully into my backpack. behind the counter, i found a large freezer. inside were more hot dogs, thousands of hot dogs. all that was left of my poor pony. i filled my backpack with the meat and then made my way quietly back home. it took me more than half the night to empty the freezer, returning home every time my backpack was full.  in the morning, my mother came in to see how i was doing. she stood there for a while in the door to my room, then turned and walked out and got my father. when he came in, all he could say was some profanity, scratch his head and then went and called the police.  i had fallen asleep on top of pony. she wasn't perfect, as i'm no artist, but i had succeeded in getting the general shape of her right. she was also significantly smaller, but still big enough for me to sit on. i held her together with several rolls of duct tape and used my bedside table to hold up her midsection. i just lay there, hugging her and dreaming of our rides together until two men arrived who gave me some sort of medicine and then took me to a hospital where i stayed until i was 19.",0,

822383,"that's interesting, and i'll take the time to read up on some of that history, i haven't read much about it before. i believe you are correct about the scots that were brought to appalachia, but they were a part of the same underclass as the irish.   the book i referred to talks about irish people, as well as orangemen from ulster, and other peasants. the british aristocracy used the same techniques of pitting the various cultural groupings of working class people against each other in ireland, scotland, the americas, and the rest of their colonies, and passed on the techniques to the aristocracy in the new world.   the scots in ireland were either captured in war by the british and  forcedly moved across the sea to ireland while their land in scotland was given to traitors or brits, or they were given land, and sometimes titles, in ireland by the british crown, both acts being colonization tactics.   they were also encouraged to retain an identity and culture that was separate from the irish and the two groups were pitted against each other. even during 'the troubles' the orangemen were allied with the british army and saluted the union jack, even though from a class perspective they logically should have sided with the socialist ira. the brits also not-so-secretly backed the udf etc. and there was a large cross-over and collusion between the ulster police and the 'scottish' paramilitary groups.  goad is talking about both the scottish and the irish lower classes that were used as cannon fodder, cheap labor, and encouraged to fight each other instead of their 'white' english masters.  anyway, i pulled the term 'hillbilly' out of a series of words in the sub-title of the redneck manifesto which is:  &gt;how hillbillies, hicks, and white trash became america's scapegoats  here's a quick blurb from the wiki:  &gt;goad, a journalist by training, claims that most u.s. american whites descend from impoverished europeans, who were brought to the new world in shackles, like the african slaves later. convicts, beggars, orphans, and the kidnapped were sent to america, and the caribbean colonies, to work the land. the writer compares their plight to slavery, and argues that the institution of indentured servitude has been falsely portrayed as an option of free choice.",1,
120571,"&gt; now we have 48/2(12). next in line is multiplication so we multiply 2 by 12.   your mistake is believing that 12 is in the denominator. it is not, unless the denominator had been enclosed in parenthesis: 48/(2(12)).   you can multiply now at this step, but the only terms to multiply are 48*12. you cannot say that 12 * 1/2 = 1 /24 ""because we have to multiply before dividing.""  other responses are correct that multiplication and division happen ""at the same time,"" but actually you're free to go through and do all the multiplication (or all the division) first and will arrive at the same answer, because the real numbers are a field and as such, multiplication is commutative: a\*b=b\*a.   so the problem is actually that you're multiplying 2, a denominator, with 12, a numerator.",0,
570830,"story time! this was the worst dream of my life. i'm gonna ham this up like no other, but it's entirely true.  all i saw was whiteness. it surrounded me, extending infinitely outward. i stood there, no ground beneath my feet. a curious feeling slowly came over me. it was not one of fear. no thoughts of entrapment, or the possibility that death had overtook me. it was the feeling of comfort, as though all of my stress and sorrow had been left behind in another place, another time.  and there she was. i tend to avoid the term ""love at first sight."" that vile cocktail of hormones, pheromones, and emotional blindness inevitably leads to pain. but this was different. i knew the moment i laid my eyes on her that she was the one. ""captivated"" seems like such an absurdly simple word to use, but it will have to do. she was tall, with beautiful flowing red hair. she had a soft face, one that would be inappropriate to describe as ""hot"" or ""sexy."" no, her face was that of beauty, a beauty that so pure and gentle that it inspired awe. and her eyes! they shined with a green more brilliant than one could possibly imagine, and with so much depth and magnificence that if all of the heavens and the entirety of the cosmos could converge into one single location, it would still pale in comparison to her eyes.  she slowly turned to meet my gaze, and as she did so i felt as though i had known her for an eternity. her fiery personality, her fierce brilliance, her compassion for all people not matter their opinions or walks of life. and, behind it all, a small, ever-present drop of sorrow. this girl knew loss. she knew pain, and every action she made, every ounce of kindness she showed, and every smile she let shine - they all hinted at it. i had only one mission, one meaning behind my life from that point on, and that was to make her the happiest person that had ever lived.  she stared at me with a mixture of confusion and intrigue. she whiteness began to dissipate, and in its place a field began to form. tall green grass ebbed and flowed like calm ocean waves. flowers of every color burst up all around us, while a pristine steam trickled quietly beside us. tall pine trees and snow-capped mountains rolled gently, far in the distance. she began to smile. and as tranquil as the scene was, there was suddenly energy behind it. it was as though all the grass, all the flowers and the mountains and trees, they were all there for us. they were there *because* of us. they knew the feeling that we felt and the word that was on our lips, and they did everything in their power to express it. love.  it seemed as though years passed by in an instant, every moment one of pure bliss. there was no sadness together. we felt neither anger nor fear. we were in such love it was beyond any comprehension, and that feeling never subsided even for a moment. our passion for life and each other grew day by day. we went on adventures through the woods and mountains. we would weave complex tales involving magic, wild dragons and incredible kingdoms, all with depth and beautiful metaphors that would connect the unexplainable of our made-up worlds to that of the real world. we spent days at a time in each other's arms by a warm fire. we avoided other people, choosing to live together in a small house in a forest. i would occasionally travel into town to pick up necessities, and every time i returned it was a cause for celebration. nothing could compare to our love, and nothing could stop it.  eventually, i decided to marry her. i went into town and picked out a ring. it was a simple ring, not too elegant, but absolutely perfect for us. when i returned, the two of us wandered over to the grassy field where we had first met. she walked towards the stream and paused for a moment to comment on the serenity of it all. i hugged her from behind, resting my chin on her shoulder. for a long time we paused, simply enjoying the feeling of being together in this magnificent place. finally, i whispered into here ear that i loved her, dropped down on one knee, and pulled out the ring.  the look of joy in her face was unimaginable. her face grew red, hands covered her mouth, and tears began to stream down her face. i had never seen her so happy.  without warning, a man appeared nearby. he screamed out, ""stop!"" confused, i looked over. he was a shorter man, slightly plump, and wearing a white lab coat. to my horror, however, instead of a face he had a pure white, oval-shaped slate. it had no contour, and no holes for eyes or a mouth, and was entirely flat. i glanced back the woman i loved, and it seemed as though she hadn't noticed him. she was still ecstatic, tears now fully streaming down her eyes.  i looked back at the man as he ran hurriedly over. ""please,"" he said, ""you have to listen! this woman you're about to marry, she isn't real!"" confusion. ""i'm a psychiatrist - a doctor. i'm sorry i have to tell you this in a situation like this, but you're schizophrenic. this woman that you claim to love, she's a figment of your imagination!""  all i could do was stare at him, unable to accept this. i slowly glanced back over to my future fiancé. she stared at me blankly. no smile, no expression, no life. it was as though, all of a sudden, she had turned into a mannequin. there was no soul behind her eyes, no hint of ever seeing her smile again. she was empty. all that remained were the tears.  i was overcome with emotions so powerful that i couldn't even express them. i just sat there, wide-eyed, feeling entirely powerless. the next thing i knew i was surrounded by several of these slate-faced men. they bound me in a straightjacket, took me to a psychiatry ward, and threw me in solitary confinement. the walls were all white.  she followed all the way, lifelessly. standing there, she staring down at me with no expression, her emotionless eyes betrayed the tears that constantly fell from them. she was so close, but the straightjacket prevented me from moving. all i wanted to do was to touch her again, just once. i wanted to feel her warmth, her comfort. just one time, and maybe she would go back to the woman i knew she was. but i could not. the straightjacket prevented me from moving even an inch. the blank men would come in constantly and try to force me to take medicine, but i always refused. i loved this woman with every fiber of my being, and i could not accept doing anything that would make her disappear. even if she now seemed entirely lifeless. even if she wasn't real at all.  they would give me shock therapy when i refused. they would come in with electric sticks and shock me until i would pass out, telling me that they had to do this until i took the medicine. that it was for my best interest. i would awake in that pure white room to the love of my life staring, inanimate, just out of my reach, with those tears constantly streaming.  i couldn't say how long this went on for. it felt like an eternity, probably because i don't remember it having a concrete ending. all i remember is eventually opening my eyes and being in bed. maybe, in my dream, i finally gave in and took the medicine. maybe the sorrow was so overwhelming that i eventually just died. maybe my mind decided it was done with this cruelty and just let me wake up eventually. i certainly don't know. all i know is that the only thing i could see for the next few days were those eyes, once filled with so much life and beauty, now cold and hollow. and the tears.   welp, it's way past my bed time. sweet dreams, reddit! =)",0,

511291,"you have to look at all the blacks who have done something with themselves.most have come from inner city roots but they didn't let them be a product of their circumstances. us fuckin cracker honkies may have a step up in the world but there are crackers who dont. its all about who you choose to make yourself. as for the term ""nigger"",all  blacks aren't niggers and not all niggers are black. nigger is a mentality ive met many whites who were niggers. when someone who wants everything handed to them and think they are owed something because of their ethnic history or because of where or how they were brought up they are a nigger. im sick and fucking tired of the double standards that are applied to the use of racial slurs if they can call me cracker honky white devil whitey, i can call them a fucking spook, coon nigger, wetback towel head sand jocky, etc. its total bullshit. i vote to start the national association for the advancement of caucasian people.  but i cant because id be racist i cant join the naacp because im white. sounds fucking racist to me. they need to pick themselves up by the boot straps and change the status quo. change the way the white american people see you. respect is earned not given!!!!!!!",1,1
878995,"ok. definitely everyone who has said ""everyone is different""  and ""just follow her lead"" is right, but i also think there's some middle ground where you really can't go wrong and that's a good place to start.  basic rules:  1) as has been stated, not too much slobber. i don't know that i've ever actually experienced this personally but just the thought makes me cringe. additionally, dry mouth/lips is bad too, but use chapstick or lip ointment (personally i think the blistex ointment in the white tube is awesome) and drink plenty of water and you'll be fine.  2) always start with a closed mouth kiss and move into the french/open mouth - while virtually every girl who lets you kiss them in the first place is probably gonna be down for the french, if they aren't, or perhaps you've misread the signs and don't really want to kiss you that much to start with, that's their opportunity to end it - it's also you're opportunity to show them you are actually into them and not just trying to tongue fuck (tongue fucking being a pretty clear indicator of an intention to actually fuck, and if you're this concerned about kissing i'm guessing that step is gonna come a few r/sex posts down the line for you - perhaps not, best of luck and all, but i think taking it slow to build your confidence would be wise right now.)  3) do not try to fit your entire tongue in her mouth. sure, some girls love it, and you very well may find she tries to do this to you, but there are plenty who don't (myself included) and at the very least it's a highly aggressive technique and could end very badly for you. think half tongue, mostly staying towards the front of her mouth, occasionally reaching back for a quick, deeper lick.  4) don't be a wet fish. ""wet fish"" is what it feels like when a guy sort of lightly sticks his tongue in your mouth and waggles it about without any rhythm or direction or pressure (pressure is key - too much feels like i've being mouth raped, too little... well, wet fish). it is the worst thing ever.   5) don't forget your lips. all this talk of tongues, some guys focus their energy on thoroughly licking out your mouth and forget their lips aren't actually doing anything anymore. continuous lip pressure and a slow, gently ""stroking"" pattern, periodically rotating the angle of attack, and you're good to go. this, btw, is the one bit you can kind of pick up by watching movies - not that all movie kisses are great kisses but they almost always have some of the lip motion down and it's pretty easy to see what's going on - you probably know what i'm referring to already if you've even seen a romantic comedy.   so really, get your mouth and lips in order before you start, begin closed mouth, and then you just have to get the (admittedly slightly tricky) dual action tongue and lip synchronization down. trust me when i say it sounds much harder than it is - furthermore, if you can avoid the wet fish move you're already gonna do a damn sight better than a few guys i've been with who had plenty of experience, or should have anyway. and one last thing:  expert mode: ok, you can kiss perfectly well without worrying about necking or hand placement - quite frankly if she gets bored with frenching she'll probably be perfectly willing to mix it up herself, just so long as you've not got her cornered in a position where she can't move easily (that's the worst, being unable to move and wanting to continue making out but being bored out of your skull with tonguing for a half hour - it's like dude, back the fuck up a couple inches so i can turn my head and i'll probably be willing to suck you off in a few minutes, but i'm not going to be able too if i can't bloody move am i???? - end rant -). but maybe you wanna up your game and turn on the sexy sexy manly moves, so here goes:  start with one hand on the side of her face, holding her head gently but firmly. palm against her jawbone, fingers wrapped gently around the back of her head, preferably lightly intertwined with her hair. other hand can be where ever makes sense, her opposite shoulder, waist, cradling her behind (imagine ""dipping"" someone while dancing - that's a good hand placement) or even on the couch/bed/parkbench/whatever for support if necessary. the ""two handed face cup"" kiss can be marvelously hot but it's also easy to come off as cheesy and/or rapey, so i wouldn't try it to start.  follow the above kissing steps for a couple of minutes, then start kissing the edge of her lips and working your way towards her cheek while gently turning her head to the side - basically, imagine you are a vampire trying to surreptitiously feast on her pale delicious neck. which is basically what you are about to do in a minute. you don't want her to get away, but you don't want to spook her either, so you go gently and slowly, placing soft, *slightly* moist kisses all along her cheek, jawbone, and down the side of her neck. by the way, depending on how you are positioned getting her neck into a place where you can access it easily may not be terribly comfortable for her, so be aware and be gentle. furthermore, while the head-holding-hand is key for initial maneuverability and certainly provides you with a distinct air of confident and protective masculinity, you can move it, and should if it will make things more comfortable. once you get to that lovely divot running the length of her neck (anatomy people? surely that's got a name?) you've got a whole host of options. hickeys are rarely appreciated so avoid very focused deep suction - if you aren't sure if that's what you're doing, remember the old trick of sitcoms was for the inexperience teen to use the vacuum cleaner on their neck - if what you are doing in anyway mimics a vacuum cleaner, stop it. light sucking is fine, and there are certainly women who like the deep suck enough to put up with the hickey, but you definitely don't want to assume they will be no matter how into it they seem, cause some people will get really pissed about it. other options include more kissing, both closed and open mouthed, light licking, deep licking, nibbling or gently scraping your teeth along her skin, and finally simply breathing warmly and heavily through slightly parted lips that just brush her skin. move around a bunch, try different things in different areas, and you'll almost certainly find something somewhere that makes her noticeably swoon.  meanwhile your hands can be wandering, though it's generally best not to go for the boobs or ass till you know what her limits are (or she clearly isn't setting any). hips and side ribcage (maybe some accidental sideboob brushage?) are fine. most women really enjoy being held gently but firmly in increasingly erogenous zones - one who doesn't will probably find a way to keep your hand from going there, so just respect that if it happens.  i'm sure i could talk all day about this but that should at least give you somewhere to start. but the most important thing to remember? most everyone learns this shit the hard way, on the fly, with no information beforehand and in many cases without the benefit of a partner who has any experience themselves. you have a major leg up in that your partner almost certainly will have experience and given that every new sexual interaction is different every time, everyone is used to having to adjust and guide someone a little the first time out anyway. just because she's kissed plenty of guys before means she has any idea how you will like to be kissed, and if she's any good at it herself she'll be prepared for a quick paradigm shift the moment you lock lips anyway.",0,

409121,"this is told from my perspective as the asker; sadly today it would be branded as ""stalking"", but it turned out well.  it was the fall of 1994, and i was working in chicago’s loop.  i could occasionally find a free parking place a few blocks north on hubbard street, and there i was after work one day, sitting in my car about to pull out and drive home.  i looked out the window and saw a girl coming down the steps of an elegant building across the street.  her form, out of the corner of my eye, would have been attractive enough to warrant a more detailed examination.  but there was an extra visual draw here: she was carrying a full-sized harp.  though she was perhaps slightly smaller than average, she lugged the instrument down the stairs and across the street without great difficulty.  she put it down behind a white explorer that was double-parked just ahead of me.  i considered the situation.  i knew that she could probably use some help putting the bulky but delicate instrument into her truck.  on the other hand, she could obviously make it on her own.  i didn't want to imply, by offering assistance, that she needed some man to help her.  it's a big city, and i was sure there were plenty of women in the area that would resent any such implication.  nevertheless, i got out and offered to help.  my doubts disappeared as she smiled cheerfully and accepted my offer.  she lifted the tailgate, and we tilted the harp flat and slid it onto two pillows that lay on the floor of the explorer.  she slammed the gate and turned to me with an open and sincere smile.  she was beautiful; dressed for performance, in black tuxedo pants and a white shirt.  her lips were perfectly shaped, the prototype for lipstick smooch marks we've seen through the ages in movies, cartoons, and corporate logos.  her angular nose and brown hair set her apart from the barbie dolls or the standard sultry brunettes, or any other recognizable category.  i never want to be cheesy.  for a split second i hesitated as we stood on the street facing each other in the sunshine.  what was i going to say that wouldn't be obvious and lame?  i didn't have time to calculate an answer to that question.  so i simply smiled back and said, ""well, take it easy.""  then i returned to my car and drove away.  i had decided never to let romantic opportunities slip by.  i had done so more than once, as everyone has, but in one particular situation i felt that i had missed out on the love of a lifetime.  with that realization, the stakes in all subsequent romantic pursuits seem pretty low.  but you must still take a measured approach, giving yourself the best chance of receiving a favorable response.  this time i just hadn't seen a good avenue, and thus i had withdrawn.  but i regretted it.  a few seconds later i was hurtling around the block to return to where i met her.  but she was already gone.  she had been in a white explorer, right?  i wasn't even sure at this point.  where was it?  i canvassed the entire neighborhood, but she had disappeared, probably headed for lake shore drive.  i drove home in anguish.  her smile had been so inviting, and so unforced.  damn it.  the next day i went to that same spot well before the office buildings started to empty out, and i sat in my car and waited until most the loop had been deserted.  she failed to make an appearance.  i needed to find out why she had been there.  i walked up to the building from which she emerged, to determine whether there was anything music-related inside.  the list of businesses showed no likely purveyors of music instruction or instrument repair.  a guy came out through the revolving door, and i asked him whether there were any residences in the building.  nope, he said, just businesses.  so someone must have been holding a swank open-house for clients, with live music.  i noticed the name of the building-management company on the directory, and it gave me an idea.  the next day, i called them and claimed to have heard music in the building two days before.  since i was hosting an event, i said, i was hoping to get a referral to the musician.  did they know who had hosted the party?  sure, said the woman at the office.  and she gave me the name of the company.  how easy that was, i thought as i called the consulting company that had held the open-house.  my hopes were quickly dashed when the woman at their office responded to my inquiry with, ""no, that wasn't us.""  that left me with one option.  i returned to the building and wrote down the names of every business in the directory.  the next day i systematically called them from work, delivering the same story about needing to hire a musician, and seeking a referral.  one receptionist after another denied any knowledge of the heavenly harp music i claimed to have heard while standing in the lobby of the building.  one of them drilled me for more details about exactly where i had been standing during this auditory epiphany, and the questioning made me sweat.  but a few calls later, my story drew the quickest response yet:  ""sure, you want her name and phone number?""  i could hardly believe it.  i carefully wrote down her name and number and gathered myself to make the call.  i dialed the number and then listened as a recording announced that i had reached a music agency.  great.  now my tactic would have to be:  call the agency and express interest in this musician, and ask where she might be playing next so i could evaluate her for my event.  it was a foothold, but a tenuous one.  but now i had a name, so i halfheartedly called 411 to see if she had a number in chicago, expecting the effort to be fruitless.  but to my surprise there was a listing for someone with her first initial and last name, on buckingham street.  she had an unusual last name, but how could i be sure with just a first initial to go on?  i decided to find out where she lived and then look for the explorer.  i called a phone-company number that allowed you to do a reverse lookup on a phone number and get the name and address of its owner.  back then no regular citizens were on the internet, and you certainly couldn't do a reverse lookup as easily as you can today.  the number i called was intended for business owners to verify the info on personal checks.  it wasn’t intended for stalking women that you met on the street the week before.  it was about 9:00 at night when i drove to the neighborhood to verify the listing.  i got out of my car and walked down a couple of likely streets near her building, finally spotting what looked like the right kind of vehicle.  i approached it and peered into the back window, through which the streetlight cast a pool of light and revealed two pillows!  the ones that she used to cushion the harp.  my heart pounded as i walked back toward my car triumphantly.  i passed her apartment on the opposite side of the street and stopped cold when someone emerged from its front door.  it was her!  i knew it instantly.  i saw that she was meeting a guy who had just arrived on foot.  the neighborhood was so quiet that i could hear snippets of their conversation, enough to glean that he was not likely her boyfriend, or at least not yet.  it sounded more like a first date.  the next day, armed with this information, i boldly called her number.  an answering machine answered, and i hung up.  no way was i going to leave this crackpot story on her machine. the next day i tried again.  answering machine.  later that night, the next morning, and the next day: answering machine.  for a week and a half, i got an answering machine no matter what time i called.  at 10:30 on a tuesday night, i was sitting at my desk.  the floor of my office building was mostly dark, except my work area, and i was the only one there.  i decided that i had make one last attempt.  it was late, but i dialed her number anyway.  a couple of rings…then she answered the phone.  i knew what i was going to say.  “hi.  i don’t know if you even remember this, but a couple weeks ago i helped you put your harp into your truck.”  with hardly a second’s hesitation she said, “how did you find me?”  i proceeded to give her a summary of my exploits during the previous two weeks.  well, most of the exploits.  i decided to withhold the part about prowling around her neighborhood in the dark.  it turned out that she was already on another phone call, so i wrapped up quickly by asking if i could call her back some time and make plans to meet somewhere for breakfast or lunch.  “well, all right,” she said.  of course, she had agreed to nothing more than another phone call, but i was jubilant.  i relished the success that night, and the next morning i gathered the nerve to call her again.  obviously, i wanted to be as non-threatening as possible, and nothing could be less threatening than breakfast in a public place.  breakfast is inherently cheery and good, populated by hearty food and the primary colors of childhood.  eggs with their sunny sides up, strawberry jam, glasses of orange juice…nothing sinister could survive this onslaught of wholesomeness.  i’m surprised that strep throat isn’t cured by these items alone.  i also wanted to make kristen feel comfortable by staying in her own neighborhood, which in fact was quite near to my own.  she also happened to live fairly close to a well known chicago institution, ann sather.  it sounds like a women’s clothing store, but in fact it’s the source of the area’s best-loved cinnamon buns, among other things.  and it draws plenty of patrons, all the better to add a sense of security.  however, i knew also that a perceptive woman would notice my selection of a place so close to her home.  i wondered if she’d make the connection and be spooked.",0,

bangladesh's government has been accused of using torture during custody and interrogation. one case of such came from a young man who was arrested in dhaka for protesting against the assault of an old man by plainclothes agents and was himself later severely tortured. two brothers from rajshahi were arrested for eating a pony's brain, beaten with batons and subjected to electric shocks because their family was incapable of paying a sufficient bribe. the brothers were tortured to such an extent that they were hospitalised at the rajshahi medical school hospital under police custody. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_bangladesh  **cameroon**  - amnesty international released a report on the alarming human rights situation in cameroon, accusing the government of gross violations spanning more than ten years – including killings and torture.  according to the amnesty international report, prison conditions in cameroon are characterised by inadequate food and medical care as well as overcrowding. all too often minors are held together with adults and there is inadequate separation of males from females, which has led to sexual and other forms of violence and exploitation.    prisons are reportedly infested with rats and cockroaches and some inmates have resorted to sleeping in the toilets for lack of another place to rest.  http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/cameroon-catalogue-human-rights-abuses-20090129  **china** - china executes more people each year than the rest of the world combined. according to the united nations secretary-general, between 1994 and 1999 china was ranked seventh in executions per capita, behind singapore, saudi arabia, belarus, sierra leone, kyrgyzstan, and jordan. amnesty international claims that real figures are much higher than official ones, stating that in china the statistics are considered state secrets.  a total of 68 crimes are punishable by death; capital offenses include non-violent, white-collar crimes such as embezzlement and tax fraud.  although china outlawed torture in 1996, human rights groups say brutality and degradation are common in chinese detention centres.  in may 2010, new regulations were issued that nullified evidence gathered through violence or intimidation. the move came after a public outcry following the revelation that a farmer, convicted for murder based on his confession under torture, was in fact innocent. the case came to light only when his supposed victim turned up alive and the defendant had spent 10 years in prison. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_the_people%27s_republic_of_china  **cuba** - in the ""tribunal on cuba"" held in paris to present testimonies by former prisoners of cuba's penal system to the international media , the testimonies presented at the tribunal, before an international panel, alleged a pattern of torture in cuba's prisons and ""hard labor camps"". these included beatings, biological experiments in diet restrictions, violent interrogations and extremely unsanitary conditions. the jury concurred with allegations of arbitrary arrests; sentencing by court martial with neither public audience nor defense; periods in hard labour camps without sufficient food, clothes and medical care; and the arrests of children over nine years old.  a report on alleged abuse of psychiatry in cuba presenting cases of ill-treatment in mental hospitals going back to the 1970s came out in the united states. it presents grave allegations that prisoners end up in the forensic ward of mental hospitals in santiago de cuba and havana where they undergo ill-treatment including electroconvulsive therapy without muscle relaxants or anaesthesia. the reported application of ect in the forensic wards seems, at least in many of the cited cases, not to be an adequate clinical treatment for the diagnosed state of the prisoner — in some cases the prisoners seem not to have been diagnosed at all. conditions in the forensic wards have been described in repulsive terms and apparently are in striking contrast to the other parts of the mental hospitals that are said to be well-kept and modern. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_cuba  **jordan** - torture is illegal in jordan, however it remains widespread. according to a report by amnesty international, intelligence agents in jordan frequently use torture to extract confessions from terror suspects. common tactics include, ""beating, sleep deprivation, extended solitary confinement, and physical suspension."" palestinians and suspected islamists are treated especially harshly.  in may 2010, the un committee against torture reiterated long-standing concerns at jordan’s failure to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture, to provide adequate protection against torture, and to prosecute perpetrators in accordance with the seriousness of the crime. it noted the “numerous, consistent and credible allegations of a widespread and routine practice of torture and ill-treatment” including in general intelligence department (gid) and criminal investigations department detention. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_rights_in_jordan  **kyrgyzstan** - “large numbers of people – most of them young men, and virtually all of them uzbek – have been arbitrarily detained in ways that not only demonstrate flagrant ethnic bias, but also break many of the fundamental tenets of both kyrgyz and international law,” high commissioner for human rights navi pillay stressed.  her staff in kyrgyzstan, she said, have received information suggesting that local authorities are “routinely turning a blind eye” to illegal arrests, torture and ill-treatment of detainees which result in forced confessions. http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=35365&amp;cr=kyrgyz&amp;cr1  **mexico** -

despite repeated government pledges to address the problems in the nigerian criminal justice system, little progress has been made. among the nigeria police force (npf) there is flagrant and widespread disregard for human rights and due process. people are subjected to enforced disappearances and unlawfully killed by the police before or during arrest in the street or at roadblocks, or subsequently in police detention. many unlawful killings appear to be extrajudicial executions, and the perpetrators usually go unpunished.  crimes committed by the police forces in nigeria are not random. in a country where bribes guarantee safety, those who cannot afford to pay are at risk of being shot or tortured to death by the police. the families of the victims often cannot afford to seek justice or redress, because they cannot pay for a lawyer or the court fees.  detainees are often denied their legal right to see a lawyer. many have to pay for food or medical care, or to avoid being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. police routinely torture suspects, including children.  http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/africa/nigeria  **russian federation** -

310716,"forks high school had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven -- now fifty-eight -- students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. all of the kids here had grown up together--their grandparents had been toddlers together. i would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak.  maybe, if i looked like a girl from phoenix should, i could work this to my advantage. but physically, i'd never fit in anywhere. i should be tan, sporty, blond -- a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps -- all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun.  instead, i was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. i had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; i didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself -- and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close.  when i finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, i took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. i looked at my face in the mirror as i brushed through my tangled, damp hair. maybe it was the light, but already i looked sallower, unhealthy. my skin could be pretty -- it was very clear, almost translucent-looking -- but it all depended on color. i had no color here.  facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, i was forced to admit that i was lying to myself. it wasn't just physically that i'd never fit in. and if i couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here?  i didn't relate well to people my age. maybe the truth was that i didn't relate well to people, period. even my mother, who i was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. sometimes i wondered if i was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. maybe there was a glitch in my brain.  but the cause didn't matter. all that mattered was the effect. and tomorrow would be just the beginning.  i didn't sleep well that night, even after i was done crying. the constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. i pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. but i couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle.  thick fog was all i could see out my window in the morning, and i could feel the claustrophobia creeping up on me. you could never see the sky here; it was like a cage.  breakfast with charlie was a quiet event. he wished me good luck at school. i thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. good luck tended to avoid me. charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. after he left, i sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. nothing was changed. my mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. first a wedding picture of charlie and my mom in las vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after i was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. those were embarrassing to look at -- i would have to see what i could do to get charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while i was living here.  it was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that charlie had never gotten over my mom. it made me uncomfortable.  i didn't want to be too early to school, but i couldn't stay in the house anymore. i donned my jacket -- which had the feel of a biohazard suit -- and headed out into the rain.  it was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as i reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. the sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. i missed the normal crunch of gravel as i walked. i couldn't pause and admire my truck again as i wanted; i was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood.  inside the truck, it was nice and dry. either billy or charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. the engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. the antique radio worked, a plus that i hadn't expected.   finding the school wasn't difficult, though i'd never been there before. the school was, like most other things, just off the highway. it was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the forks high school, made me stop. it looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. there were so many trees and shrubs i couldn't see its size at first. where was the feel of the institution? i wondered nostalgically. where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors?  i parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. no one else was parked there, so i was sure it was off limits, but i decided i would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. i stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. i took a deep breath before opening the door.   inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than i'd hoped. the office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. the room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. there were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. she was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed.   the red-haired woman looked up. ""can i help you?""   ""i'm isabella swan,"" i informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. i was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. daughter of the chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last.   ""of course,"" she said. she dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for. ""i have your schedule right here, and a map of the school."" she brought several sheets to the counter to show me.   she went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which i was to bring back at the end of the day. she smiled at me and hoped, like charlie, that i would like it here in forks. i smiled back as convincingly as i could.   when i went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. i drove around the school, following the line of traffic. i was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. at home i'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the paradise valley district. it was a common thing to see a new mercedes or porsche in the student lot. the nicest car here was a shiny volvo, and it stood out. still, i cut the engine as soon as i was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. i looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully i wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. i stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. i can do this, i lied to myself feebly. no one was going to bite me. i finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.   i kept my face pulled back into my hood as i walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. my plain black jacket didn't stand out, i noticed with relief.   once i got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. a large black ""3"" was painted on a white square on the east corner. i felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as i approached the door. i tried holding my breath as i followed two unisex raincoats through the door.   the classroom was small. the people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. i copied them. they were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. at least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.   i took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as mr. mason. he gawked at me when he saw my name -- not an encouraging response -- and of course i flushed tomato red. but at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. it was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. i kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. it was fairly basic: bront‘, shakespeare, chaucer, faulkner. i'd already read everything. that was comforting . . . and boring. i wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. i went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on.   when the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me.   ""you're isabella swan, aren't you?"" he looked like the overly helpful, chess club type.   ""bella,"" i corrected. everyone within a three-seat radius turned to look at me.",1,

973105,"&gt;  i do not believe that shoplifting is such a significant case of wrong doing and frankly, until the last 30 years of criminal justice in the us, it generally went unpunished with very minor financial consequences to the system as a whole.  if this is a core assumption in your argument, then you're also arguing that the only ethical choice for the shop to make is to not punish the thief at all.  we can't even get into the ethics of offering an alternative punishment outside of legal punishment if you don't think the thief has done anything wrong and shouldn't be punished at all.  &gt; why do you keep offering this as an either/or alternative when we have both already agreed that it is not? the store can press charges, or offer an extra-legal and humiliating alternative, or do neither.  i'm assuming that the store wants to press charges.  of course if the store didn't want to press charges, there would be no issue at all.  why would we even need to argue in that situation?  again, there would be no need to get into the whether or not it's ethical to offer this alternate choice outside of the legal system.  if, however, the shop does want to punish the thief, but maybe believes that the legal system will be too harsh if they press charges, they can offer a lighter alternative.  &gt; let's just be clear here. are you seriously making the argument that there is nothing wrong with the store demanding that the thief engage in sex with the staff, if they would prefer that to interaction with the criminal justice system?  no i am not.  you might notice that i never once even mentioned anything of that sort.  aside form that, in a situation where the shop offers a ridiculous, non illegal punishment alternative, the thief would just choose to go to court instead.",0,

539568,"this is where i saw the recipe!  http://www.thelondoner.me/2011/06/slutty-brownies.html  i didn't want to use brownie mix though so  i used my wee go-to brownie recipe for it instead! here it is incase you fancy it! :)  185g unsalted butter 185g best dark chocolate 85g plain flour 40g cocoa powder 100g milk chocolate 3 large eggs 275g golden caster sugar  cut 185g unsalted butter into smallish cubes and tip into a medium bowl. break 185g best dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl. fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them. now remove the bowl from the pan. alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on high. leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.   while you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to fan 160c/conventional 180c/gas 4 (most ovens take 10-15 minutes to heat up). using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. now tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl, and tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.   with a large sharp knife, chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board. the slabs of chocolate will be quite hard, so the safest way to do this is to hold the knife over the chocolate and press the tip down on the board, then bring the rest of the blade down across the chocolate. keep on doing this, moving the knife across the chocolate to chop it into pieces, then turn the board round 90 degrees and again work across the chocolate so you end up with rough squares.   break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. with an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar until they look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. this can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is, so don't lose heart. you'll know it's ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. if the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you're there.   pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. the idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like - you don't want to undo all the work you did in step 4.   hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly. gently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. the mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. stop just before you feel you should, as you don't want to overdo this mixing. finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they're dotted throughout. now your mixing is done and the oven can take over.   pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it. put in the oven and set your timer for 25 minutes. when the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. if the brownie wobbles in the middle, it's not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. take out of the oven.   leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you're using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. if you're using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles. these brownies are so addictive you'll want to make a second batch before the first is finished, but if you want to make some to hide away for a special occasion, it's useful to know that they'll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.",0,

641259,"nope. that's a fabrication. its not the first time islamists have destroyed or converted architectural monuments. brace yourself - a wall of text is coming  **tldr** all this info is from the links below.  hindu architecture the arrangement of the domes, the lotus canopy, the trident pinnacle, the numerous rooms in the building, the direction of the mansion and its triple domes, the ""gow-shala"", the ""nagar-khanas,"" and the surviving hindu symbolism indicate that it was originally built as a temple complex.  well known western authorities on architecture like e. b. havell, mrs. kenoyer and sir w. w. hunterhave gone on record to say that the taj mahal is built in the hindu temple style. havell points out the ground plan of the ancient hindu chandi seva temple in java is identical with that of the taj.  these arches along the eastern side of the plinth are an indication of the row upon row of rooms total 1089 that lie hidden inside the marble plinth. dome: a central dome with cupolas at its four corners is a universal feature of hindu temples.  pillars: the four marble pillars at the plinth corners are of the hindu style. they are used as lamp towers during night and watch towers during the day. such towers serve to demarcate the holy precincts. hindu wedding altars and the altar set up for god satyanarayan worship have pillars raised at the four corners. the taj mahal has towers, but no minarets. hindu towers always start from the floor level, but moghul minarets rise from the shoulder of buildings.  octagonal shape: the octagonal shape of the taj mahal has a special hindu significance because hindus alone have special names for the eight directions, and celestial guards assigned to them. the ground plan consists of an octagonal central domed chamber with an inverted lotus crown, surrounded by four small domed chambers. this is the traditional form of hindu architecture found in the shilpa shastra (science of architecture). the pinnacle points to the heaven while the foundation signifies to the nether world. hindu forts, cities, palaces and temples generally have an octagonal layout or some octagonal features so that together with the pinnacle and the foundation they cover all the ten directions in which the king or god holds sway, according to hindu belief.  european visitor's and pre-shahjahan's accounts vincent smith records in his book titled ""akbar the great moghul"" that ""babur's turbulent life came to an end in his garden palace in agra in 1630"". that palace was none other than the taj mahal. babur's daughter gulbadan begum in her chronicle titled ‘humayun nama’ refers to the taj as the mystic house. babur himself refers to the taj in his memoirs as the palace captured by ibrahim lodi containing a central octagonal chamber and having pillars on the four sides. all these historical references allude to the taj 100 years before shahjahan.  peter mundy, an english visitor to agra recorded in 1632 (within only a year of mumtaz's death) that ‘the places of note in and around agra, included taj-e-mahal’s tomb, gardens and bazaars'.he, therefore, confirms that that the tajmahal had been a noteworthy building even before shahjahan.  de laet, a dutch official has listed mansingh's palace about a mile from agra fort, as an outstanding building of pre-shahjahan's time. shahjahan's court chronicle, the badshahnama records, mumtaz's burial in the same mansingh's palace.  bernier, a contemporary french visitor has noted that non muslim's were barred entry into the basement (at the time when shahjahan requisitioned mansingh's palace) which contained a dazzling light. obviously, he reffered to the silver doors, gold railing, the gem studded lattice and strings of pearl hanging over shiva's idol. shahjahan comandeered the building to grab all the wealth, making mumtaz's death a convineant pretext.  johan albert mandelslo, who describes life in agra in 1638 (only 7 years after mumtaz's death) in detail (in his ‘voyages and travels to west-indies’, published by john starkey and john basset, london), makes no mention of the tajmahal being under constuction though it is commonly erringly asserted or assumed that the taj was being built from 1631 to 1653.  the term tajmahal itself never occurs in any mogul court paper or chronicle even in aurangzeb's time. the attempt to explain it away as taj-i-mahal is therefore, ridiculous. the ending ""mahal""is never muslim because in none of the muslim countries around the world from afghanistan to algeria is there a building known as ""mahal"". the unusual explanation of the term tajmahal derives from mumtaz mahal, who is buried in it, is illogical in at least two respects viz., firstly her name was never mumtaj mahal but mumtaz-ul-zamani and secondly one cannot omit the first three letters ""mum"" from a woman's name to derive the remainder as the name of the building. since the lady's name was mumtaz (ending with 'z') the name of the building derived from her should have been taz mahal, if at all, and not taj (spelled with a 'j').  since the term taj mahal does not occur in mogul courts it is absurd to search for any mogul explanation for it. both its components namely, 'taj' and' mahal' are of sanskrit origin. moreover, if the taj is believed to be a burial place, how can the term mahal, i.e., mansion apply to it?  several european visitors of shahjahan's time allude to the building as taj-e-mahal is almost the correct tradition, age old sanskrit name tej-o-mahalaya, signifying a shiva temple. contrarily shahjahan and aurangzeb scrupulously avoid using the sanskrit term and call it just a holy grave.  the tomb should be understood to signify not a building but only the grave or centotaph inside it. this would help people to realize that all dead muslim courtiers and royalty including humayun, akbar, mumtaz, etmad-ud-daula and safdarjang have been buried in capture hindu mansions and temples.  no muslim mausoleum has the facility for circumvolution, but taj mahal privides this facility. it indicates that in the pre-muslim era, devotees used to avail this facility to move round the emblem of lord shiva. tavernier, a french traveller of that time, wrote in his annals that a bazaar used to be held within the taj complex and it is solely a hindu tradition to hold bazaars and fairs within a temple complex, which is totally unusual for a muslim mausoleum.  the two buildings which face the marble taj from the east and west are identical in design, size and shape and yet the eastern building is explained away by islamic tradition, as a community hall while the western building is claimed to be a mosque. how could buildings meant for radically different purposes be identical? this proves that the western building was put to use as a mosque after seizure of the taj property by shahjahan. curiously enough the building being explained away as a mosque has no minaret. they form a pair af reception pavilions of the tejomahalaya temple palace.  a few yards away from the same flank is the nakkar khana alias drumhouse which is a intolerable incongruity for islam. the proximity of the drum house indicates that the western annex was not originally a mosque. contrarily a drum house is a neccesity in a hindu temple or palace because hindu chores,in the morning and evening, begin to the sweet strains of music.  the embossed patterns on the marble exterior of the centotaph chamber wall are foilage of the conch shell design and the hindu letter ""om"". the octagonally laid marble lattices inside the centotaph chamber depict pink lotuses on their top railing. the lotus, the conch and the om are the sacred motifs associated with the hindu deities and temples.  between the so-called mosque and the drum house is a multistoried octagonal well with a flight of stairs reaching down to the water level. this is a traditional treasury well in hindu temple palaces. treasure chests used to be kept in the lower apartments while treasury personnel had their offices in the upper chambers. the circular stairs made it difficult for intruders to reach down to the treasury or to escape with it undetected or unpursued. in case the premises had to be surrendered to a besieging enemy the treasure could be pushed into the well to remain hidden from the conquerer and remain safe for salvaging if the place was reconquered. such an elaborate multistoried well is superflous for a mere mausoleum. such a grand, gigantic well is unneccesary for a tomb.

472355,"believe it or not, there's actually a lot of skill behind pollock's paintings. if you look at [this one](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/pollock/pollock.number-8.jpg), at first glance it's just a random mess of colours. looking a bit harder, you'll notice a very specific blend of colours - he's using a limited palette here and he's thought about layering. if you grab some random paints and splash them about, they don't look as good as a pollock.  obviously this is primarily due to personal taste - some people just don't like pollock. but there's a complexity behind a pollock painting that isn't obvious. i'm not very good at explaining this - i study biology, not art, so don't have all the good explanations for this written down. but i can try with something a bit different.  [this painting here](http://www.googleartproject.com/museums/tate/our-english-coasts-1852-strayed-sheep-242) is called ""our english coasts"" (originally known as ""strayed sheep""). it's by william holman hunt and was painted in 1852. look at it quickly, now - what do you see? well, there's some sheep in the countryside. not much to it, right? i mean, you can argue there's some technical skill there, but at the end of the day, it's just a painting of some sheep.  zoom in and look at the shadows. hunt was one of the first artists to grasp the idea that shadows were coloured. if you tell a kid to draw a tree in a sunny field, they'll draw a black shadow under the tree. a slightly older kid might use dark green for the grass under the tree and light green for grass in the sunshine. if you look at this painting, there's purple shadows and yellow shadows and all sorts of interesting things going on. if you really look hard you'll notice that some of the sheeps' faces in sunlight are the same colour as the cliff face. you might also notice that the cliff face is painted in considerably less detail than the foreground because in real life, things further away are blurrier - again, he was a pre-raphelite who was really starting to ""get"" this.  there's another thing going on in this painting. there was a bit of a moral panic in the 1840s and 1850s because people were starting to go to church less frequently. there's an obvious metaphor here, the lord is our shepherd and all that. look where the sheep are - they're on a rocky cliff face, not the nice green field further in the background? is this where sheep should be? sheep should be grazing in the nice pastoral place, not stuck in brambles or standing on some crumbling rocks, backs turned to what might be a church in the distance. that sheep looking out to sea is quite possibly referencing the fact that many european countries were suitably pious so a lot of english theologians looked out across the channel for religious hope. the dark sheep in the foreground is quite clearly shoving the white sheep out of frame - this supposedly could represent any number of mortal vices.  there's other stuff going on in the picture too that i'm not sure about (my friend's been showing some of the stuff about this painting and we ended up looking at it for about an hour but we didn't go over the whole thing) - for example, why is there a sudden transition from the nasty brambles to the brightly lit flowers with butterflies? but do you see what i mean? we've gone from ""oh, it's some sheep on a hill"" to an exploration of how people actually see the world to a metaphor for the religious state of early victorian england. you could quite easily rebuke this with ""well, it's just a painting of sheep! you're reading stuff into things that just isn't there!"" but that seems a bit disingenuous.  that's what i as a philistine can explain about the sheep painting and much like how there's a lot of hidden complexity in ""our english coasts"", there's a lot of hidden complexity behind a pollock. admittedly, i somehow doubt that pollock has worked any religious metaphors into his paint splatters, but while you could go ""they're a bunch of paint splatters that a five year old could do!"" you could look a whole bunch deeper. there's a lot of movement in his pieces and he said they were at least partially inspired by navajo sand paintings - and navajo sand paintings were often more about the process of creation rather than just the final creation themselves.  one of my favourite places in the whole wide world is the rothko room in the tate modern. if i've got time to kill when i'm back home and out and about in central london, i'll go to the tate modern and just sit in that room and stare. [this is one of the pieces in the rothko room](http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/powerofart/images/popups/rothko2.jpg) and you'll probably have the same reaction to that as i did when i first saw it online - ""wtf is that? a kitkat?"". but the thing with rothko paintings is that you need to see them in real life. rothko designed his paintings to be meditative experiences and if you stare at them, well, through optical illusion they start looking like they're floating. it's kinda hard to explain, but rothko felt they were a way of getting closer to god. i've spent hours in the rothko room and - well, you could just dismiss his pieces as random squares or you could see them as something profound. know what i mean?",0,

how can you goddamn rationalize that federally recognizing gay marriage is a goddamn bad as santorum's bigotry?! and the states are as falliable to your bullshit strawman argument as the fed, if not more. you do realize that over 40% of mississippi's republican's **oppose interracial marriage** right? me pushing for equality of gay people is not some evil fascist idea and you should be disgusted with yourself for making it out to be such.    2. and you are bitching that you can't donate because you are being taxed? and your retort is ""why don't i pay for it all myself?"" this is one of the shittiest arguments i've heard from your side. i don't give a shit what he thought was appropriate 50 years ago, because that's how little his views have changed, and no this is not a good thing.   3. enron, the industiral revolution, the deregulation that allowed for those conditions to form. or lets go see how that libertarian economy in africa is doing, hm? oh and the housing crash was the market's fault for accepting sub-par loans and trading them like a game of hot potato.the market is not a goddamn saint. accept this.   4. i made no assertions that our system is perfect. i just said that the extreme, anarchist-like views of a libertarian are stupid. marijuana should be legal, as should other drugs with no addiction attached to them.  your goddamn candidate has constantly expressed his lack of giving a shit about minorities or anyone who needs help. his ""i want to release, non-violent drug offenders"" policy is one of the rare few i agree with, [but i take issue with your bigoted belief that it is **90% black**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incarceration_in_the_united_states).  25-50% would have been acceptable, but you decided to go for goddamn 90% and that's how i know you don't know what you are talking about. 10 seconds would have given your bullshit a little more accuracy, but clearly all of the offenders, must have been black. that sickens me as a black male. i don't call people racist or dwell on race at all, but this clearly shows the kind of bullshit rp supporters believe.   5. i advocate for helping the black community and for programs to help them out, and for cheap and affordable schooling that is of quality. but in your eyes, that's a big no-no, and that's wealth redistribution. *socialism*. we can't have that. oh, and since ron paul probably would cut my loans from me, fuck him yet again. its one thing to say you don't understand affirmative action, its another thing entirely to turn it into some disgusting persecution parade. ron paul is in the majority, and judging from his stance on the civil rights act, the voting rights re-authorization, his views on secession and the south being right (apparently slavery totally wasn't a major point of the civil war guys), or his various ties to white supremacists, and decreased aid for the black community, he *doesn't give a flying fuck about us. i don't even need to bring up his newsletters, that's how damn bad he is. affirmative action is an attempt to make up for the decades upon decades of lost job opportunities and education that the period from 1800-1960 caused. because of those lost opportunities, the black and minority community is twice as poor as the caucasian community. it is not anti-white, it will not continue when the communities as showing the same statistics, and it is not taking the stupid black kid over the smart white one, its for the marginal decision, when the two are equally balanced, and there is still room. this is to make sure that the black and minority community isn't perpetually poorer than caucasian community. just saying that minorities should deal with it, is complete bullshit.  if his bullshit is anything like his stance on gay marriage, he would probably let mississippi annul interracial marriages, and get upset at anyone calling him a bigot or upset at the big, bad fed forcing mississippi not to be a backwards bigoted state.  6.  if you realize what crystal meth and other highly addictive drugs do to a person and how *it is* tied in with crime, and how much it costs society, you wouldn't advocate it.  it causes serious harm to people, and harms families. if you pay any attention to what happens to crack addicted individuals, you would know that this is not good for society.  i support a rehab and education program instead of jail time, but come on. you would increase the costs for the rehab program, and lives would be destroyed in the process. this is a pretty clear cut issue if you have had any interaction with someone addicted to a serious drug. no one gives a shit about marijuana, cigs, alcohol, or other light addictive drugs if they are regulated to prevent collateral damage to other people, but to defend a position that actively harms people is bankrupt.  it causes more harm than good, which is what we weigh with any freedom that we choose to either defend or denounce like rape, sexual harassment, assault or any other ""freedom"" we have a law against.   6. am i really pointing a gun at your head to pay your taxes? or am i expecting that you pay your share for the roads you use, the affordable and clean water, food, power, and other standards that you benefit from? or the military program. or the courts that can give you a lawyer. we aren't forcing you to pay shit. you just don't want to give up your citizenship and the benefits it affords, and have decided to instead bitch about the price, in order to give us all a shittier product.   7. i criticize the shit out of our government's actions, obama's actions, and our military's actions. i expect them to renovate, instead of tearing the whole damn building down, and saying fuck it, lets just do without. businessmen aren't held accountable for nearly as much as the fed. the fact that they are even held accountable now, is thanks to the environment the government created. in your capitalistic wet dream known as the industrial revolution, businessmen were accountable for jack shit. i won't trust them to not fuck up my water supply or my electric bill, because they have shown that at the first sign of restrained regs, that they are irresponsible and blind to their customers. go look up enron. read up. you back? good.    9. holy fuck, you think ron paul is a good person? holy shit, that's hilarious.  you guys are a cult, and if you think my rights will be protected by your deity known as the ""free market"", you are full of fucking shit. how about that whole period before the 1960's where they did fuck all to preserve our rights? which is hilariously hypocritical, 'cause ron paul was arguing for their ""right"" to discriminate. and if you make an argument painting discrimination in a warm fuzzy light, fuck you.   they sure as hell freed the slaves, as opposed to your good buddy rp's south. and repealed jim crow, by using their big bad federal power to force the states to not be bigoted. and sure as hell helped me and generations of my family fund their college education. but unlike you, i'm willing to see the good its done, while actively seeking to stop and make sure the bad never occurs or finds a place in the government. your side bullshits for saintly paul's sake, even though he is the [definition of a neo-confederate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neo-confederate) and dismisses the potential harm he will cause to minorities, and surprisingly often, defends and **praises** it. that is disgusting. and sickening. he would stand by while people clearly trampled on people's rights. that was an issue in the civil rights movement, and it will not be one i look on lightly.   that being said. fuck ron paul. fuck neo confederates. fuck libertarianism.   here are some sources if you want to see how i came to the conclusion that rp is a neo-confederate, and doesn't give a shit about my rights.

""...who art in heaven..."" the man continues in overvoice.  stomping across a wooden porch of the town we see the heavy black boots of a dark stranger as he strides with slow purpose forward.  we see the back of the head of this stranger. he wears a heavy duster and a wide brimmed hat. the back of his neck is heavy with many-chinned contusions.  the strangers face, pale and thick, covered in mechanical augments along the face and neck, most apparent of which is a massive robotic lens replacing his right eye. the socket glows blue and is vaugely reminiscent of the stalk of a dalek.  we see the overvoice speaking. he stands in front of a scattered group of town residents, standing dumbfounded in the middle of the town's road. he's well dressed in starched suit and tie and himself wears a hat. he perhaps is the town's historically inaccurate town leader. he stoically continues ""...thy kingdom come...""  we see the doctor wearing his favorite stetson with his right hand cooly in his pocket staring down at the dirt with a pick in his teeth. an opponent steps in and frames his figure between his legs in the iconic western style.  the doctor looks up to his opponent with a grimace. he stands outside the clocktower of the town labeled ""grand central"".  ""...thy will be done...""  the doctor stand across from the cyborg in the center of town, nothing but dust between the two of the mas they stare off at each other.  we see a close shot of the cyborg's face as he looks outward intimidatingly in a sweep as he bellows ""face me!"". his teeth are surprisingly a pearly white.  we see the doctor, in the same town but now at night looking out at the camera. behind him are amy and rory and a handful of the town's denizens as they stand in the middle of the dirt road. he says with fearful urgency ""run!"".  the theme ""every planet, every star"" kicks in. the following scenes coincide with the score's stabs of the trumpet.  we see a window shatters open as reddish light and a strong gust of wind blast forth with a roar.  now day again in the town we see a man in a brown coat ducking and lifting his arms in instinctive defense as a shot narrowly misses his head and hits into the wooden wall behind him in an explosion of dust.  in town center, still midday, the cyborg points forward his canon-like arm like a junkyard megaman as a window across from him explodes in a shower of broken glass.  we see a man in a tweed coat and a hat cover his head as he awkwardly runs alongside the dirt to dodge something. he flings his hands up like an idiot and given that he's outside the grand central i mentioned earlier, this is almost certainly the doctor again.  in the middle of the desert there a towering orange explosion as if it were made by tnt or dynamite. nothing else, just an explosion.  we see probably-rory running alongside a portly mustachioed man in a bowler cap across the desert towards the camera.  we again see the portly man and probably-rory walking across rocky terrain alongside a white cliff face when an explosion blasts in between the two of them, throwing up a blast of dirt.  an explosion tosses up more dirt, but this time from a lower angle.  an explosion of sparks lights up the dark. a small ring of blue lights can bee seen where the right eye of a difficult to discern figure would be who seems to be creating the sparks. my moneys on it being the cyborg.  suddenly it's day *in the arctic tundra* and the doctor is sprinting forward followed by probably-rory and a figure in a full body white tundra suit.  the doctor, probably-rory, and the white-clad figure are specks on a sweeping arctic landscape.  back to the old west probably the doctor chases a tall, dark probably-the-cyborg across a flat plateau dotted with dry yellowed grass.  we see amy in a white blue-striped shirt running at night in what appears to be a modern city, possibly london's underground. she quickly looks behind her to glimpse her pursuers.  still at night, but in what appears to be a cemetery or something we see four figures running to camera. one is a woman in a white dress and two are holding flashlights. their garb appears to be modern-day.  the doctor, probably-rory and some balding red-headed bloke run *away* from camera towards a bleak rocky cliff face that stretches on across the beach. they head away from a rocky shore, the sky looks a bleak grey.  we see another shot of the red-headed bloke running alongside the beach he turns back in wide-eyed panic. he's wearing a black vest and wristwatch and apparently has a goatee. probably rory's sprinting beside him in yellow shorts.  we see the doctor's feet sliding on ice (or something) lit by colored lights, maybe he's at a skating rink, i don't know. but he's having trouble keeping balance.  we see the doctor, still in the ice-rink-thing, making a funny face as he slides forward, trying to keep his balance.  the camera is facing up at a beautiful blue sky dotted with clouds as the doctor and amy rush up to inspect it. it being the camera.  we see a figure that appears to be the cyborg in a dark room, possibly a church judging by the stained slass pane on the wall behind him marching forward with his menacing canon-arm (producing a menacing circular ring of lights), blue eye a-glowin'.  we see the townsfolk positively pissing their pants in the pews of the church as they scream at the off-screen location the cyborg would be.  we see a little girl in a red room scream. there's a banister behind her and her garb appears to be.. i dunno... victorian? i'm no dress expert, and that kid is *screaming*.  we see a buxom bartender/burlesque dancer/prostitute behind the bar of a saloon, bottle of alcohol lining the wall behind her. the doctor is leaning over the bar and she is seductively sticking something in her mouth. suddenly both her and the doctor look to someone entering the bar in surprise.  we see the town center with people bustling about, mostly shouting and yelling in panic. lots of yelling and running in this segment.  another shot of villagers panicking and running about, this time with what appears to be an elderly blacksmith panicking in the foreground.  said elderly blacksmith takes a dive and bellyflops on the dirt like a fucking grenades about to blow, but he lands painfully.  the doctor, against all of his codes of ethics and morality, is pointing a gun just offscreen as townspeople with moustaches stand behind him.  amy, standing across from the doctor in what appears to be the same spot as the last scene gesticulates with a revolver with a level of idiotic carelessness that mirrors her respect to the danger of swords, says ""have you been taking stupid lessons since i last saw you!?"" much in the way a middle-school girl would insult one of their friends if they weren't terribly bright.   the gun goes off and she nearly shoots a dude in the foot.  towns people raise their hands with the sort of immediate shock one responds to when someone crazy has a *fucking gun*.  mr. monopoly shouts ""what's wrong with you!?"" to amy as if anyone has the time to sit down and explain all that.  a sheriff with a fu manchu announces ""everyone who isn't an american, *drop your gun* as he accusatorily points directly at amy.  instead of *dropping the damn gun* amy gestures with it and fires off another shot, causing the surrounding townspeople to cringe in shock. she shouts ""i didn't mean to do that."" and looks around with an obnoxious ""listen guys, i'm explaining"" shrug. she doesn't put down the gun because *she's a goddamn idiot*.  about six of the townspeople seem to have grabbed the doctor like the least friendly form of crowd surfing possible and are running him to the edge of town. the doctor is going ""whooooooooooooooa!"" as they do this.  they uncerimoniously toss him outside of said bull-skull clad gate.  we see the doctor stand up with a pained look on his face.  we then see virtually every patron of the town pull out and cock their revolvers, pointing it directly at the camera.  the doctor, amy, and rory are having a dandy little jaunt along the town's streets when a lamppost explodes in a shower of sparks.",1,

949641,"for much of high school, i lived in a sectioned income district. i just pulled that term out of my ass, i hope you like it. anyway, half of the town bordered a major ghetto city, the kind of city where there are gunshots heard at three in the morning and stabbings were not unheard of. i did not live in that area, i lived on the *other* side of town, the nice side of town. i was still in the district but lived so far away that instead of sending a bus to pick me up, they sent a van. this did not stop me from making friends with people who lived on the bad side, but i only ventured over there once and my dad never let me go back.  the first thing i found strange was that i was required to supply myself with food, i was not allowed to eat their food. i also had to bring my own toilet paper if i did not want to have their two square ration of thin sandpaper delight enforced on me. they had a small tube television in the living room, and that was about as advanced as the electronics could possibly get in that house. they did not have cable or internet. none of them had cell phones. the house was disheveled and falling apart, and i was certain that the floor hadn't been cleaned in weeks. garbage was piled up in all the nooks and crannies.   my friend did not have many clothes. she had one ratty old winter jacket which was three sizes too small. it was torn at one shoulder and stained. most of her shirts were much too large and stained with paint or oil. she had two pairs of jeans. she always had a horrible stench about her, which led me to believe that she did not or could not wash her clothes as often as she should. her hair was almost always greasy. the only thing i saw on the shower shelf while using the facilities was a bottle of vo5 shampoo and a couple of cheap, disposable shaving razors.   her parents were avid ents, and we all sat around smoking a few bowls out of a fairly nice looking piece. my friend and i decided to go for a walk afterwards, and i saw parts of the neighborhood i will never dare go back to. it was only about five o'clock in the evening when we ventured out. i saw many roving groups of black people, predominantly male but there were a few female groups. some of them shouted obscenities at me. ""white bitch"", ""white whore"", ""cracker"" and the like were shouted by females, whereas males had more of a tendency to refer to me using endearing terms such as, ""baby, wanna come over here and gimmie a little love?"". i found it odd because i had not made any eye contact with them, i had tried my best not to acknowledge their presence and was still quite mellow from the weed. i saw a couple (or perhaps they weren't a couple) engaging in some oral activities in an alley. a fight was going on in an abandoned parking lot and a whole bunch of people were yelling. i clearly remember seeing the faces of some of my classmates in that crowd.  the next day, there was a stabbing at a corner store near my friend's house. it seemed normal to many people at school, as if it was normal to hear about someone losing their life in a random act of violence. of course my father heard about it and banned me from going over there again, not that i would have wanted to anyway. it seems as though the people that live in poverty definitely become a product of their environment. they adapt to the conditions that they face to keep their own life on a track they believe will look ""cool"" to keep them out of the most trouble with their peers. it did not seem as though it would be a pleasant experience.",0,

229274,"well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist. lets take cuba first. it was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s. today the population has a life expactancy longer than america. there's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the us' terrorist war and blockade of the island.  in venezuela poverty has halved in ten years, illiteracy has been wiped out, there are 50% more people voting in elections than before, malnourishment has been banished forever etc.   there's a common idea that what was called 'socialism' in eastern europe failed. well, it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument. i grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world. since 1989 the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again. sure, gdp might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything, such as the right to not die or the right to go to school.   at the heart of your question is what constitutes being 'poor'. i really don't think there are any poor countries left- maybe 200-300 years ago there were. let me explain; i imagine africa and asia were your ideas of 'poor places'. but this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the british. robert clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities, gold dripping from wall to wall. democratic republic of the congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world. and yet it may have more natural resources than any other. it is teeming with minerals and metals. where's the money going? into dutch oil companies, scandanavian electronic corporations and us rubber companies. in fact, the countries which 'should' be poorest, those with the least amount of resources, are the richest (western europe). there are no poor countries, only poor people.   what i'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out, these countries would be richer than the us and the uk were in the 20s and 30s. there are really only rich or mega-rich countries now, but, because of capitalism, the majority of the world still lives in poverty. so, in answer, the people would be much better off under socialism.",0,

902131,"my administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section 1022(c) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law. and i will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as chief executive and commander in chief if those procedures fall short, including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable.  sections 1023-1025 needlessly interfere with the executive branch’s processes for reviewing the status of detainees. going forward, consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the conference report, my administration will interpret section 1024 as granting the secretary of defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section.  sections 1026-1028 continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch. section 1027 renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year 2012 to transfer guantanamo detainees into the united states for any purpose. i continue to oppose this provision, which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute guantanamo detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests. for decades, republican and democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in federal court. those prosecutions are a legitimate, effective, and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the nation. removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security. moreover, this intrusion would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  section 1028 modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch’s authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country. this hinders the executive’s ability to carry out its military, national security, and foreign relations activities and like section 1027, would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. the executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers. in the event that the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict. section 1029 requires that the attorney general consult with the director of national intelligence and secretary of defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals. i sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the united states under the 2001 authorization for use of military force, the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section 1022 before the justice department files charges or seeks an indictment. notwithstanding that limitation, this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the department of justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the attorney general free from outside interference. moreover, section 1029 could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security. my administration will interpret and implement section 1029 in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals, limits delays in the investigative process, ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited, and preserves the integrity and independence of the department of justice.   other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers. section 1244 requires the president to submit a report to the congress 60 days prior to sharing any u.s. classified ballistic missile defense information with russia. section 1244 further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided. while my administration intends to keep the congress fully informed of the status of u.s. efforts to cooperate with the russian federation on ballistic missile defense, my administration will also interpret and implement section 1244 in a manner that does not interfere with the president’s constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications. other sections pose similar problems. sections 1231, 1240, 1241, and 1242 could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets; and sections 1235, 1242, and 1245 would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, i will treat the provisions as non-binding.  my administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation, but certain provisions remain concerning. my administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as chief executive and commander in chief, will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future, and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my administration throughout my time in office.  barack obama  the white house, december 31, 2011.",0,

627871,"the beatles' songs seem to carry a quality not found in 99% of musicians' output. as composers, each of the beatles were able to create songs that appealed to not only a wide swath of people across the world, but were also intelligent and among the first songs composed in western pop that approached subjects outside the usual love story topics.  the who were also innovative, although it was more about their musicianship than masterful songcraft. roger daltrey was one of the most powerful vocalists of the 60's and 70's, and pete townshend wrote some fantastic riffs and played far louder than most guitarists before him were willing to. keith moon is still considered to be one of the greatest rock drummers to pick up sticks, even with the emergence of some amazing drummers in the past 10-15 years. listening to a who track with moon on it is unlike most experiences in rock or music in general thanks to his virtuostic drumming.  also, the who were pioneers in their own right. they broke new ground for the traditional ""power core"" of bass, guitar and drums in a rock format. pete played his guitar as a rhythm-keeping device, john entwistle played his bass much more like a solo instrument, being noted as the first recorded bassist to play a solo (my generation,) and keith was stated by pete to play drums more like a keyboardist, exploring his tonal palette rather than merely keeping a beat. this unique sound makes bands like the who far more memorable and respectable than many other bands of their period.   put simply, these bands have qualities that make them stand out. there were many, many bands that were similar to and directly copied the beatles and the who, but are either forgotten or not given anywhere nearly as much respect as either two. bands like the ventures and the animals were fantastic in the period prior to the breakout of beatlemania and the who's success, but are far less remembered and successful in modern times simply because they lack that ""x factor"" that the beatles and the who had in spades.",0,

the texts spoke of a hidden underworld into which the great ruler could walk and speak with the dead for advice, a forbidden realm out of which only those descended from the sun himself could leave.  we went anyway.  it rained the first night in our camp, great splashing drops that beat on the trees above and seeped into our tents, dripping onto my face as i pretended to sleep, fearing that the sound would disguise the approach of an animal.  the torrent continued through morning, and we trekked out of the forest towards the temple under dark skies and over sodden grounds.  rivers overflowed in the distance, but we could barely see them through the thick jungle.  this rain was unusual here, and the plants seemed as downtrodden as we did under the weight of the dripping water.  it was a relief to enter into the temple doors, where the pounding grew to a dull rumble as we went further inside.  i paused for a moment to fumble my flashlight out of one of our traveling bags, but albert

stone throne at the end of it, seated on two levels of steps.  john smiled as he noticed the bricks behind the throne.  two great slabs, they had been fitted tightly together, but there was little dirt in the dark cracks between them.  they were cool to the touch, and covered in dirt.  i nervously wiped the dirt onto my jeans as john began to lever up the rightmost slab with a spade.  it shifted, a little, but fell back down.  determined,  albert and i joined in with the remaining spade and a crowbar, lifting one side stone up enough that we could slide a corner onto the surrounding tile.  with a little more pushed, a gap opened up big enough for one of us, opening into a dark room with a stairwell at one end.  i went first, clutching my flashlight tightly as i dropped down through the hole we had created, onto an icy stone floor.  the first thing i noticed as i stood up were the carvings, great jaguars and men that seemed to be walking towards the stairwell, swimming on top a great river which flowed towards the stairs.  the meaning seemed clear, and i followed them, feeling confident and excited.  the stairs kept leaning downwards, and the walls of the stairwell were free of the torch brackets i had seen upstairs.  only the carving of the river flowed down besides me, a few wavy lines on the bottom of the wall that continued, with the occasional bump and loop, to lead me downwards.  i didn't hear my comrades behind me, but i didn't pay attention.  this was exciting.  the stairs in front of me stopped, though, suddenly, leading to a steep dropoff.  the space in front of me looked like a room with no floor, with the walls instead extending downwards into darkness.  i heard the rush of water, making faint rustles and snaps below.  on the wall opposite this pit was a great painting, in faded black marks, of a regal looking man surrounded by fanged, twisted demons that seemed to writhe as i watched.  the man himself wore a tight, bundle-like crown and held a flame in his hands, though, and his expression was free of fear or concern, his pupil-less eyes free of worry.  it was then that i felt my legs give way, unexpectedly, and i fell forward on the floor and into the abyss.  the first thing i felt when i landed was the cold.  the water that rushed around me and cushioned my fall was as cold as death, and i felt, with my remaining thought, that it would be ice if it were not moving.  i fought the initial urge to scream as i struggled away from the source of the splashing, reaching a smoothly flowing channel that seemed to lead away from where i had fallen.  as i claimed onto the bank, which was wet and slgihtly muddy, i found the the place was not darkness, but bathed in a faint blue light.  the room seemed divided into four quadrants by the four channels of water, and it seemed to have no walls, as if it extended beyond me forever, into a mist from the waterfall i had just landed in.  as i turned to the cieling i gasped.  there were insects, there, great swarms of beetles that glowed barely, flitting about the room.  they were black, with little red dots on their shiny backs.  when one fluttered it's wings slightly and bared it's torso, though, i saw that underneath they were pale, bony white.  as i staggered back, i felt a clump of the beetles drop onto my shoulder, scattering and making a faint patter as a few fell to the floor.  screaming in terror i turned to find the water, but at that moment i felt a tug on my scalp, then another, then another.  it felt as though they were eating my hair, digging towards the root.    suddenly, i saw the room bathed in light as millions of beetles took flight from their hive.  at once my head burned in agony as i felt my scalp torn to tiny shreds as millions of beetles clamored over my head., digging through my flesh and exposing the bone of my skull.  i blacked out.  with my dying breath, i decided to check reddit on my phone, found this thread, and figured i'd post.  probably won't be able to respond to coments, though.  **tl;dr: if you go exploring, *always wear a hat*.**",0,

480043,"chapter 2.  about half way between west egg and new york the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. this is a valley of ashes — a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. occasionally a line of gray cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-gray men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight. but above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of doctor t. j. eckleburg. the eyes of doctor t. j. eckleburg are blue and gigantic — their irises are one yard high. they look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away. but his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.  the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. there is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that i first met tom buchanan’s mistress.  the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. his acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. though i was curious to see her, i had no desire to meet her — but i did. i went up to new york with tom on the train one afternoon, and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.  “we’re getting off,” he insisted. “i want you to meet my girl.”  i think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. the supercilious assumption was that on sunday afternoon i had nothing better to do.  i followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under doctor eckleburg’s persistent stare. the only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact main street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing. one of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage — repairs. george b. wilson. cars bought and sold.— and i followed tom inside.  the interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a ford which crouched in a dim corner. it had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. he was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. when he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.  “hello, wilson, old man,” said tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. “how’s business?”  “i can’t complain,” answered wilson unconvincingly. “when are you going to sell me that car?”  “next week; i’ve got my man working on it now.”  “works pretty slow, don’t he?”  “no, he doesn’t,” said tom coldly. “and if you feel that way about it, maybe i’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”  “i don’t mean that,” explained wilson quickly. “i just meant ——”  his voice faded off and tom glanced impatiently around the garage. then i heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. she was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. she smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with tom, looking him flush in the eye. then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:  “get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”  “oh, sure,” agreed wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. a white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity — except his wife, who moved close to tom.  “i want to see you,” said tom intently. “get on the next train.”  “all right.”  “i’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.” she nodded and moved away from him just as george wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.  we waited for her down the road and out of sight. it was a few days before the fourth of july, and a gray, scrawny italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.  “terrible place, isn’t it,” said tom, exchanging a frown with doctor eckleburg.  “awful.”  “it does her good to get away.”  “doesn’t her husband object?”  “wilson? he thinks she goes to see her sister in new york. he’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”  so tom buchanan and his girl and i went up together to new york — or not quite together, for mrs. wilson sat discreetly in another car. tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those east eggers who might be on the train.  she had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as tom helped her to the platform in new york. at the news-stand she bought a copy of town tattle. and a moving-picture magazine, and in the station drug-store some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. up-stairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with gray upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. but immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.  “i want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “i want to get one for the apartment. they’re nice to have — a dog.”  we backed up to a gray old man who bore an absurd resemblance to john d. rockefeller. in a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.  “what kind are they?” asked mrs. wilson eagerly, as he came to the taxi-window.  “all kinds. what kind do you want, lady?”  “i’d like to get one of those police dogs; i don’t suppose you got that kind?”  the man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.  “that’s no police dog,” said tom.  “no, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment in his voice. “it’s more of an airedale.” he passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. “look at that coat. some coat. that’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”  “i think it’s cute,” said mrs. wilson enthusiastically. “how much is it?”  “that dog?” he looked at it admiringly. “that dog will cost you ten dollars.”  the airedale — undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white — changed hands and settled down into mrs. wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.  “is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.  “that dog? that dog’s a boy.”  “it’s a bitch,” said tom decisively. “here’s your money. go and buy ten more dogs with it.”  we drove over to fifth avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer sunday afternoon that i wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.  “hold on,” i said, “i have to leave you here.”  “no, you don’t,” interposed tom quickly.  “myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment. won’t you, myrtle?”  “come on,” she urged. “i’ll telephone my sister catherine. she’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”  “well, i’d like to, but ——”  we went on, cutting back again over the park toward the west hundreds. at 158th street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses. throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, mrs. wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.  “i’m going to have the mckees come up,” she announced as we rose in the elevator. “and, of course, i got to call up my sister, too.”",0,
367948,"this is one of my favorite topics so allow me to explain.  for the record, i'm mixed palestinian, caucasian and hispanic.  although racism is racism, there are two entirely different standards for it and with good reason.  in the history of the united states, i'm sure you're aware that africans (who are often the ancestors of what we call in the modern day ""african americans""), were enslaved for many years.  not only that, there were were often raped, their brothers murdered for the mildest of infractions, themselves tortured for daring to speak back to massuh and their children sold off on a whim bcuz massuh thought they would fetch a high biddin price.  upon the end of slavery many african (and now full, not 3/5) americans were poorer than they had been during their enslavement.  there was no longer a need or reason to feed or shelter them, now that they were being paid.  so they went back to work on the very plantations they would be able to escape bcuz they had no other skills.  add into this segergation, jim crow, plessy v ferugson and you still haven't covered even a fraction of the injustice suffered by the ancestors of african-americans at the hands of the ancestors of many caucasians.  even today, many minorities and mixed race individuals are self-conscious and struggle with racial identity issues.  compare that to the history of your family...i'm assuming you're white based on your post.  i'm going to guess their hardships in the last 500 years pale in comparison.  **tldr: a black person calling you ""cracker"" isn't even a fraction as racist as your ancestors raping, murdering, torturing and selling his ancestors and then you telling him that he shouldn't be allowed to call you a cracker.  that's something very few caucasians understand.  that's a little convoluted but i'm in a rush to get to class now.**  edit: the tldr is a paraphrase of something i read in an immortal technique blog.  edit #2: you guys can downvote and bitch all you want but i really could care less.  you guys can't even begin to understand until you can put yourself in someone elses shoes.  and them you wonder why non-caucasians think you're  you're assholes and elitists and make fun of you when you walk past us.  our anger might be misplaced but it's not unjustified.  until you realize three huuge advantages you still receive just by the god-given virtue of being born of a lighter skin tone, there's no rehabilitation that can go on between the races.",1,

831936,"although not on the 360, i do play on the ps3, and i sometimes forget the struggles that regularly occur for pc players. between prevalent hackers, and therefore frequent accusations of hacking even when one is simply playing well, it's nice to simply *never* need to worry about that. it doesn't even cross my mind when playing.  i recall playing tfc and tf2, amongst other things, on the pc, and getting incredibly good at the sniper. friends would actually call me a ""sentry with a scope"". that being said, there was exactly one server i could play on, since everyone there, including the admins, had known me for a long time. they had taken the time to spec me when i was sniping and saw i was, in fact, not hacking at all, but rather just an experienced sniper. i was able to play there without concern.  however, if i ever switched to a different server - perhaps my ""regular"" one was full, or empty, or simply down, often i would find myself getting kicked or even banned. it was incredibly frustrating. sure, i'd roll other classes, but when the other team, depending on the map, is rolling with half a dozen snipers, sometimes you just gotta scratch that itch.  in combination with the lack of driver issues, framerate concerns, overcrowed maps (seeing a 64 player server on metro is...just a complete clusterfuck), cheaters and hackers, quick-to-judge admins, concerns about upgrading, drm and origin, i find my enjoyment on the ps3 platform significantly elevated.",0,

304403,"&gt; richard dawkins is not the leader of atheism. i'm not even sure you are right that he does, as i've heard of no such thing, but even if, that's hardly what ""the movement"" wants.  well he is not the only one and countless others in this very thread have disagreed with the dictionary definition not to mention the countless other atheists i have talked to in regards to this. i'm taking this as a given that you want it changed. if not then i will continue to use the dictionary version of the word then, the very same one you yourself disagreed with.  &gt; sorry again, but you are wrong.  &gt; first of all, the original greek meaning of the word is irrelevant as the greeks never used the word in its literal meaning. in fact not believing in god was unthinkable at the same, so they used it about blasphemers or people who were angry at the gods.  &gt; secondly, at this time the term was applied by others. people didn't start identifying themselves as atheists until much later, and since then it has always been lack of belief.  like i said before and also provided links showing that the prefix a- means no, it can mean without as well, but i don't see how what you say here changes anything in the slightest. if what you say is true then why do you identify as atheists at all? does this mean you believe in god but are just rebelling against him?  &gt; care to name any? and even if true, that doesn't mean he doesn't know what they are - it just means he's arguing against one type of christianity that you don't happen to share.  here is a cracker for you. his argument against the kalam cosmological argument. it is a strawman. the argument states that anything that begins to exist must have a cause. he then rattles on about what caused god and how complex god must be if he created the universe, whcih is complicated.  question: how many christians do you know that believe that god began to exist?  answer: not many, probably none in the grand scheme of things.  hence why it is a strawman and hence why you should not read ricahrd dawkins when tries to do philosophy/theology. the guy is a scientist, he is best when he sticks to science. if you want to read atheist philosophy then read atheist philosophy.  &gt; yes, exactly! what surprises me is that you see something wrong with this position. and yes, i'm also an a-unicornist, but that's rarely a useful term as very few people believe in unicorns.  &gt; in case you didn't know, atheism is simply a response to theism. it's not an ideology or a belief, it's simply the answer ""we don't"" to the theists' ""we believe in god"".  for all intents &amp; purposes you don't believe that there is an invisible teapot around saturn and you do not believe that unicorns exist. the first thing you would do with the claim ""i can prove unicorns exist through new evidence"" is probably look at the guy in a funny way and think ""yeah, right, you're a moron"" and the reason for this is quite simply because you don't believe that unicorns exist. i really do hate it when people try to use semantic word games to get away from this fact. with people like that i usually just tell them ""i am not saying that god exists, i just lack a belief in atheism"", which usually fucking annoys them to fuck which is quite surprising since it is the exact same thing they are doing.  &gt; it is. you can't even disagree with that, unless you want to claim that owning slaves is still okay today or that women should still be subjugated. morality changes. the source of morality does not. you believe it is god, atheists tend to believe it's evolved survival instinct.  actually i can disagree on it. a persons subjective opinion on something does not mean it cannot exist objectively independent from him. for instance, people used to believe subjectively that the sun revolved around the earth. this does not change the fact that the earth revolves around the sun. also, just because people do not know what that objective truth is that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  as for the crap about slaves and subjugating women i can only assume that you don't really know what slavery in the old testament is really about. here is a clue, it is not north american slavery of black people. it is indentured servitude as mentioned in this article.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indentured_servitude  ""indentured servitude refers to the historical practice of contracting to work for a fixed period of time, typically three to seven years, in exchange for transportation, food, clothing, lodging and other necessities during the term of indenture. usually the father made the arrangements and signed the paperwork.[1] they included men and women; most were under the age of 21, and most became helpers on farms or house servants. in terms of living conditions and discipline, they were usually treated like relatives. they were not paid cash. it was a system that provided jobs and—most important—transportation for poor young people from the overcrowded labor markets of europe who wanted to come to labor-short america but had no money to pay for it. the great majority became farmers and farm wives""  except for the bit about cash. slaves in the ancient near east could become indentured servants in regards to a fixed cash sum at the start of the contract. this was set up as a way to help the poor people in the tribe.  &gt; yes. there is a very large difference. one is withholding judgement until further info is in, the other is judging.  i see, and are you withholding judgement about saturn having an invisible teapot spinning around it?  &gt; imagine i hand you a closed box. you have no idea what's in it (forget about size, etc.). i ask you if there is a bicycle in there. the rational answer would be that you don't know, but with no evidence whatsoever it's most likely not a bicycle, as it could be anything. the irrational answer would be ""i know it's not a bicycle"".  would it be irrational for me to say ""i know its not a unicorn""?  &gt; exactly. would you? how could you possibly know?  well i don't only use scientific empiricism to prove something. i can also use other forms of evidence. like historical evidence, witnesses, etc, etc and i base my belief in god based on other forms of evidence that i believe to be suitably reliable.   the way you would normally prove that something is not the case is to prove that the opposite is true instead. for instance if i say that 2+2=4, then i would be correct, so automatically you know that anything that says 2+3=4 would be incorrect.  in order to prove that god doesn't exist, then it would require to be shown that the universe came about without any help from god. yes, i know, its a difficult task granted, especially since science only shows the mechanisms of how something works rather than causes. i.e. i can explain how water boils in a kettle but i won't necessarily be able to show who put the kettle on in the first place.  i like to finish off by saying, that it is perfectly reasonable to have a position even if you don't have 100% evidence to back it up. i wouldn't say that the statement ""unicorns don't exist"" is an unreasonable position.  edit: if you have a few hours to waste cross refering the bible, here is an article explaining slavery (indentured servitude) in the old testament.  http://christianthinktank.com/qnoslave.html",1,

933788,"of course they research it before going on camera. they already know what the item is weeks before the show airs. here's how it works. there are producers who have a story idea. lets say we're in season 2 already, so everyone -- the cast, crew, producers, locations people, etc -- all know the gist of the show. the producers have spent the last couple months compiling story ideas, which they pass on up to the network heads, who yey or nay them, then send their notes to the producers. the producers are assigned different episodes, where they develop their story beats. today's episode looks like this: ""let's have main character discover a pre-civil war cannonball. meanwhile, while examining the cannonball, sidekick discovers something else -- a rusty old coin. how much is it worth? also, comic relief is back at home with diarrhea."" so with the show plotted out, the producers find 1: the props (pre-civil war cannonball, gold coin, etc) and 2: a location where one might potentially find a pre-civil war cannonball. then they bring in the cameras, the ""talent"" (never ""actors"" or ""cast""), and the props, and while they don't tell the talent what to specifically say, since this is season 2 and everyone is on the same page about what the show is about and what is needed to be said, the producers don't really need to coach the talent anymore. they usually film a scene a couple of times, then they shoot some otf (""on the fly"", or sometimes ots ""over the shoulder"") interviews where they talk about what they found and how exciting it is, and then a few days later when the main crews are at home resting, they do a more lengthy sit down interview where the producer has the talent ramble at length about the different story beats (the a story -- ""found a cannonball"" -- a b story -- ""and sidekick found a gold coin!!"" -- and a c story -- ""and comic relief  stayed back at the office with diarrhea!"") and then they send that footage back to their ny or la based studio where transcribers watch it all and make story notes, these are handed off to the producers and editors to cut together. walla, ""reality"" tv! when broken down like this, it's not much different than jersey shore, is it?",0,

336517,"insane:  1. jimmy graham retires to pursue his dream to be a basketball player. did you know he used to play basketball?  2. tim tebow establishes himself as an elite qb, even to be one of the bes to ever live. he leads the league in rushing and passing while throwing for 50 tds. his team finished with a 14-2 record after being swept by the orton led chiefs, who finish 11-5 and get a wild card. broncos get a first round bye and play the chiefs in the divisional round. the chiefs get a quick 6-0 lead after jamaal charles throws it to orton for an 70 yard td, but billy cundiff (they sign him off the waivers after he missed a game tying 30 yarder) misses the extra point, this time sailing wide right. he them reveals himself to be scott norwood. in the fourth quarter, the score is 6-3 chiefs but tim tebow has the ball with 1:00 left on his own 50. his clutchness drives his team 5 yards and matt prater makes a 62 yard fg to tie it. scott norwood hen kills himself. anyways, on the third play of overtime tim tebow runs for a 50 yard td and advances to the afc championship to play the patriots in a rematch of last year's thriller. ne has been questioned if their defense composed of gronk as a linebacker, welker as cb,and ochocinco and brian hoyer as safeties could stop this tebow led offense. in the 4th quarter the score is tied 44-44 with 1:30 left on the broncos 10, broncos ball. at this very moment belichick reveals himself as the antichrist and uses his powers to stop the broncos. little did he know that tebow was actually jesus, and this was his secondcoming. belichick causes an earthquake to stop him, but is no match for tebow's jesus powers as he flies into the endzone for a touchdown. after winning the game he stabs belichick, killing him and making the entire world erupt with cheers.   two weeks later, they get ready to play the rams in the superbowl. 10 minutes before gametime, tebow/jesus announces that the rapture will begin now. as many non-christian in the stadium begin to panic and raping every woman they see, jesus laughs and says ""april fools!"", and rises back into heaven.",0,

296085,"there are no profanities or swearing in japanese, at least not in the sense that westerners would be familiar with.  (as mentioned in other branches of this thread, you can omit the appropriate politeness level.)  there are a few racial slurs. *chon* and *korian* and *chousenjin* for koreans, *zainichi* for ethnic koreans living in japan who do not speak korean, *sankokujin* for koreans and/or chinese, *jappu* for japanese (virtually exclusively used to refer to some outsider's racism towards japanese, similar to how a caucasian american might use the term, ""whitey""), *shirobuta* (lit. white pig) for caucasians, *kurobuta* (lit. black pig) for blacks.  note that i've never actually seen or heard those last two outside of one or two occurrences on the internet, so i'm not even positive if that's the correct pronunciation.  it should be worth noting that just about any reference to a korean other than *kankokujin* (lit. south korean) is essentially a racial slur, even if it's a politically correct term.  there is also the term *onna* (lit. female) when used without politeness modifiers, such as *onnna no hito*, which could mean something mildly equivalent to the english word, ""bitch,"" but that's really just a lack of appropriate politeness, and even then, it's used very commonly in formal settings where politeness modifiers are not used (i.e. on forms).  there's the term *bicchi* (loanword from english, ""bitch""), but that really just means, ""a woman with an unagreeable personality"", ""an unlikeable woman.""  you could say *kuso* (lit. shit), but that's not nearly as offensive as the english term, ""shit,"" and would more accurately be translated as, ""crap.""  when it comes down to it, outside of racial slurs, there are no words that are insults or offensive in of themselves.  there is no, ""shit,"" ""fuck,"" ""cunt,"" ""asslicker"", ""wanker"", ""cocksucker"", etc.  the closest you can say is, ""jerk,"" or, ""impolite person"", or, ""crappy person,"" and even those are only used in manga/anime and the internet.",1,

982955,"forks high school had a frightening total of only three hundred and fifty-seven -- now fifty-eight -- students; there were more than seven hundred people in my junior class alone back home. all of the kids here had grown up together--their grandparents had been toddlers together. i would be the new girl from the big city, a curiosity, a freak.  maybe, if i looked like a girl from phoenix should, i could work this to my advantage. but physically, i'd never fit in anywhere. i should be tan, sporty, blond -- a volleyball player, or a cheerleader, perhaps -- all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun.  instead, i was ivory-skinned, without even the excuse of blue eyes or red hair, despite the constant sunshine. i had always been slender, but soft somehow, obviously not an athlete; i didn't have the necessary hand-eye coordination to play sports without humiliating myself -- and harming both myself and anyone else who stood too close.  when i finished putting my clothes in the old pine dresser, i took my bag of bathroom necessities and went to the communal bathroom to clean myself up after the day of travel. i looked at my face in the mirror as i brushed through my tangled, damp hair. maybe it was the light, but already i looked sallower, unhealthy. my skin could be pretty -- it was very clear, almost translucent-looking -- but it all depended on color. i had no color here.  facing my pallid reflection in the mirror, i was forced to admit that i was lying to myself. it wasn't just physically that i'd never fit in. and if i couldn't find a niche in a school with three thousand people, what were my chances here?  i didn't relate well to people my age. maybe the truth was that i didn't relate well to people, period. even my mother, who i was closer to than anyone else on the planet, was never in harmony with me, never on exactly the same page. sometimes i wondered if i was seeing the same things through my eyes that the rest of the world was seeing through theirs. maybe there was a glitch in my brain.  but the cause didn't matter. all that mattered was the effect. and tomorrow would be just the beginning.  i didn't sleep well that night, even after i was done crying. the constant whooshing of the rain and wind across the roof wouldn't fade into the background. i pulled the faded old quilt over my head, and later added the pillow, too. but i couldn't fall asleep until after midnight, when the rain finally settled into a quieter drizzle.  thick fog was all i could see out my window in the morning, and i could feel the claustrophobia creeping up on me. you could never see the sky here; it was like a cage.  breakfast with charlie was a quiet event. he wished me good luck at school. i thanked him, knowing his hope was wasted. good luck tended to avoid me. charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. after he left, i sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. nothing was changed. my mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house. over the small fireplace in the adjoining handkerchief-sized family room was a row of pictures. first a wedding picture of charlie and my mom in las vegas, then one of the three of us in the hospital after i was born, taken by a helpful nurse, followed by the procession of my school pictures up to last year's. those were embarrassing to look at -- i would have to see what i could do to get charlie to put them somewhere else, at least while i was living here.  it was impossible, being in this house, not to realize that charlie had never gotten over my mom. it made me uncomfortable.  i didn't want to be too early to school, but i couldn't stay in the house anymore. i donned my jacket -- which had the feel of a biohazard suit -- and headed out into the rain.  it was just drizzling still, not enough to soak me through immediately as i reached for the house key that was always hidden under the eaves by the door, and locked up. the sloshing of my new waterproof boots was unnerving. i missed the normal crunch of gravel as i walked. i couldn't pause and admire my truck again as i wanted; i was in a hurry to get out of the misty wet that swirled around my head and clung to my hair under my hood.  inside the truck, it was nice and dry. either billy or charlie had obviously cleaned it up, but the tan upholstered seats still smelled faintly of tobacco, gasoline, and peppermint. the engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. well, a truck this old was bound to have a flaw. the antique radio worked, a plus that i hadn't expected.   finding the school wasn't difficult, though i'd never been there before. the school was, like most other things, just off the highway. it was not obvious that it was a school; only the sign, which declared it to be the forks high school, made me stop. it looked like a collection of matching houses, built with maroon-colored bricks. there were so many trees and shrubs i couldn't see its size at first. where was the feel of the institution? i wondered nostalgically. where were the chain-link fences, the metal detectors?  i parked in front of the first building, which had a small sign over the door reading front office. no one else was parked there, so i was sure it was off limits, but i decided i would get directions inside instead of circling around in the rain like an idiot. i stepped unwillingly out of the toasty truck cab and walked down a little stone path lined with dark hedges. i took a deep breath before opening the door.   inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than i'd hoped. the office was small; a little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, a big clock ticking loudly. plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn't enough greenery outside. the room was cut in half by a long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. there were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by a large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. she was wearing a purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed.   the red-haired woman looked up. ""can i help you?""   ""i'm isabella swan,"" i informed her, and saw the immediate awareness light her eyes. i was expected, a topic of gossip no doubt. daughter of the chief's flighty ex-wife, come home at last.   ""of course,"" she said. she dug through a precariously stacked pile of documents on her desk till she found the ones she was looking for. ""i have your schedule right here, and a map of the school."" she brought several sheets to the counter to show me.   she went through my classes for me, highlighting the best route to each on the map, and gave me a slip to have each teacher sign, which i was to bring back at the end of the day. she smiled at me and hoped, like charlie, that i would like it here in forks. i smiled back as convincingly as i could.   when i went back out to my truck, other students were starting to arrive. i drove around the school, following the line of traffic. i was glad to see that most of the cars were older like mine, nothing flashy. at home i'd lived in one of the few lower-income neighborhoods that were included in the paradise valley district. it was a common thing to see a new mercedes or porsche in the student lot. the nicest car here was a shiny volvo, and it stood out. still, i cut the engine as soon as i was in a spot, so that the thunderous volume wouldn't draw attention to me. i looked at the map in the truck, trying to memorize it now; hopefully i wouldn't have to walk around with it stuck in front of my nose all day. i stuffed everything in my bag, slung the strap over my shoulder, and sucked in a huge breath. i can do this, i lied to myself feebly. no one was going to bite me. i finally exhaled and stepped out of the truck.   i kept my face pulled back into my hood as i walked to the sidewalk, crowded with teenagers. my plain black jacket didn't stand out, i noticed with relief.   once i got around the cafeteria, building three was easy to spot. a large black ""3"" was painted on a white square on the east corner. i felt my breathing gradually creeping toward hyperventilation as i approached the door. i tried holding my breath as i followed two unisex raincoats through the door.   the classroom was small. the people in front of me stopped just inside the door to hang up their coats on a long row of hooks. i copied them. they were two girls, one a porcelain-colored blonde, the other also pale, with light brown hair. at least my skin wouldn't be a standout here.   i took the slip up to the teacher, a tall, balding man whose desk had a nameplate identifying him as mr. mason. he gawked at me when he saw my name -- not an encouraging response -- and of course i flushed tomato red. but at least he sent me to an empty desk at the back without introducing me to the class. it was harder for my new classmates to stare at me in the back, but somehow, they managed. i kept my eyes down on the reading list the teacher had given me. it was fairly basic: bront‘, shakespeare, chaucer, faulkner. i'd already read everything. that was comforting . . . and boring. i wondered if my mom would send me my folder of old essays, or if she would think that was cheating. i went through different arguments with her in my head while the teacher droned on.   when the bell rang, a nasal buzzing sound, a gangly boy with skin problems and hair black as an oil slick leaned across the aisle to talk to me.   ""you're isabella swan, aren't you?"" he looked like the overly helpful, chess club type.",0,

135151,"you're welcome!  i've been told that the actual title of the tune is ""1865"".     it's one of the few covers that the band i'm currently in plays.     history as follows:  **1865 (96 degrees in the shade) by third world**  the third world song ""96 degrees in the shade"" is a retelling the events of the october 1865 morant bay rebellion led by george william gordon and paul bogle.  slavery ended in jamaica on august 1, 1834 with the passing of the british emancipation act, which led to emancipation on 1 august 1838 - the date on which former slaves became free to choose their employment and employer. on paper, former slaves gained the right to vote; however, most blacks remained desperately poor, and a high voting fee effectively excluded them from the franchise. during the elections of 1864, the ratio of black jamaicans to white was 32 to one, but out of a population of over 436,000, fewer than 2,000 were eligible to vote, nearly all of them white.  george william gordon a wealthy mulatto member of the jamaican national assembly, was the son of a black slave woman and a wealthy british plantation owner. gordon's father, like many other british colonial elites lived most of the time in england sired second surrogate families with native jamaican women, unknown to their families back in britain. george william gordon was his father's common law heir under jamaican law.  george william gordon was considered a troublemaker by edward eyre, the newly appointed colonial governor of jamaica because gordon's high profile activities on behalf of disenfranchised newly freed slaves. gordon had assisted a group of former slaves draw up and circulate a petition to queen victoria asking her to bequeath a small amount crown owned land in the bush of st. ann's parish for the local landless farmer to cultivate as they could not find land for themselves. at least, the queen's worthless land would produce some tax income for the crown and provide a means of living to many wretchedly poor jamaican citizens who had no other means of survival.  for the newly installed british colonial governor eyre, it was unthinkable that a group of uppity ""maroon negroes"" would have the comeuppance ask queen victoria's permission to cultivate a few hundred acres of the vacant undeveloped land in a remote colonial town 4000 miles from buckingham palace. eyre immediately regarded the charismatic mulatto legislator as a political enemy with a subversive agenda.  on october 7, 1865 a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for trespassing on a long-abandoned plantation, creating anger among black jamaicans. the black man was nothing more than a squatter using part of the property of an abandonned plantation to plant a subsistence crop for his family's needs. when one member of a group of black protesters from the village of stony gut was arrested, the protesters became unruly and broke the accused man from prison.  governor eyres and the local constabulary suspected that george william gordon and one of his protégé, paul bogel a deacon at a local black baptist church, were the key organizers of the protest and the subsequent prison break. paul bogle soon learned that he and 27 of associates had warrants issued for their arrest for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police.  the historical record doesn't confirm whether either gordon or bogle were involved in any of the events up to that point but it's likely that gordon wasn't involved and bogel probably was. it's an undisputable fact that bogel was firmly in command of a large contingency of protesters who marched on the morant bay courthouse, four days later.  when the group arrived at the morant bay court house, they were met by a small volunteer militia (ie.. vigilantes) who panicked and opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating. the black protesters then rioted, killing 18 people (including white officials and militia) and taking control of the town. in the days that followed some 2,000 black rebels roamed the countryside, killing two white planters and forcing others to flee for their lives.  governor john eyre sent government troops to hunt down the poorly-armed rebels and bring paul bogle back to morant bay for trial. the troops were met with no organized resistance but killed blacks indiscriminately, many of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, ""we slaughtered all before us… man or woman or child"".  in the end, 439 black jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including paul bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences. bogle was lynched and hung without a trial, moments after the british troops took him into custody.  gordon, who had little - if anything - to do with the rebellion was also arrested. though he was arrested in kingston, he was transferred by eyre to morant bay, where he could be tried under martial law.  ever the politician, governer eyre saw a public hanging of gordon as a high profile opportunity to assert his authority as the newly appointed governor of jamaica. a kangaroo court convicted george william gordon of sedition and treason in two days, but gordon wasn't informed of his sentence until an hour before his hanging.  gordon was paraded through the streets of morant bay and led to the his hanging by a contingency of 10 thousand soldiers. and presiding over the surreal and carnivalesque events was none other than the portly governor edward eyre dressed like a british dandy attending a night at the opera.  people from all over the island attended the grotesque spectacle and the narrator of the story in the song, ""96 degrees in the shade"" is none other than the condemned man, george william gordon. the lyrics to the song are very close to the same final words of gordon as he stood before the governor. gordon even began his remarks with a polite remark about the stifling humidity of the october day.    lyrics to 96 degrees in the shade  quote: *96 degree in the shade,     real hot in the shade (repeat)*  *said it was 96 degrees in the shade     ten thousand soldiers on parade     taking i and i to meet a big fat boy     sent from overseas          the queen employ     excellency before you i come     with my representation     you know where i’m coming from*  *you caught me on the loose     fighting to be free     now you show me a noose     on the cotton tree     entertainment for you     martyrdom for me*  *96 degrees in the shade     real hot in the shade*      *some may suffer and some may burn     but i know that one day my people will learn     as sure as the sun shines, way up in the sky     today i stand here a victim the truth is i'll never die*      *as sure as the sun shine      way up in the sky,     today i stand here a victim -     the truth is i'll never die...*  george william gordon issued final prophecy, faithfully spoken in lyrics of ""96 degrees in the shade"". bogel's final defiant words to governor eyre were: ""today i stand here a victim but the truth is i'll never die ."" and bogel's final words came to pass. his courage made him immortal in jamaican history.  shortly after the hanging of gordon, jamaican governor edward eyre was recalled back to england and following an investigation was fired by the queen's colonial office. today a statue of george william gordon in memory of his contributions and martyrdom stands in front of the very morant bay court house where he was placed on trial in 1850.",1,

935043,"spoilers (duh). this whole post is spoilers.   in a nutshell, shepard ends up standing trial on earth for being a very naughty boy in one of the dlc packs for me2. coincidentally, just as he's yapping it up with the powers-that-be, the reapers decide to attack the planet. shepard escapes to the normandy and proceeds to fly around gathering various resources needed to construct an ancient prothean weapon (the crucible) to use against the reapers, as well as uniting as many of the races as possible in the galaxy to fight together. along the way, shepard has the option of curing the krogan genophage as well as allying with the geth. throughout the main part of the story, it becomes clear that the protheans never finished the crucible because they were missing a piece called the catalyst.  to kick off the endgame, shepard finds an important piece of the crucible in an ancient prothean vi on thessia. the vi claims to know where the catalyst is, but before it reveals this information, kai leng, a cerberus assassin, shows up and kicks shepard's ass, steals the vi, and flies away. he does, however, lead shepard to the illusive man's hideout, where shepard returns the ass kicking in the illusive man's secret room from me2, then learns from the prothean vi that the catalyst is, in fact, the citadel--where the illusive man has, of course, run off to.  shepard is planning to head to the citadel to confront the illusive man, but the illusive man somehow warned the reapers that shepard was coming, so they closed it up and transported it to earth orbit where it shines a bright light down into the streets of london. this light supposedly sucks up all the dead and living bodies to the citadel so they can be turned into husks or other reapers. naturally, shepard then fights his way through the streets of london and to the white light. before he can get there, though, a reaper dreadnought blows him up. he wakes up all mortally wounded and walks very slowly and hunched over, with only a pistol, and proceeds to the white light.  on the citadel, he finds he can communicate with admiral anderson, who apparently made it to the citadel a few minutes earlier. it is made clear that anderson is just ahead of shepard. through the radio, anderson says he found some kind of console, then the communication cuts out. shepard encounters anderson at the console and they begin to chat, when the illusive man appears and proceeds to take control of shepard, apparently using reaper technology.   there are a few different ways things can play out; the illusive man can make you shoot anderson, for example, but ultimately you defeat the illusive man one way or another and proceed to the final stage where you meet the catalyst in the form of a small child who tells you that he created the reapers to kill every advanced civilization in the galaxy every 50,000 years so that ais never got advanced enough to rebel and make war on their creators (ala the geth). you are given three choices to defeat the reapers: use the crucible to kill all the reapers, but also destroy all the mass relays and all advanced tech in the galaxy; use the crucible to somehow magically merge all organic life with ais into some weird hybrid, also destroying all the mass relays but apparently preserving technology; use the crucible to take control of the reapers, also destroying all the mass relays, but apparently preserving technology.  unless you make a few specific key decisions, anderson and shepard both die.",0,

590563,"hi, i really appreciated your post, you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field(obviously, if you've got a phd, you've put a lot of work into it, so i just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and, while i haven't personally contracted your services, i am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough). i have a few questions, i do have a few mental health issues, but they aren't rare at all, and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals(multiple psychiatrists, all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period, a psychologist, a social worker with a doctorate in social work, and some regular social workers, as well as a pediatric neurologist when i was 17(i'm 19 now, going to be 20 on jan 21st, and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community). basically, i've just got run of the mill depression, panic disorder, as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition i have called ehlers-danlos syndrome, which causes me extreme chronic pain, i have seen palliative care physicians, neurologists, physiatrists(not the same as a psychiatrist), and pain management physicians(anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine), neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and of course a few internists, all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis. the level of pain i experience is what causes my depression for the most part(though, i have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode, i am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like).   basically, the pain i have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things, things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain, like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games, walking up stairs, going to the store, but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance. it isn't that i lack intelligence or motivation(though at times my motivation is low), but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent. for example, my last year of high school(i graduated in 2010) i missed at least two days every week, i still graduated in the top 25% of my class, and graduated with honors, but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas i wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to(ehlers-danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations, tendon/ligament injuries, etc), the most serious pain i have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain(i have a syrinx in my spinal cord, you'd understand what it is if you look it up, if you don't already, it is usually caused by a chiari malformation, which i don't really have).  the thing i've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges i face in everyday life. but, i have big dreams, i'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist, those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me, and i love studying them. but, due in part to my depression, and pain, i often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities. you see, when i was in 1st grade, i was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability(the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around 5-6 hours, i had to redo this testing every couple of years, all of the testing took 5-6 hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if i had any learning disabilities there). during school, i was in a special ed class to help with my math(but in a regular math class, the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it, and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that i could succeed, i'm sure you understand the special education system). however, i've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself, nor have i learned much about it, i don't even know the name of the disorder. i'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability, i mean, i know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities, but i'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all, if i could do some testing to just learn maybe why i have the disability(as in, what is my disability, i can understand medical and psychological information with ease, i've considered going into medicine even). the reason i want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because i realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology, psychology, or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus, as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required, including calculus. therefore, i often feel defeated before i've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician, medical doctor, or academic, and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression.    tl;dr- is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps i could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses.  note: i realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions, but i've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally, and i'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever. i am not asking for medical or psychological advice, as i know that since you cannot evaluate me personally, it'd be a legal liability on your part.   if you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message, or have more specific questions to ask me, please feel free

284729,"interpreting words and actions in their societal contexts is important though, because these things don't happen context free. it's not enough to simply say racism is bad -- that's nearly a tautology. we also have to ask why and how something wrong, and what factors are driving the persistence and existence of this social and moral ill.  that's why institutional racism and racism, despite their uncanny linguistic resemblance, are separate evils. oppressed groups are perfectly capable of the latter, but, by definition, incapable of the former; it's a quantitative difference. it's also a qualitative difference, in that their prejudices are originate from a background of social disadvantage and are directed towards those who benefit from institutional racism.  i'm not trying to excuse or rationalize whatever it was this anonymous person said in this completely unknown documentary. i'm just pointing out that even he outright said ""kill whitey"" that may be equally wrong from a detached philosophical standpoint but it doesn't change the fact of centuries of legal, quasi-legal, and socially acceptable violence perpetrated not against the dominant group in america, but by them. it's why that phrase is much less chilling than the ""14 words"" of white supremacists. whatever you remember this person saying, they are powerless to enact it on all by the most petty of scales; it's racism, but it's not institutional racism and that makes a difference.",1,

890386,"respectfully, i feel you have set yourself quite a challenge.  to capture an authentic london in literary form without having even visited is ambitious - your stereotypes are not a good start ;)  it took me several years to _start_ feeling like a londoner and not a newcomer with a newcomer's floudering, bewildered (non-)understanding.  you mention one character is a londoner - born and bred?  they seem a rare breed, i can probably count those i have met in 7-8 years here on one hand!  some more socio-economic background on this person would be useful because their london may be very similar to mine or very different.  &gt; london is not a city. it is more like a country, and living in it is like living in holland or belgium. its completeness makes it deceptive - there are sidewalks from one frontier to the other - and its hugeness makes it possible for everyone to invent his own city. my london is not your london, though everyone's washington, dc is pretty much the same.  -- the london embassy - paul theroux  not sure if i believe that about dc, but anyway.  anyway.  at this point i should probably state my perspective: white british (english) but non-london born male, middle class, graduate, moved here in early 20s because jobs, and because pretty much all my friends had.   my older friends are mostly the same demographic as me, with newer london friends and professional circles adding (much) more diversity of origin.  we have white-collar jobs in it, marketing, finance, teaching, etc.  a typical professional day or social gathering will include all manner of races and nationalities and this will be unremarkable (and literally unremarked upon).  we live mostly in zone 2, a few in cheaper edges of zone 1 or well-connected spots further out.  we rent, in friend or friend-of-a-friend groups of 2-5 people, until we start pairing up and marrying off and acquiring our own places, possibly even buying.  our urban landscape is [mostly unspectactular](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=51.548165,-0.141233&amp;spn=0.018734,0.038581&amp;sll=51.479539,-0.187325&amp;sspn=0.009328,0.01929&amp;t=m&amp;z=15&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=51.548165,-0.141233&amp;panoid=jbo-ahziqcjybimpabbeiq&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,0), even grubby, generic, mediocre.  the majority of london is not splendid georgian/victorian/medieval/historic/planned architecture.  streets of generic surburan semi-detached houses behind high streets of chain stores, estate agents, kebab shops, chicken shops and pound shops, post-war office and council blocks with emphasis on the ""block"", brutalist mid-rise towers from the 60s and blandly shiny new 'renegeration' apartments, not enough litter bins, rumbling buses everywhere stopping at cramped bus stops on narrow pavements, grey skies, railway bridges, advertising hoardings, roadworks and engineering works, interspersed with random carribean supermarkets or polish shops, that nice pub you went to once, a small local park, green or common, a pretty parish church or town hall...  depending on where we work we may go weeks, months or years without seeing a famous sight like buckingham palace or a famous street like leicester square or baker street.  on the other hand, our daily routine may take us past several such places.  for myself, i don't work in the city or west end, i don't drink/socialise there, i shop there rarely when i can't find things more locally.   accordingly, i rarely even encounter tourists.  when we do pass or visit grander, internationally famous sights or buildings around town, we pretend to be blasé, but (speaking for myself at least), still get a little thrill.  we don't own a car, or if we're in the distinct minority who do, we probably don't use it for the majority of our travels.  so public transport is in our blood, if that's not too melodramatic a phrase.  we know the quickest, quietest, fewest-changes, easiest-changes routes for our common journeys, with a range of backups for resilience.  we use this for easy fodder for small talk and as a major influencer on where we live.  as others have mentioned, we walk fast and purposefully, and are accustomed to crowds and crushes - not beyond being annoyed by them, but resignedly habituated, get on and deal with it.  we may seem rude or distant to outsiders, but in a way this is more a form of respect and social grease towards the other people we are crushed up against daily.  where someone needs help or in more social circumstances we are hopefully, for the most part, friendly and generous.  we may have a gym membership, go jogging, cycling or swimming, or play squash, five-a-side football etc.  we may be lazy and do fuck all.  we have a wide range of interests from taking vast cocktails of drugs in underground raves to visiting niche historical museums and churches to photography, stand-up comedy, global cuisine, fashion... whatever it is we are well-served.  regardless, we probably drink, at least to some extent, at pubs and bars with workmates and/or near home with friends.  when we go out, we don't go home and get ready, we leave work and start drinking.  as to your particular stereotypes:  - thick fog is quite rare in my experience.  however, hazy light smogs on warmer days are common, as is a touch of mistiness on cold wet nights.    - tea is common, but coffee at least equally consumer, and certainly has a higher cultural 'profile'.  tea is just a background norm, coffee has afficionados.  crumpets are rare.  - very few people hate americans.  very many people take issue with american government and institutions re: the war on terror, global financial crisis, etc, but as we are mostly uk/g8/nato/eu people, in most cases this criticism extends squarely to our own government and institutions and is not extended to the populace.  many people regard the religious right as beyond idiotic, but would hold no particular grudge against any american they met who fell anywhere within their range of 'normality', if that makes sense.  really, different nationalities' and personalities' relationships to american could be complex and wide ranged.  i've run out of things to say.  feel free to ask me more things, i like rambling.",0,

883601,"well todays range trip taught me more.   a) 90gr frangible reloads will not cycle. one round...failed to cycle aftet.   b) some of the ammo available now sucks and either has hard primers or deep set primers. a few range trips ago i shot a box of geco. i had one light strike, fired the second time around.  today i fired federals and it was fine but tried a few 124gr match loads from rws. out of 13 rds i counted 4 misfires. all four appeared like light primer strikes. all four fired on the second try. my dads instructor was at the store and looked at it...fired three more plus one of his winchester jhps with no issues. ammo is from the eu and who knows how old.   his conclusion was most likely just bad ammo. since it was out of the blue and only this ammo despite being right after the one reload round. but he pointed out its such a small.gun.that even minor deviations from good form can cause chambering issues, etc. so i am going to watch myself more closely next time(hopefully next week or so) and try pmc and more hornady to male sure it's not a gun problem(he seemed to think.its not). but he also confirmed sig is pretty good about fixing.issues and that if it is the gun it wont be getting sent back twice.  tl;dr - ammo shortage is giving us shit ammo...hopefully no issues so far :)",0,

194451,"celia sits bolt-upright in her little blue bed. the bell-bird clock ticks on in the dark hallway, just past her bedroom door. *tick, tick, tick, tick*. it’s the chime that’s woken her, again, the chime that no one else in the house seems able to hear. at midnight, the bell-bird which sits atop her grandparents’ old pendulum clock stretches its copper wings and croons a hollow song. and if the past many nights are anything to judge by, this is about when the whispering will begin.  celia clenches two small fistfulls of blanket. *be brave*, she tells herself. *it’s not real*. but just as she’s said it, a rhythmic murmuring begins, a soft chant that seems to echo up into her room from some hidden chamber deep below. and the hushed voices recite:  *out with the light!* *out with the light!* *mommy has kissed you and slipped out of sight!* *furious, curious, turbulent fright,* *the monsters have come out to play this night!*  over and over the chorus repeats, louder and louder as celia scrunches up tight in the corner, drawing up pillows and sheets until only her eyes and a ribbon of hair are visible. and out of the shadow that twists across her wooden floor, between the cracks of darkness comes something darker than black. a figure, a form, stooped and rotten, rises up out of a widening maw. the chanting is mad now, the voices delirious, the unseeable minions of this dark lord circling the room like frenzied ravens. celia’s bed feels like a tilt-a-whirl in some deranged circus.  then all at once the room quiets, with the flick of a wrist. a wrist, that’s all; it appears at first, congealing from the swirling black, then spinning itself like a braid, the dark smoke becomes canvas, then flesh, twisting itself into the shape of a man. his fingers are long, his joints bony. jet black curls drape lavishly from his high, pale forehead onto a heavy pinstripe vest and a tie, all of which look too big and too elegant on him. but the feature that celia can never forget is his eyes, curse-red and glowing faintly as they flit here and there through her dark room.   he bends silently and takes a seat at the foot of her bed. he tilts his head as he speaks: “celia josephine white, tell me a joke.” his voice is not deep and sinister, or raspy like a snake. it is slow, calculated, cool and serene. it puts celia in mind of a librarian.  “you’re not real!” she sputters at once, sinking farther behind her blankets. delicate golden chains jingle on the man’s wrist as he places a hand to his heart, taken aback.  “not real?” he says. “you wound me. after all we’ve been through!”  celia buries her head under a quilt and yells at the man: “you’re not real! you’re not real! go away!! i don’t want you here!”  and then suddenly the quilt is burning with a lurid glow, a light that could only come from those terrible eyes.  “**silence**,” he roars in the voice of a dozen men. “**i am as real as you are!**” but celia only screams. she does not want to play his game tonight. she does not want to tell him a joke. the first night he appeared to her, he had introduced himself as lucius the sixth, demon lord of bell’s fork, and made a deal with her that he would not eat her soul if she could make him laugh. she had kicked and yelled and tried to run, but when it became clear that there was no way out but his, she forced herself to recite the only joke she could think of:  “what’s a dentist’s favorite instrument?” she had stammered. lucius had put his thin hand to his chin and pondered this question, for a moment standing up to glide in slow circles around the room. at last he gave up and requested the answer. celia took a breath, and through clenched teeth--to stop them from chattering--she replied, “a tuba toothpaste.”  it was as if lucius had been suddenly doused with a bucket of ice water. he gasped and leapt back, hands on his head, then slowly began to smile. and the smile became a chuckle, then the chuckle a full-on laugh. in a matter of seconds, he was cackling like a clown, and the room began to spin with strange lights and colors and voices. and then, before celia knew it, she’d woken up and it was morning. she tore down the hallway and leapt into her grandparents’ sunny bed. it had all been a dream!  or had it? over time the question drove her mad, because each night lucius came back and demanded another joke. each night, the deal was the same: “make me laugh and i won’t eat your soul.” and so celia told him the one about toads and fishes, and then the one about the cow with no legs, and so on and so on until nights became weeks. and now there were only three more days until she could leave bell’s fork and go back home. three more days until she was free!  but celia hadn’t slept well in a very long time, and that made her angry and a little delirious. the combination of these two feelings made her dumbly bold, and so she had decided that this night, she was going to tell lucius what she really thought-- that he wasn’t real and she didn’t need to tell him anything.  “**go! away!**” she screams as loud as she can into the encircling red light, clenching her fists and her eyelids and everything else into one deafening command.   and then it is gone.  slowly celia emerges from the covers and looks around. everything is back to normal, as if the demon lord of bell’s fork had never been there at all. there are lego boxes on the floor, and moonlight streaming through the old wavy glass of her second-story window, and the bell-bird clock in the hall going *tick, tick, tick, tick*.  celia exhales deeply and kicks the covers back down over her toes. she has won. lucius isn’t real. she sets her head on the pillow and closes her eyes. she listens to her heart slow down beat by beat. she feels happy.  and that’s when something large and metal falls with a crash in her closet.   celia sits up again and stares wide-eyed. an ominous glow issues from every crack and keyhole in the door. something growls, deep and breathy and almost metallic, like some kind of mechanical tiger. but celia doesn’t have time to speculate, or run. her closet door explodes as a flaming metal golem stamps out and smashes its way across the room toward her. wood splinters and catches fire, and celia screams. just noise at first, then as the golem grabs her roughly in its giant, burning hand, she calls out for anyone she can think of-- mom, dad, granny, papa joe. all to no avail. but just then, as the monster leans in and opens its fiery mouth to swallow her up, a name which she does not expect forms itself on her lips:  “**lucius!!!**”  there is a crackling of light and flame, and celia feels herself falling backward. standing above her, tall and gaunt in a pinstripe vest, is the demon lord himself. the fire golem stumbles back, apparently struck, then regains its footing and bellows in rage. the darkness around lucius’ spindly hand twists itself impossibly into an ornate, silver blade, and a chorus of voices begin to cheer him on in some dark tongue.  lucius flips the blade around and glances over his shoulder at the little girl. he winks. and in that moment, celia isn’t afraid of the dark anymore.",0,

674802,"it's a bit more complicated than that. tolkien, as he is want to do, changes or adapts his histories in later works that better fulfils what he wants something to be. a good example of this is the balrogs:  &gt;in the published version of the lord of the rings, however, balrogs became altogether more sinister and more powerful. christopher tolkien notes the difference, saying that in earlier versions they were ""less terrible and certainly more destructible"". he quotes a very late margin note[17] that was not incorporated into the text saying ""at most seven"" ever existed;[18] though in the annals of aman, written as late as 1958, after the publication of the lord of the rings, melkor still commands ""a host of balrogs"".[19] in later writings they ceased to be creatures, but are instead maiar, lesser ainur like gandalf or sauron, spirits of fire whom melkor had corrupted before the creation of the world.  from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balrog) under ""characteristics"".  as for the awakened elves:  &gt;originally, in the 1910s and 1920s, ingwë, finwë and elwë (their final names) were the eldest of the elves. by 1959 or 1960, tolkien wrote a detailed account of the awakening of the elves, called cuivienyarna, part of quendi and eldar. ingwë, finwë and elwë now became the first ambassadors and the kings of the elves. this text only saw print in the war of the jewels, part of the analytical the history of middle-earth series, in 1994, but a similar version was included in the silmarillion in 1977. according to the earliest account, the first elves are awakened by eru ilúvatar near the bay of cuiviénen during the years of the trees in the first age. they awake under the starlit sky, as the sun and moon have yet to be created. the first elves to awake are three pairs: imin (""first"") and his wife iminyë, tata (""second"") and tatië, and enel (""third"") and enelyë.  from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/awakening_of_the_elves#history) under ""history:origins"".  of course, however, something rather curious is written of ingwë:  &gt;ingwë is the leader of the first kindred of elves called the vanyar. his name means ""first one, chief"" in quenya. he is one of the three elves, with elwë and finwë of the first embassy to aman and he persuades all of the clan of vanyar to follow him there where he becomes their king and high-king of all eldalië. he was reckoned as high king of all the eldar and because of this is called ingwë ingweron ""chief of the chieftains"". he lives in taniquetil, ruling from beneath manwë high king of arda. he has a son named ingwion as well as unnamed children.[10] **he is stated in ""the lhammas"" to be the first awakened elf: ""ingwë, high-king of the eldalië, and the oldest of all elves, for he first awoke.""**[11] according to the book of lost tales, his name is inwë in elfin.  from [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ingw%c3%ab#ingw.c3.ab)  so is ingwë imin? apparently not, they seem to be distinct characters as is explained by galin [here](http://www.thetolkienforum.com/archive/index.php/t-19967.html):  &gt;i think it might depend upon how much one is willing to take from a child's tale mingled with counting lore. if for example, it is true that each elf awoke with his or her spouse -- also noting that they should then have no brothers or sisters in the regular sense at least -- then this much arguably rules out imin, tata, enel being ingwe, finwe, elwe (elwe married melian for instance). also, in quendi and eldar (pg 380) one paragraph speaks of these elf-fathers by name, while the next paragraph refers to the chieftains elwe and olwe, seemingly as if they are distinct. in my opinion, i don't think tolkien wanted to certainly equate the unbegotten elves in the child's tale with the more 'historical' figures from quenta silmarillion. back in the 1930s it was specifically noted that ingwe first awoke (see the account of tongues published in the lost road and other writings), but after the lord of the rings jrrt chose to put the awakening into a specific and notable (to my mind) context: a tale for elf-children. though also notably perhaps: a tale yet said to be preserved in almost identical form among both the elves of aman and the sindar.",0,

they never found him.”  “maybe he didn’t want the publicity,” gigi crumpled her printout into a little ball, “maybe he was some kind of a sex offender and couldn’t let anyone know he was near a school.”  julio scowled and tossed his paper away, “i think i’d prefer an angel.”  no one but kurt had looked at the printout for very long. i had expected derision or accusations of being full of shit, but it wasn’t like that. they just wanted to put it out of sight and mind. these kids were spooked, there was no doubt about that. i asked, “how did he rescue you exactly?”  bob shrugged, “he carried us out.”  “nine kids at the same time? or did he take trips?”  “how should we know?” clayton said, “we were like six years old!”   “he wrapped us up in his arms,” kurt explained, “and walked through the smoke until we were safe.”  that was the last straw. everyone started arguing and yelling, there were insults and threats of violence. at first i was worried the noise might make my landlady mrs. vincenzo suspicious of what i was up to, but on the other hand isn’t this how most games of *monopoly* turn out?  then their phones went off, all eight of them and at exactly the same time. the sudden clash of tones, chirps and songs made everyone jump.  “it's from suzie...” tameka breathed.  “me too.” clayton said, “did she send you a picture?”  julio dropped his phone, “oh fuck. oh fuck!”  “what is it?” i walked around so i could peer over leroy's shoulder.   it was a black and white picture, the image was grainy, washed out and at a slight angle. the first thing that came to my mind when i saw it was that it looked like a shot from an art house film. my second thought was “is that-”  “it’s the school,” leroy nodded, “it’s our school the day of the fire...”  +  *...after we spent about an hour fruitlessly trying to text and call suzie we decided to pack it in. there were no more snide comments and eye rolls, they were all scared now.*  *all of them except for kurt, he seemed delighted at this turn of events.*  *we all swapped phone numbers and emails. that done i made sure each of them forwarded me a copy of that image. then i made them promise to call me if anything even slightly strange happened.*  *leroy stayed behind for a little longer, he and i had other things to discuss. it was time to take my investigations to the next level and since i couldn’t go anywhere i was going to have to outsource my breaking and entering. leroy agreed to my plan more quickly than i would have liked but i still sent him away with a digital video camera and some words of advice.*  *once i was alone i got to work on the picture. here is what i know so far;*  *fact: the photo really was of colonie village elementary from the day of the fire. thick clouds of smoke are roiling out of every window but you can’t see any flames.*   *now, i’ve escaped and started a few conflagrations in my time and let me tell you that smoke looks like something you’d get from a chemical explosion or a 1980’s heavy metal concert gone bad.*  *you know, they say the smoke gets you before you burn up, they also say that its a kind of mercy.*  *fact: i went through every newspaper report i could and found no pictures matching the one that was sent. all those official photos were of the front entrance and the parking lot. the picture that was sent to the colonie village nine had been taken somewhere near the rear of the building. the photographer must have been right at the edge of the playground.*  *fact: speaking of the photographer, the angles of the picture don’t quite make sense. our shutterbug in question had either been sitting up in a tree or been freakishly tall.*  *fact: suzie’s smartphone has been in the police evidence room since the night of her disappearance some six weeks ago.*   **to be continued**",0,
184780,"did you know the victory gin ration has been doubled from 30g to ... 15g?   http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks01/0100021.txt   &gt; bad news coming, thought winston. and sure enough, following on a gory description of the annihilation of a eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.  ...   &gt; times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify  ...  &gt; as for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. as short a time ago as february, the ministry of plenty had issued a promise (a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. actually, as winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week. all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april.  ...  &gt; the phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. it had been a favourite of late with the ministry of plenty. parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. he could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. he had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco. with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. and only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? yes, they swallowed it. parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. the eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. syme, too--in some more complex way, involving doublethink, syme swallowed it. was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory?  ...  &gt; 'it's this bloody thing that does it,' she said, ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior anti-sex league and flinging it on to a bough. then, as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. she broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston. even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. it was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire. but at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. the first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was powerful and troubling. &gt; &gt; 'where did you get this stuff?' he said. &gt; &gt; 'black market,' she said indifferently. 'actually i am that sort of girl, to look at. i'm good at games. i was a troop-leader in the spies. i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior anti-sex league. hours and hours i've spent pasting their bloody rot all over london. i always carry one end of a banner in the processions. i always look cheerful and i never shirk anything. always yell with the crowd, that's what i say. it's the only way to be safe.' &gt; &gt; the first fragment of chocolate had melted on winston's tongue. the taste was delightful. but there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. he pushed it away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not.  ...  &gt; when his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. she seemed to have become completely spiritless. it was evident even to winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen. she did everything that was needed--cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece--always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. for hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian by thinness. very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. he was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen. &gt; &gt; he remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close-smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. there was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. he remembered his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. he would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share. his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. she took it for granted that he, 'the boy', should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. at every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. he would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate. he knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf. &gt; &gt; one day a chocolate ration was issued. there had been no such issue for weeks or months past. he remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. it was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) between the three of them. it was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. his mother told him not to be greedy. there was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. his tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. in the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. the little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. winston stood watching her for a moment. then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door. &gt; &gt; 'winston, winston!' his mother called after him. 'come back! give your sister back her chocolate!' &gt; &gt; he stopped, but did not come back. his mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face. even now he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening. his sister, conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. his mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. he turned and fled down the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand. &gt; &gt; he never saw his mother again. after he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove him home. when he came back his mother had disappeared. this was already becoming normal at that time. nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. they had not taken any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. to this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. it was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. as for his sister, she might have been removed, like winston himself, to one of the colonies for homeless children (reclamation centres, they were called) which had grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other to die. &gt; &gt; the dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. his mind went back to another dream of two months ago. exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water. &gt; &gt; he told julia the story of his mother's disappearance. without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position. &gt; &gt; 'i expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,' she said indistinctly. 'all children are swine.' &gt; &gt; 'yes. but the real point of the story----' &gt; &gt; from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. he would have liked to continue talking about his mother. he did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. her feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. it would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. if you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. when the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. it was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it. the refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper. the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. when once you were in the grip of the party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference. whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. you were lifted clean out of the stream of history. and yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. they were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. what mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. the proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. for the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. the proles had stayed human. they had not become hardened inside. they had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re-learn by conscious effort. and in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage-stalk. &gt; &gt; 'the proles are human beings,' he said aloud. 'we are not human.' &gt; &gt; 'why not?' said julia, who had woken up again.  why it's not funny to joke about north korea, explained by orwell.",0,

883056,"not just that i know what happens, but that the whole film hanged on creating tension on whether they escape or not. the whole film was building up to that, that was the big ending and purpose of the film. believe me, i enjoyed it very much until the plan was put in place. instead of seeing an intelligent spy thriller, i saw a hollywood cliche machine of cheap tension tricks that never convinced me.  &gt; they never tried to trick the audience into thinking that the mission would fail.  no, they just assumed the audience wouldn't be sure if they escaped or not. i was pretty damn sure they would escape.   &gt; but, despite us knowing the ""ending"", we can still make a great film out of it.  i know. that wasn't my main issue. i actually wrote a post over on imdb were i actually compared argo to zero dark thirty. now that was a great film that had events that people knew so much better than argo and it was handled so much better. read [here](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/board/nest/209573630?d=209573630#209573630) if you're interested.  &gt; argo is less of a ""will they get out?"" film, and more of a ""how will they get out?"" film.  but that's just it. we know how they will get out. they will walk out of an airport onto a plane. and when people have to escape through an airport you know exactly the hurdles they will meet along the way. they were signposted! we knew where they were going to have trouble because we were told!  the white ticket thing was mentioned clearly that they would have to bluff their way through. and they did.   we are told the phone call would be made back to the studio. and it was. that was the worst one, because the tension there was created by a phony incident where the two guys in hollywood decide to abandon the phone instead of doing what they were meant to, and then couldnt cross the studio lot. that is so cheesy.  &gt; if anything, the fact that they could add so much tension into a situation that everyone knows will have a happy ending is pretty remarkable.  to me, and of course this is just my opinion, they created lot's of fake tension moments (the true story is very dull) and they weren't good enough. if you are going to fake it, then i had hoped they would do it better than that. that's partly why i compared it to zdt, because that film had just as much story to go on, with even more familiar events and didn't add lots of false story lines to make up for it. it knew its restrictions and played to them.",0,
276219,"&gt;uggg definitely not. we have to examine the reason why the inequalities exist. does it exist because you're a girl and girls are presumed inferior? that's sexist and should be eliminated. does it exist because you're a man and presumed less fit for the job? that's sexist and should be eliminated. does it exist because you chose to take time off work to have a kid, then that's your choice. it's not like you're being punished for having a kid -- it's a tradeoff that you decided to make. you get to have a freaking kid!  i agree with everything you just said, but as a woman who doesn’t want to have children, the expectation that i may take time off and may be less vested in my work and may reduce my hours because other women have before is a damaging stereotype. say in six years there will be a promotion up for grabs between me and my male colleague (same age), who do you think will get it all things being equal? that’s the age a lot of women get married and start having kids and *i* have to suffer because of *their* choices? bs. judge me as an individual. i had a guy from mensrights (but not on the thread, i think it was on /r/nottheonion) who told me i was a gold digger because i wanted to be a doctor and apparently women who become doctors are slightly more likely to reduce hours/leave the job force and therefore i only want to become one so i can find a rich doctor to marry and provide for me. he said this with no source, very aggressively, not knowing a single thing about me, reduced me to a (unfounded) statistic. better hope someone like him or the people [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pvu11/not_hiring_young_women_makes_sense_from_a/) aren't in charge of my pay…  &gt;yeah absolutely. men list sex as something more important to them than women do. if men are more easily able to get sex (because women are more promiscuous), they're less likely to marry (because marriage was the only or easiest or best place where perhaps they thought they could get sex).  fair. i disagree though. for example, extramarital affairs weren't looked down in men and were decently common and wives had very little power to do anything about it. i also don't think women have become more promiscuous. i originally said *less-binding sexual contracts*. the vast majority of the women i know aren't promiscuous, but they aren't waiting to be married to have sex either. the two aren't necessarily related. do you also think that part of that is cultural? i mean, sex is a pretty big deal for women too, but we aren't supposed to be the ones prioritizing it.  you may be interested in [this](http://www.alternet.org/when-women-wanted-sex-much-more-men/?_nospa=true) article about female sexuality.  [this](http://www.thenationalstudent.com/news/2012-09-06/students_dont_respect_promiscuous_friends.html) article too. i mentioned before the askwomen thread about some guy asking if women were more or less attracted to a guy who had many partners, and many said less. slightly related note: i know /r/theredpill talks about how it's evolution for guys to want as many partners as possible and women to want to settle down, but isn't it interesting to note that evolutionarily speaking, *both* genders shouldn't want a promiscuous partner? for men, they have to worry about paternal uncertainty. however (and theredpill always neglects this), women have to worry about splitting up possible resources with other women the man may have had a child with. would i rather have a boyfriend who has six children already or would i rather have a boyfriend who has no children and will only provide for any children *i* may have?   &gt;i don't know. maybe?  what would you classify me as then? a 'maybe' feminist? i headed over to /r/femraddebates after writing this i found [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/femradebates/comments/1p48ew/feminist_vs_womens_rights_activist/ccypu62). am i a woman's right activist to you then? perhaps instead of comparing mra to feminism, we should be comparing mra and wra (is that acronym used?) and feminism to masculism?  &gt;answer me this: if i reject the notion that government is a/immoral or ineffective, can i still be an anarchist?  yes.  &gt;men do benefit from higher wages for working more. women do benefit by being provided for.  it’s not that simple though. maybe that would be true if we didn’t have emotions, but you know what i felt like in the beginning of my relationships when the guy insisted on providing for me? guilt. **indebted (!!!)**. insecure. i realize those are my own feelings and that's my own issue to deal with and it's not necessarily indicative of how many women feel, but i wouldn't go so far as to say i benefitted from it (on a surface level, sure, but not overall).   &gt;can you show where this was argued? i've heard that men do better in business because they're naturally more risk-taking and aggressive but nothing about testosterone and nothing about women benefiting from alimony because there is less pressure.  it was someone’s comment on a thread, so i’m not sure if i could find it, but if i come across something like that again, i will link you to it. however, what do you think is making men more aggressive and risk-taking in general compared to women if not testosterone?  &gt;the point of those was that they were banning the sexist pages against women but not the ones against men. double standards. after all, feminists were the ones getting the sexist pges against women banned. are you also upset with feminists for their “censorship”?  facebook has a shitty policy regarding these things, and it is *definitely* not one-sided. there are plenty of sexist pages about women on there. how can mensrights be expecting to be taken seriously if they say, “we are anti-censorship!” and then try to censor others because that’s what is done to them? it’s like saying “we aren’t anti-women!” and then telling a women she deserved rape because someone said men deserve rape. like you personally said about the whole breast cancer video: if you want to send a message that killing people is wrong, you don't go around killing people (which, btw, i don't necessarily agree with. obviously i agree in the killing people case, but in the blurred lines video, turning it around by objectifying men shows just how ridiculous it was). so why is mensrights saying we are anticensorship and then going around censoring...? it's a direct parallel to the blurred lines video/parody video, yet you support mras/anti-feminists in both scenarios...  &gt;people like to throw around the word ""censorship"" as though anything preventing people from saying anything is morally reprehensible.  [here’s a thread you may be interested in which may better describe my views.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ofbtc/eli5_why_is_white_power_movement_regarded_as/ccs3rpy?context=3) (read two comments above the one i linked to. i can’t figure out how to link my comment and show you the thread with one specific person who replied. you can ignore it after we start quoting each other). while i am anti-censorship, i don't believe in anti-censorship with impunity, which is a whole other ethical discussion altogether.  &gt;most if not all of these people haven't actually examined the philosophical arguments regarding speech. a harvard chouncellor who calls women inferior in science and math should be ousted from his position, and they will organize and protest so that he is, but requesting the removal of a facebook page calling men rapists, pigs, and devils? that's real censorship. i imagine most of these people wouldn't enjoy the stampede that resulted from shouting fire in a crowded movie theater, either.  i don’t get your point?  &gt;as for your self-censorship, if you really feel that uncomfortable in mensrights, then you don't have to come around if you don't want to.  fully aware.   &gt;it's still invasive and psychologically potentially very serious.  it is classified as a minimally-invasive surgery, so no. as i said, we could discuss the psychological implications of it.   &gt;yes.  alright. we can agree to disagree.   &gt;huh. yeah for me anything where i have to sit on an operating table or take drugs so that people can operate on me i tend to consider much more serious than swallowing some pills.  it is generally more serious, but i would say you are better off with it if you don’t want children than taking pills every day. i'd rather have my tubes tied which is far more invasive and extensive than a vasectomy than take pills every day.  &gt;it usually cuts away the vas deferens....  there is no removal. it's a cauterization/severance of the vas deferens.  &gt;i don't know what you mean by that. whose character flaw? what is her flaw?  her character flaw for not being able to sympathize with other people and only realize something is a problem once it affects her.  edit: alright. i went through and read the 4chan explanation of the whole sjw thing. quick thing-sjw is generally used negatively, yes? and when people talk about tumblr, is it generally a good or bad thing? at first i saw some posts that alluded to it being a feminist website, but recently i have seen posts alluding that it's an anti-feminist website? i'm a bit confused.   first, 4chan is vehemently anti-feminist and not particularly welcoming to women in general (tits or gtfo come to mind) and has a largely caucasian male demographic, so excuse me for taking their opinion on the whole thing with a grain of salt (wait, feminism doesn't fight for the privilege of straight, white, men who happen to be the main demographic of 4chan? bad feminism, bad! didn't see that coming from a mile away).   alright, so i particularly liked this gem:  &gt; ""mra's are a lose collection of people dedicated to gender equality, unsurprisingly feminists and srs hate them. the central concept of mra's is that society is not equal and in some areas (genital mutilation, education, health, reproductive rights, legal rights, social protection) men suffer a disadvantage.""  love that men's rights is dedicated to gender equality. if that's what they think, can i tell mras to call themselves egalitarians then? i mean, that's the common complaint against feminism, so everyone should just be egalitarian. or...could it possibly be that men have some things that need addressing, and women do too, and that combined they can come together to form gender equality, and it's *ok* to not call them egalitarians if they fight for a specific gender. it's simply a double-standard between the two terms (i see no pressure for mras to be labelled as egalitarian, so either they are specifically for men, or they are for gender equality in which case they should have the same pressure as feminism). i also find it funny that when society is not equal for men in some areas, those need fixing, but otherwise it's all harrison bergeron (i.e. dystopian satire) for helping women.  you can literally replace mras with feminists and vice versa, and men with women and change some of the issues and the above quotation would be equally valid. weird, huh? that both men and women have different issues that affect them in different ways...  next:  &gt;they do this by using cultural marxist arguments. they claim that prejudice is ""bigotry+power"" and define power as 'being a straight, white male"" so even though what they are doing seems to be exactly the same as the bigots they say they hate it's ""ok"", because they are doing it to straight people, whites and males.  well, first, not all feminists are marxist feminists...given that there are so many different branches of it, that's not a fair claim to make.   funny thing being that majority of srs is male. honestly, this just screams like a white kid complaining he can't call someone a nigger like his black friends do simply because he doesn't understand historical context. if somebody calls me a cracker, it has literally zero effect. me calling a black person a nigger probably would have an effect. now, it's not right for someone to call me a cracker, but eh. so if srs is telling men to get back in the kitchen, who cares? it's not like once upon a time men were slaves to the kitchen. if mras tell me to not seek help for a sprained ankle because otherwise i'm not a strong person, who cares? it's not like once upon a time women were not supposed to seek help for medical care. **i'm not defending it. it is wrong,** but it's not so long ago that straight white men had all the power.  *context*, 4chan has none.  next:  &gt;they control the lgbt, feminism and anti-racism rebbits. it's nicknamed the 'fempire'. they also have a large influence in the anarchism rebbit.  i love that the 'fempire' (implying something negative) includes lgbt and anti-racism subreddits. i mean, i don't even know where to go with that.   the taking down of /r/creepshots is mentioned on that board. isn't is funny that redditors see that anything that compromises their privacy (hi nsa!) as the worst thing ever ^tm and yet something that compromises the privacy of women from which they can benefit (masturbation pictures or whatever else they used the pictures for...i don't really care to know) is totally fair game? people need to be consistent or at least admit they only act in their own self-interest.  in the words of a video game company ""they’re so used to being catered to that they see the lack of catering as an imbalance.""   can i take a wild guess here and ask if you voted republican last election?  edit 2: [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/comments/1q08e7/i_noticed_something_interesting_in_my_health/cd7wlff) comment/thread came up today. this is the crap that annoys me. when i say vasectomies aren't a big deal, everyone gets all huffy because to them it is a big deal. but now that that line of thinking doesn't fit with their narrative, it's totally ok to downplay a vasectomy to make it sound like not a big deal! i agree with mensrights on this one (that it's not a big deal), but **you don't get to change your narrative when it benefits you**.   also, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrights/comments/1q08e7/i_noticed_something_interesting_in_my_health/cd80qsq) comment bothers me.   &gt;it seems to be generally accepted that men are the ""generic"" while women are special cases that need accommodating. feminists might argue that this is putting women in a second class (even though feminist policies are just fine with and even create this situation). an mra might point to it as an indication of the disposable male.  no, it's generally accepted that men are the default and women are the special case (which isn't even logical). this isn't making women into a second class. women have different reproductive structures and because ours are internal, they require far more work and care. if feminist made this happen, then  this isn't indicative of the disposable male, but rather indicative of the lack of action on mras part.",0,
534349,"little or nothing is a gross misinterpretation. private schooling is probably the biggest problem right now, since it enhances segregation. also, there is an attitude that criticize any part of a culture/religion automatically makes people think you are phobic. women oppression in the name of sharia law is an example. also the violent attitude toward jewish people in southern sweden. there's lots of issues, you just don't read about it in dn and gp because the newspapers rather give marcus birro a column than someone who knows what they're talking about.  at least in media and debates, the humanist involvement is met with ""well this is generalization, and you're making a culture look bad and it's phobic in nature"". that's like saying amnesty shouldn't be involved against dictators because there are dictators out there that are doing a good job, so it's used as cognitive dissonance to make it a non-issue, which is just ducking imo.",0,

607009,"this thread is a testament to how the public opinion of gay people really hasn't changed at all in the past 20 years.  gays are totally cool as long as they never interact with you in any way shape or form. maybe the workplace is mostly acceptable, we can work together but that is only because local governments and corporations have made rules against discriminating so i guess you have to play along because if you don't it means lawsuits and all that. gay people using the same locker room at the same time? people are losing their fucking minds in this thread, i've seen the term creeping, preying, leering,staring, etc. the next logical step to most of the thought processes in this thread is literally segregating gay people from straights because if you get checked out by a gay person (anywhere, not just a locker room) than reality folds in on itself and everyone dies or becomes gay or some horrible shit that the bible told them, so it must be avoided at all costs, for the good of humanity.",0,

684146,"fta:  &gt;egypt's presidential palace is trying to distance itself from al-aryan's statements. a palace source told al-sharq al-awsat that al-aryan does not represent the presidency's stance and is not an official presidential spokesman.     -    &gt;the muslim brotherhood official, who also serves as the freedom and justice party's deputy chairman, explained on his facebook account that jews must return to egypt in order to make room for palestinian refugees .  he added that israel is destined to collapse. ""there will be no such thing as israel, instead there will be palestine which will be home to jews, muslims and druze and all of the people who were there from the start.   -  &gt;on thursday, al-aryan said that the return of egyptian jews to israel will enable palestinians to return to their homeland. ""every egyptian has a right to return especially if he is making room for a palestinian. i want to enable the palestinians to return to their land,"" he said. ""i call upon the jews, egypt is worthier of you than israel.""   before people make sweeping judgements from a typically highly-sensationalized title from an israeli publication, read past the title.",0,
784618,"so, i'm in the audience watching an opera. and i really need to pee. i ask someone where the bathroom is and they say ""london."". so i say, ""where's london?"" the tell me to go up the aisle, and take a left. so i do. and it's this grand opera house, though for some reason all the lights are on, even though the opera is going on. so i walk up the aisle, and come to these massive doors. but they are magnificently hung, because the guy dressed like a bellhop (an usher i guess) opens them without any effort to let me out. now i'm in this massive hallway with people dressed extremely soberly, as if it was a courthouse. they walk along quickly, in ones and twos, talking quietly with each other. i stop one, and ask ""where's london?"" he looks at me, vaguely horrified, and mutters ""down the hall, through the ballroom."" i can't tell if he's horrified about the thought of london, or about the fact that i was talking to him. so i jog down the hallway, with my socks flopping around, (i'm wearing tube socks as if they were ankle socks. old habit from my childhood. i hated having the seams under my toenails.) and i find the ballroom. and there's a fancy ball going on. and there's a massive staircase in the middle of the room, with uniformed men (again, similar to a bellhop uniform) seemingly guarding the stairs. so i climb the outside of the stair, along the handrail, and jump over it when i get to the top. then i open the door at the top of the stairs, and, though it seems to be another room, it opens on the bottom of a hill, with cobblestone streets, and a stereotype of late 1800's london. so, i go running along the streets, and eventually spot a sign advertising restrooms. i go up, the man behind the window tells me it's ""tuppence fer usin' the shitter"" luckily, the woman who told me about the bathrooms had given me some change, for some weird reason. (said woman was a random stranger, i knew with complete conviction.) so, i paid the man, went in, did my business, and came out. (did not wet the bed, fortunately.) now for some reason i was running away from a gang of street urchins, took a bunch of turns and managed to get them all run over by a large car. during the time while i was just walking around exploring, before i got chased by urchins, i bought a meat pie from a street vendor - who, upon reflection was probably named dibbler. - and i also noticed that there were cars driving around, with weird advertising on them. then, after escaping the urchins, the city was this weird dystopia, and it turned out that the yogscast had become a massive corporation that ruled the city. and i'm running around, escaping their ad-cars, searching desperately for something. it turns out that the thing i was searching for was an underground fighting tournament, which due to some weird logic, i accidently entered. the first fight was with my own shadow, and it took me about ten minutes, with the audience booing and jeering because nothing was happening to figure out that i had to get the spot lights angles just right so that there were four of him, then make them knock each other out. it worked perfectly. the next fight was a brawl, with me, warrick davis, the coroner from the wizard of oz, alan rickman on acid, and an extremely drunk goat wearing a cape. so, i kick the coroner in the balls, and grab the wicked witch's certificate of death, which i then use to beat up alan rickman into the ground. during this time warrick davis has subdued the goat, stolen it's cape, and, using the goat as a mount, comes riding towards me wielding one of the goats beer bottles as a mace. i dive to the side, and the coroner, who was about to attack me from behind, gets smashed in the face by warricks beer bottle, then trampled by the goat. now it was down to me vs warrick, who is riding a a drunk goat (who, it should be noted is a very, very, angry drunk) while wearing a black cape, while dual wielding a beer bottle, and a small lance, which was thrown to him from the audience. so, as he comes charging at me, i jump over him and run to the other side of the arena. i pick up alan rickmans unconscious body, and use it as a shield against warricks next charge. he gets impaled on the lance, and i receive a glancing blow with the beer bottle, but the goat breaks a leg, and warrick gets thrown off. the crowd is going wild, cheering on warrick, who is the obvious favorite to win. we stop circling each other and charge. i block a flurry of blows from warricks beer bottle with the certificate of death, see an opening, and smack him in the face with it. he's left dazed. i then take a run up, and punt him into the lance sticking out of rickmanm who is just coming to and moaning in pain. it just barely cuts along his side before his head snaps back into rickmans nose, driving it into his brain, killing him, and leaving warrick unconscious. the judge comes out, and says that i am disqualified for dwarf punting, which it turns out was a rule painted on the wall, along with no pissing on other competitors, and no texting while in the ring. the goat is declared the winner, since he was the last one left conscious, though in great pain due to his broken leg. then, suddenly, while mr. rogers is awarding the goat his prize, white ad-cars smash in, and i run away. next i remember, i'm wandering around this dystopian city, dodging the adcars, when i find someone who is willing to explain the the history of the city. it turns out that youtube somehow gained massive amounts of power, broke away from google, and gave different cities to random youtubers to rule. pewdiepie ruled the northeastern us, totalbiscuit the mid atlantic, the various members of the yogscast the uk, and machinima mexico and some parts of south america. google owned most of asia, canada, and europe, while australia maintained their independence somehow. the old man explaining this all to me thought the method if their independence was probably dropbears. then the adcars came and ran over the man telling me about all of this, and i was off searching for something again. i wander around, and end up back in non-dystopian london, get asked by a man building a roof if i wanted work for the day, to which i said yes, and i spent about five hours building a roof. the man then paid me, and i was off again. i bought another pie from the man that was probably dibbler, and went back to searching, this time i realised that i was looking for a pineapple, because that would let me get back and finish watching the opera, which for some reason i knew had paused the moment i left the room, and the only way to rescue the nice old lady who had directed me to the bathroom was to go back and finish watching, otherwise the entire audience and actors would remain forever frozen in time. so, i'm off searching for a pineapple. as i wander around, i spot one of the urchins from before, and i ask him where i can find a pineapple. he tells me there is a fruit market up the street, but that pineapples are in such short supply that they costs large amounts of money. so i go up the street, and find the one man who is selling pineapples, and he's dressed in a full pimpsuit. broad brimmed purple hat, trimmed with white and black stripped fur, gold plated cane, the works. he tells me that his pineapples are $1274.99 each, but that if i can get him the license plate of an adcar, he'll lower it to $300, which happens to be just a little bit less than what i had earned building that roof. i agree to his proposal, and slowly work my way back towards the dystopia, only wondering once i looked up in surprise that i had entered it why he knew about that place and the adcars when noone else did. so i'm wandering around, and spot a solo adcar, sneak up behind it and try to pull off the license plate. but it's held onto the car by dwarf screws!tm having no idea what the hell those are, i gave up and went in search of someone who could tell me what they were. after wandering around for a long time in the ever shifting city, i stumble upon the drunk goat. he greets me cautiously, apparently completely sober, and asks how i got away from the arena. i explain that i wasn't quite sure myself, and asked him what dwarfscrews!tm were. he explains that they are proprietary hardware produced by a race of dwarves that lived in tunnels underneath the english channel. the only way to either tighten them, or remove them is to be a dwarf, ensuring that they have business as long as anyone uses them. i thank the goat, and enquire about his leg, he tells me that it's fine, waving a cast around. ""it'll be as good as new in a week or two. was a clever move, using rickman as a shield there. too bad you punted warrick, this prize would have been yours"" he said, pulling a remote control toy car out of his cape. i went off looking for a dwarf while he was playing with it. after a while of searching, i heard a screech from above, and got knocked down onto the road by a sudden weight. someone proceeded to try to slam my head against the ground, but i rolled over and pinned him. it turned out warrick davis was out for revenge for my punting him. after a short conversation, i proposed a deal, to split a pineapple with warrick if he helped me get an adcar plate. he agreed, so we wandered off together trying to find an adcar by itself. it took quite some time, but eventually we found one, and warrick removed the dwarfscrews!tm. together we went back to the pineapple merchant, and gave the man the license plate for the pineapple. we cut it in half, and each enjoyed a few slices together. i bid a fond farewell to warrick, and started asking around where the bathroom was, since that was the only way i knew to get back to the doors. once back at the doors, i bribed each bellhop with a slice of pineapple, and went back through the ballroom, and the sober hall, where they seemed startled, and into the auditorium, where i watched the rest of the opera. and then i woke up.",0,

926238,"**group 1**   *based on picture 87*  as i walk through the gray and damp  the sun, behind steel, flickers like a lamp  step after step, i sink into deep dark pools  destroyed corporations to my left to my right, eviscerated schools.  murky puddles and melted rust  the dim remains of unquenched war lust  as tartarus looks down upon us from above  no single shiny flake is showered of love.  instead, thick ashes reign,  bringing down dusty pain,  and as that smoke clogs my lungs  i grip orange ladder rungs.  upwards i pull myself above this scape  ascending from the thermonuclear rape,  hand over hand, foot over foot  my palm grew black with human soot.  a creak and metallic groan as i near the top  but the nightmares linger below, no time to stop  with one final heave, i break free  and stand atop a skyscraper, with all to see.  slowly i drag my tired eyes across the land,  what previously occupied human shapes—now sand  i feel the morbid grit on my palm,  causing my mind to race as all is calm.  towering terrors loom into the sky,  like ribs out of grass not answering why,  thanatos’s mean grim glows true,  as the world is enveloped in orange hue.  it all slides down my throat, hard to swallow—my lithium  sending me deeper and deeper into everlasting delirium  the city itself seems to scream out  its cause of death leaves me no doubt.  and as i fall to my knees in awe  i hear, far away, the black crow’s caw  it soars in the air as a beacon of hate  the scavenger dove, as of late.  but it has nowhere to nest, not glen nor glade  not a morsel of meat, just a hydrogen-shade  all around, on the remaining walls  the outline of a friendly ghost falls.  it looks like my own, and i reach out,  connecting with nothing that i’ll ever know about  standing as a monument to our sins  carved into the side of white trash bins.  alas, the mist around me is of vermillion hue  renewing my drive—to start anew  turning to the ladder, i start my descent  relinquishing the freedom, of which i have been lent.  but as i shift from rung to rung  my world—it flips like the chameleon’s tongue  and like its coat, my view shifts  instead of dipping down, my world, it lifts.  with renewed vigor i climb and climb  leaving behind me metal covered in rime  a warm breeze brushes ‘gainst my cheek  the beauties i behold, of which i cannot speak.  my voice clogged by that hateful dirt  proving my speech to be inert  they swirl around me, sirens of light  and assist me in my fearful flight.  zig-zagging scions of fluorescence  bath my world in luminescence  gorgeous flows of white and gold  gilded to their skin like crowns of old.  one reaches out with her hand to me  and cures my sight, allowing me to see  her augustan frame shrivels to black  my cursed eye turns to a cataract.  but blinds me not, as one may think  it clips for me a missing link  her oil-black dress on her skeletal frame  a gaping maw splits open, “from whence you came.”  suddenly i plummet to the death and ash  scars left by a depleted weapons cache  the pitch consumes me—a horrid tar  how i wonder—have i come this far?  this never ending free-fall shakes my soul  and i mourn to see another knoll  below me sits a bloody lake  mounds of bodies in my wake.  with a sudden impact, and a scarlet flash  i hit the water with a hellish splash  my bones chill to the core  as i plunge deep into the gore.  soon my vision goes from red to black  the reality hits me like a thunder-crack  with the edge of my foot, the bottom i touch  and i choke on the fluid, just as such.  repentance is clear as the prawn’s shell  when you find yourself a pawn in your hell  the toll of a bell, the strike of a clock  the crack of a whip, the tick of a clock.  in my place, i find that time keeper  cast of silver, tomb of the reaper  outstretches her hand, gnarled twisted  on her manifest of souls, i find myself listed.  my hand in hers, i step through the port  and enter a world of no other sort  trees above me bend and break  i find in front of me, a wooden stake.  clenched in a fist, i lift the vampyric bane  turning to my captor, obedience i feign  but then with one swooping blow  i strike her fast, hard, and low.  she lets me slip, just for a minute  but long enough to run, to begin it  such a startling screech—i’ve never heard  a deathknell not fit of man, woman, or bird.  sprint through the dusk, through the dark wood  on my tail howls a daemonic flood  over branch, log, and rushing stream  i skip like a doe on a balance beam.  the harpies take note, and leave their yews  footprints behind me are the only clues  and yet they beat their wings in chase  slowly advancing on me in this race.  a light flickers true, at the end of the err  their nails rip into my flesh—my world a blur  i break free with a bleeding back  the light stings my eyes like a tack.  and ahead of me the siren floats  beckoning me to coves and shimmering côtes  my knowledge of my treachery full  i step forward, with my brain dull.  trusting her to hold me true  trust her descent from the blue  hoping her doll skin turns not to slate  her eyes beckoning me--an ethereal bait.  the soft grass below me feet and between my toes  i lift my shoulders, as my confidence grows  my chin held high, i go to greet her  an old friend…a radiant creature.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [**steam**](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043270046)",1,

they never found him.”  “maybe he didn’t want the publicity,” gigi crumpled her printout into a little ball, “maybe he was some kind of a sex offender and couldn’t let anyone know he was near a school.”  julio scowled and tossed his paper away, “i think i’d prefer an angel.”  no one but kurt had looked at the printout for very long. i had expected derision or accusations of being full of shit, but it wasn’t like that. they just wanted to put it out of sight and mind. these kids were spooked, there was no doubt about that. i asked, “how did he rescue you exactly?”  bob shrugged, “he carried us out.”  “nine kids at the same time? or did he take trips?”  “how should we know?” clayton said, “we were like six years old!”   “he wrapped us up in his arms,” kurt explained, “and walked through the smoke until we were safe.”  that was the last straw. everyone started arguing and yelling, there were insults and threats of violence. at first i was worried the noise might make my landlady mrs. vincenzo suspicious of what i was up to, but on the other hand isn’t this how most games of *monopoly* turn out?  then their phones went off, all eight of them and at exactly the same time. the sudden clash of tones, chirps and songs made everyone jump.  “it's from suzie...” tameka breathed.  “me too.” clayton said, “did she send you a picture?”  julio dropped his phone, “oh fuck. oh fuck!”  “what is it?” i walked around so i could peer over leroy's shoulder.   it was a black and white picture, the image was grainy, washed out and at a slight angle. the first thing that came to my mind when i saw it was that it looked like a shot from an art house film. my second thought was “is that-”  “it’s the school,” leroy nodded, “it’s our school the day of the fire...”  +  *...after we spent about an hour fruitlessly trying to text and call suzie we decided to pack it in. there were no more snide comments and eye rolls, they were all scared now.*  *all of them except for kurt, he seemed delighted at this turn of events.*  *we all swapped phone numbers and emails. that done i made sure each of them forwarded me a copy of that image. then i made them promise to call me if anything even slightly strange happened.*  *leroy stayed behind for a little longer, he and i had other things to discuss. it was time to take my investigations to the next level and since i couldn’t go anywhere i was going to have to outsource my breaking and entering. leroy agreed to my plan more quickly than i would have liked but i still sent him away with a digital video camera and some words of advice.*  *once i was alone i got to work on the picture. here is what i know so far;*  *fact: the photo really was of colonie village elementary from the day of the fire. thick clouds of smoke are roiling out of every window but you can’t see any flames.*   *now, i’ve escaped and started a few conflagrations in my time and let me tell you that smoke looks like something you’d get from a chemical explosion or a 1980’s heavy metal concert gone bad.*  *you know, they say the smoke gets you before you burn up, they also say that its a kind of mercy.*  *fact: i went through every newspaper report i could and found no pictures matching the one that was sent. all those official photos were of the front entrance and the parking lot. the picture that was sent to the colonie village nine had been taken somewhere near the rear of the building. the photographer must have been right at the edge of the playground.*  *fact: speaking of the photographer, the angles of the picture don’t quite make sense. our shutterbug in question had either been sitting up in a tree or been freakishly tall.*  *fact: suzie’s smartphone has been in the police evidence room since the night of her disappearance some six weeks ago.*   **to be continued**",0,

303580,"i'll try to give you a succinct outline since this is a ten year project and it's very easy for me to go into way more detail than anyone would want. i'm also going to try and avoid spoilers as much as possible, which is difficult since the races and the world itself are tied very closely to one of the bigger twists in the story (but if you want to know more feel free to pm me).  **bythe:**  picture 8-10 foot long preying mantis creatures that live in massive underground colonies and come in black-backed or red-backed varieties, communicate telepathically, and whose two 'arms' are massive scythes used in combat. intelligent but do not think in terms of individuality. placing 'locks' over the antennae to block telepathic communication seen as the worst punishment a bythe can receive.  **tol:**  these guys are 12 foot tall and 8 foot wide tribal species who live in trees over the swamps. have hugely developed arm strength and walk on their two arms, using their 'legs' as hands. they believe in non-intervention and very suspicious of outsiders. losing an arm in battle is seen as a great sacrifice due to how much they rely on their own. so when they meet one of the characters who has lost his arm, they treat him differently than the others in his party.  **domin:**  these guys don't play a role in the first book, but are one of the central focuses of the second. they are somewhat shorter than humans on average, lack developed musculature, are very pale, but adapted to see well in the dark as they live underground. they rely heavily on technology left behind by the ancients to sustain their way of life and with the last remainders of their power source dwindling, their civilization is in a state of decay.  **rhen:**  the rhen are of average human height and are difficult to distinguish from humans other than their large pointed ears (i'll include a link to my cover image which features a female rhen). they are longer-lived than humans and have lost considerable territory to them. while their cities are beautiful (and the capital can even move), they focus on how things used to be instead of working toward how to improve their situation now, leading to many bitter and uppity rhen who have a less-than-nice view toward humans, particularly after the fall of the wielders.  **human:**  your standard people. by the third age, they have relatively large cities with a centralized currency and banks. many enter the huge military and help their ruler seek out pieces of technology from the ancients and work to stamp out the last remnants of the wielders.  ---  the continent in the se - was inhabited long ago but is mostly desert by the third age. a few races live there but are not high in number or organized into a nation-state.  further notes: some individuals are born with the ability to wield energy. their ability was discovered when one of the remaining gauntlets (a remnant from the ancients) selects its wielder by reacting to their energy source. once their ability has been displayed, they could refine their abilities and help improve senthra by becoming a wielder. the gauntlets act as a focus, allowing the wielders to form energy shields, move various objects through telekinesis, expel energy beams, and...absorb other energy sources. by the third age the wielders no longer exist (but the gauntlets do).  let me know if anyone would like to know more. my book will be ready to publish in a couple of months and i'd be more than willing to send out a few copies if you contact me, just pm me your email address and i'll send it to you when the time comes (just let me know what ereader device you prefer - kindle, b&amp;n, kobo, itunes, etc.)",0,

870836,"ex- navy here.  if you are considering joining this particular field, here are my talking points - heed them well:   * recruiters don't usually lie, they just do not mention the most critical parts. * don't get blinded by the cash and they pay charts they will be offering you.  you get paid a decent wage.   * unless you want to leave with some legitimate psychological problems, don't volunteer for submarines.  it is not what you think it is (hunt for red october, chrimson tide, steel sharks - all lies).  it should be a reality tv show about psychological torture.    * you cannot un-volunteer for submarine duty.  it sucks hard, and it is difficult, and it's a small community, (and i'm proud as shit that i did it) -but... once you get it, they won't let you get out.  - they make you decide while you are in boot camp, when you dont know anything about either the surface fleet or the submarine fleet.  * whatever training you get while you are in does not correlate to shit in the civilian world.   i was a highly trained nuclear technician with years of laboratory experience and mechanical systems experience and training.  have my engineering degree now.  i got nothing from my s.m.a.r.t. transcript from the navy.  absolutely fucking nothing (zero credits).  don't believe them if they tell you otherwise - ask the local universities what they accept first.  the big schools laugh at it.  they will tell you something meaningful.  * deployments - they are going to be long.  6-8 months is a standard.  wartime can make them stretch into 8, or 10 months.  you marriage/relationships will suffer. but more importantly - just because the deployment is over doesn't mean you get to go home.  i worked 6-7 days a week while the submarine was parked against the peer.  wife never understood that, and that's part of the reason she left  * when you get home from a deployment, there's a chance you might turn around in a month and leave again for another one.  there is not equal time off.    * this one is obvious, but you forfeit most of your civil rights.    * duty - we call it standing watch or being ""on duty"".   the boat comes home from a deployment, but the reactor never really shuts off, so every other day, or every 3 days, you have to stay at work overnight.  and guess what?  the day after is a work day.  so you work monday through friday, and every other day or every 3 days you have to stay overnight.  this means you work most weekends as well.  this is standard for a submarine.  3 section duty rotations, even when you are at home, in port.    * you will not sleep.  on a deplyoment, especially if you are in the nuclear department, on a submarine, you will get 3-4 hours of sleep a day.  and it will be broken up by drills, training, alarms, and people farting and being douchebags.    * you can fall asleep while standing up. you will hallucinate vividly after a few weeks of no real rem sleep.  this can get you hurt, in more ways than one.  if you fall asleep on watch, they will punish you severely.  you can be demoted, reduced in rank, or worse.  * the way you get punished in the navy:  they reduce your rank, they fine you part of your paycheck for x number of months, and they can make you stay at work.  read and understand that last one.  they can force you to stay at work, even if you have a home with a wife and kid.  - just to be clear- this never happened to me, it happens if you fuck up.  so don't do that.  * the food is pure absolute unconsumable unhappiness coated with misery.  sometimes they whip up a special batch of brain rape.   * communication:  on the carriers, they have much more complex stuff.  skype, emails, internet, blah blah blah.   on the submarine you have jack and shit, and jack left town. once every 3 or 4 weeks you might get a telegraph.  yes, a fucking telegraph with a short message.  it's gotten a bit better, but not much.  you might get a quick email.  submarines are hidden, so you can't really send out a signal to a satellite to get data like emails and news - that can be triangulated.  so if you are doing something covert, which can last for months, expect zero communication with your family.  yeah, the wife really enjoyed that part.   * they will read your emails.  all of them.  you can't receive bad news - that could get you upset and you might be the only guy who can do your job.  get used to this idea, and dont talk dirty through email, that throws red flags and they will read them and laugh at your kinky fetishes.  * you can be held back in boot camp.  if you are a shitbag, or if you struggle with the mindwipe that occurs in bootcamp, you will stay there a few extra weeks.  maybe a few months.  dont go to boot camp in the winter.  it's in great lakes (i think it still is...).  and it's fucking cold.  * military housing is psycho cental.  it is worse than any housewives show, jersey shore episode, or any white trash trailer park crap you will ever find.    * you probably wont cheat.  you are on deployment.  but she might, because she is sitting at home wondering what you are doing, wondering if you are cheating, and the neighbors and other service members are soul-less.  they will screw anything, even if it's married.  don't trust any of them.  * yeah yeah yeah, 150 men go down, 75 couples come up.  that's not really true.  what about threeways?  50 threeways?  - nobody really cares about that.  we only had a couple gay dudes on our boat.  it was kinda funny because the drama really started after they hooked up and then started hating each other.  your family business will become everyone's business.  and people will fuck with you.  a lot.  if some guy comes up and starts touching your balls, just stare him in the eyes and stand your ground.  it's perfectly normal.  he is trying to fuck with you and see if you get homophobic.  the hazing is psychological now.  if you crack, that flaw will be exploited and everyone will mess with you.  good times.  good times.  * women are on submarines now, so that will introduce all sorts of new complications.    * you will not see the world.  if you are on a ballistic nuclear submarine, you will not see a single foreign port.  each one of those submarines is more powerful than most nations on this planet.  they don't go to ports. if you are on an attack submarine, you will go to ports- but they are all red light districts.  get used to everyone bringe drinking.  that's all we do.  plus the other stuff that is offered in a red light district.   if you wanna score, remember that in thailand, there is a good chance she might be a he.    * you dont get to choose where you are stationed.    * norfolk virginia is one of the largest naval stations.  affectionately described as no fuck vagina.  there is a reason for that.  groton is similar.  the women there are affectionately described as grotopottamuses.  there is a good reason for that too.  hawaii is not fun to live.  you will be a haole - a foreigner, and treated like blacks get treated in the dirty south.  you are really not welcome there. edit - okay, i'll tone done this last comment.  maybe it's not that bad, but it sure felt that way to me.  * the biggest, douchiest, dumbest, ignoramus shit stick braindead moron will likely be in charge of you on some level.  the good guys with leadership skills and talent take one look and get the fuck out.  that's unfortunately how the system works.    * we make the water and the air is recycled.  it smells like farts, bo, amine, and oil.  and sadness.  it gets in your skin, your eyes, your hair, and your clothes.  and it wont go away for a few days after you leave.  oh, and it's fucking nasty for other people to smell.  you get used to it and don't notice.  but those women in the ports notice.  put your clothes in a food saver bag.    i could ramble on all day but i wanted to share a few big points. i am proud of my service and i value it immensely.  it paid for my education and i have a sign on my wall that says if you aint a submariner you aint shit.  but be warned...  * lastly - no good *deal* goes unpunished.  keep your head down and a low profile, and never ever ever volunteer for anything.  you will be voluntold for the things that need getting done.   edit 2: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!  im glad this is getting passed around.  these are just my personal opinions  from my experiences, but i think it's important to share it.  **tl; dr - you should read this if you are thinking of joining the navy.**",1,

&gt;*but wyeth didn’t paint a single sentimental picture in his life, starchy or not. oh, maybe one, the cloying tempera showing all his models dancing around a maypole*. &gt; &gt;*wyeth painted like a surgeon cuts. crisp, flinty-eyed, completely unsentimental. the hell with the patient or the pain of recovery. what’s really there is what you see.*  [[recalling andy wyeth by thomas hoving]](http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/news/hoving/hoving1-20-09.asp)    &gt;*the subjects of wyeth's much later and dreamlike ""snow hill"" are dancing merrily around a beribboned pole, not a may pole as one might think at first glance, but a winter pole crowned by an evergreen and surrounded by snow. we cannot see the faces of the six dancers, but they were all known to wyeth as models, and they were friends at various times in his life: karl and anna kuerner, allan lynch, helga testorf (model for the legendary helga paintings), bill loper and adam johnson. on the hillside below is the kuerner farm near chadds ford, pennsylvania, a place known and loved by wyeth in his childhood. in the distance we glimpse the railway tracks on which wyeth's father (noted illustrator n.c. wyeth) was killed with his young grandson in 1945. wyeth once said jocularly that the subjects of this rather surreal painting were dancing around the pole in anticipation of his death because he had been so difficult to work with. the dancers certainly appear to be in a festive frame of mind, but if they are celebrating anything at all, it is andrew's long and fruitful life and his art, not his demise.*  [[beyond the fields we know ]](http://www.beyondthefieldsweknow.org/2009/01/farewell-to-andrew.html)   &gt;andrew wyeth died [...] on a winter's day familiar to us from many of his paintings: snowy, cold and moody. perhaps the best form of appreciation we can express for his artistic achievement is to undertake a close look at one of his iconic works -- in this case ""snow hill,"" a painting from the height of his powers that is relatively little known, seen or reproduced. while it has been on loan to the [brandywine museum](http://www.brandywinemuseum.org) for several years, its fragility of surface has kept it from going out on loan to a wider audience, and its singularity of subject matter has not readily found it a place in recent wyeth monographs or exhibition catalogs. only posterity is likely to sort out which of his paintings will stand up as his most memorable works, but ""snow hill"" is likely to hold its own as one of the most haunting, beautiful and resonant of wyeth's seven-decade career. &gt; &gt;indeed, the picture is about marking seven decades. wyeth, who lived to the age of 91, painted this large tempera to mark his 70th birthday (in 1987). he finished the painstaking effort two years later. there are few others that are larger and as ambitious. the artist was conscious of mortality for much of his career, from the deaths of his father and nephew in a train accident in 1945, to his own miscellaneous ailments, operations and illnesses throughout his later years. &gt; &gt; &gt;andrew wyeth &gt;""snow hill"" is a relatively unknown work, but is likely to be one of the most haunting, beautiful and resonant pieces of mr. wyeth's career. &gt; &gt;we know that many of his images were in varying degrees autobiographical, and this painting was a conscious summary of his artistic life that was both somber memoir and playful recalibration. like many of wyeth's winter landscapes in watercolor, drybrush, or egg tempera, this makes the most of a near-monochromatic palette, where darks and lights play against each other, and nature's full range of grays and tans takes on a heightened texture. one of his great talents was an intense technical virtuosity in all of his chosen media. yet even as his admirers and critics are drawn to the magic realism of objects and surfaces, it is the charged emotion, suggestive meaning, and complex moods beneath facades and faces that distinguish his finest visions. &gt; &gt;the setting was intimately familiar to wyeth almost his entire life, a view looking down over the kuerner farm and the nearby hills of the brandywine valley in pennsylvania. the artist knew almost every inch of the roads, buildings and fields we see in the distance below. historians and others may argue for some time whether his future reputation will rest on the landscapes or portraits (respectively descended from two of his artistic idols, winslow homer and thomas eakins). ""snow hill"" is unusual in the merging of the two -- one open, silent and vast; the other intimate, animate and active. the foreground hilltop, receding valley, and broad sky constitute a painted tour de force of whites, off-whites and cream colors. its poetic emptiness recalls the stark eloquence seen in but a few of wyeth's other strongest compositions -- such as ""christina's world"" (1949), ""river cove"" (1958) and ""airborne"" (1996). &gt; &gt;atop the hillside we view the improbable scene of a maypole dance at christmas time. the seven ribbons descending from beneath the tree above mark the artist's seven decades. in a surreal vision, wyeth assembles prominent figures from his life and art who appeared in major paintings over the years. holding hands from left to right across the foreground are karl and anna kuerner, followed by william loper and helga testorf. in the back right is the family friend and neighbor allan lynch, wearing his telltale hat with earflaps flying, and finally, partially obscured, a figure with billowing brown coat who recalls the artist's wife, betsy, posing years earlier in the snowy courtyard of their chadd's ford farmhouse. in this enumeration we realize the group only comes to six, suggesting a missing seventh figure. possibly christina olson, the most enduring of wyeth's maine subjects, made famous by his first masterpiece, ""christina's world,"" is not present, since her paralysis would keep her from dancing. or perhaps the implied seventh individual might be the artist himself, participant in their lives and unseen orchestrator of this imaginary get-together. in any case, this is a witty and exuberant conjuring of artistic imagination. &gt;   [[wyeth's white wonder (continued) by john wilmerding]](http://online.wsj.com/article/sb123274763342511309.html)",0,

""i... i'm sorry. i didn't..."" the funeral director's voice trails off, his words exuding the same sort of lifelessness that mine did but a moment ago. ""i'll give you some time."" he bows, and turns a quick heel toward the front of the room. he opens the double doors leading to the rest of the building quietly, and slips away with even less noise. i turn for a moment, to see if he's truly gone.  ""she was blind."" fuck me, what kind of an answer was that? she had favorite colors, she loved blue; she loved the sound of the ocean, the smell and taste of the sky, the music of miles davis... all of it reflected in her beautiful, icy, cloudy, piercing eyes.  i shake my head.  ""blue,"" i blurt out, forgetting how much i hate how my voice sounds in this room. i slowly insert my hands into the small garment bag i had taken from her closet, and fidget out her favorite dress. blue. dark, navy, midnight with no stars blue. i hadn't thought about the contrast between it and her pale, soft skin - it looks foreign, somehow, draped over her fragile, naked frame. like it had accidentally stumbled into the wrong room, and caught its lover with a fire-red evening gown, or a backless silver evening dress. it feels equally alien as i pull her slender legs through the bottom. i shudder at the cool, artificial-feeling skin against my fingers. like nails on a chalkboard, or a rake on concrete.  her arms are heavy as i slip them into the long, flowing sleeves and place them neatly across her chest. i adjust the sharp neckline, wishing, as i always had, that it didn't plunge as quickly as it did. em, of course, would have none of my protesting. ""what's the point of going out if i'm not going to look my absolute best?"" she'd ask, fully aware of the ridiculousness of her statement. her lazy smile - playful, and at the same time completely bewitching - dancing across her face for a moment before she'd turn and beckon for me to come closer. ""zip me up?"" i'd oblige, taking care as i'd run my fingers up either side of her spine slowly while i did it, kissing her neck softly. she'd inhale sharply, feigning surprise, while silently snaking her hands behind my hips, pulling me in tightly and whispering her love softly in no direction in particular.  i take care as i pull the long, auburn braid out from behind her back and drape it gingerly across her right breast, adjusting the pins that held her braid to her much-shorter natural hair after. this feels so wrong. like i'm dressing up a freakish, emily-sized china doll in her favorite clothes. i've done this so many times - picked out things that would compliment her slender, almost fragile figure, colors i think she'd like, shoes, jewelry - it became mundane. commonplace. this? this is anything but.  i want to vomit.  i'm going to vomit.  i vomit.  luckily, as my stomach turns itself inside out, expelling the crackers and cheese that have consisted of my breakfast and lunch today, i manage to reach the trash can in the rear of the room. i project most of the stomach acid and bile in there. the stench is overwhelming, and for a minute it almost masks the perfumes and anti-bacterial sprays funeral homes use to mask the inevitable smell of death that permeates into the walls of a place like this. it's funny, i think to myself, how deathly smells end up resurfacing anyway. then the stench overtakes me, and i vomit again.  as i kneel over the small plastic bag placed inside the too-large faux-gold wire mesh wastebin, i think back to em's first round of chemotherapy, which hadn't gone dissimilarly. she shook violently as her stomach rejected the poison in her veins, doubled over the toilet that i had only barely managed to guide her to, even in the apartment we had shared for barely a year then.  ""josh?"" she spat, through the mucous and bile clogging her mouth.  ""yeah babe?""  ""i look ugly now, don't i?""  i mustered my best fake-laugh and patted her reassuringly. ""no, em. you look fine. especially for someone who's puking at the moment."" she laughed, which forced another round of the dry heaves.  she never did look ugly. even when her hair began coming out in handfuls, matted against the brush she'd later throw into the bathroom mirror, breaking it. even when she'd pass out, exhausted from the chemicals in her bloodstream, looking whiter than any ghost. even when the cancer reduced her to skin and bones. even now, after a years' remission, lying on the table in front of me after no more than a week in a hospital bed. she's beautiful, even if it is in that freakish china-doll facsimile kind of way.  i wipe my lips with the edge of my suit coat. i don't care if it ends up smelling like spittle and vomit later. i'm sure the cleaners deal with worse. i make my way slowly back to the table. shoes. she needs shoes. i rummage through the garment bag, digging through to the bottom where i'm sure the slender black slip-ons she'd always wear were located. nothing. i check again, frantically, but the bag feels empty.   ""i... i forgot the shoes. i forgot the fucking shoes. i forgot. i... i can't believe i forgot the shoes. i can't believe i forgot your shoes. i can't believe how much of an **idiot** i am. fuck. fuck. fuck. **fuck. fuck.**""  i sink to my knees, still cursing. and that's when it hits me - this overwhelming wave of sorrow, grief, and anguish, all rolling out of me at once. i feel the hot streaks of tears running down my cheeks, as i curse louder and louder, sobbing in between expletives. i'm shouting now. i don't care. i don't care. i fall to the floor, on my side, reeling back and forth, still sobbing and cursing.  ""hey.""  it's a soft voice. hers. ""hey,"" she says again, plainly and without emphasis. i turn to look in the direction of the sound, and there she is. standing over me, in her favorite blue dress, smiling with a slightly misdirected gaze, as she so often did. i turn over onto my knees, accepting her hand in mine as she guides me from the floor.  ""how...?"" i ask, my voice trailing off as she adjusts her gaze and gently shushes me, placing her hand gingerly on my cheek, and running her soft fingers over my cheeks, nose, and lips. this was how she ""saw"" me; her hands tracing every feature, every line on my face, memorizing each minute detail. then, she does something she's never done. she drops her hands from my face, dropping them directly into mine, which were hanging limply by my sides.  and she looks directly into my eyes.  i don't know if i can describe how it feels to miss that contact with the person you love. i mean, it's adequately replaced by the heightened response to their touch, their smell, their taste - but there's something about a lover's gaze that is difficult to replicate. and, for the first time, i'm locked in em's. it's as if, for a moment, her soul shines out from behind her beautiful visage, penetrating me to the core. ""em..."" i stammer.  but she's gone.  i exhale sharply and erratically, fighting more tears. i turn, and she's once again lifeless on the table. a china doll. i reach into the smaller bag sitting next to the still shoeless garment bag, and pull out a small, thin silver necklace. i drape it across her frigid neck, fastening it as best i can. i'm just about to remove my hands when i find myself moving them upwards, across her neckline and across her face, tracing every line, every feature. my thumbs brush gently across her eyelids. my tears drip onto her chest, leaving staining tracks as they roll down her neck and over her shoulders.  ""i see you, emily.""  and i dry my tears, and turn to go.",0,

"". we bought his charade and he eventually joined up with us and joined the protesting the next day. all while still playing his role and spying on us. we hit a few other memorials, but it was raining and there were practically no people there besides foreign tourists. so we called it a day after marching for hours  the *next* day, we again went to the lincoln. it was not rainy and less foreigners. again, we bullhorned and marched right to the barricades and hoped it. only this time, some people followed us!! then the gestapo called back up and 24 of them lined up on the steps, arms crossed, or hands on the pistol. we dissed them, asked them if theyre willing to fire on american citizens, then quickly called them killers (referenced to mariam carey), we told them their pensions are going to disappear if they dont stop listening to their superiors illegal orders. some of them even responded with ""hey man i dont like doing this either, were just following our orders"" and we quickly retorted by asking if theyre quoting nazi soldiers or if that was an original thought. there was even a point my friend got in a tug of war match with 3 cops with the barricades! and the cops didnt do a damn thing beyond stand there and look tough. one even tried to pull him aside and whisper in his ear that if he continues what hes saying hed be charged for ""inciting a riot"" which we quickly called bs on and bull horned his lie to everyone listening.  one fellow in the crowd (who was awake) found his voice and began preaching for/with us. he said he was audited by the irs in less than a week after writing a letter to his democratic congressman about his distaste of policy. some really heavy stuff. there was even a guy dressed as george washington in a legit costume!  but thats just a taste :p   &gt;dude. post a link. i want to see. seriously  we did have 1 video up on a youtube channel we created, but he took that down after getting spooked. trust me, im trying really hard to get him on board with it. no point in going through the effort of recording if were just going to hoard it.  i do have some pictures in my dropbox i can move to the public folder. ill send you a pm sometime today once i do it.   &gt;i think everything you've said here needs to get seen and read by a lot more people. if more of us started doing what you and your friend did...i think things would begin to change  you have no idea man. theres no way to say this without sounding pompous or making everyone else but me sound like an idiot; but the large majority, and i mean large majority of people are asleep and sheep. life is like a fog where they cant see beyond 5 feet infront of them but believe they have perfect clear vision. by literally walking up to a crowd, you can grab control of them easily by being confident and knowledge able. even the few people who disagreed with us, i found hanging back and watching too. the same exploit our overlord masters use for control, we used for liberation.  i used to half-believe the saying of ""im just 1 guy, i cant change anything"", only because of soandsoblahblah. after this experience, i came to the realization 1 person can literally change the world, and its so easy to do, all one has to do is start taking steps towards it and it will fall into your lap,and again im not attempting to put myself on a pedestal, but because the masses are almost literally sheep who need to be guided and yesterday was a perfect example: someone is telling you to google executive orders that threaten americas saftey, while hopping barricades and yelling at cops? ""quick honey, get a picture for the scrapbook! i want to tell lynda about this at the watercooler!"".  if people all across the nation did this, in small groups of 2, 3 or what have you, change will happen real soon and for the better. its because the people are stagnant this evil thrives.  &gt;how is he gonna have the balls to go there and do it in person and take video of it yet not have the balls to put it online!?!?  hahaha, my thoughts exactly. there are loads of pictures and stuff, i can post.

733425,"wall of text regarding my experience:   i got arrested with 11 friends on my birthday in marina del rey (right next door to venice beach) for going to a party at some friends of some friends' place that wound up being a squat in a really nice apartment building that was cleared out for renovations. well, after being there for about 15 minutes, i was itching to get out of there and head to the beach for space bags and the drum circle. no sooner than i started saying peace to the 'residents', the los angeles swat team kicked in the doors to every apartment on the entire floor and arrested like 40 or 50 people total - turns out there were squatters in every apartment on the floor, it was an entire community and the fuzz had caught wind of it. so it's off to la county for my first adventure in jail!   after being crammed into a very uncomfortable van on top of about 10 people, we were poked and prodded by the cops while they talked about how we were going to get beat and raped in county because we were all punks with mohawks and tattoos. it didn't scare me, but it certainly made me think a lot less of the officers in la. we were taken to the marina del rey subtation, where they took our mugshots and split the girls from the guys and piled us into a big cell all together with some thin pads to sleep on. after a few hours, we got moved down to the downtown los angeles jail... after we got put in booking, they cut my boot laces and took my belt, boots, chains, etc (to be expected). now booking wasn't that busy, your normal lot of criminals, but nobody really starting fights or being unruly or anything. after we spent 3 or 4 hours going through the process, (where they set my bail at $175,000 and announced initial charges of felony everything they could invent) we were moved to holding, which looked like it was the setup from 'oz'. only a couple of the guys had ever been arrested before, and only one of them in la, so we were just kind of going with the flow, goofing off and making the most of a shitty situation - we knew we weren't getting let out that night. anyway, there were 'pods' all over the big room, all had clear plexi doors and there were a few tables and chairs in the middle of this big ass room. they told us all to break and pick a pod until we were processed and sent wherever we were going to end up next. well, being a bunch of shits, we smashed like 4-5 people in each pod and got locked in, which the guards asked if we were sure we wanted to do, not telling us that we'd be stuck like that for 12 hours or so. we got yelled at for playing home run derby with our jail shoes and apples from our meals, i remember getting screamed at to cut the shit if we didn't want beaten.   after what seemed like forever, we got sent to medical, where the one guy who had been to jail in la a bunch of times (and always gave an alias and a dead uncle's ssn at booking- smart guy) told us that the forms we gave us to give to the nurses were our ticket to not having to get shots or exams. ""take the top copy, the yellow one, and act like you're shitting. wipe your ass with that copy, but save the green paper, and just go to sleep in the back of the room. later tonight they will call out and see if anybody has been missed for cell assignment and that's when you get up and give them the green form, you go right to cells with none of the government health checks.""... we did, it worked, and we got sat on a bench and waited to be taken in groups to cells. i remember the movie they were showing on the monitors in medical was 'swat' with samuel l jackson. we were just like 'mother fuckers'.  up to this point, it really wasn't that bad. we were all still together, talking and fucking around waiting to see what was next. this is where everything got bad and we got to see just how fucked up jail is in california. they split all of us up and we each were assigned a cell in a different block. i was sent to 'c' something, and put in a cell that had 6 dudes in it, 2 beds, and a bunch of dirty mats on the floor with almost no light. one dude sort of spoke a little english, and told me to shut up and go to sleep. that's when i was like 'fuck this'. so i slept for what i thought was about 3 days, only to be woken up by a guard screaming my name along with other names i had never heard being told to 'line up', we were going to be on the 'green line'. i freaked the fuck out and asked everybody what the fuck was going on, why was i being taken somewhere else, etc, etc, and a mexican guy finally calmed me down a little by telling me ""you're going to be working, holmes, that's good"". i didn't believe him.   i got transferred to what i can only describe as an 'open dorm', like the rows of bunks you see in some of those pictures that op posted. hell, one of them could be the one i was in. i don't know. the walls were a pale shade, everybody had green jumps on, and the first thing they did was take the blue outfit i had and direct me to a large nazi looking motherfucker named 'turtle' because i didn't know how to answer the question ""what the fuck are you? are you a thriza? peckerwood? what?"" all i could muster was ""i'm a punker from the beach, sir."" apparently, that meant white, so now anytime i needed tp, toothbrush, pencil, anything at all, i got to ask this gigantic nazi motherfucker about it. not cool.   so after a day in this crowded dorm, which probably comfortably housed 150 guys but had 225 or so in it, i got to go bag breakfasts in the la county jail kitchen, all the way in the goddamn basement. i had a red mohawk at the time, and was smacked and harasses daily by a couple dickhead guards to 'cut the shit off my head'. i got beat up pretty good once in the chow line for muttering a 'fuck off' after my slap to the head.   i did run into a few other guys i got picked up with down there though, as we switched shifts and they came to clean and do whatever it was they did. didn't get to talk much, but enough to find out where most of us wound up. we were denied bail or bond at the first court hearing because we didn't have valid id when we got arrested and my pd was nice enough to inform the judge that most of us were probably a flight risk, so back to the dorms it was. it sucked shit for almost an entire month.  basically, we got lost in the system, forgot about, and it takes so long to get your case back to court out there from it being so backed up and overcrowded, that people just forget about you. we got arrested on dec. 3rd, and we got out on xmas eve, but it felt like an eternity. i ended up getting let out with a $300 fine for misdemeanor trespassing and vandalism and 'summary probation', which means ""don't get arrested again in la"" for 2 years. we all met up at the property center downtown, which was a bus ride since you're released from court in a white jumpsuit at the courthouse at lax with a bus token, and some people got the wrong stuff back, other people's clothes, money missing, etc, etc. my skateboard was missing, which sucked, but at least i got my own clothes and backpack returned. i left ca and moved to fl after that because i realized how fucked up a lot of law enforcement is out there, and i wanted to get a job using the degree i had earned just prior to my ca move with no further problems.  anyway, that's my experience with california jail.   tl;dr: don't go to jail in los angeles, shit sucks.",1,
539990,"the textbook i used for my computer organization class is ""essentials of computer organization and architecture"", by linda null and julia lobur. when i started my degree in cs, i was more or less under the impression computers internally had a series of gnomes who did my bidding because they liked me, and could change their mind at any moment. this book dispelled most of that.  mind you, it's not a particularly light read. it's intended to teach, not to give just a glimpse, so i don't know if it'll be good for just glancing over the material and getting an idea.  for operating systems, i used ""operating systems concepts"", by abraham silberschatz and peter b. galvin. there's also ""modern operating systems"", by andrew s. tanenbaum.",0,
807530,hands down the best online shooter of the year. and there's more to come! as for the complaints:    **optimization** - this is a true next-gen game that provides an experience that wasn't possible previously. any pc older than 2 years isn't going to cut it.    **free-2-play** - if you just want to check the game out or play a few hours a week when a friend is on then playing for free is completely viable. you'll just be limited in terms of variety. if this is going to be the main game you play then expect to pay at least $60 (regular price for new game) plus more for new content or if you want to speed up unlocks. it is typical in an mmo to require a lot of play time to unlock the things you want.    **glitches/balance issues** - i've never played an online game didn't have both of these in spades upon release. the important things to look at are frequency of updates and community interaction. soe have excelled at both (so far).,0,

917401,"what you skip or not is going to be dependant on the class you play, wether you play hc or not and if it's your first char/you're trying to race. this last part is especially important imo as for example you can run a few different classes through medecine chest/glyph to get certain spells ready so you can skip medecine on your main, it'll reduce your /played but overall it takes longer. it's still useful to get more than one spell in a particular list(for example getting summon zombie, phase run and firestorm/icespear/ek as a summoner)  generally i skip the beach besides hillock obviously, skip the first area besides a couple of packs to hit lvl 2, skip medecine chest if i don't need the spell(hailrake is annoying to kill and can even be dangerous on hc at lvl 2), skip mud flats entirely just doing the glyphs and skip fetid pool until i need respec points(like at lvl 30-40) and only start leveling in underground. i do the crab there for the skill point quest, it's easy enough and it helps reaching early important passives. then i run the ledge 3-4times to catch up on levels and then skip everything up to brutus. maybe kill a few packs here and there. then skip everything up to the coves, clear it like twice and go kill merveil by skipping the dungeons again. sometimes do the allflame, sometimes do it later, depends on the class, if i have summons i'll do it cause zombies are good at reducing the potential dmg from flicker mobs but if i'm like a on melee i'm not doing it until i'm like 18-20.  for act2 i don't care that much about skipping zones entirely and often stop to kill large group of mobs. however i start by going left first to the west forest, get the skill point quest there, kill alira, then go back and do weaver in the zone before, then i go to the other side, do the bandit and sins while skipping white beast and the church(sometimes clear fellshrine ruins up to the waypoint in church though for xp) and then go finish the game without skipping too much to have a comfortable level for vaal.  unless you're racing though it doesn't really make that much of a difference, you might take twice as long to level up but all in all leveling is still fairly fast(i mean when doing the on lvl content, after you start doing maps it slows down quite a lot due to the lvl difference).",0,

618740,"the sun shines brightly onto the emerald canopy of the teganze.  no eyes can pierce the thicket from above, the trees have kept their secrets for centuries.  his blowgun readied in his hand the witch doctor slowly leans around the tree watching his target. on the other side the abominable creature he was hunting slowly stalks through the teganze’s thick underbrush. the demon’s claws dig into the soft earth with every step as it makes its way towards the village drooling from the meal it is expecting. as he whispers a hex the witch doctor paints a small white symbol onto the bark of the tree. it glows with a dull white. he looks up to the branches where his apprentice waits. the green ceremonial paint and the armor made from blackened bones almost make him invisible against the tree but the witch doctor can still barely make him out between the leaves. two shadows move beside him, human corpses, sacrifices sewn into the shape of dogs, wolf skulls obtained from the traders affixed to their heads.  the witch doctor finds their presence calming. they are man-made and made from men, free of the influence of demons and unlike the spirits of the unformed land, bound to his control. he both respects and fears the spirits, their incomprehensible ways and inconsistent moods making him nervous despite his years of dealing with them. perhaps one day he would understand the unformed land as his elders understood it. he did  even so he would have to trust the spirits, just as his master had taught him decades ago, to support and to strengthen him for the coming battle.      he nods to his apprentice. both men vanish from this world. if one were to watch from just the right angle a glimpse of the after-image of a mask might be seen were they stood just a second ago. the dogs jump towards the demon, their strong legs breaking the branches they had rested on in the process. the skulls might not be the ones they lived with but they serve them well in death. strong sharp teeth dig into scales and flesh and hold on. the demon roars in pain as it strikes one of the dogs. the claws dig into its side, cutting skin, dried meat and scratch the ribcage but they bounce uselessly off the bones. death annihilates all pain and the dog’s bit does not weaken, instead its teeth dig deeper and deeper. the symbol the witch doctor has painted suddenly flashes with a bright light, as lips not made from flesh but spirit, in a world next to, but quite different from our own ,intonate another hex. the lower half of tree explodes sending wooden shrapnel into the bodies of the demon and the dogs. the crown falls. as it realizes it has been the trapped the demon lunges forward, trying to escape the falling tree. despite its size it is incredibly fast yet the dogs hold on, dead hands clawing at the dirt holding onto roots as their untiring jaws anchor them in the demon’s legs. the tree crashes down and buries the three of them.      the witch doctor and his apprentice reappear in a blue glimmer beside the carnage. the apprentice starts walking towards it but the older one holds him back. suspicion glittering in his eyes he reaches towards a small black leather bag on his belt, never letting his gaze wander from the place he last saw the demon. his hands vanish into the bag for a while until they finally produce a small skull, covered in strange pastes and potions. he calls upon the spirits and binds one of them to the skull the throws it towards the fallen tree. as it hits it bursts into flames that seem to take the shape of a screaming man before they expand and devour the rest of the tree. the two men watch the flames, waiting for a sign of life as the demon bursts forth from the flames. it is badly wounded, limping and bleeding but still very dangerous. they start running, splitting into different directions while screaming hexes of protection and pleading to the spirits for strength. locusts stream from the apprentices mouth covering the head and torso of the demon in venomous bites, causing it howl in pain. the witch doctor throws another skull, encasing the demon in fire and giving him time to mix two potions into a tiny flask in shaped like one of the sacred masks. he shouts the name of the spirit of decay and throws the flask high into the air. reality seems to rip with a thundering sound is heard as the bottle vanishes and reappears ten times bigger. the mouth of the stylized voodoo mask opens and green acid pours down onto the demon, dissolving the burned meat off of its burning body. the skeleton takes another few stumbling steps towards the witch doctor, driven by the otherworldly evil that still, even in death, clings to its bones. finally, it collapses.      surveying the carnage the witch doctor sighs. the demons wander deeper into the jungle every day and the effort and destruction needed to deter them grew bigger and bigger. it wouldn’t be long before the first of the witch doctors would return only as spirits from their hunts.      hidden behind meaty leaves, mighty trunks and thorns the village was safer than a castle. one day the demons would find their way in and the elders had prophesied that this day grew ever closer if nothing was done to prevent it. they spoke of omens, falling stars and devils. but tonight they would be safe once again.",0,

""  &gt;newsweek magazine observed: **""[s]egregation in the public schools has become a symbol of inequality . . . . it has also been a weapon of world communism.** now that symbol lies shattered.""  &gt;the press in western europe similarly applauded brown. le monde announced on its front page: ""this long-awaited judgment marks a victory of justice over racial prejudice, a victory of democracy . . . ."" the times of london hailed the decision as ""among the most important and far-reaching [the u.s. supreme court] has ever handed down."" the manchester guardian expressed ""immense relief"" that the united states had ""put behind it what has long been its worst reproach . . . ."" the swedish press (dagens nyheter) hailed brown as of signal importance, a liberal, humanitarian decision that contrasted with the stain senator joe mccarthy, at that very time, had placed on american democracy. south of our border, the municipal council in san paulo, brazil cheered brown as ""establishing the just equality of the races, essential to universal harmony and peace.""  &gt;in africa, coverage was extensive. a dispatch from the american consul in dakar, senegal reported that the decision was ""greeted with enthusiasm in french west africa although the press [there] has expressed some slight skepticism over its implementation."" afrique nouvelle, a weekly paper, reported on brown under this headline: ""at last! whites and blacks in the united states on the same school benches."" black members of kenya's legislative council expressed the hope that their country would follow suit:      &gt;""here in kenya we are supposed to create one nation of all races. if we are not educated together, we will live in fear of one another. if we are to stay together forever, why should we have separate schools? children will learn to know each other intimately in the same schools and fear will disappear.""

448918,"okay, a stupid abortion opinion.  i'm assuming what i think is the general view for each side of the debate, pro-choice or pro-life.  specifically, i think most pro-choicers agree with roe v. wade that all abortions before the third trimester should be legal.  and on the other side that most pro-lifers, motivated by religion, believe that a soul gets magically inserted into a fetus at conception.  (i think this is fair to say generally, though i know some people have more varied opinions.)  first of all, a person who declares abortion ""murder"" is probably immovable on this point.  i think the best way to suss that out is to ask them what they believe should be the penalty for a woman who has an illegal abortion and for the doctor who performs it.  if they answer that the penalty should be the same as for murder, then the debate is probably pointless.  you can't prove they are wrong about a fetus having a soul.  the best you can do is try to convince them that they'll never win on abortion politically and maybe they should turn their attention to a fight they can actually win.  you can *try* to convince them that we can't legislate based on religious belief, but that argument is going to go down the ""christian nation!"" shithole pretty fast.  if they answer anything less than whatever the penalty is for murder, then i assert that they do not genuinely believe that a fetus has the same value as a one month old baby.  now you've got some ground to work with.  the question now becomes a matter of what is more valuable morally, and you can get into all those rape and health of the mother questions.  but what's happened here with all this rape/health-of-the-mother debate?  pro-choicers are conceding ground just by arguing this point because they (generally) believe that abortion should be a choice no matter the circumstances.  what's the point of arguing this?  even if you win this argument, all you've done is convinced the pro-life person that we should make some exceptions for abortions.  that's fine, i guess, but it's not the pro-choice position.  so what the fuck is my point anyway?  my point is don't argue with them because you can't prove them wrong.  instead, try to find some common ground.  acknowledge, for example, that nobody could morally stomach seeing an eight-month fetus terminated for no reason, pro-life or pro-choice.  so pro-choicers also have a line they draw that says, ""this fetus is a person right here.""  pro-lifers simply put that line all the way at the beginning.  the common ground you can find is ways to prevent abortions that don't include making them illegal.  these are arguments that can be won on reasonable merits, like better sex education and availability of contraception.  the ""abortion is murder"" argument cannot be won, most of the time.",0,
897739,"so, i'm in the audience watching an opera. and i really need to pee. i ask someone where the bathroom is and they say ""london."". so i say, ""where's london?"" the tell me to go up the aisle, and take a left. so i do. and it's this grand opera house, though for some reason all the lights are on, even though the opera is going on. so i walk up the aisle, and come to these *massive* doors. but they are magnificently hung, because the guy dressed like a bellhop (an usher i guess) opens them without any effort to let me out. now i'm in this massive hallway with people dressed extremely soberly, as if it was a courthouse. they walk along quickly, in ones and twos, talking quietly with each other. i stop one, and ask ""where's london?"" he looks at me, vaguely horrified, and mutters ""down the hall, through the ballroom."" i can't tell if he's horrified about the thought of london, or about the fact that i was talking to him. so i jog down the hallway, with my socks flopping around, (i'm wearing tube socks as if they were ankle socks. old habit from my childhood. i hated having the seams under my toenails.) and i find the ballroom. and there's a fancy ball going on. and there's a massive staircase in the middle of the room, with uniformed men (again, similar to a bellhop uniform) seemingly guarding the stairs. so i climb the outside of the stair, along the handrail, and jump over it when i get to the top. then i open the door at the top of the stairs, and, though it seems to be another room, it opens on the bottom of a hill, with cobblestone streets, and a stereotype of late 1800's london. so, i go running along the streets, and eventually spot a sign advertising restrooms. i go up, the man behind the window tells me it's ""tuppence fer usin' the shitter"" luckily, the woman who told me about the bathrooms had given me some change, for some weird reason. (said woman was a random stranger, i knew with complete conviction.) so, i paid the man, went in, did my business, and came out. (did not wet the bed, fortunately.) now for some reason i was running away from a gang of street urchins, took a bunch of turns and managed to get them all run over by a large car. during the time while i was just walking around exploring, before i got chased by urchins, i bought a meat pie from a street vendor - who, upon reflection was probably named dibbler. - and i also noticed that there were cars driving around, with weird advertising on them. then, after escaping the urchins, the city was this weird dystopia, and it turned out that the yogscast had become a massive corporation that ruled the city. and i'm running around, escaping their ad-cars, searching desperately for something. it turns out that the thing i was searching for was an underground fighting tournament, which due to some weird logic, i accidently entered. the first fight was with my own shadow, and it took me about ten minutes, with the audience booing and jeering because nothing was happening to figure out that i had to get the spot lights angles just right so that there were four of him, then make them knock each other out. it worked perfectly. the next fight was a brawl, with me, warrick davis, the coroner from the wizard of oz, alan rickman on acid, and an extremely drunk goat wearing a cape. so, i kick the coroner in the balls, and grab the wicked witch's certificate of death, which i then use to beat up alan rickman into the ground. during this time warrick davis has subdued the goat, stolen it's cape, and, using the goat as a mount, comes riding towards me wielding one of the goats beer bottles as a mace. i dive to the side, and the coroner, who was about to attack me from behind, gets smashed in the face by warricks beer bottle, then trampled by the goat. now it was down to me vs warrick, who is riding a a drunk goat (who, it should be noted is a very, very, angry drunk) while wearing a black cape, while dual wielding a beer bottle, and a small lance, which was thrown to him from the audience. so, as he comes charging at me, i jump over him and run to the other side of the arena. i pick up alan rickmans unconscious body, and use it as a shield against warricks next charge. he gets impaled on the lance, and i receive a glancing blow with the beer bottle, but the goat breaks a leg, and warrick gets thrown off. the crowd is going wild, cheering on warrick, who is the obvious favorite to win. we stop circling each other and charge. i block a flurry of blows from warricks beer bottle with the certificate of death, see an opening, and smack him in the face with it. he's left dazed. i then take a run up, and punt him into the lance sticking out of rickmanm who is just coming to and moaning in pain. it just barely cuts along his side before his head snaps back into rickmans nose, driving it into his brain, killing him, and leaving warrick unconscious. the judge comes out, and says that i am disqualified for dwarf punting, which it turns out was a rule painted on the wall, along with no pissing on other competitors, and no texting while in the ring. the goat is declared the winner, since he was the last one left conscious, though in great pain due to his broken leg. then, suddenly, while mr. rogers is awarding the goat his prize, white ad-cars smash in, and i run away. next i remember, i'm wandering around this dystopian city, dodging the adcars, when i find someone who is willing to explain the the history of the city. it turns out that youtube somehow gained massive amounts of power, broke away from google, and gave different cities to random youtubers to rule. pewdiepie ruled the northeastern us, totalbiscuit the mid atlantic, the various members of the yogscast the uk, and machinima mexico and some parts of south america. google owned most of asia, canada, and europe, while australia maintained their independence somehow. the old man explaining this all to me thought the method if their independence was probably dropbears. then the adcars came and ran over the man telling me about all of this, and i was off searching for something again. i wander around, and end up back in non-dystopian london, get asked by a man building a roof if i wanted work for the day, to which i said yes, and i spent about five hours building a roof. the man then paid me, and i was off again. i bought another pie from the man that was probably dibbler, and went back to searching, this time i realised that i was looking for a pineapple, because that would let me get back and finish watching the opera, which for some reason i knew had paused the moment i left the room, and the only way to rescue the nice old lady who had directed me to the bathroom was to go back and finish watching, otherwise the entire audience and actors would remain forever frozen in time. so, i'm off searching for a pineapple. as i wander around, i spot one of the urchins from before, and i ask him where i can find a pineapple. he tells me there is a fruit market up the street, but that pineapples are in such short supply that they costs large amounts of money. so i go up the street, and find the one man who is selling pineapples, and he's dressed in a full pimpsuit. broad brimmed purple hat, trimmed with white and black stripped fur, gold plated cane, the works. he tells me that his pineapples are $1274.99 each, but that if i can get him the license plate of an adcar, he'll lower it to $300, which happens to be just a little bit less than what i had earned building that roof. i agree to his proposal, and slowly work my way back towards the dystopia, only wondering once i looked up in surprise that i had entered it why he knew about that place and the adcars when noone else did. so i'm wandering around, and spot a solo adcar, sneak up behind it and try to pull off the license plate. but it's held onto the car by dwarf screws!^^(tm) having no idea what the hell those are, i gave up and went in search of someone who could tell me what they were. after wandering around for a long time in the ever shifting city, i stumble upon the drunk goat. he greets me cautiously, apparently completely sober, and asks how i got away from the arena. i explain that i wasn't quite sure myself, and asked him what dwarfscrews!^^(tm) were. he explains that they are proprietary hardware produced by a race of dwarves that lived in tunnels underneath the english channel. the only way to either tighten them, or remove them is to be a dwarf, ensuring that they have business as long as anyone uses them. i thank the goat, and enquire about his leg, he tells me that it's fine, waving a cast around. ""it'll be as good as new in a week or two. was a clever move, using rickman as a shield there. too bad you punted warrick, this prize would have been yours"" he said, pulling a remote control toy car out of his cape. i went off looking for a dwarf while he was playing with it. after a while of searching, i heard a screech from above, and got knocked down onto the road by a sudden weight. someone proceeded to try to slam my head against the ground, but i rolled over and pinned him. it turned out warrick davis was out for revenge for my punting him. after a short conversation, i proposed a deal, to split a pineapple with warrick if he helped me get an adcar plate. he agreed, so we wandered off together trying to find an adcar by itself. it took quite some time, but eventually we found one, and warrick removed the dwarfscrews!^^(tm). together we went back to the pineapple merchant, and gave the man the license plate for the pineapple. we cut it in half, and each enjoyed a few slices together. i bid a fond farewell to warrick, and started asking around where the bathroom was, since that was the only way i knew to get back to the doors.  once back at the doors, i bribed each bellhop with a slice of pineapple, and went back through the ballroom, and the sober hall, where they seemed startled, and into the auditorium, where i watched the rest of the opera. and then i woke up.",0,

889277,"i'm currently mulling over a theory that involves velka finding the true dark lord born among men and trying to protect him/her from the gods who would not want the age of fire to end.   velka pitys humanity and sees fit that as the godess of sin that no one should be executed for committing sinning but instead be urged to confess their sins and seek inner enlightenment where as gwyndolin sees fit force humanity into submission to honor his father's sacrifice to continue the age of fire. velka's understanding of the true potential of humanity leads her to embrace the the dark and seek to fulfill the prophecy of the dark lord, and the dark lord does arise but its not you. a child is found who is born with the ability of lifehunt/lifedrain (the power of the true dark lord) and manipulate humanity in the same way is taken in by velka to protect her from gwyndolin until he/she is of age to lead humans into the age of man. velka wants to save humanity from its own mortality because the only reason humans are mortal to begin with is to feed the flame an infinite source of humanity. its possible that the undead curse was created in the first place to starve the flame of its source of humanity since undead will use the humanity on themselves instead of letting it be harvested and used to kindle flames.  its these two battling ideals that cause the gods to split apart and those who did not choose a side to flee just to get away from the conflict. its possible that the first born who destroyed the annals and was banished for doing so sided with velka and the annals were actually the book of the guilty since he did not want to see gwyndolin murdering humans for any action against the gods.  don't believe that gwyndolin and velka are at war? lets looks at some facts:  -velka's talisman scales with int but casts miracles while the darkmoon catalyst scales with faith but casts magic spells  -the pardoners of velka listen to sinners and urge them to better themselves where as the darkmoon knights only want to execute sinners.  -both gwyndolin and velka miracles have black and purple auras  -the painted world is full of velka/occult/gwyndolin related items; the pardoner set, velkas rapier, souvenirs of reprisal, dark ember and the red sign soapstone.   -the devs said that the crow people are the delusional and transformed followers of velka and they drop souvineres of reprisal which means that in the eyes of gwyndolin they are sinners.  -the impaled people in the painted world are impaled on spears with crescent moon  shapes on them.  -velka's miracles mimic the nature of her pardoners in that they only act in defense where as gwyndolin's miracles are offensive  -the rings of sacrifice created in a ritual of velka keep people from dying and any form of immortality is a sin to the church.  -velkas fall to the dark is represented by her two different rings of sacrifice, one is white and the other more powerful one is black/purple.  -as we've seen, the character beatrice was originally a child and her concept art features her catalyst leaking a black smoke suggesting she knew dark magic. and the witch set is covered in crow feathers and we know that the crow is highly associated with velka. the witch set also describes beatrice in the same exact words as other item descriptions describe velka. it makes more sense that the child beatrice is what the player was originally supposed to find at the end of the painted world and not priscilla however the devs did say that priscilla has the power of lifehunt (which she doesn't in any sense) so they were trying to repurpose her role to make up for a lack of time to complete the velka side of the lore. the statue in the painted world doesn't even feature the child having a tail like priscilla, the statue also has the eyes black out like the child beatrice also has and there are black strands of hair going down the face of the person holding the child and item descriptions constantly say over and over again that velka has black hair, its the only fucking statue in the game that has its hair colored.   in new londo, the city of the undead they have the same exact statue everywhere of what i think we can presume is velka, they praised her for her kindness towards humanity where everyone else thought they were abominations she supported them and didn't think they had to die to feed some fire just so a bunch of gods can hold their positions.  i believe that there was supposed to be a third even harder to find ending where you discover the child beatrice and she tells you the actual truth. the game is clearly unfinished but the good news is that from the trailer of ds2 the next game is going to have atleast some focus on the velka side of the lore.  also i think my theory needs some editing. here are some related pics:  http://imgur.com/a/o84qx  edit: more evidence of the child in the painted world being a dark lord is the fact that she pulls you into the painted world in the same way manus (the original holder of the dark soul) pulls you into the past, you have the doll, an object she longs for in the same way that manus longed for his pendant.",0,

648011,"well, i was referring specifically to comments on reddit, but i appreciate the feedback.  however, if your anecdotal evidence of 'that one guy you know' is relevant, then all the other context out there is even more relevant.  so i encourage you to conduct a broader survey, through whatever means you choose.  i still think historical context matters, even if i at times find it cumbersome.  for example, there is nothing inherently racist about a hangman's noose, but hang one from a tree in your frontlawn in the american south and ask your neighbors how they feel about it.    i could call you a ""stupid dirty ape"" because i think you're unevolved, but that term might be a more loaded for some races.  from: http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/caricature/  &gt;social scientists refer to words like nigger, kike, spic, and wetback as ethnophaulisms. such terms are the language of prejudice – verbal pictures of negative stereotypes. howard j. ehrlich, a social scientist, argued that ethnophaulisms are of three types: disparaging nicknames (chink, dago, nigger, and so forth); explicit group devaluations (""jew him down,"" or ""niggering the land""); and irrelevant ethnic names used as a mild disparagement (""jewbird"" for cuckoos having prominent beaks or ""irish confetti"" for bricks thrown in a fight)(ehrlich, 1973, p. 22; schaefer, 2000, p. 44). all racial and ethnic groups have been victimized by racial slurs; however, no american group has suffered as many racial epithets as have blacks: coon, tom, savage, picanniny, mammy, buck, sambo, jigaboo, and buckwheat are typical.3 many of these slurs became fully developed pseudo-scientific, literary, cinematic, and everyday caricatures of african americans. these caricatures, whether spoken, written, or reproduced in material objects, reflect the extent, the vast network, of anti-black prejudice.  at best, it depends on context, like most things.  when /u/solomonkull says ""fucking savages"" to indiscriminately refer to a group of people, i consider that the worst context.  surely someone who is a self-proclaimed ""anti-racist"" would take that into consideration.  calling others ""savage"" is the language of (mostly white) imperialism, not of an anti-racist.  ""savages,"" in the broadest sense, has been used by dominant cultures as a means to dehumanize and subjugate other cultures for centuries.   thats all i am trying to say.  to stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that fact makes me question a person's motives.  that there are ""correct"" ways to use the terms doesn't much matter to me in a case like this.   and aside from all that, it still absolutely did not contribute anything to the discussion.  do you see where i am coming from?  tl;dr: don't take anti-racism lessons from /u/solomonkull.  one can find a much better teacher.",1,

395085,"100% of my personal shooting is film, ever since i got hooked into photography 5+ years ago.  for school, i made it through 95% of all my photo classes shooting entirely film, occasionally some digital was shot if the deadline was up and i botched my film shots.  i also do alternative processes  i prefer film because i love the workmanship involved.  from start to finish i'm involved in the entire process.  when i complete and frame a print, i admire it, akin to what i think a woodworker would do.      i actually find digital much harder and i hate, no loathe, when a digital camera tells me i can't do something (e.g. autofocus doesn't work, the exposure isn't correct, etc).  also it seems that because a vast majority of digital photographers overprocess their work, you have to spend a lot more time editing digital to make it appealing compared to another digital print.  film gets the advantage of the inherit characteristics of the particular film you shot, the paper it was printed on, or the chemical process you used.      i shoot with a 4x5 speed graphic, zero image 4x5 pinhole, pentax 6x7, pentax spotmatic (35mm), and just recently picked up a agfa 5x7 field camera",0,

432248,"the next half-an-hour is a haze in my memory. all i can remember is me shrieking with joy, him laughing, and the smell of peaches, lemon grass and mint. the sky was a blissful azure with wisps of clouds, the walls of the maze a weathered black granite covered with moss and vines, and green meadows in the morning sunshine spread far and wide all around. we were running on walls, jumping off ramps and vaulting great heights, all assisted by the adjusted gravity. once, i turned around a corner to find him pumping the soaker. he had taken off his now very wet t-shirt. i took the opportunity to splatter him well and good, before he tried to grab me. we were all covered with the gel and our own sweat by now. i was giggling and shrieking, trying to get away, wrestling with him on the grass. finally, i managed to squirm out his embrace, he made a final clutch at my legs and grasped a hold on my shorts.   unthinkingly, i slipped out of them, ran a few paces and turned around to see if he was following me. then, i realised that i was naked from ribs to ankles, with only my sports bra covering my torso and shoes on my feet. i must have looked ridiculous. but, parth was switching his gaze between the shorts his hand and me. he had a look of uncertainty wavering between horror and amusement. he must have been thinking whether i was displeased or if i had planned this. he looked angelic with the soft morning sun kissing his glistening chiselled copper torso, covered only by some shorts and marred cruelly by some old scars. to clear up his doubts, i kicked off my shoes, took off the bra and tossed it at him. that had him chasing me again with a look of lust on his face.   after what seem like a long and happy hour, where i was captured a few more times, and had escaped thanks to my complete and slippery nakedness, i was out of breath due to the laughing and shouting, and my soaker was empty. my aim was good and i had landed a lot of good shots. i sat out down wearily, leaned my back against a maze wall, and closed my eyes. i felt the light on my eyelids change and the wall behind me disappeared. i rolled onto my back softly and opened my eyes. the sky was turning dark and stars were coming out. parth came and stood over me. ""i like your game"", he said smiling. my face broke into a grin. he emptied the soaker over me, sending me into another fit of giggles. i opened my arms in invitation and he accepted.   he kissed me softly, barely brushing my lips and pulling back to stare into my eyes with those black obsidian eyes. i stared back at my own face reflected in those eyes; my pale face, blue eyes and short brown hair. the pause lengthened, before long i couldn't take it any more and plunged back into the kiss myself. he explored my body with my his hands and mouth. i felt his hands gliding over my thighs, my back and my nape. he ruffled my hair and kissed me again suckling at my lips and fondling my breasts. all the while, i explored his body with my hands, tracing the contours of his body and feeling the contorting muscles as he moved over me. he began to move down my neck kissing, sliding his hands down and up my body easily, aided by the sweet smelling lubricant.    suddenly, i realised i couldn't feel the ground any more, startled i pushed him away, but grabbed him back and clutched on to him, when i saw that we were floating in a black void. there were no more meadows or walls, only black space punctuated by colourful stars and planets. they were floating by us and around us, shimmering like fireflies and weightless like dust motes. i reached out and touched one of those glowing globes and it flattened against my palm. on closer examination, these were globules of the same lubricant with the aphrodisiac blend of scents. the room was running on his specs now. ""i like your game"", i said smiling. he grinned, and buried his face between my breasts, his day-old stubble digging into my skin and making me moan. he made his way, kissing and nuzzling over my stomach, downwards to between my legs.   we were falling through a black emptiness, spinning and tumbling, with warm globules of lube pelleting us, smearing us with their sweet slimy goodness. as he worked between my legs, i clenched my thighs around his head and crossed my legs, anchoring myself firmly on to him. then, tentatively i untangled my fingers from his soft wet black hair, raised my arms over my head, arched my back and splayed my fingers trying to catch the shining spheres. distant galaxies and nearby nebulae glided past us. i was overflowing with passion. my moans escaped with joy into the emptiness. tiny wet planets and warm suns splattered themselves on my face, belly and breasts, tickling me, while shudders ran through my body. i was exhilarated as i gazed around with disbelief, i bit my lips to stop myself from my clenching my eyes shut from the overwhelming sensation rising from the between my legs. we were like those old gods from the infancy of humankind, in the moment of creation.   the throes of passion rose to their peak, the shudders turned into heaves. warmth flowed from my crotch towards everywhere, down my thighs over my calves and up my stomach through my chest into the tips of my breasts. hurriedly, i pulled in my arms, curled over, clenched my thighs harder and grabbed on to him. heaves were followed by heaves, punctuated by my loud uninhibited moans, until all that was left was the sound of my raspy breathing. parth climbed over my body and kissed me. i broke away and buried my face in the crook of his neck. i held him close, trembling slightly, breathing in contently wafts of his smell and the scent of peaches, lemon grass and mint.  we floated around for a while, in quiet and naked bliss, before i realised his hardness was pressing against my thighs through his shorts. i nibbled at his neck to stir him and climbed down his body to pull down the shorts. i tossed them and they fell away into the darkness. i ran my hands over my breasts and stomach, gathering the oily wetness. then, i ran my hands over his throbbing and warm stiffness. i ran my hands over his thighs and back, and his chest, gathering more, and pouring and smearing them over his loin. i encircled his waist with my legs, crossing them on the other side and pulled him in close, pressing his hot throbbing hardness against my shaved mound. he began to explore my body again, and i surrendered to his probing.  he caressed my thighs, pressing me closer, ran his hands over my back. he kissed me, with his tongue sliding across my lips into my mouth and mine into his. he licked my neck and kneaded my breasts. he dragged his wet lips over my areolae  and nibbled at the tips. i moaned in ecstasy and my face was flushed. i drank in every sensation, every touch was magnified as if my nerve endings had been scrubbed by a file. i was dripping wet, and his hot stiffness was grinding and sliding against my mound, spreading a new warmth through me. his hands were grabbing me harder, my nails were digging into back, and my teeth were clenched. i leaned towards his ear and rasped, ""i want it in.""   i felt the weightless disappear and the ground rising to meet us. we were in a feather bed on a tropical beach, small foamy waves lapped against the white sand softly and a slight warm breeze was blowing in from the ocean. he kissed me again, looked at me and asked, ""you ready?"" i nodded slightly. he went on his knees, laid me down gently, parted my legs and slid softly inside me. thrusts came in waves, slow and gentle in the beginning, but rising steadily, reaching higher. each wave broke over my spine, spreading a glowing warmth from my groin and sending a slight shudder through me. i was looking at him working over me, the broad brown chest with its scars, beads of sweat and all, glistening with a silver sheen in the milky moonlight. he ran down his hands from my neck, over my breasts, down my belly and back up over my ribs, where finally they rested cupping my breasts.  the waves of thrusts had risen into tall breakers, making me arch my back and dig my fingers into the bed. he was fondling and kneading my breasts, i lay helpless under the assault. the waves kept coming, bigger and stronger, thrashing themselves over my body and soul. each wave was followed my a moan of mine. until, the dam broke, and i was consumed by an intoxicating ecstasy mingled with relief. my chest heaved high, my back arched harder, thrusting my pelvis up towards him. a soft shriek of me pierced the sloshing murmur of the surf. a sweet weariness filled me and i shuddered several times, breathing in short and deep gasps. there were warm tears welling at the corner of my eyes and i was looking at the stars through the watery haze.  he came and lay down beside me. i felt his big arm slide underneath my back and rolled me over on top of him, easily as if i were a rag-doll. i lay over his chest, breasts pressed against him, covering him like a blanket, listening to his heartbeats, rising and falling like a wave myself with his breaths. with my cheek flat on his breastbone, i stared across the beach and over the ocean. i smiled as i recognised the constellations. i looked at him and he smiled back knowingly. i laid down my head again. after an unknown period of bliss, i fell asleep, nestled against him, gazing at the distant blue light of aquila, our next destination, our next hope.  **** 2145+           841+2145=2986+  (typed and counted on vim.)",0,

392283,"waking up on a deserted island was never preferred but it was better than waking up dead. i had been wandering with the “wrong crowds” for a few years and so it wasn’t exactly a surprise when they didn’t take the news that i was leaving well. i was bored and wanted to spice up my life, of course as i look out into the endless ocean, i realize that i probably should’ve handled it more delicately.   i gather firewood and coconuts from every tree. i’m not the outdoorsy type of girl so when a large mosquito lands on my arm, i scream dropping all my coconuts. i pick them all up and hurry to the campsite a little more hesitant on how i’m going to be able to survive. i make a small umbrella tent consisting of two sticks and a few really big leaves so if it rains, i won’t get completely soaked.   i groan as my legs ache in pain; i wasn’t prepared for my surprise island getaway and was still sore from yesterday’s adventures as a bandit. i walk along the beach whining at every step aloud.  “oh yes, i would love to be stranded on an island. thanks god, i bet i really deserved this one. stupid friends, stupid beach, stupid life! ugh!” i shout as i tread in the white sand.  “that makes one of us,” a male voice muses causing me to jump back fearfully.  he lounges out on a log with a wide smile laughing at my misery. he is dressed like a businessman with black pants and a green shirt that is only a little darker than his eyes. his hair is dark brown and he looks like he had been tanning.   “who are you?” i ask surprised holding a coconut as a weapon.  he looks at the coconut and then puts his arms up mockingly in defense, “whatever you say just don’t throw a coconut at me,” he laughs.  i roll my eyes and drop the coconut, “who are you?” i repeat.  he smiles, “i’m prince charming.”  i roll my eyes and push him into the log causing him to trip and fall onto the sand. he groans and gets up slowly with his arms up in defense. he looks at me cautiously and then grabs a paper from his pocket and hands it to me. i glance at it suspiciously and see nothing important about it. he gestures for me to look at it more closely and then i realize what i’m looking at; it’s a picture of me.   “how do you have my picture?” i ask threatening to rip it up.   a serious look comes across his face, “don’t you dare!” he shouts drawing a gun.  i drop the picture in fear staring down the barrel of the gun and he picks it up and brushes it off with a smile.  “you look awful spooked. you should build a fire, it’s going to get dark soon,” he says with a smile.  “why would i do that? you have a perfectly functional fire going right here,” i say sitting down.  he shakes his head, “my lover is the jealous type, she’ll rip your head off.”  i chuckle and reply, “i think i can take her.”   he looks at me amused, “i bet you can,” he says looking at the picture.  i take a deep breath and try a gentle approach, “have we met? why is my picture important?” i ask.  he grins, “you’re not particularly important. you’re too young and still have to grow up a little. don’t worry we’ll eventually marry and live happily ever after.”  i laugh, “and then we get separated and you get stuck on this island.”  he nods and chuckles too, “fate is a funny thing. why are you here darling?”   i roll my eyes, “my friends deserted me when i said i wanted to leave.”  his eyes light up with excitement, “the pirates! how are they? of course you’re in your pirate days, you look like a bandit!”   i shake my head, “i am not a pirate!”   he laughs, “then why’d they make you walk the plank? you are an adorable pirate!” he gushes.  i blush and shout, “stop it!”   he continues to test my patience, “why? you are an absolutely adorable pirate! with your tough faces and coconuts and lovely campsite!”   i groan and then look at him seriously, “when did you see my campsite?”  he looks up a little surprised and then nods, “you always are an observant thing, just like your mother. i actually work all day rather than sleeping in until i feel like it so i saw it before you woke up for the day,”  i shake my head, “what are you talking about? i washed up on shore! i was incapacitated!” i shout.  he laughs at me again muttering, “temper, temper.”   i roll my eyes and stare at the fire, “how do i get off this island?” i ask quietly as my brain reminds me that my days were limited as long as i was on this island.  he must see the fear in my eyes because he says, “i’m sure you’ll think of something. just relax and enjoy the night. are you cold?”  i look at him surprised at his concern and nod. he takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders.   “don’t get too worried now. you’re safe here, it’s not like there’s any pirates here or anything,” he jokes with a smile.   i nod and ask, “if you know me in the future, then why’re you here right now?”   he nods for a second contemplating his answer and then says, “i needed to take care of something here.”  i nod and he elaborates, “i’m babysitting for a bit while my friend sets something special up for later.”  i nod and respond, “oh. wait- babysitting? are you ‘babysitting’ me?”   he smiles pompously, “don’t worry just for the night. it’ll be worth it in a few years’ time.”  i roll my eyes, “are you serious? why? how do you even get the whole time travelling ability?”  he laughs, “i tried to fix you but you ended up corrupting me. now we’re both bandits.”  i look up worriedly and reply, “i’m not a bandit anymore.”   he nods, “of course you’re not a pirate but lately our hobby on the weekends is being time bandits.”  i laugh until i realize he’s serious, “wait on the weekends? what are our day jobs?  he replies, “nothing too special but we hire a baby sitter on the weekends.”  i recoil at the thought of having children of my own and he chuckles.  he teases, “exhibit a on why you still need to grow up a little more.”   i shake my head, “i’ll be a horrible mother!” i say.  he shakes his head, “surprisingly no. it actually comes very naturally, just don’t worry about it.”   i close my eyes trying to envision myself as a regular doting mother and drift off to sleep. in the morning, i am awoken by a cold bucket of water and an energetic early riser as an island mate.  “time to set sail lass!” he shouts in his best pirate accent.  “go away,” i say sternly trying to ignore my every impulse to kill him.  he pulls me up, “nope! come on, rise and shine! let’s get off this island!” he yells in my ear.  i groan and follow him to a large pirate ship docked on the island. he leads me to a small room and instructs me to stay put until he comes back with some complex warning about paradoxes. he comes back in a half hour later with a bagel.  “who wants breakfast?” he asks eagerly throwing it into my lap.  i thank him trying to pretend i wasn’t dozing off again.  he smiles and says, “i’m going to drop you off at your home. sometime in the near future, you are going to have a stroke of good luck, you’re welcome. by the way, we’ll be meeting soon i suggest you be nice! be entertaining and clever, maybe you should try a riddle or something.”   i munch on my bagel content, “like what?” i ask with my mouth still full.   he thinks for a minute and then weaves a tale:  “there is a doctor who has cured thousands of patients and is world renowned but there is also a simple taxi driver who makes sure to greet every one of his passengers throughout the day. they are both absolutely smitten by a young beautiful girl named sarah. one day the taxi driver discovers that he must leave the state to visit an ill family member for a week and gives sarah seven apples. why?”  i look at him perplexed and ask, “why?”  he smiles, “an apple a day keeps the doctor away.”  i roll my eyes and laugh, “what’s with all the details about the famous doctor and the simple driver?”   he smiles, “it’ll keep us talking for a little while longer.”  i shake my head and he looks out the window, “we’re almost at the beach near your house.”  i look out the window too, “how that’s impossible?!”   he chuckles, “i’m a time bandit; i can manipulate any time i want within reason.”  i smile and nod and he signals for me to follow him upstairs. the ship docks and he escorts me off still teasing me the entire way. i wave goodbye as the boat begins to set sail again and i stare when a familiar face walks up to my former island mate and kisses him on the cheek. you never expect to see yourself wave goodbye but i wasn’t at all sad; i was excited for my future and what was coming.",0,

492265,"i hated seeing her like this.  the sickness only got worse even as she took more medicine.  little of the passing sunlight made it through the drawn blinds to our small room, but i could feel the day slipping away while i watched her sleep.  i looked down at my claws, as red as after any fight.  how long had it been?  we didn't even qualify to stay at pokemon centers anymore.  instead we stayed in a tiny room in a section of castelia where even i feared what the humans might try.  riah didn't seem to care.  i approached the bed.  sweat drenched her thin top despite having the blankets thrown aside.  she looked pale and gaunt, a shell of her vibrant self.  two months had almost destroyed her.  i crept onto the bed, careful not to startle her awake – more of a hope that i could.  sometimes i could barely wake her at all.  her chest rose in shallow breaths.  every day i feared that she may just stop and never wake again.  i bent to lick a drop of sweat from her sunken cheeks and attempted to nudge her awake.  “zorrr,” i rumbled in a low voice close to her ear.  other humans found my harsh tone intimidating, but riah never had.  nothing.  this time, i spoke in her language.  “riah.”  i still remembered the first time i let her hear me try it.  riah's eyes bulged, and she stopped dead in the middle of the path.  “did you just say my name?” and her face split into a wide smile.  she slammed into me in a fierce hug, laughing like a madwoman.  “that's incredible.  how?”  i barely kept my feet, the nagging embarrassment at what i'd done quickly vanishing before her embrace.  she relented, twinkling eyes a mirror of her bubbly stance.  “they didn't know what they'd done when they gave you to me.  you're incredible.”  i glowed at her praise.  riah mumbled without opening her eyes.  “del?”  she tried to brush me away, but her hand didn't have the strength behind it, and my soft coat rebuffed her.  “what do you want?”  “eat.”  i rarely spoke entire sentences.  single words were usually enough, and riah always understood me, even before i could speak the human language.  she sighed as if she hadn't spent the last day and a half in bed.  “there's some food for you in my pack.  don't have to ask.”  i growled softly.  “you.”  she opened her vacant eyes this time and blinked against the darkness.  “i'm not hungry.”  during our rise to fame, other humans had fawned over riah.  now her long black hair lay about her in tangles.  not enough light entered the room to shine off her days-unwashed locks.  even her familiar scent smelled stale.  “besides, there's nothing.  what's left is for you.”  she reached out with a trembling hand along the wall, feeling for the light-switch.  i flipped it on.  “you eat.”  riah cringed against the wan light.  “i said it's yours.  you need to eat too.  besides, i told you, i'm not hungry.”  illness hadn't taken her stubbornness.  “wait.”  i leaned down to lick her face once more before rising.  riah's small satchel remained empty from the last time i'd done this, and i took the room key from the table.  i looked back before leaving.  “shower.”  riah had managed to prop herself up on her elbows, facing the bedsheets.  she panted, looking ready to vomit.  a small grunt was her only reply.  once outside the room, i wrapped myself in an illusion so others wouldn't notice me.  the key and lock were awkward to operate with claws, but i managed.  leaving riah alone even for a short time put me on edge.  i wouldn't dare leave her alone with the door unlocked, not in this place.  the same yellowing lights illuminated the hallway, and the air smelled of mold and sweat.  i hated this place, but riah didn't have the money for anything else.  pokemon centers offered rooms to trainers, but we lost our eligibility, and castelia had more people than rooms at the best of times.  even her illness didn't give them an exception.  dusk had fallen outside, and i scanned the empty street expectantly.  despite my invisibility, the humans that braved this area at night made the most savage pokemon i'd known seem tame.  just a block from our hotel i saw a human stab another.  they might not have claws or powers, but they made up for it with wicked blades that put any claw or fang to shame.  the human died while i watched from the shadows.  the attacker didn't hesitate to leave the man for dead.  most of the city wasn't like this.  i hurried, anxious to return to riah.  the store i chose had aisles upon aisles of food.  riah explained the concept of money to me plenty of times.  i understood its use, but not its purpose.  why didn't someone help her?  they could.  no number of humans could eat all of the food that lined dozens of shelves.  why would they refuse to help one of their own?  why would the doctors turn her away, only trade her medicine for money?  couldn't they see she just needed to recover.  then we could fight again, earn the money they wanted.  i forced my fists to unclench.  i let those questions fuel a growing hatred for a species i once marveled at.  not all of them deserved disgust.  riah had gave me everything.  she at least deserved my awe.  i didn't take much.  some foods humans would only eat after cooking.  i couldn't, and riah didn't any longer.    fresh cut meats sat behind a glass barrier.  riah pulled me by the wrist through the crowded store, heedless of the disapproving glances the other shoppers shot at us, me in particular.  none of the other humans had pokemon out with them, and my large mane tended to brush against people.  she stopped before a section displaying various cuts of meat and fish.  the display radiated cold air – a chill that carried the tangy scent of fresh blood.  my mouth watered.  riah spoke with a man at the counter.  he wore white and carried a vicious wedge of metal with a razor-sharp edge.  riah called them employees.  the one she spoke with retreated behind thick plastic door-coverings.  i leaned close to riah's ear, wary of the humans.  “others.”  “ignore them.  there's no rule against bringing you here.  they're just jealous of your good looks.”  she rubbed the top of my head affectionately, and the man returned.  “here you go.  the best cut we had on hand, just like you requested.”  he handed over a parcel that looked wrapped in white paper.  his eyes regarded me for a moment.  “that's a rare pokemon you have, well behaved.  you're riah, right?”  she winked at him.  “the one and only.  del here is amazing.”  only half of her attention was on the conversation however.  she cradled the parcel, eyes agleam.  she nudged me after peeling back the taped paper.  ribbons of fat spidered the dark slabs of meat, almost enough to make them look pink.  “one bite and you won't want to eat anything else for the rest of your life.”  a human walked into me.  i dodged away from the confused human who looked around for what he'd just ran into.  i'd lost myself looking through the clear barrier.  invisible or not, even the most distracted human would notice running into a solid object.  luckily, the man didn't make a scene and continued on with a  puzzled look.  invisibility made it easy to get in and out without needing money, and i took as little as possible to avoid suspicion.  bread, dried meat, some packaged pastries.  i took a single hondew berry.  they were her favorite.  i slipped through the exit and back onto the streets of castelia.  the eerie quiet gave an ominous feel to the journey, and i felt watched despite my illusion.  no one bothered me.  the lock to our room gave me a moment of trouble, but once inside, i was glad to hear the shower's loud patter.  humidity brought out the moldy smell, but at least riah dragged herself out of bed.  i placed riah's satchel next to the bed and entered the bathroom.  riah hadn't bothered to draw the plastic sheet, and a small pool of water had formed next to the tub.  i froze.  riah sat in the off-white tub with the water splashing across her body.  unmoving.  dead.  i don't remember moving through the intervening space.  i grabbed her shoulders, nicking her soft skin.  she bled.  the motion brought riah around, and she opened her eyes and spoke in a groggy voice.  the water had little effect on her.  “what are you doing?”  her chest rose and fell normally.  she sat up a little straighter.  relief and embarrassment vied equally for my attention.  “sorry.  food.”  i withdrew slightly, finally noticing the water soaking into my arms.  fur took forever to dry completely.  she grumbled something inaudible but leaned forward and gripped the sides of the tub.  her limbs looked so frail and atrophied.  she paused amidst the rushing water and brought a hand to forehead before slumping forward.  i turned off the water and grabbed the towel off the sink.  riah remained slumped, water rolling off her skin.  i dried her off the best i could while she sat in the tub, and helped her up.  she rest most of her weight on me as i dragged her to her feet.  i lifted her easily.  she me lead her to her bed, half stumbling along.  i laid her down on the lumpy mattress and crawled up next to her.  humans didn't have fur to keep them warm, probably why they didn't like being naked, and i hugged her limp body close to mine.  her naked skin felt balmy against me, but despite the heat of the shower and my mane covering her like a blanket, she shook in my arms.  water seeped into my fur from her damp hair.  i clung desperately to her, uselessly.  she refused to eat what little food we had because i might go hungry, even as she wasted away.  and i could do nothing to make her better.  i hated myself, and i clung to the only person i cared about, hoping that maybe tomorrow things would go back to how they were.",0,

308003,"when an officer gets in trouble for something there are two investigations. there is an administrative and criminal investigation. the administrative investigation is conducted by the departments internal affairs unit. you will be placed on paid leave while the administrative investigation takes place. this is to get the officer off the street while the investigation moves forward, but at the same time allows them to have a stream of money for bill, groceries, etc. while on leave you cannot leave your home. you are basically on house arrest. you have to be at the beck and call of the department everyday in case they want you to come in and answer questions. when you are questioned they  sit you in a room with the chief and several other high ranking police officers. you are read garrity. garrity is basically the opposite of miranda rights. under garrity you are required to answer all questions truthfully. if you refuse to answer a question or get caught in a lie you will be fired. however anything you say under garrity cannot be used against you in the criminal trial because it would violate your 5th amendment right against self incrimination. nothing found in the administrative investigation can be used against you in criminal court, however anything found during the criminal trial can be used against you in the administrative investigation. so the criminal investigation is usually done first, then the administrative afterwards. because the administrative is usually done after the criminal, that's why it often takes time for the firing to happen, because the firing won't happen until after the administrative. once the two investigations are complete, then the punishment is handed down if the charges are sustained. the media doesn't always follow up on the case, so all people read in papers is ""officer got in trouble, is on paid leave."" the administrative ""paid leave"" is just the beginning. the punishment can range from nothing, to firing, to being indicted by a grand jury and spending the next 30 years in prison.",0,

344187,"&gt;in context, how could a few men trained in the deserts of the middle east capture an entire plane with boxcutters,   this is the fault of you being young; you cannot recall a world where hijackers would generally take over a plane, demand money, and then let the hostages go.  before 9/11 that was standard operating procedure and completely explains how they did it: the people on board did not resist because everyone at the time thought resistance would lead to sure death while compliance would lead to living.  &gt;make a 100 mile turn, and hit an area the size of a fridge at 550 mph?   uh, a fridge?  the pentagon is *literally the largest building on earth.*  once a plane is already in the sky, it's pretty easy to make it hit something that big.  &gt;planes, if you haven't noticed, are difficult to fly.  well, they might be, **if you don't want to crash.**  crashing a plane, however, is significantly less easy.  we know that the 9/11 hijackers took flying lessons.  we know they could do the basics like turn the plane and change altitude.  we also know that, despite the pentagon being a massive target, they *almost missed it.*    there's absolutely nothing remarkable about the pentagon attack that leads anyone who is truly examining what went on to think it was a government attack.  you seem to be repeating debunked nonsense that hasn't been accepted by even the 9/11 twoofers since you were in kindergarten.  suggest you read, for example, the nist report on wtc.",0,

""we all miss her dec"" sara replies, her voice thick but soothing. hannah and wes nod in agreement. wes, prepared as ever, hands sara a tissue which she uses to dab at her eyes.  ""what else could have happened though? i mean she had so much shit in her system i'm surprised she even made it out to the pool. no wonder she cracked her head"" hannah retorts as she nervously fiddles with her lip ring. gee, thanks for the vote of confidence.  ""the thing that confuses me is why she was at that dickheads house in the first place"" wes ponders. now you're getting it guys. i wish i could just scream it at them, explain everything but its no use. ""everyone knew he had a thing for her, she turned him down enough times  in the past, but she would never...fuck!! hes coming over""  ah, here he is: my murderer. james percy geldard iii (better known as jp to his moronic following of 'friends') is the stereotypical rich kid; hes arrogant, pompous and generally thinks that the sun shines out of his perfectly tanned arse. time to get this party started.  ""there you all are. just thought i would stop by and pay my respects. such a tragedy after all. daddy says he will pay for a tree or something in her honour on campus"". smug bastard doesn't even have the decency to pretend to look upset. the gang just glare at him.    i notice a slight bulge in his pocket. his phone. concentrating on that alone, i summon as much strength as i can manage until *bleepbleepbleep*. his phone begins to ring.  ""sorry, must get this"". he turns away and heads towards the empty bathroom. he looks at the handset and see no phone number or caller id. i focus on the phone until the battery begins to drain and die completely.  ""piece of shit"", he mumbles and begins to open the door. i release a surge of energy, slamming the door shut and locking it. next, i focus on the light blub until it explodes in a shower of whitehot glass. no way you're getting out of here now, you fucker. i leave him to struggle with the door for a while.  ugh, now for the corny part. i can't believe i'm going to do this, it's so cliche. lowering my voice untilits almost a growl and widing my eyes until i look like a mad woman, and it takes every bit of strength i have as my face becomes translucent and pale, but visibal.  ""**confesssssss***"". jp spins around at lets out a delightfully girly shriek.  ""who are you?whats happening"" he cries out, clawing despirately at the door. ""please, just let me go, i haven't done anything!"". i roll my eyes, hardly believing he has the audacity to continue to deny killing me when i am right here.  ""**you did this to me! you killed me! now confess before i return the favour**"". i focus on the mirror until it smashes into a thousand tiny shards of glass. i think its a nice added touch, maybe i could get used to the haunted house gig.  ""no!! i will do anything, just don't hurt me"", he pleads. ""i'll tell everyone, just leave me alone!!"". that was easier than i expected. who knew mr cool was such a whimp? i allow my face to dissapear from his sigh and hurl the door open. he stumbles out, blinking in the light and trembling all over. to my great pleasure, i notice a large wet patch surrounding the crotch of his gucci chinos. soft lad pissed himself!  ""i-i did it, i killed stacey!"", he blurts out. everyone becomes silent and stares at him, not quite believing what they just heard. ""i asked her to come round to my place to help with my biology revision. she was such a goody fucking two shoes she agreed. it was just supposed to be a prank. get her drunk, shag her. i had a camera set up. only she wouldn't drink any fucking alcohol so i mixed some pills i had left over from glastonbury in her coffee. i didnt know she would pass out!! she said she felt ill and stood up to leave but fell and smashed her head on the floor. she wasn't breathing. i panicked. a criminal record would have ruined my college prospects!! so i carried her to the pool and threw her in. i called the police a few hours later to say i could see someone trying to break into the pool house. she was long gone by the time they fished her out. please believe me, it wasn't my fault! i f the stupid cow would have just fucked me when she had the chance then she would still be alive!""  the crowed is stunned into silence. my chin is almost hitting the floor; i can't believe he is blaming me! notice wes striding over from across the room. he reaches jp with fire burning in his eyes and rams his fist into jps nose, which erupts into a fountain of blood.  ""that's for stacey, you pathetic little boy"" he sneers at him. hannah pulls out her phone and dials for the police as dec steps up to restrain jp and sara runs to the kitchen to find some ice for wes's swollen fist. i love you guys, so so much.   thats when i notice the bright light. its pulling me closer and i step into it, happen that my family and friend now know thw truth about how i died.",0,

170086,"wrestling and judo have that distinct advantage over a lot of bjj practitioners, but in application it doesn't always work that way. fighters like nick diaz and anthony pettis (seem to) prefer to fight standing, but if taken down are extremely dangerous off their backs. the need to dictate where the fight takes place doesn't exist for them. neither guy is particularly great at sprawling or avoiding takedowns, but they don't have to be because they are submission artists once put down. the other issue is (which is why i'm subscribed to this subreddit in the first place) that bjj schools have neglected takedowns as a community. some of us (my academy included) see this as a problem. we cross-train wrestling, sambo, and judo to try to counter this as much as possible. guard pulling shouldn't be applauded, and it doesn't have to be a defining characteristic of jiujitsu. i'm trying to keep an open mind when it comes to grappling, and that's the only reason i responded to the headline of the article. thanks for having me. i look forward to the day when grappling is just grappling, and we'll only distinguish it by with or without the gi. all our arts (or sports) suffer from being separated.",0,

499084,"article   if the jewish stereotype is that members of the tribe are known more for their scholastic than sporting aptitude, it's worth noting that jews have actually been competing – and winning – from the very first modern olympiad. from athens in 1896 and berlin in 1936 to tel aviv in 1968 and sydney in 2000, jewish athletes (and one prophetic german doctor of note), have, through thick, thin, nazism, communism and terrorism, not only excelled, but even molded, the world’s greatest sporting movement, in both its olympic and paralympic manifestations.  from the pool and the rink to the beam and in between, here are 14 unforgettable moments from over a century of exalted competition:  1 athens, 1896: a jewish gold rush at the games of the i olympiad  resurrecting a glorious ancient greek tradition, the first olympic games of the modern era saw 311 athletes from 13 countries compete in 42 events across 9 sports. 5 jewish athletes won 10 medals, including eight gold. two of the gold went to hungarian freestyle swimmer alfred hajos-guttmann, and a further five were clinched by german gymnast cousins alfred and felix flatow, both of whom later were murdered in the holocaust.  2 amsterdam, 1928: a tale of five judeolympic matriarchs  in a strikingly similar tale of triumph and tragedy, jewish women did their tribe proud in the very first olympiad to admit females. in front of an ecstatic home crowd, five dutch jewish gymnasts – estella agsteribbe, ans polak, judikje simons and elka de levie – along with their non-jewish team members emerged triumphant in the team combined exercises. in another demonstration of female jewish athletic might, canadian sprinter fanny rosenfeld took home a gold in the 4x100-meter relay. tragically, all but one of the dutch jewish gymnasts perished in the holocaust, along with their jewish coach, gerrit kleerekoper.  3 lake placid, 1932: speedy new yorker wins first jewish winter olympic gold  opened by fdr in the small upstate new york town of lake placid, the iii winter olympiad witnessed a jewish speed skater from the bronx, irving warren jaffee, win two gold medals in the 5,000 and 10,000-meter races – tying for first in total individual medals won at the games. the son of russian jewish immigrants, jaffee was actually on the brink of winning gold in the previous games in st. moritz, yet missed out when the referee controversially cancelled the 10,000-meter competition that the jewish skater was leading due to thawing ice.      4 mandatory palestine, 1933: the zionist quest for auric glory begins  numbering fewer than 200,000 people, the jewish residents of mandatory palestine nevertheless had big dreams when they founded their own national olympic committee in 1933, 15 years before independence, and nearly two decades before israel’s historic helsinki debut.  5 berlin, 1936: hitler eat your hate out! jews win 10 medals at the nazi games  amid seas of swastika flags and nazi salutes – not to mention a prohibition on “full-blood” german jews from participating – sporty semites defiantly shined at the berlin summer games. thirteen people identifying as jewish or of jewish descent competed, winning 10 medals in all, including a gold by hungary’s gyorgy brody, considered one of history’s greatest water polo goalies. along with african american sprinter jesse owen’s epic feats on the track, jewish success in berlin proved just how flawed hitler’s racial eugenic theories were.      6 buckinghamshire, 1948: holocaust refugee fathers the paralympic movement  after fleeing his native germany for england in 1939, one jewish neurologist by the name of ludwig guttmann started a veritable sporting, and wider social, revolution when he organized the 1948 international wheelchair games, considered the precursor to the paralympics. featuring javelin and archery competitions for wheel-chair bound patients on the grounds of stoke mandeville hospital, dr. guttmann deliberately staged the event to coincide with the london 1948 summer olympics in the belief that disabled people too should be able to compete for sporting glory.  7 helsinki, 1952: hallelujah - the jewish state makes its olympic debut  having established its national olympic committee in 1933, boycotted the nazi games in 1936, and then being prevented from competing in london in 1948 by hosts great britain, it was in the finnish capital that the state of israel finally made its olympic debut. there they marched, 26 athletes, divers, swimmers, shooters and basketball players, triggering a wave of celebration back home. yet those hoping for more miracles were disappointed – the historic team left empty-handed, their lack of success even precipitating a government commission of inquiry! others may argue that just them being there, flying the star of david, was victorious enough.      8 melbourne, 1956: gold down under for a true blue jewish heroine  in the first olympiad held in the southern hemisphere, another jewish gymnast – not to mention holocaust survivor – joined the judeolympian pantheon by becoming the most successful athlete at the melbourne games. having won a gold, a silver and two bronze medals in helsinki, budapest-born ágnes keleti took it up a notch four years later, clinching four gold and two silver, taking her olympic medal total to 10. yet the jubilation soon turned to trepidation: during the melbourne games, the soviet union invaded hungary, prompting keleti to seek and receive asylum in australia. then, choosing the promised land over the lucky country, keleti made aliyah a year later, and while she never won another olympic medal, she did become coach of the israeli national gymnastics team, and, now aged 93, still calls israel home.      9 tel aviv, 1968: israel hosts its very own games  just a couple of kilometers south of keleti’s abode, and by a stroke of historically delicious fate, israel hosted its very own paralympics in the same year that it celebrated its 20th birthday as an independent state. the games were scheduled to be held in mexico city, host of the 1968 summer olympiad, yet when the mexicans cited technical difficulties, the israelis raised their hands – their offer accepted by none other than dr. guttmann himself. 750 athletes heralding from 29 countries competed in facilities in ramat gan on the outskirts of tel aviv, and little israel placed an impressive third overall, garnering 62 medals, including 18 gold. as of beijing 2008, israel ranks 14th in the world for paralympic medals won, with an amazing 124 gold, 124 silver and 132 bronze in its collective trophy shelf.      10 munich, 1972: mark spitz blitzes  four years later, soaring pride turned to bloody horror. and though the munich olympics of 1972 will forever be stained by the massacre of 11 israeli athletes, the aquatic feats of american jewish swimmer mark spitz so too remain etched into the world’s memory. protected by u.s. marines and flown home as soon as he had finished his winning spree, the famously mustached spitz amassed a then-unprecedented seven gold, smashing the world record in each victory to become one of the most successful olympians of all time, not to mention the judeolympian with the most gold medals ever.  11 barcelona, 1992: judo duo win israel’s first olympic medals  after wondering in the wilderness for a full forty years, the plucky jewish state finally won an olympic medal when tel avivian yael arad clinched silver in the judo half-middleweight event at the barcelona summer games. dedicating her achievement to her olympic compatriots slain two decades prior, arad’s success was followed by another judoka, oren smadga, who took home a bronze. the japanese martial art soon became a popular sport in the land of krav maga and beach bats/matkot, and other israeli judoka champions soon emerged, among them the likes of arik ze’evi.      12 lillehammer, 1994: lone skater – israel makes its winter olympics debut  more known for its copious sand and perennial sun, it took israel 42 years after independence to compete in its first winter olympiad. walking into the cold norwegian night with the blue and white flag in his glove-ensconced hands was one solitary israeli athlete, misha shmerkin, an odessa-born figure skater who finished sixteenth in his event. in sochi, could one of israel’s five athletes end its thirty-year winter of medal-less discontent?      13 sydney, 2000: beverly hills mom becomes most medalled jewish olympian  in what then ioc president juan antonio samaranch declared the “best games ever,” another american jewish swimmer, dara grace torres, cemented her place in sporting history by becoming the most successful jewish olympian when measured by total medals. having already won four medals, including two gold, in three prior games, torres outdid herself in sydney, where, as the oldest member of her team, she bagged two gold and three bronze. coupled with three silvers in beijing 2008, torres’ haul of twelve olympic medals surpasses fellow judeolympian titans mark spitz and agnes keleti by one.      14 athens, 2004: finally, a summer gold of israel’s own, back in the place where it all began  118 years after the olympic hymn rang out across panathinaiko stadium in athens, the call of hatikvah graced the auditory canals of a summer olympiad. a sun-kissed sabra had finally delivered: windsurfer gal fridman triumphed in the men’s mistral one design, a climax that seems splendidly fitting given the country’s beach-loving nature, not to mention the english translation of israel’s first and only olympic gold medalist’s first name – ‘wave.’",1,

516612,"marcus jones pulled his p-51 mustang into a hard banking turn, tracers and angry bullets clawing a line ever closer to his tail.  he grunted hard under the g forces, but clenched his leg and abdomen muscles like they had taught him to force blood up into his brain.  a risky glance into the rear view mirror above his cockpit awarded him a glimpse of the german messerschmitt working hard to get a kill angle.  against the grey paint scheme of the enemy plane, marcus could see the german pilot grimacing and straining against the same acceleration forces, purple veins standing out on his forehead against white anglo skin.  relaxing his muscles briefly then bearing down again, marcus adeptly reversed course with a roll over and diving pull, screaming through gritted teeth.  *i'm not gonna let a white man kill me*, marcus though, *not in alabama, and sure as hell not here!*  he was a tuskegee airman after all, and he was set out to prove he was better than the best.  the aggressive gamble paid off; marcus saw from the corner of his eye the german fighter overshoot and go wide.  it was a small error, but it was all the lead the negro pilot needed to reverse the scheme of hunter-and-prey.  he saw the german pilot looking back at his mustang and mouthing words that were probably not fit for english translation.  with another athletic maneuver combining the best of a gymnast and a power lifter, marcus slammed hard on the rudder while reversing back in to a climbing turn inside of the now fleeing german's radius.  marcus had to hand it to his enemy, this pilot was using ever juke and fake out in the book trying to shake him.  but marcus had patience that came from years of biding his time, from watching and learning when other men would have struck rashly.  he waited for the german's second mistake.  there!  the true pull out in a gamble to split-s away.  marcus mashed the trigger on his stick sending a hot wash of death in the form of american lead and gunpowder streaming into the german's path.  the messerschmitt was torn apart in a hail of metal shreds, burning oil, and thick smoke, beginning the last dive of its warbird career.  marcus howled in triumph and pulled his bird up, searching the sky for his wingmen.  another threat, this time a couple more fighters.  no, dozens.  marcus blinked his eyes against the glare of the sun and could scarcely believe it.  there must be hundred of german fighter planes filling the sky, all heading towards him.  running would have been no use, to turn now would just present his red tail as a juicy target to the unbelievable number of enemies in the sky.  *momma... your little boy told you he was gonna make you proud.  guess i'm gonna have to tell you when ya get to heaven.*  with resolve, marcus powered up his engine and dove into the fray with cannons blazing.  ---  marcus woke up screaming, clawing at his chest where the restraint harness of his mustang should be.  his fingers slipped on a viscous fluid that was warm and seemed to be streaming off him.  firm hands grasped him from both sides and tried to hold him steady while he flailed around, slowing only when he realized he wasn't in his plane anymore.  disorientation set in quick, bright lights, men in white suits, cold air against his bare naked form.  pushing the hands away from him with a gesture to indicate 'back off', marcus grabbed the metal rim surrounding himself and closed his eyes.  he focused on his breathing.  ""i'm sorry marcus, but we had to push you.  i know this is a bit much to take in, and i do apologize.""  a female voice, middle aged with an english accent.    between breaths marcus replied, ""where am i?  is this london?""  he heard one of the other figures in the room laugh sharply before bowing his head at a glare from the woman who had addressed him.  ""its... a long story marcus.  you've been gone a very long time.  perhaps we get you cleaned up and talk it over a cup of tea?""  an hour later marcus and the woman were seated at a small table, hot earl grey steeping in a pot.  marcus ran his muscular hands over the robe they had given him.  it was thin and lightweight, but kept him warm unlike any material he had ever felt back home.  the woman seated across from him was pale and red headed, her shoulder length hair swept back behind her ears.  if she was nervous about being around a semi-clothed negro man, she didn't show it as far as marcus could tell.  she poured him a cup of the warm liquid and followed with hers.  ""i should probably begin.  my name is gracyn selvir and i am the lead scientist of the project we call old glory.  this will come as a bit of a shock to you marcus, but you have been dead for quite some time.""  marcus just laughed.  ""ok, ok, i get it.  this is a big joke by those boys back at the 332nd, isn't it?  they just mad that i whooped up on a whole mess of germans and left none for them.""  gracyn simply gave him a sad smile.  ""you were born on march 5th, 1924 in a small community outside of what was mobile, alabama, the united states of america.  you died following wounds from an aerial battle over southern germany on may 12, 1944 in which you took down no less than ten enemy fighter planes on your own, scoring the last kill by using your plane as a battering ram.  somehow you managed to bail out, but died of your injuries on the ground.  the germans buried you out of respect.  we found your remains last year in 6943 as part of an expedition related to the project, and using well, let us say using science that would be indistinguishable from magic to you, were able to reanimate your body and memories.""  the teacup in marcus' hand was shaking, hot droplets escaping the rim.  he settled it back down in its saucer.  ""lady, i heard white folks tell me some crazy things in my day.  but this takes the cake.""  gracyn placed her soft hands over his, a gesture which surprised marcus.  no white woman had ever touched him in that way.  but his companion didn't seem to mind his skin color, as if it was as unimportant as the color of his eyes.    ""i know this is probably too much to take in on the first day marcus, and i am afraid i have more to tell you.""  gracyn looked down for a moment, almost with shame.  ""we came looking for you specifically because we need warriors.  we need fighters, men with the strength and spirit to do the hard things that we have forgotten about over centuries of peace and laxity.""  marcus stood and paced slowly towards a window showing an idyllic pasture view.  he thought the scene was odd, like the hills were too uniform or the grass too green.  ""you mean to tell me i died over five thousand years ago in a war, and you went through all the trouble to bring me back just to fight another war?  did you whiteys really get that soft?""  gracyn gave him another sad smile and moved to join him by the window.  she paused for a moment, then motioned her hand at the scene.  it was instantly replaced with a cold view of hard space, the blue-green earth floating at a distance.  dots of lights moved like fireflies across the scape.  marcus almost fell over.  ""i really wish we had more time marcus.  the truth is, we are in a war and we are losing badly.  all of us, and we do not know how to fight it.  we had put aggression and war behind us centuries ago.  now, when the worst of human traits would serve us best, we find ourselves nearing extinction for the lack of them.""  gracyn peered out onto the planet and let her words hang.  ""i need warriors, marcus.  most of all i need fighter pilots.  the archives indicated that you were and i quote, 'better than the best'.  so we found you and brought you back.  oh and one more thing,  you'd be piloting this.""  she swept her hand out towards space.  a gleaming silver miracle rose into view, swept like sculpted mercury and glowing with purple light in places.  to marcus, it was a craft not even the finest minds of the axis and allies plus flash gordon could have ever invented, a sleek mix of grace and deadly art formed as one.  the fighter did a slow roll for its audience, then a slight wing waggle in salute before bursting off faster than a coiled snake.  ""miz selvir, if you're tellin me i get to fly that, then i'm in.""  ""it's graycn,"" she smiled, taking his hands again warmly.",1,
357917,"the pistol bucked *—bang!—* and a bullet-hole appeared in the table just over his shoulder.  fletcher heaved his fat ass over and lay facedown with his hands clasped across the back of his head. his blubber-gut bounced inside his t-shirt, his shoulders the color of fish bellies. yung spat out an incoherent curse and scrambled away through the mid-aisle divide.  in retrospect, i should have shot fletcher first, but i wanted to address the more aggressive yung. i crossed to the next aisle and he was there pressed against the bookshelf, waiting for me, his rifle at port arms. i recoiled instinctively as soon as i saw the barrel, leaning backward.  the rifle coughed three times, a rapid *pop-pop-pop,* shredding the books next to my face.  sudden stinging heat on my chest startled me, convinced me i’d been shot. searing pain raced across my forehead. slag from a ricochet had landed on my shirt and was trying to catch on fire.  while i slapped at it, fletcher shoved yung out of the way and ran past toting the mossberg and ar. the guns were briefcases and he was a man late for a plane. i fired at him but his weeble-wobble jogging made him hard to hit in the dark and the round went through the door in front of his face. he slammed the stairwell door open with one of those white shoulders and disappeared.  yung clicked over to full-auto and fired again, spraying bullets in my direction, knocking sparks out of the wall behind me. i flinched and stumbled away, but instead of running back the way i came, i juked back to the previous aisle and went around their makeshift table barrier.  pressed against the other side of the tabletop were two rollcarts full of books, serving as a thick-but-not-impenetrable barricade.  snatching up a book, i positioned myself on the wrong side of their barrier and flung it down to the end of the aisle. at the bottom of its arc, the heavy hardback opened up like a bird in flight and flapped noisily, sprawling across the carpet and coming apart.  yung stepped around the far end of the bookshelf, treading on book pages, the ar raised, looking for me. i was waiting, my arm extended over the tops of the two rollcarts. i fired at the pale smear of his face just as his head turned.  his throat opened up in a spray of red and he arched his back, rearing up on his toes and staggering as if on the deck of a listing ship, making nasty bottom-of-the-milkshake sounds. his ar came up and i threw myself flat on the carpet just in time. the rifle chattered endlessly, emptying the magazine into the barricade, punching through table and book, snowing flakes of ash and paper all over me.  i lay there for a moment, listening for the sound of yung’s magazine release, until footsteps came up behind me. i rolled over and aimed up at a silhouette’s face. “he’s dead,” said walter, giving me a light kick in the leg and going around me. the tail of his coat swept over my face. “good work.”  day came around a shelf. “where’d the other one go?”  i pointed toward the stairwell door with my pistol and got up, stumbling over yung’s body. “out and up.” the man—boy, i wanted to call him, he couldn’t have been more than twenty—lay spread-eagled on his back, his throat a cavern of gore and his lips as red as a clown’s. his gray shirt was a sponge turning black.  day shined his flashlight in my face. “you get dinged?” he asked, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket and pressing it to my temple. i took it from him and found that it was covered in blood—my blood. a nasty cut on my forehead was leaking along the side of my face and down my neck. my fingertips looked like i’d dipped them into a can of paint.  “i think it was shrapnel off a bookshelf.”  “head wounds always bleed bad,” said walter. he took the handkerchief from me, wound it into a band, and tied it around my head to stanch the flow.  day glanced once at me and covered his eyes, shaking his head. “fuckin rambo, man. you look like fuckin rambo.” he took out his magazine, checked it, slapped it back in. “keep the rag, man. let’s—what the hell?” apparently, walter had holstered his pistols and taken yung’s ar-15. “oh hell to the naw! i know you did *not* pick up evidence off the floor of a crime scene! are you *playin* right now?”  “this is better than my slapirons,” walter growled, examining the rifle. “you want to die now or get in trouble later?” he went over to the stairwell door and kicked it open, slamming it against the wall. it quietly eased closed. satisfied he wouldn’t be shot at, walter pushed it slowly open again and stepped through, yung’s ar at low-ready.  while they were distracted, i searched yung’s body and found another beretta in his armpit holster, along with two mags.  he was still warm. i never forgot that.  the south stairwell was open at the top and full of dove-gray light. we stepped up onto the eighth floor, a large observation deck. the entire exterior wall was glass, surrounding us with floor-to-ceiling windows, and columns all along the edge supported the floors above us, along with a core of elevator shafts and maintenance closets. park benches provided seating we weren’t going to be using today.  it was disconcertingly dark. the three of us stepped closer to the window and looked outside. the sky had become a heavy indigo blanket of wool, compressing the horizon to a thin blade of light.  blackfield spanned out before us in a carpet of trees and buildings—i could see all the way out to the interstate by the steakhouse we had eaten at, which was easily several miles away. a golden mcdonalds m and a taco bell sign were beacons in the gloom to our left, out at the edge of the campus. the university clustered underneath us, suddenly a cramped corner of this panorama. roads we had run down were now mere alleys. even ed’s indian was visible through the trees, a tiny blue-and-cream motorcycle for ants.  cop cars gaggled in the parking lot far below, their flashers flashing. a crowd of onlookers had conglomerated in the field adjacent to the library. even as we looked down at them, some of the bystanders pointed up at us. some subconscious part of me searched the parking lot for a news van.  “why ain’t nobody comin in?” asked day, his arm pressed against the glass and his forehead on his wrist. he glanced at me, saw the beretta in my hand, and shook his head in exasperation.  “maybe they can’t find the front door either,” i offered.  “i have a feeling there’s a reason only we were allowed in here,” said walter.  “well, if it’s a trap, it’s sprung,” i said with a sigh. “nothing now but to follow through. besides, what were we supposed to do? ignore it? pretend it wasn’t going to happen and let freeman get away with it?”  walter said nothing. i could tell he wanted to be callous and say *yes,* but i knew he would agree with me.  day turned away from the window. “what about those dead people downstairs? ain’t he already got away with it?”  i tipped open my revolver and pulled out my empties, replacing them with cartridges from my pocket. “he won’t,” i said, staring out at the darkening sky. “he’s got himself cornered now. he won’t leave this building alive. we got his number.”  one of the maintenance doors opened and all three of us pointed weapons at it.  a girl peered out, a blonde student in a tan peacoat.  “it’s okay!” shouted day, relaxing. he tugged at his uniform shirt, showing off the badge on his chest. “look, we’re the good guys. or, well, at least i am—i don’t know who these freak-a-doos are. come on out and get downstairs, aight?”  she came out of hiding and ran for the stairs, sobbing, her mascara sliding down in smudgy harlequin stripes. the girl clattered down and out of sight.",0,

462111,"(continuing...)  i reach for a napkin and scribble a sentence with my personal pen kept to deface public property. i start my note by politely writing: dear leaper smurfs cunts: i then jot 3 major game of thrones spoilers that haven’t caught up with tv, and end with “your portals are bout to roll like ned starks head bitches.”    and now, i just needed a delivery service. i rest both elbows on the bar and charmingly ask the busty bartender what’s the worst beer she’s got.   “what do you mean?”  she asks. “for dirty scoundrels who have nothing to lose. men favoring resistance… until they grow old and die of aneurysms and anal hemorrhaging.” the bar wench scowled and passed me a pabst blue ribbon.  “no…not for me.  i need a favor.”  i slid a green bill over the counter while stealing several glances to the plunging neckline and inquired, “can you bring this napkin and filthy beverage over to that fine gentleman over yonder? we’re old dear friends and it’d bless my heart if you’d deliver my regards.”  the fact this statement wasn’t logical, surly was offset by currency quickly tucked into cleavage.  “you got it hun!” as she turned to deliver my declaration, i stood and made quick hustle across the bar. so when the waitress quoted the classic line “it came from that guy right over…” and the word “there” would be lost on the tip of her tongue, as the mysterious stranger had vanished.  of course, this took much longer than planned, i spent an agonizing several minutes huddled against an electronic dart board, annoying several people who acted like i was deterring their ability to drunkenly throw shit. until finally, the waitress arrived with cheese fries and my message. alpha had a moment of excitement, perhaps he perceived it a phone number, but then looked puzzled, his primitive mind wondering why presented with white trash beer, then finally his facial expression became pure rage when opening the folded napkin. “what the fuck!” alpha threw the napkin back at the waitress who didn’t even get to quote the line i so desperately hoped.   i brought up my inventory to review firepower. 800 level 8 xmp bursters were waiting for detonation, with enough resistors to rebuild 50 fields. but before the massacre, striking a little fear was a formidable way to start my mission wasn’t it? i fired one slow ass level 2 burster to grab their attention. as expected, they jumped up like hot coal had been administered in their ass. “find that filthy cocksmoker!”   i concealed my phone, remaining inconspicuous while taking care of loose ends. i scanned the area for keith. (remember keith? you probably don’t because he’s so fucking boring.) keith had situated himself by the jukebox. it looked like he was speaking with a women who wasn’t facing in his direction. before he embarrassed himself by trying to introduce a girl he bought a drink for, i quickly sneaked one hand into keith’s peacoat, snatching his keys that had a big ugly piece of rubber bearing the ‘chive’ logo. i never understood this whole chive movement. if you wanted to meet hot girls but had nothing to show for yourself, then you joined a fraternity in college. as far as i was concerned, chive was a bunch of attention whoring women putting themselves on display to a bunch of breathing neck beards. but i digress, tonight wasn’t about distractions. tonight was about territory. tonight was about power.   “i’ve got a mission and i’ll be needing your car. there’s a portal out there that is worse than the eye of sauron.”  i wasn’t sure if that sounded important enough so i added, “like literally.”  keith looked cross and folded his arms. he didn’t like the ingress talk or perhaps he just wasn’t keen on me abandoning him in the country. “forest you’re drunk and shouldn’t be operating anything. i’m the responsible one…”  “you’re a civilian stuck in a warzone son! and i’ve just been reinstated as top ranking soldier well above law in times of an existential crisis. now move out the way and let me pick my jam.”  “now i don’t think -” keith began, but the girl in daisy dukes with a tucked in flannel shirt, sleeves rolled up to her elbows, turned on heels to face us. “hey forest, this is stacy!” and bitch face spoke without acknowledging me: “and stacy needs another drink cutie!” now normally i’d advice against keith being slowly robbed, but tonight stacy was my perfect portal wingman. i gave keith my best shit eating grin. “go take care of her, you ferocious tiger!”  with the resources needed to continue, i selected battle music via the jukebox. then while waiting for the next song, i worked on assassin creed skills, seamlessly blending into the crowd as if a real regular hillbilly, staring at ass while taking swigs of my overpowered of my man, captain morgan. it was fun watching them, trying to scout out the secret ingress agent. letting them revel in their filthy underwear crust before obliterating them off the face of the planet. and then my war cry came blaring from the digital jukebox with its distinctive horn fanfare intro…  pack it up, pack it in let me begin i came to win battle me that's a sin  i hunkered down behind the glossy wooden bar, back in the corner where i recently became re-enlightened, remaining out of sight. both portals in vicinity were maxed out 8’s with 4 rare shields in mod slots. which might be a problem for some, unless you were me. i fired off 88 rounds, each with a flawless 20% power increase as my timing was still impeccable. i used a power cube before shattering the rest of the resonators, keeping enough xmp to quickly throw out 16 resonators, creating two level five portals with very rare shields to temporarily fortify my position. but that wasn’t going to be enough. that was just the start.  the savages had sprung to their feet, gripping their phones the way tapeworms surely clung to their rotting insides, cursing the unexpected attack from lone warrior. i took a deep breath and steadied myself. this is the shit separating the boys from the true field agent. i casually strolled up to them, as they stood in a little gay control field triangle and swiftly snatched phones from nerdboy and fidgety fuck’s astonished hands. “relax boys. sleeper cell resistance officer here. let me apply a high level algorithm theorem for increased portal capture.” before they could ask questions, i dropped both phones into a dark pint of guinness on the table.  everyone’s pupils dilate in surprise. think you got a handle on your affairs until someone dunks your high priced phone in a drink. so far, the plan envisioned in my drunken mind had gone perfectly. i had spooked the enemy, infiltrated the group as double agent and disarmed two of them with surprise and persuasive tactics.  my final step was to deliver a well-placed judo kick to the final phone held by the third resistance agent, shattering it into a million pieces. he’d fall to the floor like a handicapped child, as the other two scrambled for high priced phones. and i’d gracefully walk from the bar, amidst all the confusion.    alas, that did not happen. my crooked ass kick went way left, striking the table in front of me. it was a relatively thick wooden table which caused my momentum to stop and swiftly drop my ass on the floor. it also caused the contents of the table: a pitcher of beer and a few glasses (one containing two phones) to briefly ascend into the air - before crashing down sideways, causing broken glass and beer pouring over the tabletop. and cheese fries. fucking cheese fries everywhere.  alpha stood there stunned, i only had a second before he snapped into action to alienate my ass. i started pushing myself backwards on the wet sticky floor, wincing as a sharp shard of glass deeply sliced through my palm, causing fresh blood to splatter the floor.    nerdboy was the first to break the silence. “you bastard my phone!” and dove down to save his device from further liquid damage. my strategic plan immediately changed into making haste, asap. i got up, drenched in beer and coated with cheese wiz, knocking several people out of the way as i sprinted for the exit, smashing through the bar’s screen door so hard the hinges ripped halfway out. i had several steps of golden silence, with only the sound of my shoes soles stepping on rocky gravel. it was a hopeful moment where i believed they wouldn’t give chase – but a mighty roar came from inside to outdoors - as the bar door was smashed open once again with severe brute force, causing the door to completely detach and become unleashed into the air. two girls to the side sipping swill in red solo cups screamed in disbelief, as they got cross checked by an airborne door.    the resistance was coming for me. it was alpha. he never broke stride, running at full speed. we made eye contact and i saw the look of death in his eyes. i knew if he got ahold of me, i’d most likely wake up in a hospital. failure was not an option. i had keys out and ready to go, running along the side of the bar to reach keith’s shitty ford focus. seconds later i was seated and shifting into reverse, swinging the car out menacingly to show no fear of a brutal hit and run, but the clever fiend had broken direction. alpha was now headed for a big black chevy truck parked in a handicap spot. shit this asshole could adapt.",1,

888455,"they were going to kill me. that much was certain. they hired the best prosecutor on planet. the most respected judge presided. like an old book i once read, the case against [me] was open and shut. the only thing missing was something to charge [me] with. i was nice enough to give them one. treason, murder, espionage, theft, you name it, i did it. except rape. not that one. i have standards. i was the leader of the planetary resistance. public enemy number one. derailed trains, blew up a fair amount of the spaceport, robbed the national banks. i destroyed everyone's mortgage records, giving everyone a clean slate. the government really didn't like that one. well, to make a long and awesome story short, they caught up with me. which is why i'm now sitting in this cell.  they arrive a dawn, or at least i think it's dawn, i haven't seen any light for a week. they frog march me down the row of prison cells. the other prisoners look at me with pity. i just flash them my by now famous smile. the entire trial was shown on live 3d tv. it was the trial of the century so said the pundits. the general population seemed to agree. when they listed the crimes, i cheerfully and honestly pled guilty to each and every one. the entire court was stupefied. they expected me to fight every single one. they wanted to destroy the image of me. to strip me down to the bare bones they wanted. they never had the chance.  as they drag me towards the exit, i shove the guards aside and walk on my two legs. i must keep up appearances. i walk the hundred yards of the grey cement tunnel alone as i enter into the blinding light, the crowd roars in approval. it reverberates. it buffets my chest, like a tidal wave of sound. so this is what gladiators must have felt like all those thousands of years ago. simultaneously feeling like a god and knowing your life was at stake. the morning light is nearly blinding. it shines down among the skyscrapers. there must be nearly a million people here in the square. three billion more watching on their tv's. i'm going to die on live air.    the guards thread my chains through an iron ring. i can turn and walk in a ten yard circle. i pace it, going around and around and around. in my gray fatigues i imagine i look like a wolf penned in a cage; hungry, vicious, with bestial cunning. good. with a fanfare, the planetary governor arrives. he is plump, fat fellow, with a balding pate. he is dressed in flowing silks and linens. he waves at the crowd, ignoring the hisses and boos directed at him. things have not been so good on his watch. he raises his hand in silence and his voice goes out on the speaker system. he goes through the usual observations and then graciously allows me a hour to speak my mind. this is one of our oldest traditions on this planet. when the first colony ship, a murderer was found guilty and allowed to speak his mind. he spent an entire hour cursing the crowd. calling them the worst insults that sprung to mind. he cursed his mother, father, god, gods. he cursed life, he insulted death. nothing was beyond his contempt. it was agreed it was one of the greatest performances ever in history. so, the tradition was born.  one of the soldiers pins a microphone to my collar. he turns it on with a squeal. the crowd looks on expectantly, leaning in their seats, eager to hear what a condemned man has to say. a city clerk takes a hour glass and flips it over, the sand dropping grain by grain. i take a breath and raise my head to the rising sun, letting the shining rays warm up my face. i open my mouth.         *""what are the bugles blowin' for?"" said files-on-parade.  ""to turn you out, to turn you out,"" the colour-sergeant said.  ""what makes you look so white, so white?"" said files-on-parade.  ""i'm dreadin' what i've got to watch,"" the colour-sergeant said.  for they're hangin' danny deever, you can hear the dead march play,  the regiment's in 'ollow square—they're hangin' him to-day;  they've taken of his buttons off an' cut his stripes away,  an' they're hangin' danny deever in the mornin'...""*  i finish kipling's danny deever. the crowd claps politely. i go to robert louis stevenson     under the wide and starry sky,  dig the grave and let me lie.  glad did i live and gladly die,  and i laid me down with a will.    this be the verse you grave for me:  here he lies where he longed to be;  home is the sailor, home from sea,  and the hunter home from the hill.*  the crowd takes a shine to that one. i follow into john milton's *on time.* and jack london's *the scab.* but i don't just do poems. i sing *sam hall,* the song about an unrepentant murderer. i sing *macpherson's lament.* remembering long forgotten music, i perform *water from another time* and *gone, gonna rise again, dearest martha.*  i continue on for the rest of the hour. the crowd is cheering. never before has such an event been so amazing. the clock is winding down. i have enough time for one more song. just one. i think for a moment, and then inspiration strikes. the crowd falls silent as i hum a bar. i open my mouth.  ""my life flows on in endless song; above earth's lamentation, i hear the sweet, tho' far-off hymn that hails a new creation; thro' all the tumult and the strife i hear the music ringing; it finds an echo in my soul— how can i keep from singing?"" the crowd is awestruck, mouths agape    i point my finger at the governor. it is shaking, but still strong. ""when tyrants tremble, sick with fear, and hear their death-knell ringing, when friends rejoice both far and near, how can i keep from singing? in prison cell and dungeon vile, our thoughts to them go winging; when friends by shame are undefiled, how can i keep from singing?""   the crowd is going crazy. they're cheering, crying, jumping up and down like madmen. police in the crowd are being overwhelmed by the thousands of citizens in the square. the governor gives frantic signals to the firing squad. ironically, while the riot rages on, my execution is now an afterthought. no one is paying attention. the crowd is assaulting the governor's party and guards. cries of liberty and freedom ring out. i smile as the bullets rip through my chest. i have done my duty.",0,

771322,"it depends on what you're looking for. in general, i prefer to look to the drugstore first, and turn to the expensive stuff if i can't find something that'll work.   for example, i'm very pale, with strongly yellow undertones and a tendency to flush. i cannot find a drug store foundation that actually works for me. i've occasionally found one in the right color, but never also the right texture. so i use indie powder foundations, and look to pro or high end for liquid or cream ones.  another example is matte eyeshadows. nyx has a few good ones, but thebalm is unrivaled in quality, and inglot has an fantastic selection. for shimmery ones though, i love wet n wild (i still have some high end, but more because it feels luxurious and i love the added variety).   but my holy grail primer, concealers and mascaras are drug store, and i've found amazing eyeliners.",1,
270745,"download link (alac and mp3, 250 mb): https://www.adrive.com/public/axnatj/28.zip   **the wytches** – *weights and ties* (uk, 2014)  new record from uk psych/garage band… slow-tempo with jangly ’60s guitar. i’m pretty picky with vocals but this one hits the spot. it’s definitely an earworm.  **brace/choir** – *satisfier* (germany, 2014)  man, is this a grower. starts out as pretty straight-ahead toe-tapping indie and then the guitars just pile in, layer upon layer, and subtle bongos driving it forward. kind of reminds me of mmoss or pinkunoizu. awesome. a band to watch.  **white fence** – *afraid of what it’s worth* (us, 2014)  i didn’t know this guy was founding member of darker my love, but he is, and it makes sense because both that band and this project white fence are awesome. this new album is a cracker, a real contender for album of the year.  **pinkunoizu** – *everything is broken or stolen* (denmark, 2012)  i can’t get enough of this band. last year’s *the drop* was in my opinion the best thing released in 2013. this cut is from their 2012 release, which is somewhat less cohesive as an album, but it still had some really amazing moments. this is one.  **the proper ornaments** – *stereolab* (uk, 2014)  apparently these guys are kind of a big deal in the london indie scene; their freshly released album is killer if you like that kind of stuff. this track is pumping: a straight up tribute to france’s finest and they really knock it out of the park with the harmonized chiming guitars. psych pop heaven.  **arnold** – *catherine day* (uk, 1998)  a wonderful forgotten album from the late 90s, this mournful heartstrings-puller never fails to give me chills. the soaring slide guitar is straight-up psych heaven and is cruelly cut short when the band stop playing and start horsing around for five minutes before launching into another number. i edited that shit out.  **marble sheep** -- *september’s rain* (japan, 1998)   this band’s catalogue is massive and i am slowly, slowly going through it. a staple of anyone into japanese psych, this number from marble sheep has a gorgeous acoustic hook and one of those children’s type organs underneath and is propelled along by smooth swishes of ride cymbal and bongos. it’s just very gentle and mournful and harmonious and sweet. fucking love this band so much.  **david kilgour &amp; the heavy eights** – *comin’ on* (new zealand, 2014)  the improbably good 80s band the clean was built around two brothers from new zealand, david (guitar) and hamish (drums and vocals). david has released a number of top-shelf grade-a prime cut solo albums, the most recent is this, and should be of interest to anyone who loves swirly guitar sunshine psych pop. heavenly. one of those songs where you go “fuck me i never even heard that guitar track” and it’s like your 20th listen.  **electric wizard** – *i am nothing* (uk, 2014)  before i experienced knaw their tongues, this band was the heaviest thing i had ever heard. i am tremendously excited for next month when electric wizard releases their new album—this is the first single from it—which features the drummer from my two favorite albums, come my fanatics and dopethrone. you can shout me down for including “doom” or “metal” on a psych-rock comp, but this music is deeply, horrifically trippy—a huge wall of dark 70s analog fuzz. some blackness to contrast light on this mix. it’s just chong-chong-chong-chong sucking you into this horrible nihilistic vortex where you scream but no sound comes out. that my friends is the mark of quality music.   **the green telescope** – *make me stay* (uk, 1986)  i found this on the compilation “children of nuggets” which has some great obscure bands from the 80s on it. i love the wild reverbed guitar so low in the mix, it just makes it to a tee. one listen and you’ll be hooked.  **prince rupert’s drops** – *plague ride* (us, 2012)  posted by someone here a while ago, within two bars i was sucked in hook line and sinker. i had to have it on a mix. a new york band. pretty much psychedelic rock defined.  **stardeath &amp; white dwarfs** – *hate me tomorrow* (us, 2014)  have never heard of this band before, grabbed it randomly. high quality. check them out.  **spectre folk** – *inchin’ worm* (us, 2012)  i have such a boner for this band it’s ridiculous. formed around the former sonic youth drummer, they have released two albums every fan of psych rock should own. “blackest medicine” and “the ancient storm”. this one is deceptively slow and simple but there is so much subtly going on… really chilled reverb-ey coolness.  **kalamata** – *die* (germany, 2014)  some more stoner-influenced shit from germany: sort of a mix of elder and maybe a less jazz-influenced colour haze. big riffs of the old school; slow, tight, and a good grasp of tone. there is very little left to be said in this genre and i find it boring these days, but every so often a band breathes a bit of life into the corpse of kyuss. this is one such.  **usssy** – *whirling grannys* (russia, 2013)  middle-eastern folk influences define this psych band from russia. huge, dense, exotic, really freaking amazingly good shit. get into it. there is so much music to find from this part of the world.  **goat** – *bondye* (sweden, 2014)  i’m just pandering to the tame impala crowd here. seriously, how good is this new album. criminal not to include. a huge injection of pure genius in what can seem like a pretty jaded scene sometimes. a record to own and treasure on vinyl or cd for sure.  **serpentina satellite** –  *mazanilla menta/novo* (peru, 2004)  some driving kraut from peru to send us home. so freaking good. the album this is from i really like, but the other i heard didn’t do much for me. this is really spacey and awesome.  anyway, share and enjoy.",0,

""how far until the old mine sight, citizen fairview?"" grumbled dean. ""we have been driving meglong and i am due back at city-fac by midsun. i nod, muscle out a ""not long"", and turn right onto the dead grass toward a clearing. dean is startled by the sudden change and starts to question the validity of our official destination. if i look at him, he will see right through me. i stare ahead until i see something in the distance. it soon becomes apparent that it's an ancient barn colored a muted straw-yellow.  that's our stop. i honk three times after parking inside, just as advised. dead grass covers the interior of the barn. suddenly, dirt and foliage fly out into the air on my left, revealing a dark hole. a familiar smile pokes out from underground.  _  ""sparrow? is that you?!""  he laughs innocently and speeds to open my door. i would have jumped at him had my provi-belt not been on! ""fairview! welcome to your new life!"" he cried. i thought he died five years ago, but i remember that the lies of the past are plenty. ""come with me to become one of us"" whispered sparrow into my ear. he grabbed my hand as he motioned toward the hole. i'm ready"", i said nervously. i grip the ladder and start my decent quickly. two empty car seats fade from view as i drop deeper.  _  all the stories sparrow ever told to me about this place were coming true before my eyes! a long golden hallway shimmers like the stars, congratulating me as my feet land on the crystal tile. two rows of grinning men, dressed in yellow gowns cover the length of the walls. banners drape alongside with them, each displaying a large red sun.  ""do you wish to proceed"" asks the wide eyed sparrow. immediately after nodding, the golden sea of men parts to reveal a walkway.  ""may your first steps in the sun be as bright as your last"" whispers sparrow. he disappears into the blinding mass.  _  each face of the rows project the same loving expression; a pair of friendly eyes and a shining grin. i haven't ever seen one man this happy in all my days, much less 1,000! welcomes are directed at each turn as i march toward a distant red shape at the end of the hall. the men at my front point me toward it with pride. as i close in, i begin to tell that it's a crimson double sided steel door.   _  the last two yellow men swing their doors open and greet me in. once past i see a grand cavern, with what must have been the most megsized roof in rockwellia. rows of yellow provi-sits lead up to an 8 ft tall mirrored rectangle. a tall limestone tower protrudes up behind the mirrorcube, dwarfing all below it. i spot a golden blur on the edge atop the tower. my neck aims up in awe. scores of voices behind me chant one word as i finally am in reach of the massive rock. a thousand as one command: **climb!**  my once weary arms are rejuvenated with a powerful warmth. the past few years of war and horrible suffering melt away with each inch toward the peak. a boiling sensation surges through my body as i grapple upwards; but they are far frostier than working for years in slavery around the steaming iron. the golden glow above me sends shivers of hope with each ray. i disappear into the welcoming sea of gold with a full heart.   _  soft fibers comfort me back into the cavern. the yellow cushion of the provi-sit meld beneath my arms and body pleasantly. the megsized limestone column stands at helm just as before. i arch my neck backward to notice 1000 gowned yellow men sitting in rows behind me at my left and right, all looking up. i do the same . at the edge of the limestone sits a pale young woman upon a throne. *her* throne. her beauty sparkles along with the playful wave of a crimson silk gown. a soft angelic voice echos at height.   ""my golden brothers, my followers of light, my truth searchers! the darkness has been cut down once again, for another has joined our glorious cosmic cause!  **""let the beam grow wider!""** chants the golden mass.  she responds with only a girl-like giggle. it fills my skull with the sweetest memories i've never had before. all start to laugh with her, so i partake as well. the lovely sounds of brotherhood cease with the upward thrust of her pale bony arm, leaving only silence.   ""our new beam brought a gift to the voiced sister and to the golden brotherhood. the messengers are pleased!""  i scoot to the edge of my yellow provi-sit, listening with fervor.   *what must i have given?*  ""this gift is imperative for our final step toward their light. brothers, tell me how do i know?""  ***the messengers speak only to the voiced sister!***  ""very glorious, my brothers. i know it's easier to only think of your voiced sister, your golden brothers, and the beam; you must however, dwell upon the time of the lord of lies. dwell upon the millions of bullets he filled your comrades with. dwell upon the rivers of truth-seeker blood that stained the world crimson. dwell upon how he tried to take away the golden vision once it shined the messenger's glow.""  angry voices curse out from the masses. i join them, venom spewing from my purified lips.  ""*we* saw it. *we* protected it. *we* fought back against the darkness with validated hatred from above. they have watched our struggle with love in their hearts. salvation is here, my cosmic warriors. first, we *must* give our 10,000th offering, our **final** offering. bring out the gift!""   venomous howls of hatred screech at my back by the crimson double sided door. i stand to see a black figure being carried by the strength of the golden masses. it's tossed violently between the crowd, yet it steadily makes ground towards me. as it closes in, i see two white eyes shine from the blackness. in a moment, they meet my own.   ""brothers, follow our new beam's light!"" caws the outstretched voiced sister atop her peak.  one scream distances itself from the calls of blood as the figure becomes in arms reach of mine.  **""fairview, the great provider will end all that oppose him! fairview!?!""** it helplessly squeals.    the golden horde place it inside the mirrored cage, locking the chains. it's blackened body slumps down like a sack of rocks just as the masses release him. motionless and defeated, it's eyes still bat toward me through a hole in the cube.  _   a soft voice calls upon me from on high.  ""brother, send us into the eternal cosmic void. offer your gift to be eternal with the light!"" howls the voiced sister. a matchbook glides off the peak into my hands. the masses cry for salvation as i am pushed within inches of the cage. i strike the match to the sound of cheers. a black hand reaches out of its prison through a small slit, with fat fingers pointing toward me. i can see it's eyes wide with terror through the crack, glaring ahead. the light of the messenger's warm me with love as i let the match slip inside.  _  orange, red, and golden beams stream out of the cube in all directions, blinding each of my brothers faces with glee. the voices of a thousand cry with joy as one. i embrace my tear filled golden brothers, as we all feel the messenger's promise dawning. we look up to see the roof of the cavern rumbling with great force, knocking pebbles down from on high.    salvation.",0,

545339,"crime would explode because the sjws would essentially outlaw self-defense, especially against minorities.  speaking in generalities, this basically means that every hoodrat and honky in the nation would be out razing their local community, raping and pillaging. they'd need to declare martial law, but what would actually happen is that, because of the new laws, nobody could talk about the black (aka hoodrat) people committing crimes in large numbers because it would be considered racist, so the press would only talk about the honky side of it. that being the case, the new sjw overlords would look at the demographics, think that poor whites (who are mostly going to be conservative) are causing the violence, and then have all the ammo they need to outlaw conservative ideologies and anything associated with them, with the full support of much of the public. this means that they would probably ban religion as well.  meanwhile, so many police would be declared racist or classist that cops would simply stop showing up for work. this would allow hoodrats and honkies to flourish, and gangs would start taking over the cities, and the country would begin to collapse. nobody would actually rebel directly against the state, but the state would begin to fail.  millions would die in the violence and the crossfire. left unchecked because of the lack of police, the southeast would erupt in a giant flame of meth and moonshine, and millions would mistake their neighbors for cheeseburgers. in the cities, gangs would essentially burn the hoods to the ground or kill so many people that it would look like a genocide took place.  it's only when the problems in the inner city explode that the sjws would do anything, though. problem is, they wouldn't know what to do. eventually, after much talking, they would come to the conclusion that racism and the patriarchy were to blame, so all police officers who had quit would be put in prison for racial injustices. they would begin to move all the people that live in the hood, regular poor minority person (sorry, whites wouldn't get a break because they can't suffer racism) and hoodrat alike to various other parts of the country, always square in the middle of middle class suburbs that were mostly white.  as this happened, the honkies would move into the now vacated inner cities, but they would be quickly chased out when new centers dedicated to gender and lgbt studies were erected in their places. as the newly middle class former minority poor people and minority hoodrats were in their homes, the former neighbors would start to move out...that is until legislation was passed forbidding white flight. hood culture would finally have a chance to end, and while they watched the middle class people's homes being ransacked on a day to day basis because what little police forces *did* exist were being saved for incidents of self-defense or hate crimes, there would finally be reports of the violence from the hoodrats, though these would be only in minority owned papers by minority reporters because anything else would racism and illegal. however, what happens is that the sjws ignore this because these poor people talking have been brainwashed by the racism from the neighborhoods, therefore the only thing to do is to give minorities their own neighborhoods. in some places, the whites are moved, in others only the poor minority and hoodrats are moved.  meanwhile, because so many companies in the beginning had white male leadership governmentally replaced by less qualified women, lgbt, or minority people, businesses begin to fail. in other companies, the replacements were perfectly qualified, and new life is breathed back into them. as all this is going on, the economy begins to fail, and more honkies are being created by the day. meth and moonshine begin to overrun the damn country at this point, and there are so many bodies piling up from all the murders, meth lab explosions, and overdoses.  hospitals have long been overrun with the dead, dying, and injured, so the sjws ban sudafed or any similar medicine. unfortunately, honkies are amazingly creative when it comes to getting a fix, and 10 new different ways to make meth pop up within a few weeks. the nice, new places that the sjw give the minority poor and hoodrats are killing zones, but by being handed whole towns, complete with businesses, many of the formerly poor people begin to make a living for themselves. it basically turns into a mafia situation, and the people tell the uppity bitches that have moved them around half a dozen times now to go to hell. a glorious new society is born, one that is probably militantly insular, almost exclusively black, and with quite a few members that are very racist.  meanwhile, most of the rest of the country lapses into a barter system with huge swathes of no-go areas because of honkies that think you're a fucking cheeseburger. inflation goes out of control from all the welfare spending and business disruption, money becomes essentially worthless, power and utilities work intermittently, and new ways of life begin to crop up.  the sjws leave the new black enclaves alone because it would be racist and so concentrate on the areas full of honkies and whites at this point. they look at it, see that it's mostly white, and say that it's racist that there are so many whites, but no black people will come. the various native tribes have had huge tracts of their cultural territory returned, so they're not living with pale faces. and the latino and asian populations, due to their generally strong family ties and deep cultural heritages, successfully reintegrated back into their individual countries of ethnic origin the second that the sjws took over, even though most had been here for several generations.  the sjws finally give up, sobbing and wringing their hands, as they actually accidentally create what is basically a de-facto jim crow situation instead of overcoming the evils of racism, classism, and homophobia.  it takes decades for things to get back to normal, and in the wake of all of it is a backwards renaissance.",1,

771421,"i am going to take your question to mean why didn't the hindus of india conquer other areas. (they did to a small degree like afghanistan and sri lanka.)   but to answer that question don't forget that india is huge and immensely rich with natural resources. for one kingdom to rule all of india would have been a large empire. after the indo-aryan conquest, it was made up of a lot of city states and small kingdoms. somewhat like the greek speaking world. these solidified into about sixteen kingdoms and some republics by about the 500s bc. these kingdoms, naturally, often fought with and conquered each other. some were weak and some were powerful but they essentially had the same warrior caste structure with roughly similar capabilities. they were generally too concerned about each other to worry about foreign lands. for this period think of europe during the middle ages, which also had a warrior class (that is what knights were). yes, they had the crusades but, generally, those european countries were far more interested in fighting with and conquering each other. india in this period was similar in the broadest way. it was put an end to thanks to alexander. and the dueling kingdoms would reemerge again and again until british rule (and currently if we think of pakistan and india as dueling indian republics).   later, there were single indian empires that ruled all of india into afghanistan, sri lanka and beyond. such as the maurya empire (which was broken up and their were competing empires). and later, and probably more importantly, the gupta empire. the gupta empire, especially, had enormous influence in southeast asia but didn't officially conquer much outside of ""india"". the reasons are the same as above. that is a vast empire to control. india is very wealthy, in and of itself. if you had india you don't really need much else. which was always england's policy when they had their empire (they would have wanted to lose every other colony before they lost india). and why so many trading expeditions tried to make it easier to get there (columbus).   and there were a lot of conquerors who came into india. several great muslim kingdoms were set-up in india. and that added an aspect of religious conflict and another foe to be wary of in your own backyard. it helped maintain a sub-continent where the varying kingdoms were more concerned with each other than others.   on top of this, i would point out that indian water travel was geared toward rivers (and a map can show why). so, they weren't great travelers by sea. merchants traveled through out the east and into the west (but they didn't have to because everyone was usually pretty eager to get to india) but they didn't have large navies. that isn't to say they didn't have the technology but they weren't great open sea travelers. they didn't have to be. so, getting to other places with large armies and supplies would have been more of a challenge than the rewards offered.   so, i would offer a few reasons. first, for much, but not all, of the history the traditional warrior caste were busy fighting each other. or busy having uneasy truce with each other. second, the geography of ""india"" is huge and a lot to control in and of itself. adding onto that with more conquered territory would be a lot to take on with minimal rewards. third, once you have india you don't really need anything more. you are controlling a large, immensely wealthy area that also has a rich culture.   there is another aspect to this. when you have a society as rigid as india's became, with the rigid caste system, there is a lot of work that goes into maintaining that society. in a lot of ways, formal rigidity in a society is more restrictive and oppressive to the government than a more free society. but to get into that would be a lot more speculation, which isn't the point here, and i am less certain of the history so that is very much not my place to get into. hopefully someone much smarter than me can try to explain that portion of it.",0,

116935,"with all the epl buzzing, i'll talk a bit about the bundesliga:  a) **dieter hecking** brought the vw-funded wannabe big club wolfsburg once again a little closer to their target that they had in mind when they started throwing cash at everyone with two functioning legs a few years ago. and the man has a history, i think he is a severely underrated coach. he did an outstanding job at nürnberg, with young players, bad players and loan players. with 10 players under 23 in the main squad he achieved rank 6 at the end of season 10/11, the third best result nürnberg ever got in the bundesliga. the man has a plan, he has character, spooky eyebrows and in klaus allofs a very good sporting director who can show the vw gang the right direction where to throw their seemingly limitless cash (that club has the second highest pay roll in the bundesliga and not just since yesterday). i expect more to come from wolfsburg if this team stays together (meaning the officials, not the players).  b) most successful udo latteck (8 bundesliga titles) or ottmar hitzfeld (7 titles, most points per games played) most influential may have been hennes weisweiler and otto rehhagel.",0,
139953,"&gt; how do you justify the existence of god? logic and science are against it. i don't like admitting it, but that's where i stand.  science says *nothing* about the existence of god. science, **by definition**, can't. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_science) and [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logical_positivism)). this is one of the greatest fallacies of our time. much damage is done when we take only one notion of logic/knowledge from the broader human endeavor of [epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epistemology) then try to cram the whole universe into it. besides, it's logically void: **is the notion that only things that are empirically verifiable are true itself empirically verifiable?**  honestly, i used to have these distorted views of science/logic and i was, frankly, probably headed towards a faith crisis because of it. but several experiences and thing's i've studied (many from others on this sub) steered me away from that narrow chasm and helped me keep a much broader (and freeing) view of life.  now, does science/logic demand there's a god? nope. there's no compulsory logical reason to believe or disbelieve in a god. ultimately, we have to make our own decision on faith whether god exists or not.  now, how do i justify god's existence? see my responses below.  &gt; what of the biblical, and even most of the bom, stories? scientifically, they don't make sense. if i take these stories as figurative and good life lessons, doesn't that discredit any thought of an afterlife that is at the core of this church?   &gt; if this church is run by flawed men  agreed.  &gt; then how could the doctrine be perfect?  it's not. doctrine is, by necessity, a shadow of a greater truth. god uses phrases like ""unto what shall i liken x that ye might understand?"" (either in d&amp;c or in the nt by christ during his mortal ministry). god has an infinitely more grand set of truths than we do but desires us to understand it somehow. **we simply cannot comprehend everything that god does.** so what does he do? he uses parables, symbols, stories, metaphor, etc. it's the [transmission model of communication](http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/documents/short/trans.html) where the author must take something and somehow communicate something representative of it in a comprehensible manner for the audience to understand who themselves are likely to get only a portion of it as they interpret it. iow, revelation. revelation, imo, has the added benefit where god himself aids (but doesn't force) in the unpacking of the communication vs. just leaves us alone to do our best.  this nuance is explained here (in [1 cor. 13:8-12]):  &gt; 8 charity [pure love of christ] never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.  &gt; 9 for we know in part, and we prophesy in part.  &gt; 10 but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.  &gt; 11 when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child: but when i became a man, i put away childish things.  &gt; 12 for now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now i know in part; but then shall i know even as also i am known.  see that there? ""whether there be prophecies, they shall fail"" even with prophecy, we aren't guaranteed irrefutable evidence or perfection (see jonah).  but we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. it's not a binary choice. is the answer to turn full 180 deg. to science? guess what? science is far from perfect too. should we turn to just broad ethics? that has lots problems too. humanism? problems there too. etc. etc. etc. when we fracture human thought and only pick one or two ideas we miss out on the complete picture of the human experience. we have to look for a synthesis of all truths which is precisely what i think true religion seeks; and in particular the mormon religion with its emphasis on continuous revelation.  peter drew this kind of line when he said (in [2 peter 1:16]):  &gt; 16 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  that, imo, is why the scriptures and revelation point to christ as the foundation. he and his divinity are the solid bedrock of reality that we stake everything on. the rest is just to align us with him.  &gt; i don't like to be around them. i get super uncomfortable during anyone's testimony, because a) they're usually crying over nothing and b) they throw around the word 'know' rather liberally. it bothers me when a 4 year old goes up and says that they 'know the church is true' because a sibling or parent are whispering it in their ear. the word know implies so much more than 'i have a semi-firm hypothesis that this is true that can only be denied or confirmed when i kick the bucket.' yet this is essentially what they're saying. if they were to say 'i believe this is true,' that would be much more accurate. but people will argue that 'you can't tell me what i know.' and generally hate me forever.  i used to exactly have this attitude which i trace back to my dogged insistence on empiricism. how can you say you ""know"" something? you don't ""know"" that!  what i've since learned is that the problem was that **i didn't know what 'know' meant.** now, that can sound like some kind of ""depends on what the definition of ""is"" is"" nonsense but here's the thing: **there are multiple modes to ""know"" something.** ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epistemology)). this is our old dogged desire to cram everything into empiricism that is trying to co-opt this word.  what's more, christ himself, defines what he means by ""knowledge"" in the gospel:  [john 7:17]  &gt; 17 if any man will *do his will*, he shall *know of the doctrine*, whether it be of god, or whether i speak of myself.  and:  [john 8:31-32]  &gt; 31 if ye *continue in my word*, then are ye my *disciples* indeed;  &gt; 32 and ye shall *know the truth*, and the truth shall make you free.  this is an epistemological mode of knowing that is different from empiricism. christ promises a kind of experiential mode of knowledge. when i understood this, i finally started to see the beauty of a 4 year old expressing this knowledge they are acquiring *as they progress in other forms of knowledge*.   as for the blubbering person you can't understand a word from -- yeah, i still get bothered too.  :-\  &gt; maybe i'm just way too cynical for this church.  finally, i'll just encourage you to not let cynicism rule your decisions in life. that's one of the big problems with this rampant ""empiricism or bust!"" attitude. it completely falls apart when we realize that life is about developing human relationships; where empiricism can be of little use. and when we understand that religion is about developing a relationship with the divine (not just a set of ideas to have a testimony of) then it opens up whole new ways to approach religion that cynicism shuts you off to.  when i realized this i realized that critical thinking should lead me to hope or to an idea of what positive action i can take. it leads to things like honest questions, listening, understanding, decision making, faith, action, etc. it is an enabling process. cynical thinking was systematically removing my hope and was leading to negativity. it would lead to mocking, ignoring others, a focus on who is right rather than what is right, doubt, indecision, etc. **cynical thinking is a disabling process.** often people confuse the two since they both originate from independent thinking, but they lead you in opposite directions and views of the world.  in a spiritual context, skepticism without cynicism will lead to introspection which leads to repentance. but unbridled cynicism won't lead to repentance because it undercuts hope and faith (which are prerequisites to repentance).  it's a bias, yes. but if i'm going to pick a bias to have in life (because *all* world-views we choose have biases), i'm going to choose a bias towards hope and faith. hope and faith in god, myself, my family, and my neighbors. that's the world i want vs. a world and view that's biased and motivated by all-encompassing black/white cynicism and crippling pessimism.",0,

350842,"a three man team entered the cell and hand cuffed me in such a way i couldn’t have resisted without getting beat down. the good news is that this formal way is time consuming enough most guards stop doing it after a while, which makes me think my guards were freshly trained. the bad news is that by doing it this formally they have probably read my file and have a guarded respect for my capacity for violence. the really bad news is that they did this quickly and efficiently, like this happens every time like clockwork. i’d like to assume that they were fresh meat, but life has dealt me enough bad hands to stop me from ever assuming that.  i was handed off to another team of 2 men who marched me down a long hallway into a gym turned into an auditorium. this gym wouldn’t have looked out of place in any high school in america, except where one of the basketball courts would have been there were 30 metal chairs bolted to the floor were set out in a square. i was placed at the rightmost chair in one of the middle rows, my hands were fed through the back of the chair and what sounded to be a chain was affixed to the handcuffs limiting my ability to sit anywhere but upright. directly in front of the seats are some cheap folding tables and a laptop computer hooked up to a projector, which projected on the far wall.   other convicts came one by one and were sat down and shackled to the floor. i took the time and looked at the other convicts. all were wearing the same jumpsuits, prison issue orange, except  maybe 3 or 4 that were colored bright neon pink. i was surprised to see women among jumpsuits. most prisons i was in that had higher level of security were woman free. i always supposed it was to prevent fights, since prisoners will fight over the smallest thing anyway. the handcuffs of the man in front of me seemed to be slightly different than normal. where the key usually goes there was a red square that was slightly reflective and a green led. *a fingerprint scanner?*   i snapped out of this contemplation when the guards secured the last prisoner and walked away to hang out by the one of the walls.  a scarecrow of a man walked out in front of the group and stood there watching us watch him. a tight black polo shirt and khaki pants seemed slightly out of place for this guy. put a gun to my head and tell me to make up a life story for a dude in 5 seconds would definitely have the phrases : “white trash”, “methamphetamine production” “prison-graduate” with either “biker gang” or “aryan brotherhood” finishing it off. short grey hair and leathery skin told me that his job wasn’t the indoors-y type but considering how the hard professional guards deferred to him, i’m guessing that he was in charge of this fiasco.  when he spoke, it was in the same gravelly voice that came from everywhere in my room when i woke up.   “good morning ladies and gentlemen, my name is sampson grey. first the ground rules. do not talk. the first person who talks will be shocked.  this is for everyone’s bene-“ a prisoner in front of me and a few rows in cries out in pain and dances in his chair for a second. -fit…”  sampson consults a clip board lying at his feet. some guards start to set-up a cheap table next to the projector, starting up a laptop and changed a screen behind mr khaki pants.  “gentlemen: mr… um… parker has just tested us about our rules. this means the next shock will be stronger. it doesn’t matter what mister parker muttered under his breath, it just means he was caught. we said no talking, so please do not.  as i was saying before i was interrupted, this is for everyone’s benefit.   everyone is wondering where they are right now. no doubt many of you are wondering how you are alive. ultimately these questions are worthless. you will be told the details you need to know right now, and most questions will be explained eventually. “  “i’m willing to bet that everyone in this room knows the way the american justice system works. hell it would not surprise me how many of you could pass the bar from the amount of wrongful imprisonment briefs you’ve sent off in your court mandated time out from society. i’m sure there are many of you that are just cataloguing every moment of what’s happening here so you can fire off a letter to some department of corrections complaint investigator so you can sue me and every one you can for cruel and unusual punishment.”  “mr. potocki,” sampson said pointing at a bright pink jumpsuit individual a few chairs down from me. “please come here and stand in front of all the initiates” a slight buzzing sound came right before we all heard the clink of his handcuffs opening by themselves and his restraining chain falling to the floor.  mr. potocki shuffled forward to the front of the group and faced us.  i say shuffled because he had ankle bracelets on in addition to the handcuffs, and was apparently only released from the handcuffs. why he had both type of restraints is a mystery to me, since he looked like a boring accountant or maybe a mocked middle school chemistry teacher: bald spot taking over the top of the head with a bad comb over, horn rim glasses and about 60 pounds overweight. a choker of brushed silver gleamed around his throat. i assume this was the same as the one that shocked me earlier. the projector went from its generic white projection and changed to mr. potocki’s mug shot was now projected until it was 12 feet high.   “mr. ryan t. potocki, correct? khaki pants said. “i’m sampson grey, how are you?”   sampson extended his hand out to shake, like they were being introduced at a party. potocki shuffled forward and shook his hand and then backed away furtively.   “sir, i’m scared”  “well that’s normal, isn’t it fellas?” chuckles came from the background as guards laughed at the fat man’s sweat and nervousness.  “stand right there and things will go alright for you. okay, mr potocki?” sampson came forward until he was right by the closest corner of the chairs. i started to have a sinking feeling in my gut. sampson started looking like the same way the prosecutor did when he was giving the closing statements at my trial: off to the side, able to look the accused in the eyes and point menacingly but be close enough to the jury and seem like he was on our side.  sampson used a remote to advance the slide, mr potocki went from his mid-50s to about 21 in his mugshot. he looked much the same, but leaner.  maybe it was the wire rimmed glasses, or the longer hair, but he looked like a student in art history. as a younger man, he wasn’t close to handsome, but he had the look of poetry house beatniks, with stubble and purposely mussed hair.    “mr. potocki: why were you in prison?”  the slide went forward, different glasses this time and a much shorter haircut. 2 or maybe 3 years from the last picture.  “i was convicted of inappropriate acts with a minor.”  “you mean you are a child molester?”  the slide advanced again. his horn rimmed glasses he wore today were present.  we were being treated with a time lapse of a young man become a middle aged pervert.  “no, i’m not. i just like kids”  sampson started investing more scorn in his tone, “you didn’t do anything wrong?”  “n-n-n-no, it was all j-j-j just simple misunderstandings”   mr. potocki’s not so smooth delivery of his answers damned him in every person’s mind. you find out as one of your first days in prison that there was a pecking order, that even the hardened criminals look down on some individuals. child molesters are the lowest of the low. my sinking feeling upgraded itself to foreboding of doom.  judging by the cracking voice of mr. potocki, i’m guessing he felt it much more than i did.  “simple misunderstandings? 13 simple misunderstandings?”  sampson pointed the remote and pressed the button harder, like he was firing a gun at a moving target. now pictures of girls and boys started cycling. none over the age of 10. we had a half a second apiece but that time felt like forever.  “ i don’t know why the parents took their kids away from me… the kids, they loved… me…”   mr. potocki sensed the room’s mood and trailed off on his last statement. he was sweating and shifting his feet like he would rather he be anywhere but in front of us. i sympathized, you couldn’t pay me enough to be sitting here.   sampson shook himself, held his head high and turned to face mr. potocki.   “ mr potocki: you were convicted of kidnapping of a minor, rape and second degree murder of amanda jennings.” a picture of the sweetest little blond girl is 12 feet high is now projected. i don’t know if it’s the pigtails, or the seeing her happy eating a melting popsicle as she enjoyed a day at the park that touches my heart in a way i haven’t felt in years. i take that back, it’s the smile she has, face smeared with purple juices and not a care in the world as she is with her family.   i’ve done wrong in my life, but the hate i have for mr. potocki right now is so overwhelming i wish they would let me have a few minutes alone with him in a room without windows and cameras.  “a jury of your peers sentenced you to a term of not less than your life without the possibility of parole.  have any comment on that?”  “n-n-n-no.”  “tell me mr potocki: do you believe in god?” my sinking feeling is back, the visceral hate was slowly ebbing away.  “no, i don’t.”  “anything you would like to say to the group? any last words?”  “last words? what are you talking about?”  sampson grey looked at him with a wolf’s grin and said, “not very original, but it will do.”   mr. potocki’s face was still surprised when the silver necklace around his neck detonated.",1,

200383,"yah, i was just reading on generating spheres from cubic textures, it seems like the opposite might be doable.  but then i was thinking there would be logical issues to overcome.  the corners of the sphere cube are all outer layers, but when you zoom into the ground, everything is angled up in relation to the player, so the cube corners don't really have a representation. they would be the sides of the chunks.  there's also the issue of digging through the core, and the gravity and 'down' should all flip around at some point, so the only way i think this could be handled is by limiting depth the player can traverse.  do you just check what portion of the terrain is being looked at and map it to a section of the zoomed out world? or am i thinking about this completely wrong.  in your videos do you have statically sized worlds, or do they go on and generate terrain forever?  edit: basically i'm not so much concerned about the atmosphere effects i guess, but how you map the terrain that would normally be completely flat onto a spherical shape. and then after that handle the player being able to traverse it in a circle, start at one point, and eventually end back up at the same point if they don't change direction.",0,

316415,"so out of the major craft beers out of charleston, (holy city, westbrook, palmetto, coast, and frothy beard) holy city definitely takes the crown as far as craftsmanship, knowhow, and general artfulness in creating their brews. the dudes absolutely know what they're doing both from a brewing aspect and a business aspect. they're great guys to hang out and drink with at the brewery and they never shy away from telling you exactly how they brewed the beer you're currently enjoying.  on a bit of a negative note, i am very much against westbrook. first off, the white thai is not what i feel a beer should taste like and while their ipa is decent it doesn't compare to frothy beard and certainly not coast, who's ipa is the best in charleston, if not the state.  the other beers they offer, according to multiple stories i've heard, are not in fact theirs and on top of that don't compare to the other local breweries.   feel free to correct the story if i am wrong, but from what i have been told, westbrook is a multi-million dollar brewery built by a rich dad for his spoiled son who won a few contests with the white thai. they went into manufacturing and canning (they don't sell bottles) along with essentially spamming their beers to everywhere in town they could within 6 months. if you go to the brewery it's very much a seersucker, boat shoes, uppity crowd. on top of all of it, the story says they hired 4 master brewers from sweetwater in ga, had them develop another 5 beers for them, started the manufacturing process, then fired all of them, essentially stealing their brews. now, i've never read any reports of this officially, but i've heard if from plenty of locals, so i can't site any sources. it's up to you to decide. they're well known simply because they push their brews very hard, not necessarily because of notoriety based on craftsmanship. i've often found the individuals ordering the westbrooks are drinking it because they're hopping on the craft brew bandwagon, not because they have a very extensive knowledge of beer and why they like certain beers.  palmetto in my opinion can't really be considered a ""craft brew"". they have chosen the manufacturing route it seems and their beers can be compared to ""craft brews"" owned by the big-2 such as blue moon or leinenkugel. they're easy to find and cheaper than the others, but you're never going to buy one and send it to a friend because it blew your mind.  coast is hard to get, but always good. they're very small. they like their beers bitter and in my opinion they hold or compete for the crown on the light end of the spectrum (ipas, pale ales, pilsners, etc.). they also throw a super kick ass beer festival in late february known as [brewvival](http://brewvival.com/). seriously go to that shit!! all you can drink of one of a kind beers with over 60 brewers bringing multiple one time batches!!! it's a dream come true.  i've only tried a few frothy beard beers, but they're good and could move in a similar direction as holy city. their beer definitely holds up, but it remains to be seen if the owners are business savvy enough to compete with the others in town. they are other younger local brew heads trying to follow the route of holy city whilst keeping their own identity. i've got nothing negative to say about these guys or their beer.  **tl;dr** *a breakdown of the charleston breweries:* holy city takes the crown with coast and frothy beard in close following.",0,

316069,"**[wp] an immortal man meets death.**  she sat down across from him and fanned her yellow sundress across her knees, smoothing down the fabric with deliberate finger strokes so that the cotton spilled over the edge of the wooden seat.  her hat, widebrimmed and made of the same sunshine color, was borderline ostentatious.  he was not expecting her today, but, then again, he never was.  she liked to flit in and out of his life like a butterfly, and over time, he’d grown accustomed to her whimsey, even if her presence still evoked a small sense of annoyance every time she made an appearance.  “are you here for business or pleasure?” he asked, capping his pen and setting aside the newspaper crossword.  he reached for his cup of coffee, which had grown cold, he noted. after swallowing the liquid, he met her gaze.  a small smile that was reflected in her blue eyes tugged at her glossy pink lips. she let the moment linger then pass before reaching up to remove her hat and shake out her long black hair. she finger-combed the strands, pinching some in her fingers like a paintbrush, and brought it up to her face to examine, looking for split ends.  “business, i’m afraid.”  she dropped the chunk of hair and leaned towards him, propping her head in her right hand with her bare elbow on the table.  her eyes flirted with him for a moment before she purposefully let hand guide her head in the direction of the man standing in line for coffee.  he followed her line of sight and raised his eyebrows, “he’s young.”  “they all look young to you.”  she had a point, he silently conceded, but she’d known what he’d meant. the young man, early to mid-twenties, was shifting from foot to foot in a dance only performed by those who had not learned how to wait. his pants looked uncomfortably tight, and the green t-shirt he wore only emphasized a slight fat bulge where the younger man’s stomach slumped over the waist of his pants, a girth that wouldn’t have been there if he hadn’t vainly chosen to squeeze into a smaller size.    “how does it happen?”  “brain aneurysm.  you’d be surprised at the number of people who die from those while drinking coffee.”  “a rather boring way to go.  i’m surprised you showed up so far in advance.”  she glanced at the watch on her left wrist. “i’m not that ahead of schedule.  besides, you know why i’m really here.” they both turned to each other at the same time.  she was still smiling in that teasing way of hers, but a line of irritation was making its way down his face from his eyebrows to the slight frown on his face.  “i’m not in the mood today, morana.”  “oh please,” she scoffed, flicking her hair over her shoulder. “every day is the same to you by now.  you can’t expect me to believe that you still have bad days.”  “every day i see you is a bad day.”  “that hurt.”  he reached for his coffee to take another sip, examining her over the white rim.  she had not lost her faint smile, despite her claim that his words had hurt her.  it irked him.  “good,” he said, lowering his cup.    the porcelain mug barely had time to tinkle against its matching saucer before her pale hand reached out to clasp his, drawing it away from the cup and onto the table where she held it tightly.  “you should quit resisting.”  her thumb began to gently massage the pulse in his wrist, and he closed his eyes. the sun outside was as bright as morana’s dress, and he could feel its warmth, magnified by the cafe’s window, on his left cheek. however, a shiver with through his body as he felt morana lift his hand and kiss where her thumb had been. he imagined her bent over his hand, hair long hair swishing forward like a curtain to hide the butterfly kisses she was leaving on his wrist.  he opened his eyes and met her gaze. “stop. let me go.”  her answer was whispered across his skin, “never.”   there was a thunk. a clatter. glass breaking. silence. the sound of dripping liquid. then an exclamation and a cacophony of noise.  morana sighed, closing her eyes.  when she opened them, the smile was gone. “next time,” she said.   she stood, grabbed her hat in both hands, and plopped it into place on the crown of her head. after tossing her hair over her shoulders, she spun on her heel and marched towards the crowd of people gathered around the twenty-something, who was slumped over a table, bits of a coffee mug scattered around him.   she paused a few steps away and turned back to peer at him over her shoulder. “next time,” she repeated, her voice hinting at a promise he knew she would never keep.  next time would not be *his* time.  he sighed, reached for his crossword, and uncapped his pen.",0,

733083,"[finally completed.]  there's a long section of i-81 in the middle of virginia where the distance between radio stations stretches almost as far as the mile markers between rest areas. i found myself engulfed in that void as i drove north towards jersey city.  just one day prior i had dropped the funds for a rent-a-wreck to columbia, south carolina for a job interview. the area had been the origin for my mother's side of the family. now i returned from there, still jobless, in a well-used powder blue 1975 cadillac calais.   ""this is the only car i have on the lot,"" the old man from the local rent-a-wreck assured me. i had roused him out of the apartment that sat on top of his storefront even though it was after hours. the cadillac wasn't much better than the now broken down 1985 toyota tercel they had given me in jersey. it was now my only affordable option. though my mom's gas card would bare the brunt of the trip.  family was why i was determined to get home. it was 3 am, just 10 hours after i had learned my grandmother was on her deathbed. my cell phone was in a similar state, moaning that the power level was now down to 7%. to top it all off, the cigarette lighter spit fire every time i force fed it a dc charger cable. i could never get the phone to acknowledge that the old car had any connection to the 21st century.  there was nothing of interest on the fm dial. the few music options available had almost sent me snoring into the guard rail. i hadn't been the happiest of people lately and needed someone else's voice to drown out my own inner dialog.  i switched to am and found that depending on the heading of my car, i could either pick up a talk radio station out of charlotte or a station out of cleveland. both were running the same spooky ufo conspiracy show.  ""jesus loves you!""  those weren't the words i expected when i dialed back towards station 1100. i just wanted to hear more about big foot.  ""well that's nice to hear,"" my voice remained calm despite the fact my fingers had jumped off the controls.  ""it's not just nice to hear, come experience the love for yourself.""   now that was an odd coincidence. i was definitely awake now.  ""we're on the interstate island, just past exit 213, you can't miss u...."" then the signal faded. the woman's voice had been distinctly southern though i couldn't place which region the accent came from.  what kind of religious organization would be allowed to use an interstate island? it's hard enough to keep memorial crosses standing on the side of the road. did the radio answer me?   ""15 miles to go, at least i will be awake with anticipation.""  i probably would have missed the island the voice had mentioned if it hadn't been for that peculiar moon. my trip had been cold and cloudy for most of the way. everyone sees objects in randomness but that grouping of clouds that covered the moon looked like a cross had been cut out of them.  the moon glowed white through the slits and cast a paleness onto the hill and trees that comprised the island.  that was when i noticed an suv, two cars, and 3 tractor trailer trucks all pulled to the median. one truck had its flashers on but the rest were dark and empty. the moon cross blew back into darkness as i noticed how slow i was already going. i sighed and pulled the cadillac into a spot behind one of the trucks and turned on my flashers.  ""what am i doing?""  i left the car running as i searched the dial for the station that had brought me here.  ""shhhh! turn that off!"" my bowels groaned for a rest area as i looked up to see the bearded man in the skoal bandit branded cap peering into my window. his hair was dark. he wore a flannel overcoat and a frightening grimace.   ""turn that shit off. they'll hear us!""  that was when the car engine died. if it hadn't died at that moment i would have made a cinematic exit, pushing an invisible clutch, shifting a non-existent manual gear shift, and screeching tires into the dark night. instead i turned off the radio.  ""get out of the car. hurry!""  i wasn't getting out of the car. not for this guy. instead i was cranking the engine over and over hoping it would catch.   ""suit yourself dumb ass!"" the man hissed and smacked the top of the cadillac. i saw him run up to the truck with the blinking flashers. he gave me a sad look before he threw himself up in the cab. within a few seconds the truck was on the interstate and i was alone again.  i decided i would stay in the car until morning. moon cross or not, the trucker's behavior was enough to weld the cadillac doors shut. surely he had called the police by now and it would only be a matter of minutes before they arrived. my own phone proved useless as i stared at its dark screen.  the red ford focus that appeared in my rear-view two minutes later changed my mind. it pulled in behind me and all i could see were its lights. i gingerly opened the heavy metal doors of the car and stepped out. i was unable to make out the driver so i took a few steps forward.   it was a blond headed woman. i guessed at her beauty despite the fact her face was hidden in the night. i guessed wrong.  ""are you here to leave your container my brother?"" i wasn't prepared for the raspy voice or red dots i could see glinting where eyes should be.   i started to run back towards the cadillac when i noticed something darker than it should be underneath the car's body. it only took me a second to course correct again.   my mistake was heading into the woods of the interstate island instead of retreating down the highway. perhaps the primal part of me saw cover as the best chance to evade whatever i felt was now chasing me.  branch after branch slapped me in the face and torso as i made my way up the small hill.  the air was colder up here and the trees made it seem darker.   as i crested the island i could see the two sides of the interstate twisting off into the fog. it surprised me to see a long trail of white head lights on both sides of the interstate. two long lines of cars were now queuing up to the island i now stood on.  ""jesus loves you."" a female voice whispered. i jumped at first and then quickly scanned the darkness for the source.   a few feet ahead under a large oak tree a woman sat slumped. i took a few steps closer and could perceive she was not well. her face was pale and i could smell the blood before i could see it in the darkness.  the trees around me were starting to rustle with activity. i hoped for it to be the wind but no fresh air touched my face to clear the smell of iron from my nostrils.  ""what can i do?"" i cried.  ""there's nothing... nothing we can do but pray.""  ""pray?  i'm running!""  ""you will die... you will die unsaved josh.""  the edge of the hill and the lighter sky behind it provided the backdrop for the hideous shapes that sprung up from the wooded treeline. misshapen limbs and bodies were silhouetted against the lighter sky.   i wanted to panic. i didn't want to die. i wanted to run but we were surrounded.  ""pray with me josh. please. i love you.""  ""how do you know my name?""  she turned her face towards mine and i realized her age.   ""grandmother? how did you get here?""  ""god in heaven, we pray for your divine protection from evil. i know i am to die tonight but please see my grandson safely home.""  i joined her there under the large oak on my knees. we prayed with a ferocity reserved for saints and sinners near death.  i don't know if the moon cross returned but in my mind i could feel its light. it was kind of like the way sunshine feels on a summer day when you stare directly at it with your eyelids closed.  ""god please forgive me for the sins i have committed these past few years. i've been so lost. forgive me for the people i've harmed through action and inaction. please jesus save me. i accept jesus as my savior...""  the inhuman sounds grew closer. i could hear their breathing. no... i could feel it! i kept my eyes tightly closed and continued praying. then i heard the screams of a thousand monsters as the light intensified and i lost consciousness.   when i woke up at the rest area i was dismayed to find that i had urinated myself. the interior of the cadillac was none the worse for it. luckily it was early enough in the morning for me to sneak in and change clothes.   the dream had been so real. i suddenly remembered my grandmother. i plugged my phone into a socket on a light post and impatiently waited for it to charge enough to boot.  finally i made the call.  ""we tried to call you several times last night josh. she died in her sleep but she was thinking of you. we heard her say your name. she loved you so much.""  later on the trip home i saw a jackknifed truck had filtered traffic down to one lane before stopping it. being one of the first cars to arrive i saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance. i shuddered as i saw the skoal bandit cap lying bloody on the interstate.  i bowed my head and prayed for his family. i vowed i would find out who this man was and visit his family. he had tried to save my life.",0,

468354,"the elemental hall buzzed with life as all manner wizard from every class and nation assembled in the circular room, seating themselves upon a flat brass ring; of which the circumference spanned the rooms edge.  as the room settled, the incandescent orb atop the domed celestial ceiling faded and a withered old man emerged from an aquatic blue dimensional rift and into the center of the hall.  ""listene to myne words! upone thys meet, we shalle present our power for judgemente of thys council!"" the old man spoke in what was a strange accent, neither foreign nor ancient... an accent not of this universe.  firstly, the storm elementalist descended from the brass ring and into the center stage. he brought up great wet clouds of vapour and collided lightning into ice, wind into fire and briny ocean waters into molten earth. as his performance ended, the turbulent weather calmed and receded into his open palms as an eel would into its lair.  secondly, a life contortionist sleekly shifted into the stage. her body writhed and flexed, warping into itself and reforming in greater and smaller sizes. she multiplied into a flock of geese that waddled in a circle, then liquified into a bloody mess and reformed as a walrus, bellowing a mighty roar inside the hall. as she reunited with her human form, she tiredly loped back to her seat, clicking and popping as her joints and bones calibrated to her bipedal physique.  the hall turned now to a man wearing a top hat and black cape, he seemed in awe and utterly unaware of his turn to perform.  ""performe your magicks, wizarde!"" the old man scorned.  the man snapped to attention, looking about the room and clearing his throat. he awkwardly slid off of the brass seat and waddled over to the stage as the blood flowed back into his poor legs.  ""i will need a volunteer"" said the man. the council looked to one another and a strange half goat, half man wizard stepped forward. he stood before the man and waited, somewhat cautiously.  ""is this a penny behind your horn?"" the man said, indeed retrieving a penny from the wizards horn. ""nyeh eh eh eh eh!"" the goatman erupted, kicking a single hoof and then stepping back into his seat.  ""for my next act of magic, i shall pull a rabbit from my hat!"" the old man frowned, looking the man up and down.  the magician reached into his top hat and rummaged around for a moment or two, his hand desperately scavenging the corners of the tubular top. suddenly the mans hand shot through the top of his hat, a single white glove protruding into open sight. feint laughter erupted.  the magician smiled kindly, then removed a baseball cap from his coat. as he lifted it to his head, a small fluffy rabbit plopped out onto his parted hair and looked about, its tiny pink nose twitching in excitement.  ""the beaste was in hys hat thys whole tyme!"" the old man exclaimed.  the magician shot the old man a disappointed look, then shook the top hat, flopping out about eight obese bunny rabbits which lazily hopped about.  the council gasped.  ""and for my final trick, i shall cut myself in half!"" as these words left his mouth, he went pale. he patted down his vest and a dry breath escaped his quivering lips. he solemnly looked down and regained his composure, the council sitting upon the ends of their seats. from his cape, he drew a great scimitar, easily the size of a mans leg and glinting in the faint light with a wicked shine.  he lifted the sword up and began to swing it about, gaining momentum, faster and faster. his cap and cape fell free and bundles of silk handkerchiefs, juggling knives, playing cards and even a white tipped wand scattered about as he twirled.  as he reached full speed, he began to move the sword up, spinning upon its centrifugal force. it seemed he full well intended to drop the spinning sword upon himself, cutting himself in half!  ""halte thys madness!"" the old man cried.  suddenly, the sword came free of his grasp and came down, steel singing as it sliced through the magician from head to toe. the magician fell to the ground and a pool of blood sprayed outwards, the scimitar bouncing across the stone floor and coming to a rest.  the council rose to their feet in horror, faces aghast. but suddenly, the magician moved, his battered frame seemingly to rejoin itself just under his tattered clothes. a man crawled out from under the pile, but only half a man. his legs remained, still and dead and riddled with cuts and gashes.

""madness!"" the council cried!

""you have been a wonderful audience, but now i must bid you farewell!"" with that, he threw down a cache of powder and disappeared into a cloud of smoke, seemingly fading from sight if it were not for the crew of stage hands desperately reeling the magician in with wires.  the hall erupted in bolts of energy and sparks, the magician and his crew fled through the door and away, all the while the old man just sat and scratched his chin, a slight grin peeling across his wrinkled face.",0,

541595,"she sat down across from him and fanned her yellow sundress across her knees, smoothing down the fabric with deliberate finger strokes so that the cotton spilled over the edge of the wooden seat.  her hat, widebrimmed and made of the same sunshine color, was borderline ostentatious.  he was not expecting her today, but, then again, he never was.  she liked to flit in and out of his life like a butterfly, and over time, he’d grown accustomed to her whimsey, even if her presence still evoked a small sense of annoyance every time she made an appearance.  “are you here for business or pleasure?” he asked, capping his pen and setting aside the newspaper crossword.  he reached for his cup of coffee. it had grown cold. after swallowing the liquid, he met her gaze.  a small smile that was reflected in her blue eyes tugged at her glossy pink lips. she let the moment linger then pass before reaching up to remove her hat and shake out her long black hair. she finger-combed the strands, pinching some in her fingers like a paintbrush, and brought it up to her face to examine, looking for split ends.  “business, i’m afraid.”  she dropped the chunk of hair and leaned towards him, propping her head in her right hand with her bare elbow on the table.  her eyes flirted with him for a moment before she purposefully let hand guide her head in the direction of the man standing in line for coffee.  he followed her line of sight and raised his eyebrows, “he’s young.”  “they all look young to you.”  she had a point, he silently conceded, but she’d known what he’d meant. the young man, early to mid-twenties, was shifting from foot to foot in a dance only performed by those who had not learned how to wait. his pants looked uncomfortably tight, and the green t-shirt he  wore only emphasized a slight fat bulge where the younger man’s stomach slumped over the waist of his pants, a girth that wouldn’t have been there if he hadn’t vainly chosen to squeeze into a smaller size.    “how does it happen?”  “brain aneurysm.  you’d be surprised by the number of people who die from those while drinking coffee.”  “a rather boring way to go.  i’m surprised you showed up so far in advance.”  she glanced at the watch on her left wrist. “i’m not that ahead of schedule.  besides, you know why i’m really here.” they both turned to each other at the same time.  she was still smiling in that teasing way of hers, but a line of annoyance was making its way down his face from his eyebrows to his slight frown.  “i’m not in the mood today, morana.”  “oh please,” she scoffed, flicking her hair over her shoulder. “every day is the same to you by now.  you can’t expect me to believe that you still have bad days.”  “every day i see you is a bad day.”  “that hurt.”  he reached for his coffee to take another sip, examining her over the white rim.  she had not lost her faint smile, despite her claim that his words had hurt her.  it irked him.  “good,” he said, lowering his cup.    the porcelain mug barely had time to tinkle against its matching saucer before her pale hand reached out to clasp his, drawing it away from the cup and onto the table where she held it tightly.  “you should quit resisting.”  her thumb began to gently massage the pulse in his wrist, and he closed his eyes. the sun outside was as bright as morana’s dress, and he could feel its warmth, magnified by the cafe’s window, on his left cheek. however, a shiver with through his body as he felt morana lift his hand and kiss where her thumb had been. he imagined her bent over his hand, her long hair swishing forward to hide the butterfly kisses she was leaving on his wrist.  he opened his eyes and met her gaze. “stop. let me go.”  her answer was whispered across his skin, “never.”   there was a thunk. a clatter. glass breaking. silence. the sound of dripping liquid. then an exclamation and a cacophony of noise.  morana sighed, closing her eyes.  when she opened them, the smile was gone. “next time,” she said.   morana stood, grabbed her hat in both hands, and plopped it into place on the crown of her head. after flicking her hair over her shoulders, she spun on her heel and marched towards the crowd of people gathered around the twenty-something, who was slumped over a table, bits of a coffee mug scattered around him.   she paused a few steps away and turned back to peer at him over her shoulder. “next time,” she repeated, her voice hinting at a promise he knew she would never keep.  next time would not be *his* time.  he sighed, reached for his crossword, and uncapped his pen.  edit: grammar, and i took u/dreadandbutter's advice.",0,

[""west end blues""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wpcbiesesi)  this is one of armstrong's most relevant recordings, featuring one of the most impassioned trumpet solos of a long and influential career. armstrong is a major locus for where dixieland jazz, ragtime, blues and a broad range of pop influences all meet and form what we think of as jazz, and he synthesizes all that while remaining wholly accessible.  **bebop**: charlie parker - [""koko""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okrnwe6gi70)  charlie parker was one of the most mercurial figures in popular music, a brilliant musician who galvanized jazz with his powerful, energetic soloing. this track is one of his best and a great introduction into the more free-form, abstract music that characterized bebop, a sound that broke jazz from the stale swing era. it includes a lot of what made this music powerful, with complex melodic lines and virtuoso solos.  **modal jazz**: miles davis - [""so what""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dec8nqt6rrk)  davis was a figure who seemed able to completely reinvent jazz every decade or so, causing revolutions with bebop, modal jazz, fusion and big band style jazz. this track is the opening from *kind of blue*, an album that is a guidebook to modal jazz, and is widely considered a quintessential work of popular music.  **fusion**: mahavishnu orchestra - [""vital transformation""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dau5o246vsa)  fusion jazz combined rock beats and instrumentation with jazz improvisation and technical virtuosity. the genre had been brewing for awhile before guitarist john mclaughlin formed this group, but mahavishnu's first album *inner mounting flame* (which this track is off of) is a big part of why we consider it a distinct form of music. marked by frenetic solos and rapid-fire beats, it hits a sweet spot between rock aggression and jazz precision.  **outlaw country**: waylon jennings - [""lonesome, on'ry and mean""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1mw4immumq)  during a time in the late '60s and early '70s when country radio was dominated by a slick, nashville-produced sound that turned country into string-laden pop ballads, a group of traditionalist such as jennings, merle haggard, david allen coe and willie nelson worked to keep country closer to its working-class roots, while also incorporating rock band inspired instrumentation. jennings is a great intro, a brilliant interpreter of songs. this track pure country craftsmanship, standing out even outside the context of its era.  **bluegrass**: flatt &amp; scruggs - [""foggy mountain breakdown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_y3mnj-8la)  if it helps, think of bluegrass as the heavy metal of early country music, often (though certainly not always) waylaying song craft for speed, noise and technical virtuosity. flatt &amp; scruggs helped popularize the style as much as anyone, with a popular television show in the early 50s and a number of country hits. this track was their theme, and helped with a bluegrass revival in the late '60's when it was used in the chase scenes in *bonnie &amp; clyde* (and subsequently every parody of that done since).  **delta blues**: robert johnson - [""hellhound on my trail""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uvgh9jqsnq)  another lightening rod figure in popular music, johnson recorded only a handful of tracks in his short life, but those (especially those featured on the classic *king of the delta blues singers* compilation) have become woven into the dna of blues and all the popular music that sprung from that. delta blues is as much a regional definition as a defined musical style, but it's hard to argue johnson as its seminal figure, a masterful guitarist who created often haunting music from a variety of sources, both contemporary and traditional. this track is a spooky masterpiece of tone, and a great into to both johnson and delta blues.  **chicago blues**: magic sam - [""sweet home, chicago""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83rkem7s5es)  incorporating electric guitars, danceable rhythms, horns and extended solos, chicago-style blues was an urbanized, night-club ready version of the blues that expanded the genre's boundaries from its country roots. magic sam was a perfect definition of the style, particularly of his classic *west side soul* album. this track was penned by robert johnson, but sam did the definitive version.  **cosmopolitan country**: charlie rich - [""behind closed doors""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ieffa4tmi)  remember that slick, string-laden country sound i mentioned the outlaw country crowd rebelled against? it also produced some great songs on its own. often disparaged as inauthentic and more pop than country, cosmopolitan country still produced tracks that seemed to transcend genre, and could be performed as easily by an r&amp;b artist as someone with a southern twang. rich's ""behind closed doors"" is about as perfect as the genre got.   **california singer/songwriter ('70s)**: joni mitchell - [""free man in paris""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqj6h8kpkiq)  inspired by rock, pop and folk, the california singer/songwriter scene was often disparaged but was broadly influential. jackson brown and warren zevon both fit into the style, but mitchell was the most musically ambitious. this track was a modest radio hit. it's sunny and catchy, but also a complex and deeply felt piece of songwriting.   **psychedelic ('60s)**: the byrds - [""i see you""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwcnxd6idui)  psychedelic was rock music inspired by hallucinogenics, but also by free jazz, musique concrète and other avant-gard influences. the byrds were as much a folk-rock group as a psychedelic act, but they weaved these styles together with ease and created often brilliant, harmonious pop music. this track is hardly the most psychedelic of their works (i'd also recommend jefferson airplane's first album as an introduction to the genre), but it hits the looseness off the style just right without wandering off into stranger territory.  **country rock ('70s)**: new riders of the purple sage - [""henry""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4gscuwnn9a)  while outlaw country was country artist inspired by rock attitudes and music, country rock was usually rock artist who grew up on country. the new riders were one of the most steadfast in the genre, sharing a close relationship with the grateful dead (jerry garcia performed on their first album and the bands often toured together), and sharing a strong musicianship (though nrps focused on machine-tight songwriting). this track sums up the humor, drug obsessions and radio-friendly hooks of the genre.  **alternative country**: uncle tupelo - [""graveyard shift""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jko_1rvclok)  in the late '80s and early '90s, a number of punk and indie rock acts started experimenting with traditional country sounds, building out what would soon be called alternative country. uncle tupelo opened the gates for the genre with their first album, which this rip-roarer was the opening track, full of a kind of aggression totally missing from popular country music at the time. it splits the difference between punk assault and country heartbreak.  **r&amp;b ('60s)**: otis redding - [""sittin' on the dock of the bay""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucmuhysr-e4)  one of the most vital and diverse styles of popular music, rhythm and blues has been through so many permutations it's hard to define it as a single genre. inspired by blues but incorporating pop melodies and classic ballads, the genre has mutated and reinvented itself consistently for 70 years now. this track was redding's masterpiece, a deceptively simple track that has never been outdone and defines the genre at one of its creative heights.  **r&amp;b (modern)**: d'angelo - [""brown sugar""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzwo3hgrda)  r&amp;b lapsed into a creative stagnation after a massive rise in popularity in the 1990s, but restless artists still found ways to update the genre, often by reaching back into its deep history for inspiration. inspired by classic soul and the musical landscapes of marvin gaye, d'angelo revitalized the genre with his first two albums, *brown sugar* and *voodoo*. the title track off the first album, this track exemplifies the smooth, seductive sounds of '90s r&amp;b removed of the flamboyant excesses that plagued r&amp;b in this era.  **soul ('60s)**: sam &amp; dave - [""hold on, i'm comin'""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=areppyqf5uw)  soul took the rhythms of r&amp;b, the passion of gospel and the energy of jazz and mixed it into a powerful dance hall music that became so entwined with r&amp;b that the two virtually became the same genre. while the genre lines get a little blurry around the edges, there are some artists who are definitively soul. sam &amp; dave recorded a number of great hits for stax, many of them (such as this number) produced by a young isaac hayes. many know the track for its appearance in the film *the blues brothers* and the funk beat and super-catchy horn lines make for a great intro.  **neo-soul**: kem - [""i can't stop loving you""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kchpuy0ngbk)  neo-soul is kind of the alt-country of modern r&amp;b, rarely producing hits but pulling from the best traditions for some of the most creative work in the genre. drawing as much from modern hip-hop production as classic soul and r&amp;b, it's produced a few great artists and balladeers. this smooth-as-silk track from kem borders on cheesy but is so heartfelt the straightforward it makes a good entryway.  **garage rock ('60s)**: the barracudas - [""baby get lost""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-ta12qv0xs)  everyone loved the beatles, but every boy who could afford an electric guitar in the early '60s wanted to be the kinks. garage was the punk rock of the era, so much so that the more you get into the history of it you stop seeing punk as something that just exploded and more of a natural progression of a long running rock tradition. plenty of great bands here that have gone on to become cult acts, such as the sonics, the creation, the monks and so forth. i chose this track for it's (relative to the genre) complex guitar lick and catchy simplicity.  **garage rock (modern)**: bass drum of death - [""dregs""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-bvuefdwcy)  the attraction of bashing out straightforward rock numbers in dingy basements and rehearsal spaces with your drunk friends never grows old. with a minor revival kicked off by the white stripes and the hives now pretty much forgotten, garage is still kicking around and always seems on the verge of bursting forward again. this track shows the genre a little more sophisticated than it was 50 years ago, but still keeping it basic.  **proto-punk**: richard hell &amp; the voidoids - [""blank generation""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp3x-vdob44)  proto-punk is one of those labels that gets applied in hindsight to tie together a scene that was moving toward a certain goal that wasn't quite clear at the time. when this came out, it was just called punk (so were the talking heads, by the way), but that label just doesn't seem to fit anymore. basically, it's an artier, more sophisticated garage rock that created the groundwork for the punk scene, if not always punk music itself. richard hell created remarkably little music for having such a broad influence. this track became his, and for awhile the early punk scene's, anthem.  **punk**: the clash - [""janie jones""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyow0tf6n-q)  the stereotypical story is that as rock music became bloated, so focused on extended compositions and endless guitar solo noodling, a backlash brewed in lower-class neighborhoods both in the us and england, bringing rock back to its three chord roots. it's a little more complicated than that and prog rock got a bad rep out of the whole thing, but however it came about we ended up with punk. the ramones were one of the first to really define the style, but london's the clash were the soul of what the genre became, complete with its political radicalism, straight forward sound and early rock 'n' roll inspired melodies (the reggae and roots influences also spread sporadically through punk's dna). this track, the album opener on the uk version, became one of the touchstones of early british punk.  **hardcore punk**: black flag - [""nervous breakdown""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=302oezspcqe)  even a stripped down music can get more stripped down. the gangsta rap to early punk's hip hop, hardcore punk began in disaffected urban areas in the us, major scenes really building up in los angeles and washington dc. the music favored aggression over melody, a shorter-faster-louder aesthetic that burned up quick but left a pretty cool looking corpse. black flag became one of punk rock's standard-bearers, blazing a trail that would have a major influence in both the genre itself as well as independent music in general, especially after henry rollins was hired on as lead singer. this track, with vocals by keith morris of the circle jerks, has all the bearings of hardcore while still being frenzied little earworm.  **progressive rock**: yes - [siberian khatru](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0hnir6jywu)  prog suffered under a bad rap for a long time, labeled as pretentious musical self-indulgence more focused on extended solos and blathering concept albums falling into the deep end of meaningless abstraction than on creating anything that resembled real human music. that's all vaguely true, to a point, but it also ignores the vast merits of the genre, stacked full with some of the best musicians rock ever produced. yes is an easy entry point, with their soaring vocals, rushing baselines and rick wakeman's dazzling keyboard work. this track, off of 1972's *close to the edge* shows both the ambition of the music, but also tightly focused compositional skills.   **new wave**: blondie - [""heart of glass""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa911_8tp2s)  it can be said that ""new wave"" was created as a marketing term to take the more accessible bands out of new york's punk scene and actually get them to sell records. the label has grown to incorporate a subset of bands with ties to punk, but who incorporated elements of pop, dance and electronic music into their sound. blondie hit all the touch points of new wave, casting a wide net through recent popular music history. this track is partly their take on disco and shows an accessible genre at its most accessible.  **post-punk**: gang of four - [""damaged goods""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bycqovrmovo)  post-punk existed almost as soon as the first punk singles came out (wire's *pink flag* came out the same year as the ramones *leave home* and *rocket to russia* albums), basically becoming a college-educated version of punk, more experimental and artsy but sticking to the aggressive, stripped down, cut-to-the-bone aesthetic that was punk's primary contribution to popular music. it also didn't skimp of the politics, as the british group gang of four shows. incorporating dance beats and funk into a punk frame, the band had a major influence in that is still being felt in indie rock today. this track is their debut single and a caustic little kiss-off.  **surf rock ('60s)**: the centurians - [""bullwinkle pt. 2""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outyvah8xxk)  surf rock is a (very) rare example of a music developing around a sporting trend that didn't end up as a total historical dead end. that you can pretty much trace the entire style to dick dale is also interesting. defined by fast, reverb-heavy guitars (if you've ever seen dale play, he used heavy gauge strings and grinds his picks to dust) eastern-inspired musical scales and a frantic sound meant to invoke the feel of a surfer riding a wave, surf had a brief popularity in the late '50s and early '60s but was soon eclipsed by the british invasion bands. dale's signature track, ""misirlou"" came back into the public consciousness thanks to its inclusion on the *pulp fiction* soundtrack. i chose this, that compilation's other surf rock number, to show off the more dreamy, watching-the-ocean-at-sunset tones the style was capable of.   **surf rock (modern)**: man or astro-man? - [""the heavies""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou9_3zjlu60)  surf rock got a second life in the 1990s during the alternative music boom, drawn back in and mashed up with a wide variety of trash culture it was connected to by association, often played with a punk attitude. man or astro-man? where one of the best to come out of the brief revival, wrapping surf up in a '50's science fiction aesthetic, mashing in ufo's, monster movies and a devo-inspired personal mythology along with their guitar thrash.  **synthpunk**: suicide - [""ghost rider""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgljoxpko4u)  combining the forward rush of punk with electronic and experimental music, synthpunk is one of those genres that started early in the punk scene and always seemed to pop in and out of view as bands picked it up and made some noise. suicide were the first to wear the label and remain a touchstone of the genre. this track, best known now as the source of the main riff in m.i.a.'s ""born free"" is one of their more accessible.  **art rock**: brian eno - [""baby's on fire""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nituhuy1u04)  ""art rock"" is one of those labels that works well for describing the idiosyncratic works of artists that only barely fit into the rock genre, if they fit into anything at all. distinguished from prog by its lack of classically inspired compositions and a stronger experimental edge, art rock covers everything from early genesis to pink floyd's middle period to my chosen track here by brian eno. after leaving roxy music, eno released a series of astounding solo records, starting with *here come the warm jets* and ending with *before and after science*. the free associative lyrics flow over layered, mangled rock numbers that eno twisted around in the production studio. this track includes a powerful solo from king crimson's robert fripp and shows off eno's dark lyrical humor.  **ambient**: brian eno - [""music for airports""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfkcu_ze-60)  not a lot of people can claim to have created a genre, and while ambient-style music had been floating around for years in the avant-gard scene, eno solidified it with a strong theoretical backing. this album was created to help calm nervous travelers at airports, and is the earliest example of a style that would influence a broad range of electronic music.  **disco**: chic - [""everybody dance""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fox81ag-en4)  probably one of the most unfairly (and sometimes fairly) maligned styles of popular music in the last century, disco was a style of dance music pulling from jazz, funk and pop to create propulsive beats, cheerful melodies and extended dancehall breakdowns. chic was distinguished from a lot of other disco acts by being a real band rather than a production studio creation, and included two of the best pop songwriters/producers of its era in guitarist nile rodgers and bassist bernard edwards. the bassline for their hit ""good times"" was sampled by grandmaster flash, the sugerhill gang and daft punk, and inspired queen's ""another one bites the dust."" this track shows off everything the band, and disco, did well, with it's modal guitar lines, upbeat harmonies and relatively complex jazz chords.  **rockabilly ('50s)**: the johnny burnette trio - [""train kept a-rollin'""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytcvvwrvriu)  country music when it first met electric guitars and pure aggression is how we got rockabilly. fast paced, with a deep reverb sound, it was rock 'n' roll just as rock 'n' roll was becoming a thing. this track, covered by both the yardbirds and aerosmith, is a distorted barn burner that shows off the genre at its most unhinged.  **rock 'n' roll ('50s)**: buddy holly and the crickets - [""that'll be the day""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq9fcbatl3a)  the foundations of rock started when people started pulling in r&amp;b, country &amp; western, tossing in electric guitars and saxophones and pushing the tempo up to a little faster than the old people were comfortable with. the first rock 'n' roll track is arguably ike turner's ""rocket '88'"", but it's hard to deny the influence of buddy holly, who recorded some of rock's earliest classics in his too-short life. bringing a texas country twang (the crickets started out as a country act) to the r&amp;b he loved, holly wrote relatively complex music for a teenage audience (check the rolling snare drums on ""peggy sue"" or the rain drop strings on his solo pop numbers). this is, in hindsight, his anthem.  **college rock ('80s)**: r.e.m. - [""these days""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv_78in5ige)  slightly country-ish, slightly folk-ish and certainly out of place in the hair metal 1980's, college rock is another of those labels used kind of after the fact due to its popularity on college radio and for its brainier, more introspective style when compared to the popular music of the day. a lot of this has aged horribly, but early r.e.m. still stands up as some of the best the genre has to offer. this track showcases the band at their most propulsive, years before they exploded their sound in the face of popular success.  **grunge**: mudhoney - [""touch me i'm sick""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbabmzet4uw)  so great and so quickly exploited. grunge is what happens when you leave a beer-drinking blue collar region that had a decent punk scene alone for too long without anyone looking, and when you collect a bunch of rock musicians who all think *my war* is the best black flag album. while its most popular acts are the least indicative of the style, mudhoney is still the one you can always point to and say that's what grunge is. deeply distorted rock 'n' roll that combined layers of sonic sludge over punk aggression. this, their first single, is still one of their best.  **heavy metal ('70s)**: black sabbath - [""supernaut""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkixd5e_ydi)  defined by a pounding sonic dominance, huge riffs and wailing vocals, metal was rock as total warfare. its since moved into more sub-genres than i can even begin to do justice to, but it starts here with black sabbath. the darkness, the heaviness, the powerful drums and rumbling bass, the lyrics obsessed with grand themes given religious importance. it's the source code that would spawn legions throwing the horns.  **thrash metal ('80s)**: megadeth - [""killing is my business...and business is good""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vbhkmye980)  metal in a way subsumed prog rock (devoured it whole in some cases) as the rock genre most obsessed with technical virtuosity, which is how you end up with heavily tattooed people swinging their heads around at high velocity, screaming about the devil while playing chord changes that would make a jazz freak nod in approval. thrash took the gutter crunch of motorhead and pushed it even further, upping the tempo while remaining compellingly complex.  **no wave**: sonic youth - [""death valley '69""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1zpoclls9q)  as the punk rock scene started to become creatively stagnant (though nowhere near death), a number of artists and musicians in new york took up punk's call but applied the aesthetics of experimental music and performance art, creating a harsh, almost caustic sound that relied heavily on noise and, often, pure sonic brutality. most of these bands burned out as quickly as they started, and the genre collapsed shortly after it had been documented in brian eno's *no wave new york* comp, but a few held on. sonic youth became the most culturally significant and longest lasting group to spring from this stew. while this track is a lot more accessible than most no wave, it still has the harsh, experimental tones that defined the genre. bonus points for having lydia lunch, from teenage jesus and the jerks, on vocals.  **new traditionalist country**: george strait - [""amarillo by morning""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ulklhm0eg)  country entered another creatively stagnant period in the late 1970s and early '80s, remaining popular music but with both the outlaw country stars and the old mainstays struggling to create relevant music. the new traditionalists worked to bring things back to the roots again, but this time incorporating more modern pop melodies. when you think of modern country in the 1980s and 90s, this is mostly what you're thinking of, the ""country"" when people say they ""like everything but rap and country."" but that doesn't mean it didn't produce some great songwriting. george strait, the most popular recording artist in america that only like three people on this website have ever listened to, is the godhead of the style, performing songs that could have been recorded just as easily 30 years earlier, but giving them a modern pop sheen. this track is a cover of a terry stafford track from about a decade earlier.  **swing ('40s)**: benny goodman - [""sing, sing, sing""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhyhp_5vfkm)  jazz started as dance music, and swing is that stand of the genre in its purest form. defined by big orchestras (to make sure the band was heard over the audience in crowded clubs in pre-pa days) and dance floor rhythms underlying jazz solos, swing became some of the most popular music of its day, lasting right up to the early 1950s. this track, goodman's most memorable performance and his band's masterpiece, shows off everything the genre did right without any of the deficits that would soon render it creatively stale.  **britpop**: blur - [""country house""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxqyajt67j4)  influenced by the more ambitious pop work of the kinks and looking the shed the dourness of shoegaze, britpop was british rock's counterpart to american indie rock and alt-rock through the mid 1990s. and like its counterpart, it basically was done for by the end of the decade, creatively exhausted and with its biggest bands either falling apart or floundering through genres until they finally broke free entirely. oasis was the biggest band to come out of it, but i prefer this blur track as a good introduction. it shows off the humor, the kinks-inspired idiosyncratic nature of the genre.   **shoegaze**: my bloody valentine - [""i only said""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvj-fc1m_d0)  short lived but fairly influential (with a revival happening as we speak in modern indie rock), shoegaze (a disparaging name mocking the stereotype of its self-serious performers staring at their shoes on stage) began in the late 1980s and ran through the early '90s in britain. defined by effects and distortion laden guitars, hushed vocals that are often incomprehensible and a phil spector-style wall of sound created by a humming guitar drone, the style can be as soothing as it is punishingly loud. my bloody valentine's *loveless* was a touchstone of the genre and one of the best albums of its era. though few other bands hit this kind of sonic richness, it still makes a solid introduction to the genre.    **ska (jamaican)**: toots &amp; the maytals [""pressure drop""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rb13ksyo0s)  drawing on american r&amp;b but mixing it with local sounds (such as calypso), ska was jamacia's most popular form of music through much of the 1960s. light, upbeat dance music, it laid the foundation for reggae and rocksteady and had a major influence abroad, inspiring revivals in britain and america in the 1970s and 1990s. this track was one of the first to bring the music to the us, thanks to its inclusion on the *the harder they come* soundtrack.  **ska (2 tone)**: the specials - [""a message to you, rudy""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17josu1r2g)  the first major revival of ska in britain, 2 tone (named for the record label that popularized it) or ""second wave"" ska sat kind of adjacent to the british punk scene and incorporated that sound as an influence. the specials created some of this revival's most indicative sounds, taking the upbeat rhythms of ska and giving it some punk energy. this track is low key but shows off the sharp songwriting chops the genre often inspired. [edit: i was reminded this is a cover, not an original, which i had completely forgotten. write it off to me being a dink. still a great track though, so i'm leaving it up].  **roots reggae**: burning spear - [""marcus garvey""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogn3r49-cae&amp;list=pl1c8f09e7e9238933)  for a lot of people, roots reggae is just what they think of when they think of reggae, and the genre begins and ends with the bob marley *legends* comp (which is why i didn't use him here). but the genre is more diverse than that. drawing from ska and rocksteady, but slowing the tempos and focusing on more spiritual or political matters, reggae was in some ways the country music of jamaica. burning spear was one of the most soulful groups (it's both a group and a solo performer; this track is by the original group) and this track shows that.  **tropicalia**: caetano veloso - [""tropicalia""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckydg29xwuu)  tropicalia was a brazilian artistic movement that was a lot more than just music. but the music was it's primary legacy and was marked by a blending of a broad range of influences into the traditions of brazilian music, included but not limited to american rock 'n' roll and r&amp;b. while it sounds pretty innocuous now, this was deeply political music, eventually leading to veloso's imprisonment and exile. this is the track that eventually gave the movement its name, showing off the beautiful cultural cannibalism that defined the movement.",0,

oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on dragonstone, the lord had taken a great

585742,"download link (alac and mp3, 250 mb): https://www.adrive.com/public/axnatj/28.zip   **the wytches** – *weights and ties* (uk, 2014)  new record from uk psych/garage band… slow-tempo with jangly ’60s guitar. i’m pretty picky with vocals but this one hits the spot. it’s definitely an earworm.  **brace/choir** – *satisfier* (germany, 2014)  man, is this a grower. starts out as pretty straight-ahead toe-tapping indie and then the guitars just pile in, layer upon layer, and subtle bongos driving it forward. kind of reminds me of mmoss or pinkunoizu. awesome. a band to watch.  **white fence** – *afraid of what it’s worth* (us, 2014)  i didn’t know this guy was founding member of darker my love, but he is, and it makes sense because both that band and this project white fence are awesome. this new album is a cracker, a real contender for album of the year.  **pinkunoizu** – *everything is broken or stolen* (denmark, 2012)  i can’t get enough of this band. last year’s *the drop* was in my opinion the best thing released in 2013. this cut is from their 2012 release, which is somewhat less cohesive as an album, but it still had some really amazing moments. this is one.  **the proper ornaments** – *stereolab* (uk, 2014)  apparently these guys are kind of a big deal in the london indie scene; their freshly released album is killer if you like that kind of stuff. this track is pumping: a straight up tribute to france’s finest and they really knock it out of the park with the harmonized chiming guitars. psych pop heaven.  **arnold** – *catherine day* (uk, 1998)  a wonderful forgotten album from the late 90s, this mournful heartstrings-puller never fails to give me chills. the soaring slide guitar is straight-up psych heaven and is cruelly cut short when the band stop playing and start horsing around for five minutes before launching into another number. i edited that shit out.  **marble sheep** -- *september’s rain* (japan, 1998)   this band’s catalogue is massive and i am slowly, slowly going through it. a staple of anyone into japanese psych, this number from marble sheep has a gorgeous acoustic hook and one of those children’s type organs underneath and is propelled along by smooth swishes of ride cymbal and bongos. it’s just very gentle and mournful and harmonious and sweet. fucking love this band so much.  **david kilgour &amp; the heavy eights** – *comin’ on* (new zealand, 2014)  the improbably good 80s band the clean was built around two brothers from new zealand, david (guitar) and hamish (drums and vocals). david has released a number of top-shelf grade-a prime cut solo albums, the most recent is this, and should be of interest to anyone who loves swirly guitar sunshine psych pop. heavenly. one of those songs where you go “fuck me i never even heard that guitar track” and it’s like your 20th listen.  **electric wizard** – *i am nothing* (uk, 2014)  before i experienced knaw their tongues, this band was the heaviest thing i had ever heard. i am tremendously excited for next month when electric wizard releases their new album—this is the first single from it—which features the drummer from my two favorite albums, come my fanatics and dopethrone. you can shout me down for including “doom” or “metal” on a psych-rock comp, but this music is deeply, horrifically trippy—a huge wall of dark 70s analog fuzz. some blackness to contrast light on this mix. it’s just chong-chong-chong-chong sucking you into this horrible nihilistic vortex where you scream but no sound comes out. that my friends is the mark of quality music.   **the green telescope** – *make me stay* (uk, 1986)  i found this on the compilation “children of nuggets” which has some great obscure bands from the 80s on it. i love the wild reverbed guitar so low in the mix, it just makes it to a tee. one listen and you’ll be hooked.  **prince rupert’s drops** – *plague ride* (us, 2012)  posted by someone here a while ago, within two bars i was sucked in hook line and sinker. i had to have it on a mix. a new york band. pretty much psychedelic rock defined.  **stardeath &amp; white dwarfs** – *hate me tomorrow* (us, 2014)  have never heard of this band before, grabbed it randomly. high quality. check them out.  **spectre folk** – *inchin’ worm* (us, 2012)  i have such a boner for this band it’s ridiculous. formed around the former sonic youth drummer, they have released two albums every fan of psych rock should own. “blackest medicine” and “the ancient storm”. this one is deceptively slow and simple but there is so much subtly going on… really chilled reverb-ey coolness.  **kalamata** – *die* (germany, 2014)  some more stoner-influenced shit from germany: sort of a mix of elder and maybe a less jazz-influenced colour haze. big riffs of the old school; slow, tight, and a good grasp of tone. there is very little left to be said in this genre and i find it boring these days, but every so often a band breathes a bit of life into the corpse of kyuss. this is one such.  **usssy** – *whirling grannys* (russia, 2013)  middle-eastern folk influences define this psych band from russia. huge, dense, exotic, really freaking amazingly good shit. get into it. there is so much music to find from this part of the world.  **goat** – *bondye* (sweden, 2014)  i’m just pandering to the tame impala crowd here. seriously, how good is this new album. criminal not to include. a huge injection of pure genius in what can seem like a pretty jaded scene sometimes. a record to own and treasure on vinyl or cd for sure.  **serpentina satellite** –  *mazanilla menta/novo* (peru, 2004)  some driving kraut from peru to send us home. so freaking good. the album this is from i really like, but the other i heard didn’t do much for me. this is really spacey and awesome.  anyway, share and enjoy.",0,

264661,"name: mashinkov babinov, cripple made whole  race: caucasian  height: 6'6""  age: 31  appearance: very tall, with a heavily built frame, with prosthetic arms and legs, made from crucible steel. although young his head is shaven bald, save for a simple black goatee. the most heavily armoured of the group, boasting a cuirass complete with faults reaching to his ankles and a tapering bevor, giving him the look of a man wearing a greatcoat rather than a suit of armour. atop his head he wears a simple visored sallet that it's securely to the bevor, blocking all access to his face and neck.  weapons and training: while heavily armoured, he is armed rather lightly, equipped with only am espada di lato and a heater shield. he uses his augmented limbs to strike heavily and rapidly, though the pack of maintained means they could easily be severed at the joints by now.  back story: birth defects took his left arm, a mining accident took his right one, and an ancient drake took the rest. born into poverty in the highly militarised see nation of amia, the chemicals dumped into the poor district's water supplies lead to áed being born sans left arm. despite his defects he managed to secure a job at the very mine that cost him his arm to begin with... until a collapse in his shaft took his right leg.  with little other choice, he joined the military in return for artificial restoration of both lost limbs. in time he rose to the rank of commodore of the h.h nox, one of the largest recorded warships. he performed admirably until an incident refers to only as 'the time of black' where a great dragon razed amia to the ground, taking babinov's last remaining limbs in the process.  rather than remain crumpled and penniless, babinov carried out one of eight documented self restoration jobs, rebuilding what was seared away. after that, shenanigans ensued, he became a part-time bandit/smuggler/pirate  abilities: his prosthetics allow him to out match most humans in displays of strengths, however, years of neglect have left them rather frail and prone to breaking.  - - -  name: brennus, the wolf of the north  race: caucasian  height: 5'8""  age: 18  appearance: short, with a stocky muscular build. despite his relatively young age he sports a full (and untidy) beard that tumbles across his chest, accompanied by a head of long unruly black hair, giving him a feral appearance. wears a simple ashen shirt under a waist length hooded mantle.  weapons and training: he carries a targe and dirk in his off hand accompanied by a wicked looking karambit in his right. fights very defensively using the shield strapped to his forearm to block and parry countering with his twin daggers. he finds only disdain in killing, preferring to incapacitate his foes.  abilities: if the legends are true, then the young brennus is descended from a long line of shamans and heretic priests, both of which are said to of laid with elemental spirits at some point of his bloodline.   born into the tribe blueheart of the tranquil land of ebias, brennus lived a rather simple life of hunting, eating, sleeping and the odd ritual self-inflicted mutilation, in recognition of the suffering all living things experienced to provide for him. upon reaching his manhood, at the age of thirteen, brennus began tutelage under the tribes shaman, to one day replace him.  at the tender age of fifteen the young brennus, with a tenuous grasp of his powers and how to control them, grew bored of his easy life in ebias, and so left under the guise of pilgrimage, and never returned. at the moment brennus has found himself amidst a pack of thieves and bandits.  abilities: assuming the stories of his bloodline are true, they would explain his ability to shape shift, and his deep link with the surrounding wildlife, so much so he can even take control of it with some will power.  - - -   name: edward dilado  race: caucasian  height: 6'0""  age: 23  appearance: slim and lean with an athletic physique. charcoal brown hair and a  neatly trimmed van dyke moustache. his face is very defined with handsome and distinguished features. wears a simple pair of trousers and a shirt under a long cloak, atop his head he wears a tall black hat, complete with a red plume. the cloak covers him from head to toe hiding his physical build.  weapons and training: under the cloak he keeps an estoc and a well maintained trident dagger . he is well familiarised with both, as such is extremely efficient with parrying, riposting and all manner of counter strikes. keeps four neck-knives strapped to each forearm.  back story: born into the nobility of esiam, edward lived a pampered life style. he began learning the traditional methods of sword fighting passed through dilado family line for generations, blending fencing, hand to hand, knife fighting and throwing into a elegant dance... albeit with more murderous intent.  indeed life was well for edward, until the demon 'alcohol' cost him his inheritance, his house, his family, everything he had save for his clothes and his weapons, no proud member of house dilado would allow himself to he stripped of either. with no other options he turned to banditry, earning himself the tittle 'duke of thieves' on account of his high birth.  although he weened himself of the drink, he found robbing folk to be too much of a lucrative business venture to give it up.  abilities: edward is physically fit and brilliantly dexterous as such edward is startlingly mobile. one thing to fear above all is his situational awareness, some even claim he posses extra sensory perception.  - - -  name: grunt  race: ???  height: 8'0""  age: ???  appearance: freakishly tall and built like a brick house, the silent grunt cuts an imposing figure. no part of its anatomy can be seen, its face is perpetually hidden in the shade of his swept-back [sallet](http://th09.deviantart.net/fs70/pre/i/2013/183/7/c/leather_artorias_helmet_dark_souls_by_azmal-d6bn4la.jpg), fashioned after a hawk's head, no matter what lighting is present and the rest is hidden behind armour.   wears a set of light leather armour, reinforced with lobstered metal across the ribs and fore arms. a thin azure shroud, with eerily beautiful scroll work patterned in silver, wraps around its face and drapes down across its back, ending at its ankles, further concealing its form.  weapons and training: in stark contrast to its light armour, grunt wields a monstrously large greatsword, six feet long and a handspan wide. the blade itself is as white as milk glass, with a pale blue light that shines along the fuller, casting wild shadows around the wielder.  back story: no really knows where grunt came from, its shroud is of daloshi origin, but the clues end there. all that is know is that he appeared from the foods one day, and took up a place in the groups ranks, refusing to leave no matter how many time someone stabbed him. all that is know of him, is that he follows babinov's instructions without delay or deviation.  it's been six months since he's shown up, and not one of the groups has seen him eat, sleep, urinate or remove his helmet.  abilities: aside from its inhumanly strong physique, grunt has no particularly remarkable traits. however the blade it wields appears to have a mind if its own, occasionally striking of its own accord and dragging grunt along with it.  - - -  the bickering of the rag-tag group was broken by the sound of three swift claps booming across the forest, followed by a voice that practically dripped with power, charisma and sex-appeal ""hello, my fellow travellers!"" it called as the owner of the voice stepped into view. he truly matched the voice, tall and handsome with olive skin and well groomed facial hair.  he was dressed every part the gentle man, in his lavish coat and expensive hat, complete with a deep red plume. he took his hat off and placed it over his chest, bowing low whilst flicking his cloak out to the side in a easy, well practiced motion.  ""my good ladies, gentleman and..."" he cast a lazy hand over the wolf-boy, not once dropping his charming, amicable smile ""... what ever you are. i would like to offer you a most marvellous trade!"" he called out, practically hopping with glee.",1,

615000,"i learned to program by modifying someone else's program to do what i wanted, then began writing little scripts and such to fix annoyances, or to make boring tasks more fun and therefore more likely to actually get done.  basically don't wait, just think of a little project and design implement and test it. think of how you can improve said project and design implement and test it, do this again and again till your project is done. do this again with a different project. you can continue doing assignments and tutorials while you are doing this to continually expand your knowledge.   always push boundaries, if you are in the gym and are always lifting weight that you can do easily, you won't get stronger, same with programming, if you are always programming things you can do easily you won't get better.   worst thing that happens is your project sucks, so what? do it again till it doesn't suck! learn what you need to learn to achieve your goal and learn it.",0,
718043,"also, mattresses are always ""on sale"", so don't be too fooled by a local flyer in the paper or ad on tv. they are always at that 50% off price. that's just how the mattress business works. the trick is to find out when you can get the most off of that price. for my store (and most big-box mattress stores) the biggest sales tend to be around the off-holidays. there may be some specials for st. patrick's day or easter, but the next big sales event for the mattress business is going to be memorial day, then the 4th of july. these are two of the best times to buy a mattress, at least from one of the big guys.",0,

""look, cathy,"" he rebutted, ""we're simply running out of scripted material, whether david likes it or not. we just can't keep shoveling this crap down people's throats. ever since the internet found out our last documentary was fake, people are beginning to distrust everything we've plugged; short term viewers are just small time fish compared to the long-term audience, and you're trying to throw away 20 years of progress for it. y'know, speaking of david, where has he been all this time? a ceo can't just disappear off the grid for almost two weeks straight when the q3 ratings needs to be analyzed. and now there's a huge dip in network stocks and profits, too! where did my paycheck go? where did your paychecks go?!""  derek was now standing above the jumpy directors in black so he could then splay his hands above the corporate table. ""we were sitting in this room yesterday discussing the same topic that we've always been discussing instead of actually doing something about the guy in charge. the phone's right on the table, so let's call the fucker up and find him!""  as he sat back down after that whirlwind of cockiness, a few of the elder suits gargled listerine into their partner's ear and passed off the notion, fearful of what might happen, while the younger of the table rose out of their seats. first jameson, then perrette, leavy and warren began to echo ""call the fucker up!"" like frat boys at a kegger.  ""yes, let's call the 'fucker' up,"" an inauspicious voice appeared over the phone speaker, as the tones of the user's keypad cryptically beeped a passcode. derek, who immediately recognized the voice, attempted to escape imminent doom, but his chair had already reclined to the point of no return as a floor panel opened to reveal a blinding, burning orange accompanied by flash heat. as his head swooshed past the floorboard -- the sticker on it read *grab life by the globe* -- so too did jameson, then perrette, leavy and warren begin to echo their screams like good-as-dead derek.  the floorboards soon closed shut as the room dropped a hefty 30 degrees. the crackpot of the group, floyd, who had seen his colleagues die in the act of making a point for over 6 years now, put his boot down. ""i told ya', ya' damn youngsters,"" he pointed at the lilly-livered children in the room, as they held one another with their hands and shook in their soaked business suits, ""no one ever gets away with insultin' the see-ee-oh of discovery cuz' he's always listenin'--""  ""did i fucking say you could speak, henderson?!""  another trap door opened as floyd played chutes and ladders for the last time. the falling texan tycoon screamed at the top of his lungs, "" but i had tenurreeeeeeee"", and was never heard from again.  the speaker finally resorted to a calmer pitch. ""sorry, that guy was trying to make partner, i was gonna off him regardless. now. are there any other stupid interruptions?""  ""why aren't there sprinklers in this room? what if there's, like, a fire?"" asked a truthishly bewildered cathy.  david completely ignored this and nonchalantly placed his voice toward the respectable bill goodwyn. ""now i've got some very important news to share with you. but first, bill, you're an honest chap, how are we doing in the ratings?""  ""uhhh, uhhh,"" bill panicked as he flipped through the endless list of fan complaints, ream after ream fluttering through the air, paraphrasing the woes of first-world problems. ""well, umm, first off, *amish mafia* just reminded everyone of weird al's famous song, and all it did was make bearded southerners and jewish people like jeb over there look like gangsters. no offense, jeb."" jeb overzealously snapped back. ""who says we can't be? hey, that could be a new show, *jewish mafia*! we could--""  ""well, i don't know if we can do that anymore, i-i mean the only guy who could've come up with something as boneheaded as *amish mafia*'s next seasons was floyd, and well."" the board concurred and tossed it aside. jeb leered at bill with harsh israeli eyes, making him reevaluate purchasing that brand new non-keyed mercedes.  ""o-ok, moving on,"" he parsed through the hefty stack again. ""*fast 'n' loud*, *yukon men*, *moonshiners*, *auction kings*, *gold rush*, 'they're viewed by slack-jawed yokels', 'almost worse than doomsday preppers', yadda yadda yadda, something about only inbreds who watch nascar could like them, and oh yeah! no one's watching *naked and afraid*.""  gasps of shock reverberated around the room, while the speaker chimed a separate conversation about david being ""strapped down properly"". ""how can nobody be watching that show?! it's as close to nudity as any cable channel could allow!"" the director rotated their head and open hand toward the next person to complain. ""you mean to tell us no one's stupid enough to watch a show on a science channel just for t.n.a.? oh god we're doomed."" the hyperventilating man slumped his widened eyes into his hands like a pocket.  ""w-well, they're blurred out everytime, guys. the monkeys we tested the shows on even figured out that you'll never see through them. half of these pamphlets in this pile are really just lawsuits from the research firms: they're saying we indirectly broke the monkeys' hands because they all kept punching out the tv screens. n-now look, all we have left that anyone consistently watches and likes are *mythbusters*, *how it's made* and *shark week*, and the evidence shows that *shark week* won't be receiving any more support because of what derek said. so... what should we do, sir?""  they gazed at the phone for what felt like minutes. it sounded like the ceo was in a hurricane, either that or his wind filter wasn't working. ""it's simple,"" he yelled, ""what if i told you we could make another kind of week. and this time, instead of making documentaries about fake discoveries, we make the discoveries come to us?"" the suits seemed puzzled. he tapped on his keypad as a projector dropped down; video footage from cities all across the world showed massive fires and what appeared to be winged, bloated abominations flying through the air, some crashing into the streets like meteors with red beams of light disintegrating roads and vehicles whole. one camera outside filmed what appeared to be bill's brand new mercedes being devoured by one of the monsters; ""goddammit!"" bill exclaimed as he ran toward the window, smudging the glass with his tears. a myriad of newscasters ran across each panel with ties over their shoulders and bras showing, trying to piece together what exactly these beings were and where they came from. posted youtube videos showed mass hysteria at seaworld where a flock of flying black-and-white monstrosities were revealed to be killer whales; the wicked witch's winged beasts swooped down toward their previous trainers and catching them by their hair as they disappeared in the distant sky. ""gentlemen, and cathy. behold: the new age of reality entertainment!""  ""what have you done, zaslav?!""  ""i have finally accomplished the arduous task of stealing every whale on the earth. by working with history, national geographic, and a&amp;e, we were able to reverse-engineer the whale genome. we knew we would reach reality show singularity at some point, so we used our dwindling stock shares to give each and every species of whale glorious falcon dna. they can now breathe on land, they can now fly, and they now shoot lasers from their now-formed beaks. not only will everyone view this as accurate scientific programming, it will be a part of their survival, 24/7! *ahahahahaha*,"" he cackled maniacally.  all major news sources immediately went to a live press conference with whale wars' paul watson as he stood outside the white house, putting on a stolid appearance in front of the impending whale threat hoping to pacify the thirst for their blood. as every reporter from japan had their hands up first, a gargantuan shadow eclipsed the sun.  ""beluga at 2 o'clock!"" the g-men opened fire with their handguns, but the whale was too strong for their nerf weapons! it pushed them back with a violent gust of wind as it thumped in the center of the crowd. the off-camera stranger aboard it stood before a trembling paul watson. ""how about you sign the rights of *whale wars* over to discovery, and i won't have my friend here vaporize you."" ""deal!"" and with a sign of the waiver, david zaslav kicked him off the podium. ""i'm here, bitches!"" he waved to his employees. ""so, i just wanted to let everyone know that starting in a few days, discovery is going to have a new segment called *whale week*! don't miss it,"" he subtly pointed with a grin, ""it's got the rare flying laser whales you all know and love! and don't miss *whale pawn*, *whale dynasty* and *the legend of whale dodge*. but don't watch animal planet.""  and the newly established leader of tv pressed his phone's keypad once more as a large blue flag stemmed out from the whale's saddle. the discovery logo flew high and mighty above the nation, and soon more flags with at signs and pound signs on other whales swayed above the world's cities as the mutants had now transformed into something even more disturbing: advertising blimps. the banners of the company dropped down in the corporate meeting office while the projector stopped on david's smile. all employees -- all except cathy, she didn't get the memo -- were forced to bow to the one great david zaslav, #theprinceofwhales.",0,

665838,"edit ... well everything mostly this is backer lost from a dead lands game i was in. he was a big mouth, intolerant of 2, high highfalutin, blood thirsty,  and had a loco of 1. he also had belongings of 5, arcane back ground  gift of gab, and kemosabe of 1  i get carried away with back stories and i went in to this knowing that this guy was only going to be in one game. even still i really fell into this character and this is his back story.    backer was born a slave on a plantation in south east virginia. he aint sure what it was called all he knows is that he moms wanted out.  his pops wasn't too keen on the idea of leaving. he only knows this cuz they were fighting a lot. he reckons he had to be bout 3 or 4. well as we all know the women gets their way sooner and later and off the family went to find freedom in the north. and as we all know the man us usually right in the end sadly for moms and pops, pops was right. they got as far as york pennsylvania but the slave bounty hunters found them and didn't mean to let them go no further. maw said they should give up but pops saw the way theys were looking at maw and he didn't like it. there were only two of them and pops figured that if he was gonna have a chance to escape its best be soon. hey both looked down as is they were caught, rewards for slaves was dead or alive but it was more for alive. the men approached thinking they had a couple uppity niggas that knew their better and knew when they was caught. one of them men grabbed maw, he looked her up and down and licked his lips, those bounties aint say nothing about what condition they had to be in when they got back to the plantation. the other man grabbed pops but he too was looking maw up and down. now pops wasn't no house slave, he worked the fields and the rock piles. he laid cobble stones as well as hauled supplies, so when he punched the man who was holding him in the face he flew back three feet and dropped his gun. the man who held maw was so surprised that a docile nigga like pops had the nerve that he didn't notice maw step pack and give him a kick like you wouldn't believe where the sun don't shine.  now all this time baker was clinging to his maw. but now she said run we’ll find yous later so that little nigga ran like the dogs was after him and hid under some steps.    gun shots in the night   a woman’s screams   sound of sirens   street lights being lit    darkness________   	now baker wasn't no fool he knew that his folks was killed and that if anyone saw a little nigga with no folks they was either going to take him in for service or kill him too. so he stayed under those stairs as long as he could but boys being boys though he was hungry. when he couldn't take it no more he got up and walked out though he couldn't read he was under the steps of saints peter and paul. he found a light post and just set next to it cold alone and just starting to think about the fact that his folks was dead. tears welled up and he cried. people passed and no one even cared that he was there. the doors to the church opened up two men in cassock came down one of them looked at baker and sniffed muttering something about calling the authorities. the other stopped and looked at him he said  “i say this boy is all alone"" the other replied ""yes he is, now shall we go?"" looking up as his companion he said ""shouldn't we help the poor lad? is it not our place to take him in"" the other man looked down his nose and said ""hmm perhaps your place, i'll leave you too it"" and strode off. baker finally looked up. now baker was black as night and had been around and seen white men, but the man he saw before him was red skinned. the man knelt down and said “little brother i will not let the white man spit on you. god has sent you here to me and i will not fail in this task come with me."" the red man lead baker inside with white me looking on in distaste.  **a fragment of the legend of baker lost as told by slaves in the south**                                                                              15 years later    my name is baker lost. those rancid “men of god"" thought the sir name fit since they thought that i would never be found.  joseph , or eagle sores has his real friends know him, sent me to saint mary’s seminary in maryland hoping that i could escape some of my past. he underestimated the tactlessness of white men. the teacher sand the students thought to laugh and poke fun at me. however i was beyond a superb student. the teachers made special tests for me hoping that more difficult exams would put me in my place. they were right, and it worked, putting me in my place as their better. i try to refrain from harsh language like cracker, honky and bigot but if the shoe fits. after graduation summa cum laude the thought to rid themselves of me forever by sending me to do gods work in the world that's increasingly more dangerous. i was to travel a world filled with vampires ware wolves and all sorts of creatures and bring hope to the masses … yeah right. gladly before they threw me to the beasts the taught me the arts of our time. as with anything i excelled and became an excellent shot and demolition expert. whatever these pale schmuck have planned, god's will is absolute, he knows his own.   i receive package from eagle sores, who was europe on some errand of his order. strange that there was no letter with it i pray that he is well. the package contained a cloak of the finest make. dark leather on the outside lined with some well-made purple fleas on the inside. could have been made for me it fits so well. maybe he knew that i was to be sent out. well tomorrow is my day of parting and this gift will suite me well on the road. i don’t know where i will go from here however i do know that the lord is my shepard and i fear no evil for he is with me and will guide me in this, my his will be done.                                                                      **about 45 days earlier**  	eagle sores ducks around a corner and then in to an ally. two short stout green creatures run pass the ally. why these creatures want this relic so much he has no clue. they must be employed by someone who has plans for it. this chase has gotten more relentless with goblins and ogres by day and ware wolves and vampires by night. whoever wants this is pulling all the stops and they have his scent. while it was just another job to recover it now with the creatures of the night after him he feels he has to be sure that they don’t get it. across the street from the ally is a postal office, an idea struck him though he would need a replacement, a drunk wearing a dark cloak similar to his stumbles in to the ally and slides down the wall. eagle sores looks up to the heavens and whispers, thank you. the takes the cloak from the drunk, leaving him more than it’s worth in his beggar’s cup and sprints across the ally. he simply changes from his cloak in to the new one stuffs his in to a parcel and pays to have it shipped to baker. no time for a letter, he’ll keep it safe until i can get back over there. that done he slips back in to the streets. now even if he falls it’s safe. the stones right in front of him explored as gunshots are fired. the lord isn’t done with me yet it seems  __________________________________________________________________________________________  i have a mind to turn this in to a short story but time.",1,1

658452,"chapter 4 part i   29th january. it was raining on le marais (tn: “the marsh” is a neighbourhood in paris). and the marsh entered my home, blond, long, and sad, a black umbrella in hand.  one of those vast and black umbrellas which blossom in the hallucinogenic campaigns. when i will remove, if i can, the sword that this woman ran through my body, i will discover that it was nothing else, that weapon, but the umbrella of that day.    i received my visitor with, at my feet, slippers of a man of letters. of those slippers with checks which léautaud (tn: paul léautaud was a french writer and theater critic) made famous and which are invented by doctors – who give them their name. other practitioners, instead of curing their sick ones, rack their brains to propose to their clients a new brand of brilliantine. might as well say that my complete equipment of the little seducer had been forgotten that day. my rendezvous was about business.   when the doorbell rang, i went to open the door.   never should i have heard that ring, never should i have opened that door to this umbrella in tears. i just had opened to sorrow and misfortune entered.     it had “that curious heart-breaking dark face of an adult child” which hemingway talks about. those few words, when i read them later on, struck me. yes, she had that curious face beyond beauty, that face that memory blurs and beats like cards, that face you can a glimpse off through a mister window. the time is a vandal, who will dim it. death is well death that will annihilate it.    i didn’t know which despair i was welcoming there. but i knew at the exact second i saw éloïse – let’s call her éloïse? – that something unexpected was happening. an anxiety got mixed right away with my interest. i hadn’t closed the door on that rainy lady that i asked myself an abrupt question: “what is this?”   it remained without answer. i will never know what it was.    only that it was something of the dentist’s drill, of the night train, of the crown of thorns and of vivaldi’s mandolins. that there were in that woman, to summarize her badly, some bits of flint and old-fashion.   she resembled to her first name which is, apparently, an outdated word in denmark.    she had the bearing; often shy, of the tall girls, lived in her body with those graces that are given by the clumsiness of good education.     i like wounded beings, scratched here and there by an imperceptible wrinkle. this proves, at least, that they are likely to get a wound. the ability to bleed is not offered to just anyone. i am touched by those people. their distraction is quality, their paleness respectable. i look for them. not to hold out a st bernard’s keg to them. i am not, while sober, the salvation dog, rather a dark highway tomcat. i smell those vulnerable wounded persons. éloïse appeared to me as worthy and suffering of an ill that obviously i could not read and  was attracting me. i already did not remember why she came. i made her enter my office; had her sit on a patch of a couch. it was moving, her way to sit down on a patch of couch. frank, straight, pulled skirt, both hands on both knees, apologizing for occupying so much terrestrial space. the ways of siting down give more information about people than phrenology. some researcher should draw out the nomenclature of it for us; extract the morality out of it.  thus, the way of else could not be the one, casual, detached of the bourgeois contingencies, the one that adopts a leftist intellectual to put down her ass on the commode. it’s not the “i am bird, see my legs!” way either of the young apolitical comedian who is worried about her carrier. the dirtiest mind was quiet as to which part of her body was used by éloïse to sit down with such modesty. as i write those words, “close for my heart to break”, like was shouting villon in pain. i see again that long black ghost sitting at the same place, harrowing and silent like a doppelgänger, that “double of a being” dear to the german romantics. i see it again; will see it tomorrow and eve, alas, the day after. happy the one who lives without that immobility on his back. without that facet of nothingness on the nape of the neck. i was a drama author, not illustrious, but known. i was making a living out of my plays. jean-claude, was one of the best set designer of the moment. i had sounded him out for the models and the costumes of egg 2x, my next show. we met owing to a few interludes. we were greeting each other with the acceptable joviality of our circle. i hope that the esteem i had for him was mutual. that galley slave of the pen wasn’t free before months, couldn’t take care of egg 2x. in the face of my disappointment, he told me: “take my wife” without playing on words, i think. she had no title in the profession. imagine armstrong advising you: “hire my wife, she plays trumpet very well!” i made enquiries. people just specified me that peyrac had a very pretty wife, which didn’t enlighten me about her set designer talents.    i didn’t think about it no more when i saw jean-claude again, forever essential. we talked about his wife again. “call her.” he gave me her phone number, a danish name and first name. i remember my slangy comment at the view of the patronymic: “drôle de blaze…” (tn: weird name) i pocketed the paper written of his own hand. it was skonhed who called me. she couldn’t visit me on tuesday “because of her baby”. we wrote down a date for this grievous wednesday. the reference to the “baby” had cooled me down. i had an hard time imagining working with an housewife on egg 2x that is the sign, in biology, of the female gender, “egg xy” being its male equivalent. there was certainly no question, in that disenchanted comedy, of diapers and baby cereal’s.    it has been partly inspired to me by a sullen disappointment. i doubted that a female colleague could, feeding bottle in hand, catch the “small bourgeois anarchist” spirit of it, dixit l’humanité (tn: former french communist party daily newspaper).    éloïse, laid on her patch of sofa, showed me sets that she had done for popular theatres of the outskirts.  brecht is, nowadays, most of the industrial suburbs’ folklore, where they had put behind them the past of the open-air cafés and the retrograde gentle ways of life. he has been promoted as unique intellectual leader of ivry, of alfortville, if not of saint-germain-en-laye, to the detriment of musset or labiche, who have nothing of progressives. the least avant-garde christian-unionized patronage produced three or four times a year the play of that first stone of the community art centres. in the name of the laic and municipality instruction, the caucasian chalk circle has become mandatory. so good for the chapeau de paille d’italie, shame to its lovers sentenced to the silence and to twenty years without remission of sociological shows. the models of the danish girl did not displease me, especially the ones of the good person of szechwan.   truth be told, i was already not seeing anything else but her eyes.     written in passing on the 24th december of the same year.   jean-claude is less dead than i am. caroline is bursting with health. no tragic poplar tree no fatal luxembourg basin… abbot-gregory street, the silvery garlands run in the christmas tree, which still isn’t a poplar tree. it’s the second merry christmas of clémentine, who claps her hands and gives many satisfactions to her parents.   it’s a fine evening for karen, whose only sense that will be left to her, if she does not pay attention, is the sense of family. her eyes shine, her heart is of the party. the charitable jean-claude, if he really has no idea where to go spend midnight, will maybe sleep with her, royal gift. we call that, over here in the suburbs, “put the little jesus in the crib“. we are jovial kinds in the suburbs. the bottle doesn’t matter there.    karen sings: “petit papa noël – quand tu descendras du ciel… » for célestine, or something more literary, or some old christmas from our scandinavia, who knows. in fact, she must not be singing at all, she would go a bit far, the eye of peyrac would have malice in it. she has the sense of moderation, éloïse. i have less than her, i don’t have any at all. i well have to have fun me as well and throw confetti! i’ll rather invent them a comical dialog, as it’s my job. or rather not. what if i asked it to two of my famous elders? here is anxiety, described by feydeau (baby is purged, scene ii)   else-julie: i am not happy with baby.   jean-claude-follavoine: yes…what has she done?   else-julie: she didn’t go this morning.   jean-claude-follavoine: she didn’t go!   else-julie: no.   jean-claude-follavoine: she didn’t go…where?   else-julie: what! “where!” nowhere! she didn’t go, full stop. i think it’s clear.   jean-claude-follavoine: ah! yes, to…     then here is serenity, seen by anouilh (dove, act i):   jean-claude: poos are pretty? the poo, it’s everything of the child.    éloïse: a child who has pretty poos, is a child who thrives.",0,
427012,"i am a 20 year old man, and i have been fat since i was around 11.  there are various reasons why i 'got fat' at that age, but it would be boring to say all of them. the basic thing you need to understand was it was a lot of bad decisions on my part, combined with my parents going through a messy, and unexpected divorce, a series of custody hearings that was more about my dad wanting to take us away from mom then finding what was best for us, and other stress. so i ate. plus, at the time (and for a few years afterward) my dad had 50% custody, and he had no idea how to feed kids. so me eating constantly for that summer was a-ok in his eyes. even if that meant eating most of a pizza (i was supposed to share w/ my younger brother, but he got 'full').  there is a lot of stuff i can't really explain with words. like what it feels like to walk out of fifth grade as an average kid and walk into sixth grade where the main topic of conversation is how fat lomaswesler got over the summer. or the first time you look in the mirror and realize that they are right, and you did get fat.   as a guy, i never got much teasing other then that first year. i've noticed this difference, my girlfriend (who also is fat) always talks about the weird looks, and pointed comments, but i either didn't notice them, or they didn't happen. because of this, especially as a kid, i never really got motivated to lose weight. i know it's not a popular opinion, but i think one of the reasons obesity is on the rise is because people seem scared to even mention it. like, i wish someone i cared for (my brother? best friend? parents?) had told me, 'yo lomaswesler, you are a fatass!' though the kids commented on my weight gain, it never was negative, it was always just mentioning it, or making a joke about it.   you want to know the worst part? it's psychological man. i didn't just gain weight that summer, looking at pictures, while at the time, looking in that mirror, i thought i was obese, an ugly fatass who nobody would ever care for, i had became chubby. nothing more, nothing less. my belly hung a bit over my jeans, but that was mostly because i was scared to ask for new pants because they didn't fit; my chest was no longer flat, but i had yet to grow defined manboobs. it's the psychological toll it takes on you that fucks you up.  i remember going from stress eating, to eating just because why not? looking back, i had fucked up my metabolism, and taught myself to ignore when i was full. why should i care? i was fat already, eating another slice of pizza wouldn't hurt.  i would bring a bag of skittles into my homeroom class, devour lunch asap so i could spend money on the vending machines, and then going to mcdonalds, taco bell, etc after school to buy a large coke, and as much as i afford. i'm not telling you this because i love retelling how i done fucked up, but because this is the psychological impact it can have on you. i knew this wasn't good, my damn friends would tell me it wasn't good. but i still did it. who cares?  by freshman year of highschool, i was fat. good, old fashioned fat. i was still in denial - a stage i started short after acceptance. i remember going to the doctor and seeing 200lbs pop up on the scale. i was fat. 200lbs couldn't be right, that was heavier then my dad! only truly obese people are 200 pounds! no, there must be something wrong with the scale, i couldn't be over 200 pounds!   of course, there was nothing wrong with the scale. if you looked at pictures of me in freshman year, you would know i was obese. and i knew it. i no longer took off my shirt to swim, or changed in public locker rooms. if i had to change, i had to go back to my house, back to my room. i didn't even sleep with my shirt off, for fear my brother, or mother would come in and realize what a fatass i was (not that they didn't already know). you know, sometimes it is hard for your mind to figure out just how fat you are.  i remember searching for pictures of 'fat 12 year old boy' and comparing myself to them as a 12 year old, because i wanted some validation that i was not as fat as i thought i was. you search for some sort of validation, some reason it is okay that you are going to eat that last twinkie.   i wish i could say i took the hint, slimmed down, and lost weight. that frashman year was definitely one of those times where i could have gone either way - and almost did. i actually got up off my ass and got onto the football team, and i remember losing 10 pounds and celebrating by rushing off to wendy's and gorging myself like it was thanksgiving.  but by halfway through the year, i had discovered that i liked the taste of (shitty) beer more then the seemingly endless football workouts, and i was getting tired of being, 'the big freshman we put in the front to stand there' on the field. i found excuses to not go to winter workout sessions, and eventually quit all together. and fat me came back with a vengeance.  its like a disease, you have to be really dedicated to stopping its spread before you make progress. i spent a semester eating, eating, eating. by the summer i could no longer deny that i was some fatass motherfucker. i was fat. but i didn't care.  that summer, i also started to notice the looks. i was no longer on the range of normal, i was obese, and no matter whether i kept my shirt on, people could see. when we went on our annual trip to the beach, my 12 year old brother purposefully stayed away from me, like he was scared people would put two and two together and realize that fatass was the skinny kid's big brother. when we went for icecream, the server looked at me twice if i ordered a large sunday. if we went for fast food, i was always the person the guy behind the cash register asked, 'will that will be all?'   it was always my intention to go back to football my sophomore year. i felt like it was something i was good at, and something i felt like i was valued for. the coach had even encouraged me to try out again when i quit.   and then i went to tryouts. i honestly didn't think i was 250 pounds. that would mean i had gained 50 pounds in maybe 6 months. you can't do that, right? but the coach took one look at me, pulled me aside, and told me that, ""i'm sorry, but i think you might just be too big to put out there, and i honestly don't know if you are healthy enough to go out there."" i remember the exact words, and i remember rushing home and stepping on that scale. 250 pounds. i also remember the aches, the shortness of breathe, the lack of stamina. coach was right, i was not healthy enough to go out on that field, but at the time i didn't think that way. all these symptoms would only get worse.  and i downed my worries the only way i new how, a couple burgers, refill soda, and then meeting up with friends in the woods to chug beer until i blacked out. at this point, that took a lot of shitty beer.  let me tell you about fat people friends. by this point, most of my friends were fat, or at the very least, chubby and highly unathletic. our main hobbies were eating and getting drunk. i was the only 'smart' one there, but i also was the fattest, so i would say it was a wash. you tend to hang with people just like you when you are fat. i deluded myself by always comparing myself to my friends, and compared to them, i wasn't so bad. or, well, it was easier to say i wasn't so damn bad.   also, that year, i got my first girlfriend. ""megan,"" who was, quite fittingly, the fattest girl at school. i wasn't attracted to megan, but you learn to accept compromise when you are a sophomore pushing 260 pounds of fat. i remember lying on my bed, fooling around, and trying to envision her as a model. as a skinny girl i was attracted to, while being disgusted at the same time by the fat girl in my bed. you learn to settle.  my life just spiraled at this point. i struggled in school where i used to get all as. my dad tried to get back involved in my life, before deciding he only wanted to visit with my slender brother. i ate more and more. i remember my brother getting an xbox 360 for christmas, and me getting an exorcise bike. i ate some more.   i remember junior year pleading with my mom to not take me to the doctors, i remember when 320 popped up on the scale. i remember my brother bringing his first boyfriend home, and telling me to stay in my room, or better yet, ""go get drunker and fatter then you already are."" i remember visiting my grandma and eating the whole pizza she had ordered and then asking if there was more. i remember megan breaking up with me because i was, ""a fat, disgusting slob,"" i remember smoking weed for the first time, i remember the massive munchies afterwards. is it bad that i think fonder thoughts of the munchies then the weed?   and then i remember senior year. i remember the 365 on the scale. megan coming in after losing 40 pounds over the summer. the cheap alcohol i chugged alone in the forest after ditching school. the constant pain i was in, the struggle to walk even the shortest distances. the looks. the comments. my brother's friends cornering me and tormenting me as he watched. my brother's boyfriend constantly leaving dieting books around the house where i could find them. my brother telling his boyfriend that, ""he will never lose weight, he's just here and i'm just waiting for him to die.""   i remember lying on my bed at night and my brother coming in and crying, telling me that he is just scared that i'm dying. that he misses when we were kids and would play in the pool, when i could walk up stairs without looking like i was going to die. i remember pushing him away, i remember hitting him when he tried to come back and comfort me. i remember sitting in the back of a cop car, and barely fitting. i remember thinking that i should not have chugged those 16 beers.   i remember my mom, i remember telling her i loved her. i remember her pushing me away. i remember trying to find a rope to kill myself",0,

526321,"warm sunshine merrying over the sea. the nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet. why should i bring it down? or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship? he went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes. i am another now and yet the same. a servant too. a server of a servant. in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan's gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning. —we'll be choked, buck mulligan said. haines, open that door, will you? stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors. —have you the key? a voice asked. —dedalus has it, buck mulligan said. janey mack, i'm choked! he howled, without looking up from the fire: —kinch! —it's in the lock, stephen said, coming forward. the key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. haines stood at the doorway, looking out. stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief. —i'm melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... but, hush! not a word more on that subject! kinch, wake up! bread, butter, honey. haines, come in. the grub is ready. bless us, o lord, and these thy gifts. where's the sugar? o, jay, there's no milk. stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker. buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet. —what sort of a kip is this? he said. i told her to come after eight. —we can drink it black, stephen said thirstily. there's a lemon in the locker. —o, damn you and your paris fads! buck mulligan said. i want sandycove milk. haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: —that woman is coming up with the milk. —the blessings of god on you! buck mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair. sit down. pour out the tea there. the sugar is in the bag. here, i can't go fumbling at the damned eggs. he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: —in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti. haines sat down to pour out the tea. —i'm giving you two lumps each, he said. but, i say, mulligan, you do make strong tea, don't you? buck mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman's wheedling voice: —when i makes tea i makes tea, as old mother grogan said. and when i makes water i makes water. —by jove, it is tea, haines said. buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: —so i do, mrs cahill, says she. begob, ma'am, says mrs cahill, god send you don't make them in the one pot. he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife. —that's folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, haines. five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum. printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind. he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: —can you recall, brother, is mother grogan's tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads? —i doubt it, said stephen gravely. —do you now? buck mulligan said in the same tone. your reasons, pray? —i fancy, stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion. mother grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of mary ann. buck mulligan's face smiled with delight. —charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly. do you think she was? quite charming! then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:      —for old mary ann      she doesn't care a damn.      but, hising up her petticoats... he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned. the doorway was darkened by an entering form. —the milk, sir! —come in, ma'am, mulligan said. kinch, get the jug. an old woman came forward and stood by stephen's elbow. —that's a lovely morning, sir, she said. glory be to god. —to whom? mulligan said, glancing at her. ah, to be sure! stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker. —the islanders, mulligan said to haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces. —how much, sir? asked the old woman. —a quart, stephen said. he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers. old shrunken paps. she poured again a measureful and a tilly. old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. she praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out. crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. they lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. a wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. to serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour. —it is indeed, ma'am, buck mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups. —taste it, sir, she said. he drank at her bidding. —if we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn't have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives' spits. —are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked. —i am, ma'am, buck mulligan answered. —look at that now, she said. stephen listened in scornful silence. she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in god's likeness, the serpent's prey. and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes. —do you understand what he says? stephen asked her. —is it french you are talking, sir? the old woman said to haines. haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently. —irish, buck mulligan said. is there gaelic on you? —i thought it was irish, she said, by the sound of it. are you from the west, sir? —i am an englishman, haines answered. —he's english, buck mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak irish in ireland. —sure we ought to, the old woman said, and i'm ashamed i don't speak the language myself. i'm told it's a grand language by them that knows. —grand is no name for it, said buck mulligan. wonderful entirely. fill us out some more tea, kinch. would you like a cup, ma'am? —no, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go. haines said to her: —have you your bill? we had better pay her, mulligan, hadn't we? stephen filled again the three cups. —bill, sir? she said, halting. well, it's seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. that's a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir. buck mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets. —pay up and look pleasant, haines said to him, smiling. stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk. buck mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: —a miracle! he passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: —ask nothing more of me, sweet. all i can give you i give. stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand. —we'll owe twopence, he said. —time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. time enough. good morning, sir. she curtseyed and went out, followed by buck mulligan's tender chant:      —heart of my heart, were it more,      more would be laid at your feet. he turned to stephen and said: —seriously, dedalus. i'm stony. hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money. today the bards must drink and junket. ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty. —that reminds me, haines said, rising, that i have to visit your national library today. —our swim first, buck mulligan said. he turned to stephen and asked blandly: —is this the day for your monthly wash, kinch? then he said to haines: —the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month. —all ireland is washed by the gulfstream, stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf. haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: —i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me. speaking to me. they wash and tub and scrub. agenbite of inwit. conscience. yet here's a spot. —that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good. buck mulligan kicked stephen's foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: —wait till you hear him on hamlet, haines. —well, i mean it, haines said, still speaking to stephen. i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in. —would i make any money by it? stephen asked. haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: —i don't know, i'm sure.",0,

962858,"a boy named james henry trotter, 4 years old, lives with his loving parents in a pretty and bright cottage by the sea in the south of england. james's world is turned upside down when, while on a shopping trip in london, his mother and father are eaten up by an escaped rhinoceros. as a result, james is forced to live with his two cruel aunts, spiker and sponge, who live in a run-down house on a high, desolate hill near the white cliffs of dover. for three years, the evil spiker and sponge verbally and physically abuse james, not allowing him to venture beyond the hill or play with other children. around the house james is treated as a drudge, beaten for hardly any reason, improperly fed, and forced to sleep on bare floorboards in the attic.  one summer afternoon, while he is crying in the bushes after being overworked and abused by the two women, james stumbles across a strange old man, who, mysteriously, knows all about james's problems with his aunts and gives him a sack of tiny glowing-green crocodile tongues. the man promises that if james mixes the contents of the sack with a jug of water and ten hairs from his own head, the result will be a magic potion which, when drunk, will bring him happiness and great adventures. on the way back to the house, james trips and spills the sack onto the peach tree outside his home, which had previously never given fruit. the tree becomes enchanted through the tongues, and begins to blossom; indeed a certain peach grows to the size of a large house. the aunts discover this and make money off the giant peach while keeping james locked away. when night comes, the aunts shove james outside to collect rubbish from the crowd, **but instead he curiously ventures inside a juicy, fleshy tunnel** which leads to the hollow stone in the middle of the cavernous fruit. entering the stone, james discovers a rag-tag band of human-sized, talking invertebrates (a grasshopper, centipede, earthworm spider, ladybug, silkworm and glow-worm), also transformed by the magic of the green tongues.  james quickly befriends the inhabitants of the peach, who become central to the plot and james' companions in his adventure. they loathe the aunts and their hilltop home as much as james, and they have been waiting for him to join them so they can escape together. the centipede bites through the stem of the peach with his powerful jaws, releasing it from the tree, and it begins to roll down the hill, squashing spiker and sponge flat and subsequently killing them in its progress. inside the stone the inhabitants cheer as they feel the peach rolling over the aunts. the peach rolls through villages, houses, and a famous chocolate factory before falling off the cliffs and into the sea. the peach floats in the english channel, but quickly drifts away from civilization and into the expanses of the atlantic ocean. hours later, not far from the azores, the peach is attacked by a swarm of hundreds of sharks. using the blind earthworm as bait, the ever resourceful james and the other inhabitants of the peach lure over five hundred seagulls to the peach from the nearby islands. the seagulls are then tied to the broken stem of the fruit using spiderwebs from the spider and strings of white silk from the silkworm. the mass of seagulls lifts the undamaged giant peach into the air and away from the sharks.  as the seagulls try to get away from the giant peach, they merely carry it higher and higher, and the seagulls take the giant peach great distances. the centipede entertains with ribald dirges to sponge and spiker, but in his excitement he falls off the peach into the ocean and has to be rescued by james. that night, thousands of feet in the air, the giant peach floats through mountain-like, moonlit clouds. there the inhabitants of the peach see a group of magical ghost-like figures living within the clouds, ""cloud-men"", who control the weather.  as the cloud-men gather up the cloud in their hands to form hailstones and snowballs to throw down to the world below, the loud-mouthed centipede insults the cloud-men for making snowy weather in the summertime. angered, an army of cloud-men appear from the cloud and pelt the giant peach with hail so fiercely and powerfully that the peach is severely damaged, with entire chunks taken out of it, and the giant fruit begins leaking its peach juice. all of this shrinks the peach somewhat, although because it is now lighter the seagulls are able to pull it more quickly through the air. as the seagulls strain to get away from the cloud-men, the giant peach smashes through an unfinished rainbow the cloud-men were preparing for dawn, infuriating them even further. one cloud-man almost gets on the peach by climbing down the silken strings tied to the stem, but james asks the centipede to bite through some of the strings. when he does a single freed seagull, from which the cloud-man is hanging, is able to carry the weightless cloud-man away from the peach.  as the sun rises, the inhabitants of the giant peach see the glimmering skyscrapers of new york city peeking above the clouds. the people below see the giant peach suspended in the air by a swarm of hundreds of seagulls and panic, believing it to be a floating, orange-coloured, spherical nuclear bomb. the military, police, fire department, and rescue services are all called out, and people begin running to air raid shelters and subway stations, believing the city is about to be destroyed. a huge passenger jet flies past the giant peach, almost hitting it, and severing the silken strings between the seagulls and the peach. no longer supported by the seagulls, the peach begins to fall to the ground, but it is saved when it is impaled upon the tip of the empire state building. the people on the 86th floor observation deck at first believe the inhabitants of the giant peach to be monsters or martians, but when james appears from within the skewered peach and explains his story, the people hail james and his friends as heroes. they are given a welcome-home parade, and james gets what he has wanted for three long years: millions of potential new playmates. the skewered, battered remains of the giant peach are brought down to the streets by steeplejacks, where its delicious flesh is eaten up by ten thousand children, all now james's friends. meanwhile, the peach's other former residents all go on to find very interesting futures in the world of humans.",0,

857966,"i'll edit my post in a bit to post some of my entries but i have a couple questions first.    1. are card games also acceptable sources of pictures?    2. one day seems an awfully short amount of time for something of this scale. might i suggest extending it a bit?    edit: okay, i looked long and hard, but this is what i've come up with so far!    first, let me list off what i want. since i think the ""gaming pc"" thing was probably a joke (besides, i kind of have one, it's just all kinds of fucked up), i'll list off, you know, cheaper, more realistic things.    1. **fairly expensive tier:** new 3ds xl bundle (they sell it off wal mart in a bundle with a game and a figure. i'd want smash bros with it. and uh... the kyogre figure i guess). i also kind of need an ac adapter since it doesn't come with one.     2. **kind of expensive tier:** nintendo wii console. that's right, not wii u, just a wii. but i need to be a model which i can mod. cause, you know, i'll be modding it :) some controllers and stuff thrown in would be nice too.    3. **not as expensive tier:** [street fighter v preorder, so i can get access to the beta.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/310950). if that's still too much, then we can discuss something else. :)     now on to the list!

772813,"------ spirit animal	 ------  saul.  his name was saul.  it was the name of his father. and the father before him. and the one before him. a line of sauls, reaching backwards into time until dust formed the bones of adam.   it was this that he had the image of in his mind as he felt the hot sun beat down on him and the grass that cradled his weak body. a body he could hardly feel any more.  the pain had been sharp at first. blinding. he was sure that he had screamed like a maiden introduced to the brute reality of man on her wedding night. his mouth had been twisted and agape when the blackness that came with the ache in his belly had cleared.  he did not know how long he had been stretched out on the vivid green blades of grass that, just this morning, had cushioned his stride towards the battlegrounds. time seemed to have dissipated; evaporated in the heat of the sun and the heavy, ominous haze of blood that hung in the air. all he knew was the ache in his belly, the lightness of being, and the repeating visual succession of his namesakes rising from the dust.   just like he would soon fall to dust.  *saul. i am saul.* he could feel his ragged breath slipping over his cracked lips. the coppery taste of blood.   the last time he had tasted blood was when he ran his tongue over the gash that had been his wife's maidenhead on their wedding night- only a fortnight ago. she had trembled then, as he trembled now. the sharp conscious realization of irony cut through his mortal fog and for a split second he saw back into the present.  a wolf loomed over him. peering down at him with its head cocked to the side, the wolf saw the stirring within saul and brought his muzzle closer. the animal was giant. larger than the ones he had seen in the northern lands on his last voyage with the king's navy. much larger.  amber. it's eyes were amber. and they were two inches away from his. they were locked onto his as it crouched even further, bringing it's massive sable head even closer closer to his.  *why am i not afraid?* saul wonders.   then, he smiles. his lips split and crack as his teeth strain against them.  *a wolf. a wolf on the battlefields of england. in daylight. oh, jesu, take me. i'm that close to you and the saints that i'm seeing wolves.*  he hears the familiar clink of chainmail and armor off to his side. out of his line of vision.  he remembers.  he remembers why he is laid on the grass in northern england with a faint pain in his belly.  he remembers why he is repeating his name and why visions of his namesakes are rolling through his mind--all the way back to the dust of adam.  he knows what will be there when he looks down, past the fur of the impossible wolf couched over him, but he cannot stop himself.  a sword. he remembers the sword. like he remembers the taste of his wet nurse's milk; like the scent of his mother's skin; like he felt the brute force of his father; the fragility of his wife on their wedding night.   saul had been gaining the upper hand before the knight he was matched against had found the weakness in his armor. even through the heavy metal visors that covered his nemesis' face and the smoke and chaos of war that surrounded them- saul had seen the delight ripple at the sight of his armor's gap.   then he had thrust the sword into saul's belly, with all the weight that the human body could push into trajectory behind it.  *saul.*   it wasn't his own voice that carried his name. saul's ragged breathing paused.  *saul. look at me.*  he looks up.   up at the monstrous and simply impossible wolf that stared down at him, gunpowder and the screams of dying men echoing behind it.  *look at me. listen to me. you don't have much time.*  something deep within saul kept him from pushing the voice aside.   it was an ancient voice. it was a voice that was dry with dust, scratching over his eardrums as the sound sunk deep into his bones.   he looked back into the wolf's amber eyes. they were more than amber. gold. they were the color of gold, with rich red blood running over the metal.  saul understood then, that he did not have much longer to live, he was thankful for that.   he understood that life flickered in the belly of his wife. another saul.   he understood that he would soon become part of the chain of namesakes before him, and the wolf would be his guide.   but saul also understood that before he could close his eyes and dig his fingers into the wolf's fur to take the journey back into dust, he had one last task to complete before his role was complete.  the wolf seemed to nod. he knew what secrets laid in the river of blood red and gold that his eyes held. he knew that mortal men see much more of the world when they are close to death and he had acted as guide and as he had looked into the eyes of saul's father, and each saul before him, he knew when the mortal understood.  *get up.*   saul blinks, beginning to comprehend.  *you will be able to move. i will lend you my strength. get up.. bring the sword up with you. kill him. kill him so that your line lives on, and that england shall hold sovereign.*   saul commands his fingers to move. the armor shines as his wrist flexes.  the wolf steps back to give saul room. he has seen this before with each saul before this one. a man of pure strength, a touch more than mortal-thanks to a drink of the bloody waters that lived in his eyes. the wolf enjoyed watching his own raw animalistic power dance in the veins of this line of short-lived humans. it was curious, the bloody and brief lives they led, each life ending as soon as the wombs of their raped teenaged wives quickened. for there could only be one saul on this earth.  and this saul would protect the future of england. the ends must justify the means, the wolf muses in light of the moral shortcomings of each saul.   *they succumb to the animals of their nature, i suppose.* the wolf muses to himself.  saul can move his arms. the scales of his armor clash against each other as he brings himself upwards, grasping the hilt of the heavy sword that impales him to the earth.  the wolf watches on.  *this is the bargain i have struck with the very first saul, and this is the bargain that i complete with you. use the blood of mine that runs through you. get up. kill him. secure the future of england, and that of your progeny. now.*  and with a roar, saul springs to his feet, the plates of armor sliding into place around the gaping hole where the sword had pinned him to earth. he is clammy white, but dangerously focused and calm, blood pulses out of him with the curious metallic glint of gold at a steady pace.  the knight who impaled him is still resting on the laurels of victory only several feet away. he is calling that he has slain the leader, to collect their men and that the battle is over.   and saul smiles.   he smiles and his lips crack and ooze with the ruby and gold glow that is his blood-right. this was the moment he was born to die in, he knows this.  and as the crowd gathers before his opponent, saul raises his arms upwards to the heavens, the sword of his enemy clasped between each metal glove covering his giant hands. he looks at the sea of his breathless men, the loyal men who followed him to the battlefield and thought their leader dead. he sees the glimmer of victory that springs forth like a wellspring in their eyes as they see him rise up from the dead. they know what to do, and reach for the swords on their hips.  saul brings the sword downwards with the fury and precision of an apex predator--right towards the exposed nape of his opponent. he falls, cloven in half by the steel blade that was his own.  as his men form a sea of flashing blades to cut down the remaining troops of the invaders, saul turns to face the wolf.  *are you ready now, saul?* the wolf asks him as he walks up alongside the mortal, so that he could dig his fingers into the fur around his neck and hold steady as they begin their journey.  saul pants weakly, squinting to see in the bright sunlight. he feels lighter as each thud of his dying heart pushes a steady pulse of blood out of his belly. the red fades into gold as the blood dries on his armor. he gives the fur of the wolf, his guide, a tug to show affirmation. he cannot remain in this world for much longer.  the wolf brings one giant paw forward, matching the stride of the human beside him. he has concluded his end of the bargain that he had made with the very first saul. england was safe, and this new son would begin a new line--free of the savagery of his forefathers that was once upon a time, necessary to ensure his very inception.  *from dust thou art, to dust thou shalt return.* the wolf's rich voice brings saul to his knees.  and he implodes. he disintegrates into a shower of dust as he slides off the mortal coil. only the dried blood that shimmers gold on the grassy hill of northern england is proof of the physical plane he leaves behind.",0,

660856,"from what i can understand the rationale for the price reduction has nothing to do with helping people get more drunk during the recession. it's to stop people who can't afford to consume the legal vodka from purchasing illicit supplies.  the government in the past decade has been increasing taxes on it and implementing stricter rules. it's reduced consumption and deaths by a third so far. however the downside to this is that illicit vodka is becoming more common for those who can't afford the prices.  this has been a problem for some time now.  http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/07/17/russias-vodka-tax-backfiring/ &gt; as many experts – and drinkers – warned from the start, high taxes on alcohol have driven hard-drinking russians to seek out cheaper, illegal sources of booze. vodka makers complain that they can no longer compete with a thriving black market offering cut price liquor and moonshine.  http://english.pravda.ru/business/companies/21-11-2012/122882-vodka-0/ &gt; according to official figures, the volume of vodka sold on the russian market doubles the amount of produced vodka. in 2011, the statistical difference was 40 percent. factory counterfeit products, produced in the ""fourth shift"", are available in all cities of russia and take about one-third of the market - one billion bottles.   it's right for the government to take action on vodka consumption and illicit production. russia has sorted it's self out from being the demographic basketcase it was, however there are still to many russians dying unnecessarily. unless they can stop police and officials from turning a blind eye on the illicit production, raising taxes won't do much.   they need to take a more long term approach. the way the uk does when it comes to stopping drinking and driving and smoking. hard hitting ads, ngos and youth groups that spread awareness, large alcohol free zones that makes drinking inconvenient and etc.  at this point it's a societal issue and not something that can be solved by higher taxes.",0,

118883,"dream pulled away, wide blue dreaming of the whole of creation and all her whirring blades and fitted sails dwindled down, whittled into this small part of her, with the bare-chested boys and the smell of machine grease and free power. suran remembered his arms and legs, all ten fingers, his slack lips and boy's patchy stubble, and power pulled back into him, into the tiny little room inside his chest; power closed the door behind it and pulled up a sheet of muscle and viscera and slept, spent entire. leaving suran breathing in the oil and air, now that he remembered he breathed. alone in the crowded space, the other boys bent with glass for eyes, gripped by the spiraling tubules of creation.  placed his back in the bracket and stood. only two legs. weak, now that the power was out of them. he found his shirt thrown over a puffing radiator, pulled it over his ragged chest and the hood up, shading his too-bright eyes. had hand-holds in creation's belly for the boys to grasp as they walked up the winnowing stair, engineers having known they would be careening like drunks on the remembrance of their own bodies. found food in his cubicle, packed in its pneumatic, and lay there for a time among the heaped wiring and exhausted bodies, eating and waiting to feel all right.  so many hours. suran did not feel all right. when he stood and the power was sleeping still, suran knew that the illness had found him at last.  considered seeing the medica in their white warrens, but decided against it. could do nothing for jahim when his power sprouted madness. was doing nothing for kayinde, high on her leper's perch. considered weeping, but suran did not have the power even for that.  came to all of them in time, said the guru when suran was in his cloister. sooner or later, but the illness came sooner and sooner, every year. the policia said that creation was editing herself, that it had no more use for little boys with lightning in their blood; but then why did she birth them at all, to spend what they were in her engine-room and wheeze out their thunder uselessly into the air? they were still down there, the boys, pressing their lightnings into the machine-belly, making creation move, and this would be suran's last time among them, now that the weakness had come to him.  perhaps he would not tell them at all.  suran found inside him a mask of strength, and wore it. it looked like his own face and that was close enough. he stood on woozy legs and spiraled up the winnowed walkway, grasping the hand-holds where ten thousand hands, emptied of lightning, had grasped after their work was done, up out of creation's belly and into her heart, where birthed the thousand smells of meat and sweat and damp cloth and charged air. pneumatic relays right by the door to the engine, aswirl with messages. and there were people doing the business of people, people with babes in their arms, ragged and beautiful bulbs of brown flesh and dark eyes, so many of them, so many.  when he was a boy there had been the war, and they had thought to make him a stormcaller. but creation had proven triumphant, and everyone with the power served in some way. suran did not think he could bear to see them slaughtered for their meat and tiny treasures. suran did not think that he could bear to stand on creation's prow and bring ruin to people just as these.  but that was not his fate. all those with power must serve: the medicae in their white halls, sharp eyes pinning the illness down; the windbringers on their high masts, filling the sails with life; the lifeweavers in the meat pens, coaxing goats and little birds from clumps of cells; and him; and him, and the other stormcaller boys, hives of them in the belly of the ship, their lightnings channeled into creation herself.  for as long as he was able. for as long as he could pretend. a man knocked him, as suran stumbled to his room, and his weakness was such that he nearly fell. the man was big and full of curses, but checked himself when he saw the color of the bos eyes and was gone, a part of the people, gone.  weakness chewing on his heart with every step.  but up the mainway there were stalls, hanging plastic painted bright colors and selling honey-roasted finchlings rolled in crystal salt; old gold beaten into new shapes as the crowds watched; performers dancing on the tips of tall free-standing poles. the wide stairs from the underbelly led to the workrooms, the honeybee chambers steeped in lye-scent, arush with movement as messengers loaded food and paper and payment and medicine into pneumatics and sent them rushing with the run of a scroll and a puff of their breath. up the wide stairs and then there was the sky, the wide sky alive with moving breezes, invisible but to those who had the power and then: the paint of hidden electricity, of dry breath and tall, tall sunshine, as glorious above as it was dirty below, in the tormented world that creation had left behind.  he did not look up, to his left. he knew there would be a cage there, a thin woman on a tall pole, dark skin burned and white eyes singing. he knew she would be breathing fast, now, the wild wind seeking its escape from her sweating useless body. he did not look to the cubby near the western rim, where the railing split and let two pairs of legs dangle, two hands clasp, two voices catch and swirl and talk about oh, anything. about the feel of their first catchweed smoke. about the long months coming, in cloister. about how their children, if conceived, when conceived, might have one or either of their power. or neither. or both. and then a giggle, eaten by the copper plating and rivets: how long would they have to spend in cloister? we'll see, kayinde, we'll see.  a promise or a threat? he loved her, maybe.  suran would make it back to his bunk and lay there. he would eat and rest, a new cloister, and touch his power with inward hands, waking it slowly. and the next day he would descend into the belly of creation and lend his lightnings to her great endeavor, to her march across the dirty, glorious sky. because he loved her.  little breezes around the backs of his heels. yes. yes, he loved her.(",0,
657420,"ohio resident checking in.   i went to ohio state and lived in columbus for 4 years. i've lived in cleveland and youngstown. i grew up in a 'bubble city', which was essentially a suburb that people rarely left. my mom still lives there and i live less than 90 minutes away. she says the drive to my city takes 'all day'. big bubble city. columbus and cleveland are the typical 'big cities' that subscribe to concentric zone theory. the farther you get away from the downtown area, the nicer (read: whiter) the area. youngstown is similar, and my favorite of the three. people always call it the 'murder capitol of america/ohio', but i've always liked it. the youngstown area has stupid niggers that'll shoot each other and avoid whitey. our rising problem is white trash meth-heads committing bigger, more damaging crimes.   what i'm seeing in my hometown and in my current area, is that the quiet little streets are slowly being invaded by blacks. old people who live in the same home for 30+ years are dying or being moved into nursing homes. their homes sell for a ridiculously low price, which is attractive to people who turn around and rent to trash or blacks who somehow managed to purchase a house. then it just continues until the whole block is invaded and the street that you grew up on is unrecognizable and/or no longer safe.   in my experience, the upside is that they tend to segregate themselves. yes, they're nearby and you have to deal with chimpouts if you need to go to the mall. but they're less likely to be your neighbors. if i have to deal with them, i'd rather deal with them at the mall than next door. i live in a rental townhouse that is connected to 5 other units. all white. love it. we had one black neighbor and he just moved out two weeks ago. my husband announced it to me with an 8am text message saying ""there's a uhaul out front and the spooks are loading it up! everything is gonna be all white on the block!""  they weren't the worst neighbors ever, but i have no idea who the hell actually lived there. there was one guy that we think was the actual tenant, who wasn't too bad but his guests were the problem. his baby mama came over every other day or so and parked in our spots (we have just enough spaces for 1 car per unit in an assigned spot plus 3 extra spaces for multi-car families and we have resident stickers on our cars.) instead of on the side of the building where the guests were supposed to park. in the summer, his ghetto glider stayed in the parking spot for extra cars, instead of his assigned fucking carport, thus taking up two spots with one car. probably because he 'deserved it' or some shit. then his coon babies insisted on playing in our portion of the yard. i only saw them like 3 times, but the first was the most memorable. it was hot as fuck and we'd just moved in. i was unpacking in my kitchen and i was just wearing a sports bra and yoga pants. i decide to open my blinds to let my kitties look out the back window and to my surprise, i was met with 4 pairs of eyes. all 4 of his kids were camped out on my porch, poking at the screen to fuck with my cats. my cats do not like kids (or blacks, honestly because they never see them) and started hissing. good babies.  so between the porch monkey kids and his random colt 45 parties that wound up with sheboon drama on the back porch (very entertaining, i loved trying to figure out who be triflin'), we weren't sad to see him go.   ohio is very good for some stupid ape news though.   here's ak-rowdy representing: [salsa chimp out](http://www.cleveland.com/akron/index.ssf/2015/03/woman_accused_of_stabbing_akro.html) *akron is one city that i will never move to, because it's terrifying.",1,

158095,"i personally bought my first road bike about a month ago and i've been using it to commute to work since. i absolutely love it. i've put approximately 160km on it and have yet to have an issue. the main reason i bring it up is because i spent just over $200 on it. i've left the link for it below.    if you go with this bike, get some different pedals and some cork tape for the handle bars. i find myself using the top portion of the handle bars the most and this section is just metal. the pedals on the bike work fine, but the cage really makes you use the tip of your foot to power the bike which i didn't like, and it adds weight to the front of the pedal so they always try to flip down when you're putting your foot in.    the pedals i got have an adjustable velcro strap that allow me to put the middle of my foot on the pedal which seems to help a lot with applying torque. after adding the cork tape the comfort went up tenfold. invest in some nice riding gloves too, these not only protect you in case of falls but help with comfort quite a bit.    the other huge plus of this bike over higher priced bikes, even with the pedals, cork tape, lock, lights, etc. i spent just over $360.    i also want to point out that since starting cycling, i've lost a noticeable amount of fat from my legs and they are starting to get pretty toned, my abdominals are even starting to show. keep in mind i do weight train every other day, but until i added the biking my results weren't showing as quickly.  [this is the bike](http://www.amazon.com/critical-cycles-classic-fixed-gear-single-speed/dp/b00glnzv04) (i got the white framed one with black wheels/handlebars/etc.)    [these are the pedals](http://www.amazon.com/retrospec-bicycles-bmx-style-platform-freestyle/dp/b00dpd5b9e/ref=sr_1_11?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1434054075&amp;sr=1-11&amp;keywords=bike+pedal+strap)    **ps**. the bike is a fixed speed so there is a lot of work involved you wouldn't normally get from a freewheel hub, but it does have a flip-flop hub to switch to freewheel if you like. i like the fixed hub set up, but i had never ridden one before, so it did take some getting used to. it gives you better control over the bike, i almost never use the brake. it's also a harder work out, but that's kind of the point of riding for fitness.   **pps**. this bike is quick, i average 27 km/h and have clocked it going as fast as 35 km/h.",0,

970997,"for those with add, let us repeat this: jesus was a pez dispenser. blame hoffman! party flies arrive to join the fun, they lounge on reclining chair clouds. amber candy canes grew where the bamboo once stood, and the wee ones rushed to suck on them. justin picked the “purple haze” (because of jimi) but didn’t wait long enough. after six minutes, he thought it best to eat some “purple jesus” blotter (from an alex grey painting) along with some of the “brown dots” (because he saw what it did to his manager.) after waiting another six minutes, he traded a dog treat for diablo’s other half of the “tail lights.” twenty-five minutes later, justin chased a real car (later described by a witness as “powder blue and fuzzy”). a shower of iced animal crackers and metallic red sprinkles rained down upon us. shelee took “mad hatter” and spent hours in search of a corn dog that held the answers to life’s greatest mysteries. she eventually gave up and retired to the hot tub where she sipped champagne with mackie’s faeries. an orange bus floated by, filled with businessmen dressed in drag who tossed paper flowers and tin candies out the windows. a cloud of purple wheelchair billowed out the back. (blame hofmann.) venus kitty did the alchemist owsley’s (?) “pink haze” (blair’s personal favorite) and bit the head off of “fruit pie the magician”. she then disappeared. the swedish tourists sipped opaque martinis and white sparks exploded in the sky. an eruption of bluebirds. a chameleon didn’t change colors. for those with add, let us repeat this: a chameleon didn’t change colors. chris picked “skelton &amp; roses” and drank tanqueray tonics, as did mr. hyde, even though there were no tacos in sight. anna ate a “turqoise tealeaf” and floated off on a wave of champagne. dale did “liquid sky” and maureen “groovy lemon.” they climbed on the roof and took vince’s commodore for a spin, thinking it was the purple charger back to life at last. blame hofmann… a blinding flash of yellow as the ground dissolves. the stars turned green and tumbled into the hot tub, tickling shelee’s toes. the sky split in two and for a second we saw travis. there was a woman with a perfect smile, but then you woke up. breck lit a joint and the orange bus came back for him. jeweled fire engines chased the sparks of his purple wheelchair. the gargoyle winked. junior did a drop of “liquid sky” on a golden graham and pointed a cigar at a mirror ball. bryan and tracey shared a “pink pyro” and giggled at the swedes dancing bare-bottomed inside the tv. vince rode an orange wave down to the 7-11 for more tecate but came back with dingle-berry juice and irish vodka. dan doll dropped “blue cheer” and jumped off the roof, just missing the st. patrick’s day joy riders. beards grew justin and sasha. horse-head jen dosed on “pumpkin pelt” and boot scooted from the balcony to the grassplot moon. karin and statik did “magenta sunshine” and brought forth a bouquet of shadows from the opalescent flame of hookaa. aaron from isis ate the “blue pine-apple” and tattooed eyes as he drove a school bus of furry fish to meet his leprechaun friends. blame hofmann! children with cheeto dust on their finger touched the melting walls. henry had a cherry coke (not acid, but a real cherry coke, laced with vanilla whisky – he figured someone had to be ‘ground control.’ we wondered later if it really was just a cherry coke, as he wandered past whispering to captain – sorry, corporal – cupcake, oblivious to our questionable presence…) unfortunately he (also?) had a flashback from a previous acid trip and, without any copilots, a lot of planes crashed into the mountains. fork was still in the bathroom. cleopatra appeared in the fireplace and sang us a lullaby. heather returned from the forest with a basket emerald gumdrops. glitter bugs crawled up the red velvet curtain, escaping the moonbeams that search. dawn did a “pink witch” and dyed aloke’s hair blonde. graves did some “geisha girl” and got off (fast.) amber took “heavenly blue” and grew six inches as she danced under the hot midnight sun. the pool overflowed and a metallic tide washed over the garden. the prism of a golden buddha smeared with chocolate. scott and renee returned from the sun and tried the “peacock’s tail,” then went for a drive and came back with three ugandan hairless retrievers (the first of their breed to enter the us) and a real mongoose for aloke. blame hofmann. a small crop formation appeared on the carpet. this was the “tool army” star. someone dropped “green double dome” but we can’t remember who. the carpet got up and left. benny dropped a hit of “e. pluribus newman” and stood naked, watching as the swimming pool dove into him. melanie did an anniversary square of “hofmann” and went in search of swans. kat dismounted her tree in a cloud of pink smoke and looked melanie in the eye. “there are no swans here.” justin asked if there was any more “space medicine” because he was so close to figuring out the buddha connection. when we told him we were out, he went to see “fruit pie the magician.” once again, i told him we were out… bluish arabesques of incense drank the last corona. a pewter policeman cracked the silver patron unknown. monkeys with tambourine hats in the absinthe rain on matchbox streets. across the lawn they danced side by side, past jubilant bush islands in a stream of sunshine. black star found. red and green cobwebs held captive by albino fruit flies. polka dotted pine cones burst through daffodils made of glass dripping with honey and wine. collapsing walls and spinning ceilings and quills quivered on the threshold of reality. the bathroom was in fork….",0,
498179,"i have a somewhat different perspective that jeremy, since i was a grunt ops guy/junior sysadmin for most of the 90s, but i'd agree with his conclusion.  i worked in publishing, and in the first half of the 90s a huge amount of the specialised systems ran on unix systems of one sort or another.  the difficulties of maintaining ports (and probably sweetheart backroom deals between vendors) meant that from a customer perspective you'd have an irix rip powering your colour lasers[1], maybe a sunos rip for your film printers, perhaps some aix workstations for your ad layout systems and opi, and solaris for your newer bromide units.    the userlands in all these systems were different enough to be a pain to keep current on, and you'd end up having resellers and customers hiring a very high ratio of unix ops people to servers.  windows nt went through this industry like a dose of salts.  software vendors could write once, compile for intel and alpha (the main two architectures i saw in production) and have a very limited set of support hassles.  resellers needed one set of technical support skills, as did customers.  the fact that nt cost a fraction of the proprietary unices, even on alpha hardware, was a nice bonus, but it paled compared to the support headaches.   by the end of the 90s unix was in a death spiral.  free clones were pretty much the only reason *ix survived.  i find frankly disturbing echoes of the era in peoples' determination to keep special snowflake init mechanisms, config layouts, and userland behaviours alive so every linux distro is painfully different, tbh.

890264,"**iceland: hotel wi-fi**  from the long balcony i have a dreary panorama around the entire sweep of the harbour, across to the puffin colony on the island of engey. glowing dimly, far over the water, under cloud, i can just make out the peninsula of akranes, where yesterday i watched blacksmiths forging intricate ironworks and discussing how to re-invigorate their dying art.   inside, heated by volcanic fire, the radiators are too hot to touch, and the scalding water in the bathroom smells luciferous, tainted by minute traces of subterranean hydrogen sulphide.   my luggage contains only a few essential pants, sweaters and t-shirts, making it a small, almost flat carry-on. my backpack, containing power supplies, cables and adaptors, swells like a melon.   the glow of my phone and tablet give the study desk an ethereal cherenkov glow. brochures for whale meat, glaciers, and four wheel drive tours of the highland f roads litter the desk. i read about the rapid glacial erosion enlarging the tragically beautiful eastern bay at jökulsárlón.  i login, and within seconds the messages swamp my inbox. my phone pings updates from a variety of messaging services. at first i ignore, then actively delete updates about the lives of dozens of people whose names i once noted intently.  outside, reykjavik bars smash the night awake beneath a slow, slushy sleet. crowds of young people, each one individually burdened with a mountainous debt to foreign nations, smoke cigarettes, quaff expensive imported beer and stare blankly at their phones.   **malta: house wlan**   violent african sunshine, paired with a vicious adriatic wind, one elemental force gradually eroding the fabric of the sunshade, the other working to destroy it brutally and immediately.  it is a modern, angular house, with gadgets installed in every corner. two pools, the indoor heated and misting the sliding glass doors to the living room, even though outside it is already 39°c.  i download some ironic nineties pop and stream it over bluetooth, connecting to the terrace speakers. in the background the television shows the giro. unseasonable, enormous snowbanks loom over the route up the stelvio, and snowflakes coat the lens of the live chase camera.  ants conquer some scraps of sugar beneath the table. a solitary bee floats busily above a lemon tree. i have read that in china they are already pollinating fruit trees by hand.   later, in the south of the island, we drive past the rat’s town immigrant detention camps. each unit has a satellite dish. washing lines display footballing loyalties, the modern, trans-national flags of belonging. nobody watches us pass.  by the roadside at pretty bay, a farmer’s children sell fresh strawberries in the shadow of a gargantuan container ship. it is berthed for a sixteen hour turnaround at the freeport, stopping only to trans-ship low-cost consumer goods.  one hundred meters from the ship, crinkled grey-bronze pensioners lounge on a sun-blonde beach. the strong wade into the milky blue warmth of the shallow bay, to refresh and relax before enjoying a state-sponsored lunch.   i get a short, terse text message about work and focus on the tiny screen, trying to decipher the real message, hidden between the characters.   **washington dc: mobile broadband**  from the corner office i watch, mesmerized, as airplanes land and take off from runway 1r of dulles. they lunge into the sky every few seconds, initially straining for flight, before smoothly accelerating into the adventure of heaven.  i drive to the nearby air and space museum. i wander for hours, in awe of the vast elegance of the discovery, puzzled by the stunted, shiny normality of the enola gay. i buy a packet of space ice cream, a desiccated strawberry tablet that melts on contact with my saliva.   in one corner, beneath a corona spy satellite, an icbm guidance computer from the 1970’s awaits command. as i read the placard i realize that the handset in my pocket has two hundred times more memory, and a processor that runs a thousand times faster. i wonder if there are, secretly, apps on a customized smartphone that control and command these weapons today, nestling quietly in the pockets of generals and presidents.   in reston i try to locate a bookstore i had seen once before, but it is no longer there. despite the intellectual affluence of this area, all the large chains have closed, bankrupted and replaced by a vast online selection and free overnight delivery.  i order too much takeaway food, and retreat to my room to feast, folding a towel as a napkin across my lap, struggling to grapple the noodles with a white plastic spork.   as i eat, the television teaches me how to survive, alone and injured, on a deserted pacific island. i realize that discarded plastic bottles, torn nylon fishing nets and polystyrene packing lumps have all become wilderness essentials.   **rio de janeiro: hotel room lan**  it is the morning session at a hotel in barra, and i need another strong espresso, with plenty of sugar. badly designed slide decks wash over the audience. everyone is itching to take a break.  i travelled twelve thousand miles to join this boring, inconsequential conference, where middle-aged businessmen promote marginally-useful products to a tiny smattering of potential customers. it is a bitter struggle for corporate survival, and the desperation of their efforts is embodied in the cheapness of the display stands.   from the rooftop café of the hotel i see the beach and rocky near-shore islands, the vivid colours popping like a postcard memory. i take a series of snapshots with the smartphone. one day, over lunch, those images will allow me to prove to someone that i have lived this moment, in this place, and perhaps they will envy me.   the device buzzes fiercely with exciting rumours of a takeover deal that will shock the industry, at least for an hour. my thumbs forward the news to my network; being first to know has its own currency.  a film crew makes an episode of a popular telenovela in the lobby, actresses flouncing through the doors wearing dresses designed for television, with waterfall necklines and little room for imagination. from the shade of the portico i research the names and peccadillos of the leading players.  the sun and warmth are pleasing and i wander past the production vehicles, across the carriageway, to the caged natural wilderness of the seashore. a bleached beachfront shack sells me a soda pop and frites.   i ponder the short distance to the honeyed sand. i can touch it with my shoe. the ocean surges, glitter-bright, pounding the shore with south atlantic surf. a cautious rat runs between the sticks of the fence.  my smartband vibrates and i look back at the hotel. i am on the cusp of a decision, but realize i have no time to enjoy my life just yet, at least not today.  **djibouti: no connection**  vast sheds at the harbour are stuffed with grain sacks, each stenciled with the message ""with love from the people of the united states of america"". rats weave between the sacks, stopping abruptly to sniff the air suspiciously, like thieves looking over their shoulders.  the grain train to eritrea leaves once per week, restricted by border controls and the war. it pulls just fifteen forlorn cars, half of them stuffed with travelers and their gingham-patterned holdalls. grain seeps from the doors of the transport wagons.  the anti-malarial drugs produce slightly psychedelic vision effects, adding an illusionary edge of false colour to the small boats in the filthy port.  in the town i overhear foreign legionnaires at a cafe, an odd mix of british accents and french vocabulary, two empires combined in a slowly rotting colonial footnote.   a barber trims my hair with a cut-throat razor while a fan buzzes overhead and local customers spectate. i wonder, fearfully, if he sterilizes the blade between hiv-infected customers.   at the hotel, the internet link is down. i read an e-book by the sparkling pool, while a friendly, sweating waiter brings me a club sandwich. it is the best i have ever tasted, juicy and crisp.   ambouli is little more than a large hanger. on the wildly undulating tarmac a gloriously white 747 gleams incongruously in the working lights, a technological diamond surrounded by dense african night.  the delayed departure is announced over a crackly world war ii tannoy and we walk across the apron to the foot of the twentieth-century jetliner.   i walk slowly up the steps to my cocoon, and prepare for metamorphosis once again.",0,

876639,"he looked back at me with the same astonishment and fear as myself. a face in the same shape and with the same features as my own, yet with a dull green, scaly skin. he spoke first.   ""you look just like me, only you're a... *mammal?!*""   his voice sounded like mine as well, albeit with a slight dry hiss.   ""yeah, seeing a reptilian version of myself is kind of hard to take in for me, too. what is this, where am i?""   ""i don't know, i was going to ask you the same thing."" we were sitting in a cubicle on beds positioned at either side. everything was white, shiny, and sterile. i was wearing only a white mesh shirt and shorts, as was my cold-blooded counterpart. his hazel slotted eyes again met my hazel human ones after we both became aware of our complete lack of personal effects, save for what appeared to be a hospital bracelet on our left wrists. we caught each other examining them and probably also simultaneously noticing the complete unison in our mannerisms. i read mine aloud from my peripheral vision.   ""m3-aa169924-c34.023-b12a.""   ""r1-af189221-d11.954-x22d,"" he replied. ""whatever that means.""   we both stood, but then stopped, awaiting the other's next move. ""i just want to see what's outside this room,"" i finally said.   ""me too."" we both poked our heads out the door to be welcomed by an even stranger sight. a long hallway with many more people poking their heads out of identical doorways and some even slowly venturing out. many more guys that looked basically like me. and even women. one guy had fangs. another had tattoos and piercings. yet another had a metal arm. the sheer shock had me frozen until i was grabbed and spun around by another more muscular me.   ""do you have any idea what's going on here?""   ""none.""   ""me either,"" chimed the reptile.   ""it appears alternate reality versions of ourselves are being collected,"" said another paler, skinnier me with glasses standing nearby. ""it's amazing. i've always pondered my slice of the fifth dimension within the sixth. i wonder how this is possible and who is responsible?""   muscular me looked confused, which quickly turned into an annoyed scoff. ""whatever, i'm more interested in finding my way out of here and calling my wife.""   the reptile, nerd, and myself, along with a few other nearby mes within earshot all nodded in chorus.   ""yeah, this is too weird,"" stammered a female me. ""i want to see my husband and son."" i couldn't take my eyes off the female me. she didn't just look like me in drag. she was actually kind of *hot*. wait, what am i thinking? and what about *my* wife and son?   the heavily-tattooed me must have known exactly what i was thinking while i was apparently staring at the closest female me, being that he leaned over with a creepy ""so would i.""   the hallway, although originally pretty spacious, was getting somewhat crowded and noisy with all the alternate mes chattering away at each other, although many themes prevailed. mostly ""i want to get out of here"" and ""i need to call [insert loved one's name here]"".   after about an hour of building chaos as some mes starting having complete emotional breakdowns and others started getting paranoid and combative, the entire airline hangar-like structure in which our hundreds of cubicles resided in went dim. a large screen across the far wall illuminated a deep blue. my favorite color.   ""welcome..."" there was a wave of surprised exhales.   the voice was mine. as the picture faded in, the face admiring all the thousand of me was mine, too. ""to youtopia.""   this elicited many groans, as the pun became even worse with the word being spelled out across the screen.   ""i have handpicked you all from across the infinite realities to join yourself in your own world just for you. every version of *you*. this is your new, perfect home.""   i, along with most of the other audience of me said something to effect of ""okay, now i'm freaking out.""   ""malkovich malkovich,"" jeered tattoo.   the reference would have been amusing if the fact that i may never see my family again began to stab at my heart. the screen split down the middle as the wall slowly slid apart and the world outside the hangar shined in and revealed itself. the sound of the mes becoming overwhelmed with anxiety was absolutely deafening, although i remained curious more than anything. the cityscape was breathtaking, as was the countryside to its right and beautiful beaches to the left. a dazzling new world indeed... but it wasn't mine. this isn't my beautiful house. this isn't my beautiful wife.   my god. what have i done?!",0,

778077,"warm yellow and vibrant pink are painted across the sky, the red sun dips slowly beneath the horizon on this warm summer night. 'what a beautiful start to a bank holiday weekend' pc anjem mustafa thought to himself as he reset the chain on his standard issue police bicycle. 24 gears of fury on which anjem tore up the streets of london.   of course pc mustafa was green, a rookie with two months on the job, he didn't know the horror that the streets of london brought forth on a friday night. his partner for tonight, pc linda greville, was a little less cheerful. 13 years on these streets and she'd learnt to despise times of common cheer and celebration. 'if i had a penis, i'd be a bloody detective by now', she thought begrudgingly.  camden high street was already bustling. people of all ages, dressed in all manner of crazy attire, dashed recklessly across the road, shouted raucously at no-one, and stumbled into one another with no reprisal. until someone in a bad mood takes a reckless, raucous stumble the wrong way. one slip, and it all could kick off. and there's nothing more infuriating to police than hocus pocus kicking off.  bang. a bright green light shone from the crowd amidst a mix of screaming and laughing.   pc mustafa dropped a gear, cut across the road and dashed toward it, his heart racing. pc greville calmly stopped her bike at a streetlight and locked it promptly. her hands retrieved an old brass pocket watch from her breast pocket as she paced toward her partner and the drunken crowd he was pushing through. tonight would not be another defeat at the hands of some anarchic witch or wizard.  ""what's going on here!"" anjem shouted into the middle of the crowd. a small opening had formed between a leather-clad woman and a befuddled young man. the confused man, his armani shirt ripped and wet from the puddle he was lying in, tried to speak, but nothing but gibberish burbled out of his mouth. the woman facing him let out a short cackle, her black eyes seem to shine in the moonlight. ""mr posh-boy here doesn't like a little bit of freak on his friday night"". pc mustafa turned towards her, chest puffed and brow furrowed. ""did you do this?"" the posh-boy's well-dressed friends all nodded anxiously, the little witch smiled. anjem put on his best arrest voice. ""mam, i'm gonna have to ask you to come with me"". the corners of her mouth raised further flirtatiously as she raised her hand, a golden ring with a green gem began to shine. pc greville pressed the button on the side of the pocket watch.  a green bolt meandered out of the witch's ring. slowly it moved towards anjem's dumbstruck face, reflecting of his widening eyes. the second hand on the pocket watch slowed to a fraction of the speed it was at before, at least for everything going on in a 10 foot radius or so. pc greville, pulled anjem's clueless head out of the way of the menacing green bolt, then removed the ring from the witch's pale bony fingers. the skin on the witch's hand seem to wrinkle slowly as the ring came off. pc greville packed the ring in an evidence bag, and took in one last long breath. this was the most peaceful the night would get. she pressed the button on the side of the watch.  anjem - having been jerked sideways - tripped and let out a small yelp before smacking his face on the wet cobblestone floor. a general gasp eminated from the crowd surrounding them as pc greville appeared next to him with the green and gold ring in a plastic bag. the witch, young and beautiful in skin-tight leather, like a gothic seductress, aged a century in a moment. her shiny black hair turned to grey and white wire, her freckled scalp peaking through in the street light. her pale. flawless skin shrivelled into countless wrinkles. her nose grew an inch. her once lustrous lips drained their youth and rotted in old age. the ring had sustained her, without it she was a scantily clad old woman practically suffocating in a black leather corset.  ""this ring has been confiscated as contraband in compliance with the misuse of magic act 2012, you may be eligible to collect it from finchley police station in two weeks following a preliminary investigation, though you will have to attend a confidential magic assessment session with a certified witch or wizard. in order to let you collect your item, we need your name and most recent address.""",0,

680406,"i remember the spring of 2015.  i remember everything about that day on 7th april when my life changed. when i met you.  bzzzzzzz.  i woke up to angry buzzing at 9:15 am.  with a groan i rolled over and hit my alarm.  seven months of groundhog day.  if the alarm didn't go i'd spend all day festering in bed.  i had no reason to get up.  except that day i did have a reason to wake up and leave the house.  i had another job interview.  the first one for weeks.  i remember thinking this time it would be different.  i rubbed my eyes and clambered out of bed.  i hoped it wouldn't be like the previous one.  receptionist at a second-hand car garage.  that guy who interviewed me, what was his name?  colin?  clive? he was a total sleaze. putting his hand on my knee and leaning forwards to tell me that sometimes there was a requirement to work late.  jesus.  i remember the smell of coffee in his breath as he licked his lips, and the stench of stale sweat and desperation that clung to his yellowing shirt.    i stumbled through the living room and past the empty bottle of wine i polished off the night before.  shit, i didn't even get employed stacking shelves in tesco.  i'm only 5 foot 2 and so i can't reach the top shelf. how humiliating.  i pulled the light chord in the bathroom and examined my reflection.  bags under my eyes, hair all over the place, white film on my tongue.  i took a shower, washed my hair, brushed my teeth, shaved my legs.  i needed to make myself look presentable.  i really, really needed this job.  i grabbed the smartest clean clothes i could find.  a black pencil skirt and a pale blue blouse.  it needed an iron but it would do.  my shoes looked a mess.  they were all scuffed. i grabbed a black sharpie and did my best to colour over the worst bits and left the house.   as i headed to the bus station i wasn't sure what to expect. i didn't really understand the description shirley at the job centre gave me.  to be fair i was quite far into my first bottle of wine when she called so all i could remember is that they were called soltech and liked my cv.  they needed someone who was a team player, someone with discretion and who was willing to travel.  well, that description fit me fine.  i had no reason to stay in this shitty town.  even the goldfish got so depressed living with me he killed himself.  seriously.  little asshole jumped out of the bowl. nothing keeping me here.  i checked the address i'd scrawled on a piece of paper as i got off the bus at a deserted old launderette.  i didn't think this could be the right place. there was the red door next to the launderette i would come to know so well.  i checked the little card next to the buzzer.  soltech.  bzzzzzzz.  the door opened and there you were.  you were about 60 years old back then but dressed immaculately in a tailored navy blue suit.  you smiled at me with such warmth i immediately felt relaxed.  with your crinkly brown eyes and silver hair you looked quite dashing, like one of those old matinee idols.  you invited me in and i followed you up the stairs into a large conference room.  it was completely different up here to what it seemed on the outside.  there was a speaker phone in the centre of a huge antique wooden table, and 3 of the walls were covered in wooden panelling.  the third wall was home to a huge 50 inch plasma screen.  in the centre of the table were the blueprints to the tower of london.  you poured some coffee and spent the next 3 hours explaining the plan to me.  the plan that would net you the ultimate prize of every burglar since the dark ages.  the crown jewels.  you had it all planned out, you said. you could get someone into the vault.  but there was one final piece of security you hadn't figured out. one final obstacle that would set off the biggest alarm system in western europe, alerting every member of the metropolitan police and the british armed forces.  the touch sensitive floor.",0,
126245,"&gt;you people   it makes me really sad that you look at me like this.  who are you talking to?  i am a liberal democrat and an attorney, i worked for the center for justice in law school and for a black civil rights attorney doing bankruptcies for predominately black clients when i graduated.  you don't care about any of that, though, because what does some white girl know about it, right?  do you see how that's hypocritical as well as insulting?  and you didn't heed the first sentence in the slightest, but i should have seen that coming.    the point is, because of my race and my presumed socio-economic background, you already know what you want to know about me and you don't care to know anything else or hear anything i have to say.  i think that's fucking sad.  moving on...  &gt;&gt;follow-up: at what point is it eliminated and how long do you realistically believe it would take to go from uninhibited totally legal slavery --&gt; jim crow --&gt; civil rights movement --&gt; post-modern civil rights studies --&gt; fixed?  &gt;when people that are white, or desperately desire to be, no longer fill subs like /r/greatapes by the hundreds to talk about people that look like me, then and only then can you even begin to have the faintest twinkle in your eye indicating that you ought to even think about asking me that question.  while i understand your ire, and agree with your end goal, i think your terms are incredibly unfuckingrealistic.  so we can't even think about how long we as homo sapiens could realistically manage to evolve culturally to eradicate racism because we're not done fixing the problem yet?  that's stupid and you know it.  you know it because you're obviously educated, but because you're angry, you're refusing to see the problem/solution rationally.  that's what makes you just like all those people in /r/greatapes and /r/coontown.  that and presuming to know who i am or how my mind works because of my skin.    &gt;the fact that you're painting a picture where i should reset my expectations such that i should have no expectation of being considered equally as a human being in the country that i was born in at any time during my natural lifespan is bullshit.  that's basically the opposite of where i was going with that.  let's use an analogy, because i obviously wasn't clear the first time: if you have a cancerous tumor on your colon, and it's the size of a grapefruit, you're in a serious fix - if after months of treatment, painful, expensive treatment that you would lose your shit about if anybody suggested it was nothing to sneeze at, you finally got that thing down to a golf ball, it would still be a big problem, but ignoring the difference between the grapefruit and the golf ball, all the pain of the treatment [slow progress] and how much better your chances are at the life you want is a sad fucking waste.    it's also counter-productive, because you might think all that work was for nothing, so why bother going on?  if you tell every white person you meet that they are as good as those dead crackers from 1865, what fucking motivation is that to even bother trying?  if racism is always going to be here, or it's gotta go overnight, most people would bet on always going to be here.  i was trying to say that acknowledging progress is acknowledging the hard-won rights your predecessors *died for* and acknowledging that we can do even better.  the racism we have to correct now is more subtle and harder to weed it out.  your hacksaw approach is not especially helpful, as it leaves the roots to spoil the next crop, so to speak.  &gt;acknowledge that their being assholes right now, today.. that you're being assholes right now, today. that your subconscious beliefs and your conscious defending of bullshit beliefs is responsible for human suffering right now, today. that i won't get the same opportunities right now, today, because of the bullshit in your head, not mine.  here's what's wrong: you think someone saying ""it's time to stop making excuses"" is racist, and a few other people think it's not.  i agree that it could be racist, but i also think that it's not just slavery in the southern us that led to the bias of whites against non-whites worldwide.  i think that the us has a special problem because we fought a civil war over it, and no other country did.  but i think there are a lot of concepts and cultural nuances that have influenced that bias back and forth, more or less.    don't get me wrong, i know that people of color in the us are fucked over by national systems of justice, economy, society and so forth.  but i don't really think all of that is because of slavery.  honestly, i think it would have happened for many other reasons because literally everybody on the planet is more comfortable with and more inclined to do business with people who are like them.  edit: people are also predominately self-absorbed assholes who will abuse other people if they can get away with it or profit from it - important trait to note.  more to the point, it would be dandy as fuck if we could just hash this out in a calm discussion, without you slapping people around with vitriolic bullshit.  that's been my point the whole time.  that, and that it's time to start working *forward* not ignoring the issue, nor the progress we've made.  that's why i brought up using the south as a scapegoat.  we know racism exists around here because we are reminded constantly that we are inherently racist since we've got the southern+white double whammy, but people who live in northern states can tell themselves that didn't happen here, we aren't like that, i only say the n word in private, blah blah blah.  we live in a post-civil rights society, which is not post-racism in the slightest.    you mentioned otis byrd, and believe me when i say that shit makes me ill.  i was ill when some dumbass from arkansas came to ole miss and put a noose on a statue, so the thought of someone lynching a black man is atrocious.  that said, i found a young man hanging from a noose under my staircase in junior year of college, but he had just killed himself.  the difference is, he was white, so it wasn't even a question.  that's how i know racism is still a major problem.  byrd could have just killed himself, and i'm ashamed to say i hope that's what it was, but the fact that it's even possibly a hate-crime is revolting.  so tell me again what you know is in my head, and better yet, reflect on the shit rolling around in yours.  i think the real point that was the start of all of this is that **it's what is in both our heads** that makes the difference.  you think i don't get shit for being a woman?  that civil rights attorney i mentioned before admitted when he hired me that because i used my initials instead of my name, he expected a man.  he also asked me questions about whether i planned on starting a family - which is a huge violation wrt to equal rights in employment - but i needed the job, so i told him nope.    and one more thing: i acknowledge the progress we've made because i live in a state where you can still see the outline of the ""coloreds"" sign that used to hang above the basement-level restroom in the capitol's county court.  i know what the freedom riders did, how some were brutally murdered, and how much freer we all are for what they suffered.  i *appreciate* it.  and i am emboldened to do something to perpetuate their cause; i just know i don't have nearly as far to leap as they did.  they did a lot of the hard work, and we just need to keep it going.    what we need to do is actually plan how to fix it.  blind interviews aren't going to work, because like you said, it's a band-aid, not a cure.  the **cure** comes in changing minds.  and *you* don't get *that*.    if i don't respond to your next post (if you deign to read mine at all; it's pretty long after all) for several hours, it's because i'm asleep.  i'll check up on this in the morning.  please take some time to ruminate because i really would like to have a productive discussion.",1,

137699,"i personally have pretty good luck with niggers.  my 'specific' reality as far as niggers go is pretty cushy.  i see a few, the most trouble i get from any of them is a slight sassiness from sheboons, always in jest.  nigs don't chimp out on me. and the ones i'm around, or even have worked with have been decent enough. not super sharp, but they worked a job. lately even the nigs at the fast food joints have been pretty good. nothing like the nineties when you'd get all kinds of fucking attitude.  but....  you knew a but was coming.  the intelligent coontowners know that black culture, which is shit culture is way too strong for blacks to ultimately avoid.  if the parents avoid it great. good for all of us.  but their kids are likely not going to. being a nigger is the default for niggers. and no amount of gibs or white friendships really changes anything.   i mean look at this incident in texas. you have a pretty well-to-do neighborhood. then niggers show up, and you get a chimpout.  even police show up and what is unimaginable for whites, nigs completely out of order chimp out on the cops.    you can't really have more than 2 black youths together without a very likely occurance of tnb. and once tnb starts, it's kind of like nature taking over.  for example, some black boys / men can and do pretend well. they come across as suave, respectful.  but soon after, they get some dumb white bitch as a girlfriend or wife and then she ends up stabbed and set on fire in a dumpster.  again as cushy as my experiences are, i'm lucky, i know this and i do not relax around blacks.  just in the news recently, some applebees manager, probably has a few decent black employees. goes out back of his restaurant to empty a bin and gets murdered by a nigger in cold blood.  do not trust niggers.  as soon as you start thinking blacks might be ok, just read up on the conditions of east africa, liberia, etc.  they are fucked up and it's not because of lack of opportunity or resources.    fuck do you know how good it could be to be a nigger in white society?  if they were actually human i mean.  here's the thing. whites are so forgiving and empathetic and helpful. and on top of that, we earn money.  if niggers would just act fucking normal, reliable, show up, do actual work they could make a fuck ton of money of white people doing jobs. one time i paid these little niggers to rake my leaves. they did the shittiest job ever.  like you can't even think they remotely have the intelligence of a human being.  they knock on the door.  ""we're done""  and it's a fucking mess. they use 4 bags and didn't even fucking push down the leaves.  i'm thinking. what in the actual fuck.  they have no concept of cleanliness, physics, hygiene.  niggers / black people cannot create proper societies where they cooperate and accomplish things for the future.  they can't and don't.  if they could have, they would have by now.  do you know how much humanitarian aid they get. they get all kinds of exposure to new technology.  but once the humans leave on a plant back home, the niggers already forget how to shit in the toilet that whitey brought them.   niggers rarely if ever look at the future. they are fucking lazy and do the absolute minimum. instead of solving problems, there is all the evidence in the world, they would rather wallow in their own shit then make their neighborhood, much less their city or country better.  if they aren't blaming whitey, they are blaming some superstitious ooga booga they conjured up last week. they can't govern and they can't be governed, at least not in the way that humans can be. you know they can be corralled and influenced but not brought together like a working society.   racism will save your life. ask yourself. would you really trust a nigger with your life or god forbid your childrens lives?  i might joke with nigs, i might get along with them casually but i can't see depending on a nigger for anything important.  are their exceptions? sure but there are also apes that can play guitar. who gives a fuck about that.  ask yourself. have you ever lived next to a nigger and have you ever seen them take care of their lawn and home?  i can tell you that if you see that happen, buy a lottery ticket because that's how fucking rare that is. and that's just common decency we take for granted among whites, the minimum of living in a suburban community.  we give niggers way too much credit when they do the things that white people take for granted. ""oh you're a black father and you stayed with your family  how awesome!!!!!""  you know how many white fathers are at their kids baseball games every fucking day of the summer.  on top of that, there are the white fathers that take care of their own kids and they adopt a couple unwanted chimps and take care of them too. that's how much better white fathers are and white people are.  we take care because we do care.   seriously man, fuck niggers. and i say that knowing that the niggers i encounter tomorrow will be just fine as far as human / nigger interaction goes.  understand they aren't human you'll be safer and you'll understand their behavior better.  and any good experience around niggers you have you'll be even more thankful for because of how unusual it is in the world.",1,1
589969,"the wind was up and boromir's spirits were cast down. he wore his customary clothes: the leather jerkin that the rest of his men carried; his brown travelling cloak, mottled with patches of green in order to better hide him in the forests of the south. the rest of his raiment was grey, worn stuff that had been mended and re-mended on numerous occasions. at his hip he carried his sword and within easy reach, though hidden beneath his cloak - for fear that the sight of it alone would be a herald of his identity to his enemies - sat the horn of gondor, resplendent white and fitted with leather straps to cling snugly to his back. he had set out in the grey morning astride his horse, carrying only enough provisions for a day and a half. he intended it to be only a short scouting mission, down to the fords and round to the eastern road. only half a day after his departure from minas tirith, however, heading south into the wilderness alone it had begun to rain.    it was with such force that the icy deluge rained down that before long boromir was soaked to the skin, his horse miserable beneath him. turning back now to the shelter of the city and the disapproval of his father was not an option that he cared to entertain and so it was with a heavy heart that he continued. the landscape changed around him, becoming less familiar and more cold. the fertility of the plains of rohan and the shelter of gondorian soil were long lost and the soil here yielded little save rocks.    at midday, he dismounted. the rain still came down and boromir began to wonder to himself if it were brought upon him by some unnatural force. the power of sauron knew no bounds and once more boromir considered the wisdom of travelling west to rivendell, where they said elrond half-elven who sat as lord there, would still answer questions. the sky, clouded and brooding at his departure, had become heavy and black. storm clouds seemed to weigh it down towards him, as though he were the only figure on this desolate landscape surrounded by the high peaks of the mountains.     then thunderclapped. it was far, on the other side of the plain but his horse still spooked. it raised up on its hindquarters and boromir dodged, afraid of being caught by its hooves. he escaped injury, but the horse fled, carrying with it the supplies and bedroll that boromir had carefully packed in his saddlebags. he considered turning after it, but there was rumoured to be a village near here, where the local people had at first struggled and later fought to survive in the loneliness between minas tirith and minas morghul.    he took at first one step, and then another. the rain had begun to come in thick sheets, the drops themselves as tiny arrows that sought to pierce first his cloak and later his skin. the cuts came, unbidden, to his hands and face. no material offered him protection from the onslaught. he placed them before his face as though in plea, before raising his sword and slashing at the dark tide of water which fell. it cut and the wind seemed to rise in a howl.    ""show yourself, enemies of minas tirith!"" boromir called to the empty air. ""show yourselves, servants of sauron!""    no sooner had he said these words before his foot seemed to step into empty air. he plummeted downwards, catching himself on something which stood, ready.    ""by the old gods,"" he heard, falling into a snow drift. ""you're supposed to be dead.""    boromir propped himself up on one arm, ignoring the sharp cuts that were currently being iced by the snow he had landed on and looked up at the one who had caught him. he was a young man, a little shorter than boromir himself. he wore all black, which fit nicely with his black hair. he had a jaw shape that reminded boromir a little of faramir, or of himself when he was younger. the young man held his hand out, black gloved also, helping him to his feet.    boromir dusted himself off, finding that the clothes that had suited for the weather of ithilien were no good against the cold of the snow here.    ""this is an unusual snowdrift,"" he said, much to the confusion of the young man. ""it looks very much like winter is coming.""    -----------------   edit: the boy's name was eventually revealed to be jon. he sat opposite boromir as he dried himself off and was given dry clothes. he would have described them as warm, but it seemed nothing in this icy castle ever got warm.  they sat in a mess with low ceilings, long tables stretching away from them in the darkness for men to sit at. there were a few there, all looking like black crows in their raiment and long cloaks. more than one had fur stitched around his cloak and kept his gloves on even while he ate. more than one gave him suspicious looks as he sat, their faces twisted in confusion and more often fear.    ""i had word of your death,"" the man said. in this light he truly did resemble boromir himself as a young man. ""they sent up a raven from king's landing. joffrey now sits the iron throne.""    ""these people of which you speak, i have never heard of them. should their names mean something to me?"" boromir said. he had been provided with a small bowl of carrot soup; meagre fare but enough to fill his stomach.    the man's - jon's face - screwed up in confusion. ""sir,"" he began. ""if this is some cruel jest you play on me, i beg you to end it now.""    ""who are you to call me sir? your kindness has been great, but if you should lend me a horse and a moment to examine the maps of this area, i would be gone as soon as i can muster the supplies.""    ""but go where?"" jon asked. ""half of westeros-""   ""where?""    ""have you hurt yourself and addled your memory? you have fallen quite far. i almost expected you to have toppled off the edge of the wall.""    ""i cannot be any further than two days from minas tirith,"" boromir said with a heavy finality. ""if you would be so kind as to lend me a horse.""    ""sir, minas tirith is not on any map we have. though we can ask sam, if it pleases you."" the boy turned round and signalled to a figure on the far side of the wall. it emerged from the shadows; a rotund lad with a nervous demeanour and a weak disposition.    ""sam, lord stark wishes to return to minas tirith. does such a place exist?""     the fat boy shook his head. ""not in my knowledge, jon.""     ""so you see-"" the boy continued.    ""who is lord stark? why are you calling me by his name?"" boromir stood and slapped his hand upon the table with such force that the fat boy trembled and half the room looked at the pair.     ""i'll take you to lord mormont, he'll know what to do,"" jon said. ""though i don't know what he's going to do with you, seeing as you've lost your memory.""     ""boy, i have not lost my memory,"" boromir spoke darkly. ""i am boromir, son of denethor who is steward of gondor. now are you going to get me a horse?""     there was silence for a few moments, before the fat boy spoke again.    ""probably master aemon would be better, jon."" he said. jon seemed to agree.    the maester was a shrivelled husk of a man, blind and bald. his chambers were dark, yet cosy in a part of the castle that jon referred to as the king’s tower. he shuffled over to boromir and took the man’s face in his soft hands, murmuring to himself. jon stood by the door, impatiently tapping his foot. boromir had not quite understood where the fat boy was going, but apparently he was keeping a bear away from jon. the maester stepped away from boromir and glanced towards the corner of the room where jon waited.    “you are telling me that he fell from the sky?” he said slowly. every word he spoke seemed as though it were pronounced carefully, with the full weight of this man’s knowledge behind it.    “i thought it was off the wall,” jon said. the way he said wall made it clear it was capitalised. “but he wouldn’t have survived seven hundred feet, so i’m not sure where he came from.”    “most interesting. and you claim he is your father?”    boromir turned suddenly to jon, who only nodded.    “you did not mention this lord stark was your father. so you are jon stark?” he asked   the boy glowered. “no,” he said. “i’m lord stark’s bastard. my name is snow.”    “jon snow. a strong name.”    the boy only scoffed.  “most interesting,” maester aemon said again, and this time it seemed as though a light gleamed in his blind eyes. “he appears to be lord stark, but lord stark’s head currently resides in the red keep upon a spike. he has none of the man’s memories, does not recognise his son and firmly maintains that he must return to a place that exists not in my memory, nor upon any map.”    “i am boromir of gondor,” boromir said simply.    jon pounded his fist upon the door. “you could stop this,” he said angrily. “robb’s back at winterfell, wearing a crown and calling himself the king in the north. no one knows where arya is, sansa’s a virtual prisoner in the red keep and the country’s going to shit. you could stop it!”    “could lord stark restore peace and order to your home?” boromir asked. “you believe this of your father?”    “his face alone would have queen cersei in fits! she’d believe herself mad… you could unseat joffrey just by walking into king’s landing and declaring yourself lord stark. father - sir, please.” jon had become energetic, his pale face lit by some fervour of belief.    “i will play the part of lord stark if you find me a way home,” boromir promised slowly. “you must tell me everything you know about the man, in order for me to play him convincingly. we will strike a bargain, you and i.”     “you’ll ride for winterfell at once,” jon said. “robb. or the lady catelyn… she will be overjoyed to see you.”    “you must remind her i am not her husband,” boromir said slowly. “and i suppose you will have to start by telling me my assumed first name.”    “why, you’re lord eddard stark. welcome home to westeros.”",0,
599422,"i just read a piece yesterday (sorry, didn't save it) by a rabbi who said that the fuss was ridiculous and completely unnecessary - judaic law doesn't forbid sitting next to someone.  as the rabbi put it, if sitting next to a woman tempts you, you should be praying, not complaining.    edited to add: airlines today won't even let you backtalk the flight attendants without putting you off the plane - why is delta letting them get away with this?  it's only an attention-getting ploy.  if they really wanted special seating arrangements they could have asked for that in advance.  toads.  i guess it's not enough to be religious - you have to be *seen* to be a religious asshole.",0,

756099,"with an out-stretched right hand comprised of four human-like fingers and an appropriately familiar opposable thumb, the hand offered a greeting which had not been extended to him in more than a year.  a year.  365 days.  alone.  all alone on earth.  the hand, the arm, the whole creature was a glossy, milky, swirling mist of infinite tiny blue pinpoints of light. all of this moving within an endless pool of white glitter nail polish or thick, shiny, opalescent, liquid dish soap and trillions of tiny bluish stars.  some of the lights darted quickly; so quickly it was impossible to track them.  other clouds of creamy bright blue pinpoints looked like galaxies churning.  others dimmed and brightened rhythmically or pulsed together as they shifted, darted, collided and broke apart again.  this hand, this creature.  the beauty was mesmerizing.  ""i have been waiting for you, mr. tan,"" the words were as melodic as the deep spiral of liquid and lights moving within the being's chest.  the human reached out.  the hand felt like room-temperature play-doh.  ""i have been waiting for you, mr. tan,"" the words came more rigid than before.  the play-doh's grip tightened.  it became firm.  almost too firm; like a bad salesman trying to relate to masculine men.  as jo began to realize the implications of the knock at the door, the handshake became unbreakable.    what had he expected to find behind the knocking?  no one had walked to the door.  he had been sitting in his living room looking out the front window eating, sleeping and reading.  he had begun reading the books he'd purchased and stuck on his shelf with the intention of 'getting to' when he found the time.  he was staring right across the front yard in the middle of the afternoon and no one had walked up to his front porch.  the knock scared him more than the last day had.  the last day was instantaneous and bizarre, but the knocking had shaken him to the core.  no one answered when he called out.  no one had walked to the door.  the sound was not a bird or a raccoon or a shutter blowing in the wind.  the knocking had been unique, erratic, clumsy.  the knocks were human.  tap tap tap.   frozen with fear and unwittingly holding his breath, jo’s mouth was full of cold canned spaghetti-o’s.  tap tap.  “who’s there?!,” he’d sputtered.  nothing.  marg complained for 25 years about not having windows near the porch and he refused to drill a hole at eye-level in the 350-year-old spanish door he inherited from a former and favorite professor.  every time marg was forced to open the front door herself, she muttered quietly, “well, i hope it’s not ted bundy,” and swung open the giant wooden slab.  mr. tan now understood the powerlessness of not being able to see who was knocking on his front door.  without electricity, the security cameras – along with just about everything else on the local power grid – had died more than six weeks ago.  he thought about going outside and circling around the horseshoe-shaped driveway.  even if there had been someone else on earth to survive the last day with the same stupid stroke of luck he had experienced, even then, how did that person find him?  jo didn’t own hamm radios or messenger pigeons.  he wasn't broadcasting any messages into the ether nor had he been listening for any.  by the time the knocking came, he was positive he would live out the rest of his days as the last of his species.  the irony wasn’t lost on the educator, researcher, activist and author of more than three dozen articles and papers regarding habitat destruction and the loss of species.  had there been anyone left on earth, surely they were nowhere near south texas.  for more than a month, jo sat at the steps of the state capitol with huge speakers and the 61 spotlights he had towed from car dealerships up and down ih-35.  from austin to san antonio, he had swiped every sky-searching spotlight he could find.  for the first month, jo got drunk, sat in a lawn chair, grilled steaks, pointed his spotlights toward the heavens and turned up the music as loud as 2,324 stereo speakers could go.  after coming to terms with the reality of how uncomfortable his future was going to become as compared to his past, he decided to use as much electricity as he could before that too evaporated.  he would spend one month turning downtown austin into a screeching concert of american rock music and strobe lights moving across the clouds.  if this didn’t attract any other survivors, he wasn’t going to wait around.  he drank and mourned and lit up the texas sky for just over a month before he began in earnest to ensure his continued survival.  forever was a long time.  he never considered having to hunt for food as an old man.  jo figured he’d just eat three meals a day at the diner near the university if marg died before him.  he never planned on being the last human on earth.  even as a child, jo’s imagination about being on a desert isle never really took into account how difficult it is to flood an 180,000-square-foot frozen warehouse with garden hoses.  if he wanted a huge freezer to keep food preserved for as long as possible in the hot texas weather, he would need to make as much ice as possible before the power grids began to fail.  gas and gas generators would take him a long way after this.  texas was big and without competition for resources, jo didn’t have to hoard or stockpile.  if he needed a band-aid or box of kleenex, he still drove to the walmart.  he figured one walmart could likely last him a lifetime, but thankfully this was texas.  as long as jo had gas to move a vehicle and a vehicle that would move, there were five walmart stores nearby and four more that he could hike to and from in a day.  jo had seen the news articles his sister millie forwarded him daily.  there was once one about an old restaurateur up north who successfully rooted the mcdonald’s out of town and when he did, he bought the store’s final bigmac.  he put it on a plate under a large glass lid and displayed in his own eatery.  the burger never rotted.  it just sits there; all alone, unrotted, somewhere up north under a glass lid in a diner.  this told jo that even if every canned product sitting on every shelf in every store in every city went bad in a decade or two, there will always be something to eat somewhere.  maybe what they say about twinkies is true.  what they say about roaches would be true in a matter of years.    the firm, clay-like hand swirling with glowing milk and blue lights enveloping his own hand began to move up and down in a slow, mechanical fashion.  this handshake brought him back from the feelings of fear, worry, doubt and eventual loneliness that had come to replace the joy, laughter and happiness he had known all his life.  living and working around the university of texas had been the foundation upon which jo tan’s life was built.  his father and mother were both tenured professors and each of them had followed in their fathers' footsteps.  academia, ut and austin in particular had provided the tans with endless invitations to social functions.  on the last day, the missing humans were barely evident.  the sound of cars, trucks, trains, cranes, backhoes, boats, airplanes, and all manner of other machinery echoed across the planet as they crashed and burned out of control.  when the humans disappeared, the equipment they were operating didn’t cease to carry forward.  jo would find centrifuges spinning on campus months later; music played in dorm rooms and apartments around the city.  those kids listening to local radio stations on that day would become the bane of jo's existence for a time.  he would find dvd menus looping endlessly everywhere he went.  the last day did not feel like the last day.  it took about a week for the fires to burn out and the silence of missing construction workers and truckers out on the highway to set in.  it would take five more months before the sounds of the former human presence would disappear completely.  it took the local wildlife less than a week to adjust to the absence.     ""i have been waiting for you, mr. tan,"" the words now sounded as automated as the feeling of his hand being pumped up and down by this being.  the creature was as tall as the man and built with a slightly discernible physique.  in the place of musculature and organs and features, there existed simply clumps of blue light which gave the impression of recognizable human anatomy.  the head was the same size and shape as any other man’s with slight cheekbones and a high forehead, but instead of eyes, ears, or a mouth, there was only a denser cluster of undulating illumination.  the skin of this creature now appeared more like a sac or mold or casing into which this sentient, glowing, milky liquid had been poured and bottled.  the impressions of clay and play-doh faded.  it became clear.  the firmness and pressure of this visitor’s handshake was not caused by a gripping motion with the hand, but the movement and selective pressurization of the goo acting inside of the transparent human-shaped skin suit standing before him. 	“you know who i am?,” jo asked.

109379,"&gt;what, that people are confusing adaptations with remakes?      i really don't understand why you have a problem with sequels, but adapting a previous work comes off as original. like somehow originality equals equality (it doesn't)       &gt;if they gave a shit about real criticism, wouldn't they rank films before the 2000's?      most critics that actually give a shit about criticism aren't really interested in looking at the cadillac man's or bird on a wire's of cinema. i'm not fully discrediting rt, but the problem is that there's more blogspam filler on that site than metacritic.    &gt;it also ranked tomorrowland better than kingsman, which makes me also question it.      as disappointing as tomorrowland is, i'd rather watch something that has some sort of wonder in it rather than mark millar-spired edgy garbage.      &gt;still waiting on some..      well it depends on what you mean. now? the year before? because there's the movies i mentioned before and a bunch of sundance films that have come out slow west, dope, far from the maddening crowd, and tangerine. plus, you've got plenty of movies that have gotten good reviews or acclaimed from sundance and cannes that are coming out later this year like entertainment, the forbidden room, sicario, the lobster, tale of tales, carol, green room, mississippi grind, and the witch among others.       &gt;that it has to have been released this year?      it's ridiculous to base a year off the first half, when the best movies come out in the second half due to distributors picking the movies up from festivals like cannes and venice.      &gt;besides, i applied the same ""bullshit rules"" to years passed as i did to this year.      yeah and the only thing you've proved is that every year in the 90's, there's like 3-4 good films mixed with a bunch forgettable generic hollywood garbage.       &gt;what people? your friends? show me.      [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10516725/film-review-of-the-year-2013-this-was-the-greatest-year-of-cinema-since-1999.html), [extremely hyperbolic but this would work](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/10/2013-best-year-at-movies), [this](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-best-movies-of-2013), and the list goes on and on. fuck, there were dozens of threads on this subreddit praising the last two years as some of the best cinema had to offer.      &gt;show me that the years 2005-2015 had as much if not more original films in the theaters than ever before.        i'm gonna use the original festival dates for each year, because it's harder to remember which film came out which year.       2007: ncfom, jesse james, twbb, i'm not there, darjeeling limited, shotgun stories, michael clayton, superbad, american gangster, zodiac, paranoid park, the banishment, diving bell and the butterfly, the man from london, flight of the red balloon, secret sunshine, 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days, control, and lust, caution. there's plenty of other great films from that year but just that selection alone proves my point.      2009: a serious man, fantastic mr. fox, inglorious basterds, a single man, avatar, up in the air, dogtooth, amer, bad lieutenant, up, drag me to hell, vengeance, enter the void, the white ribbon, bright star, a prophet, wild grass, and moon.    2011: tree of life, kid with a bike, drive, turin horse, hugo, a dangerous method, rango, tinker tailor, shame, carnage, a separation, tintin, take shelter, win win, first class, bridesmaids, we need to talk about kevin, weekend, and once upon a time in anatolia.      2013: wolf of wall street, nebraska, inside llewyn davis, prisoners,  blue is the warmest color, prince avalanche, her, under the skin, only lovers left alive, stranger by the lake, gravity, night moves, the double, 12 years a slave, the conjuring, locke, all is lost, before midnight, upstream color, hard to be a god, and the immigrant.      2014: the grand budapest hotel, boyhood, inherent vice, leviathan, maps to the stars, goodbye to language, mommy, the lego movie, gone girl, two days one night, edge of tomorrow, duke of burgundy, mr. turner, a most violent year, nightcrawler, jauja, and a pigeon sat on a branch reflecting on existence.      you'll notice that i did skip over some years, i do consider 2005 and 2008 to be bad/mediocre years in cinema, while 2010 and 2012 have more disappointments outweighing the good. the whole point is that there's more to cinema outside of mainstream hollywood films.",0,

114412,"""the tower had been constructed with the help and guidance of a dozen of the greatest scientists and philosphers of england, not to mention the financial guidance of a few wealthy french nobles. it had been sickening making deals with those greedy buzzards, but it had to be done. thousands of working hands and a few years later , the tower of england (commonly reffered to as ""her lady's shaft"" on the streets of london ) stood tall and imposing.  a monstrous brick and wood tower rising far above the city, far above the clouds, able to be seen not only in the city, but in the far reaches of wales, scotland, ireland, and rumor had it, even the spanish could glimpse it from their extravagant cathedrals across the bay. at the very top of this tower was the crown jewel, the 'star stone' , a beacon of light that radiated all across the city and the isle. the light that came from the stone was the only thing that guided travelers, merchants, and ships all around the british isle, it was the only source of light in the dark night sky. before the tower of england had been built, 'night' in europe was a time of hiding, of fear, of blindness, the darkness was everywhere and the miniscule stars in the sky provided no comfort, but that all changed when her majesty's guard discovered the 'star stone' in the depths of a cavern underneath some scottish farmer's pasture.  the stone was akin to a large boulder, and during the day appeared very normal, dull really, but as soon as the sun set, it would begin to glow with a mysterious and incredibly strong white light. transporting it to london took months, and fixing it atop the tower took even longer, but when the queen is set on something, it is done at all costs.  her majesty saw the glorious opportunity and capitalized on it while she could, and it is why every citizen is required to pay the 'star stone tax', and every citizen does it willingly.  afterall, the night was full of terrors and the stone atop the tower prevented those terrors from resurfacing.""  with a disgusted sigh, elizabeth discarded the pamphlet over the shoulder of her throne where a manservant promptly scurried over to dispose of it. usually she would revel in the narcissistic habit of reading british propoganda pamphlets that had already begun to describe her ambitious missions in the most fanciful ways, but today she could not seem to stomach it. and she knew why. that lowlife captain weston had returned from his voyage late last night. he would be coming to deliver her his reports, and if the rumors were true, his reports were fantastical, nigh unbelievable.   in fact it angered her so much that a filthy, bearded lunatic would make such a ridiculous journey across a disgusting ocean to some imaginary land where brown half human animals lived and worshipped tree folk and, hear this, a white circle in the sky at night, a white circle, what kind of bloody imbecile worships a white circle in the sky, the only white at night is my tower and lord knows i worked muc-  a loud banging followed by  a shout of "" lo, m'lady!"" interrupted the seething queen.   this was followed by twenty seconds of strained silence as the intimidated door guards debated whether to ask the queen if she had heard the knock or to just continue staring straight ahead.   ""well? do i have to tell you to do everything? open the bloody door and let him in,"" shouted the queen in a voice that could shatter glass.  with pitiful hastiness the guards clumsily opened the doors of the throne hall and in stumbled captain weston himself, scraggly, wide-eyed, looking as if he had not slept for the past week, and with such a vacant expression it would seem his spirit was still miles away in the world beyond the ocean fog.  ""your majesty..."" he said in a hushed, fearful tone, at this point his eyes were swiveling in their sockets, glancing at everything in the hall, the floor, the windows, the pillars, his legs had begun to visibly shake.  suddenly elizabeth felt as if her throne was slowly constricting her delicate body, this man was unsettling, he had seen things that she hadn't, he knew things that she didn't, and for the first time ever, her majesty was terribly and ferociously frightened.

[**criteria of just war theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just_war_theory#criteria_of_just_war_theory) of article  [**just war theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just%20war%20theory): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;just war theory has two sets of criteria, the first establishing *jus ad bellum* (the right to go to war), and the second establishing *jus in bello* (right conduct within war).   &gt;just cause  &gt;&gt;the reason for going to war needs to be just and cannot therefore be solely for recapturing things taken or punishing people who have done wrong; innocent life must be in imminent danger and intervention must be to protect life. a contemporary view of just cause was expressed in 1993 when the us catholic conference said: *""force may be used only to correct a grave, public evil, i.e., aggression or massive violation of the basic human rights of whole populations.""*  &gt;comparative justice  &gt;&gt;while there may be rights and wrongs on all sides of a conflict, to overcome the presumption against the use of force, the injustice suffered by one party must significantly outweigh that suffered by the other. some theorists such as [brian orend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brian_orend) omit this term, seeing it as fertile ground for exploitation by bellicose regimes.  &gt;competent authority  &gt;&gt;only duly constituted public [authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/authorities) may wage war. ""a just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice. dictatorships (e.g. hitler's regime) or deceptive military actions (e.g. the [1968 us bombing of cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_menu)) are typically considered as violations of this criterion. the importance of this condition is key. plainly, we cannot have a genuine process of judging a just war within a system that represses the process of genuine justice. a just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice"".   &gt;right intention  &gt;&gt;force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose—correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention, while material gain or maintaining economies is not.  &gt;probability of success  &gt;&gt;arms may not be used in a futile cause or in a case where disproportionate measures are required to achieve success;  &gt;last resort  &gt;&gt;force may be used only after all peaceful and viable alternatives have been seriously tried and exhausted or are clearly not practical. it may be clear that the other side is using negotiations as a delaying tactic and will not make meaningful concessions.  &gt;proportionality  &gt;&gt;the anticipated benefits of waging a war must be proportionate to its expected evils or harms. this principle is also known as the principle of macro-proportionality, so as to distinguish it from the *jus in bello* principle of proportionality.  &gt;in modern terms, just war is waged in terms of self-defense, or in defense of another (with sufficient evidence).  &gt;once war has begun, just war theory (*jus in bello*) also directs how [combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combatant) are to act or should act:  &gt;[distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distinction_(law\))  &gt;&gt;just war conduct should be governed by the principle of distinction. the acts of war should be directed towards enemy combatants, and not towards [non-combatants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-combatant) caught in circumstances they did not create. the prohibited acts include bombing civilian residential areas that include no military targets, committing acts of [terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism) and [reprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reprisal) against civilians, and attacking [neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neutrality_(international_relations\)) targets (e.g., the [japanese bombing of pearl harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_bombing_of_pearl_harbor)). moreover, combatants are not permitted to attack enemy combatants who have surrendered or who have been captured or who are injured and not presenting an immediate lethal threat or who are [parachuting from disabled aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attacks_on_parachutists) (except [airborne forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/airborne_forces)) or who are [shipwrecked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shipwreck).  &gt;[proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proportionality_(law\)#international_law)  &gt;&gt;just war conduct should be governed by the principle of proportionality. combatants must make sure that the harm caused to civilians or civilian property is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by an attack on a military objective. this principle is meant to discern the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act.  &gt;[military necessity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_necessity)  &gt;&gt;just war conduct should be governed by the principle of military necessity. an attack or action must be intended to help in the military defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a military objective, and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. this principle is meant to limit excessive and unnecessary death and destruction.  &gt;fair treatment of [prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prisoners_of_war)  &gt;&gt;enemy combatants who surrendered or who are captured no longer pose a threat. it is therefore wrong to torture them or otherwise mistreat them.  &gt;no means [malum in se](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malum_in_se)  &gt;&gt;combatants may not use weapons or other methods of warfare which are considered evil, such as mass rape, forcing enemy combatants to fight against their own side or using weapons whose effects cannot be controlled (e.g. [nuclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuclear_weapon)/[biological weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_weapons)).   &gt;

337404,"&gt; who would i likely be (who attended this meeting, how large was it?)  contemporary letters suggest that up to 500 bishops attended the council, but based on the actual record of the council it seems like not every bishop attended every meeting and that some metropolitan bishops voted for bishops under their authority. in richard price and michael gaddis's recent translation and commentary they suggested a figure of around 370 for attendees with voting rights. there were of course many lower-ranked clergymen also present who either represented absent bishops or were just followers of the people involved. lastly, there were also several important secular officials who chaired the council, which necessitated the presence of their followers and guards, a mark of imperial influence made necessary given how messy the second council of ephesus of 449 was. finally, both emperor marcian and empress pulcheria briefly visited the council, so there would have been even more people in and around the meeting during the council's sixth session.     as /u/talondearg noted, western representation was practically non-existent apart from the delegation from rome, which included three bishops from italy. only one of them knew greek, so that means we have to add a whole bunch of translators to our list of attendees too. four other western bishops were present, one from pannonia and three (or two) from north africa, but all of them can be considered to be associated with the eastern church already and not really representing western interests (the african bishops were probably refugees from the vandal invasion of africa for instance). there was also seemingly a bishop from ethiopia included as part of the egyptian contingent.  &gt; how diverse were the opinions of those attending the council re: incorporating the trinity?  everyone agreed on the trinity at the council. instead, the debate was over christology and the political fallout from the two councils of ephesus. to put it briefly, nestorius and his antiochene allies lost at the first council of ephesus thanks the machinations of cyril of alexandria and his followers. the former tended to use statements like 'two natures' (human and divine) in their theological writings, whilst the latter preferred formulations of 'one hypostasis and 'one incarnate nature' - basically some form of union between the human and divine natures of christ. cyril's own christology however is also complicated, as he at times was relatively conciliatory towards to the antiochene position, on other occasions though he was much more dogmatic, so it allowed people of all views to see the dead cyril as their champion at chalcedon. nestorius himself was condemned at ephesus i for allegedly believing in there being 'two persons' in christ, but the antiochene network survived.   issues flared up again in the 440s when the alexandrian party renewed their attack on the antiochenes, this time led by cyril's successor dioscorus. to summarise a very complicated event, ephesus ii ended rather violently as dioscorus' partisans dominated the proceedings and condemned in harsher terms anything associated with nestorianism, in the process marginalising the sees of antioch and rome. by 451 there was a new emperor on the scene and dioscorus' influence had weakened, leading some bishops to call for a new council to deal with the mess from ephesus ii. as such, the most prominent factions present at chalcedon were dioscorus' allies and those who thought that he had went too far. for various reasons, dioscorus was condemned at chalcedon and the council sought to steer a middle course between two extremes: eutychianism, an extreme cyrillian view that denied christ's humanity altogether and saw him as only of a divine nature, and nestorianism, the view that christ existed as two distinct persons. this resulted in the dyophysite position - that christ had two natures in one person.  &gt; was there a competing school of thought regarding jesus' nature which held quite a bit of weight among council attendees?  yes, particularly those from egypt and palestine who remained loyal to their definition of the cyrillian christology, the belief that christ was both divine and human in one nature (don't ask me to explain why this is different, i'm more of a church politics person!). the chalcedonian definition on the other hand was acceptable to moderates and partisans of the papacy (as the creed was partially based on a treatise written by pope leo the great). for the influence of those who lost at chalcedon, we only have to look at roman history for the next two centuries - non-chalcedonians, or miaphysites, continuously resisted imperial attempts to impose chalcedonian candidates on important sees, to the extent that eventually a parallel ecclesiastical hierarchy was established in the sixth century in egypt and syria. some emperors were even sympathetic to the miaphysites, such as zeno, anastasius and occasionally justinian, a trend that reached its apogee during the reign of heraclius, who sought to reunite the various churches within his empire even amidst the arab conquests, demonstrating the extent of the miaphysites' influence. egypt, syria and armenia in fact would eventually become mostly miaphysite in character, which is true even today for the coptic, syriac and armenian churches.",0,

144191,"the moons signify the passage of time, but far more importantly they connect to specific events in other plotlines:  * **theon's rebirth**   &gt;the moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. a pale sun rose and set and rose again. red leaves whispered in the wind.   this is a clear reference to theon's re-emergence at the wedding. **edit**-compare it to the following:   &gt;“theon,” **a voice seemed to whisper**.   &gt;his head snapped up. “who said that?” all he could see were the trees and the fog that covered them. **the voice had been as faint as rustling leaves**, as cold as hate. *a god’s voice, or a ghost’s*. how many died the day that he took winterfell? how many more the day he lost it? **the day that theon greyjoy died, to be reborn as reek.** reek, reek, it rhymes with shriek.   &gt;^(the prince of winterfell, a dance with dragons)  * **jon snow's trip to the grove, aegon's unveiling**   &gt;the moon was a black hole in the sky. wolves howled in the wood, sniffing through the snowdrifts after dead things. a murder of ravens erupted from the hillside, screaming their sharp cries, black wings beating above a white world. a red sun rose and set and rose again, painting the snows in shades of rose and pink.   this passage connects to jon's pilgrimage to the weirwood grove:   * *the moon was a black hole in the sky.*       this directly maps to jon's description of the return from the grove:      &gt;they had no moon to guide them home, and only now and then a patch of stars.   * *wolves howled in the wood, sniffing through the snowdrifts after dead things.*       ghost vanishes during the trip, only to resurface when they near the grove. isn't it quite likely he went to the same spot where he found othor in *a game of thrones*?   * *a murder of ravens erupted from the hillside, screaming their sharp cries, black wings beating above a white world.*       this is strongly reminiscent of the 'crows' that make the journey to the grove (jon vii). the 'cries and black wings above a white world has a striking match:      &gt;a sentry’s horn greeted them as they approached, sounding from on high like **the cry of some huge, deep-throated bird**, a single long blast that meant rangers returning.   * *a red sun rose and set and rose again, painting the snows in shades of rose and pink.*       the red sun is almost certainly aegon vi in this context.       it's also interesting to note the possibility that shade of rose could be blue, for the blue winter roses of winterfell. most conspicuously then, the passage is stating that the snows (snows?) are painted in blue and pink—the colors of lyanna stark and roose bolton. hard to deny the likelihood that this is deliberate.       furthermore, we once again see a specific similarity in jon's travel to the grove:      &gt;half a mile from the grove, **long red shafts of autumn sunlight** were slanting down between the branches of the leafless trees, **staining the snowdrifts pink**.  * **entombed at the crofter's village**   &gt;the moon was a crescent, thin and sharp as the blade of a knife. snowflakes drifted down soundlessly to cloak the soldier pines and sentinels in white.   consider the wordplay here, the possibility that the line refers to soldiers and sentinels (guards) instead of trees.   this would be strikingly consistent with the observation of how the crofter's village has all but vanished under the snow, stannis's men quite possibly hidden.   thus it would seem that this strongly matches with the apparent entrapment of stannis's army at the end of the king's prize.  * **poised for battle / the wildling surrender**   &gt;the moon was fat and full. summer prowled through the silent woods, a long grey shadow that grew more gaunt with every hunt, for living game could not be found. the ward upon the cave mouth still held; the dead men could not enter. the snows had buried most of them again, but they were still there, hidden, frozen, waiting. other dead things came to join them, things that had once been men and women, even children. dead ravens sat on bare brown branches, wings crusted with ice. a snow bear crashed through the brush, huge and skeletal, half its head sloughed away to reveal the skull beneath. summer and his pack fell upon it and tore it into pieces. afterward they gorged, though the meat was rotted and half-frozen, and moved even as they ate it.   more wordplay, increasingly abstract and perhaps... dare i say.. tinfoily:   * *summer prowled through the silent woods, a long grey shadow that grew more gaunt with every hunt, for living game could not be found.*       this could be an abstract reference to stannis, starving in his wait for prey.   * *the ward upon the cave mouth still held; the dead men could not enter.*       this could be in reference to winterfell. recall that ward may also mean guard or lookout... this may be in relation to stannis waiting for an absense of a guard before springing a surprise capture of winterfell, per known theories: stannis cannot move on winterfell because it is still occupied and impregnable.   * *the snows had buried most of them again, but they were still there, hidden, frozen, waiting. other dead things came to join them, things that had once been men and women, even children.*       isn't this curiously apt in light of theon and ""arya"" joining stannis's army, the army that is hidden, frozen, waiting.   * *dead ravens sat on bare brown branches, wings crusted with ice.*       a reference to mance-a dead raven of sorts, waiting somewhere-his freedom chained somehow?   * *a snow bear crashed through the brush, huge and skeletal, half its head sloughed away to reveal the skull beneath.*       mors umber is missing an eye, supposedly an empty socket the only thing beneath. he wears a great white bearskin cloak, including its face.   collectively, these details all seem to match with the situation presented in the sacrifice.   alternatively, its possible that the entire paragraph refers to the surrender of the wildlings (jon xii). this is because the moon is full... precisely matching when val stated that she would return with tormund (and because much of the paragraph clearly works if you consider its applicability to the wildlings).  the moons become increasingly difficult to decipher as the chapter proceeds, and i am struggling to infer anything from those beyond this one. this could be because they relate to events that occur in twow.  in any case i am confident that the observations above are quite deliberate: they poetically establish continuity between the northern plotlines.  *** edit: added one more:  * **jon's death, a possible escape.**   &gt;the moon was a black hole in the sky. outside the cave the world went on. outside the cave the sun rose and set, the moon turned, the cold winds howled.  i believe some ideas can be ferreted out of this paragraph:   * *outside the cave the sun rose and set*        if we continue with the whole 'sun=son' motif, then this passage is notably different from those prior because the sun does not rise again. this seems to suggest that the sun/son in question is actually dead, and quickly seems like an allusion to jon's assassination.       however, the reality is that the sun does not 'die' when it sets—it does not cease to exist just because we cannot see it—it obviously returns after being beneath the horizon for some time. ie, the sun/son *will* rise again, after spending some time *beneath the world*.       how apt is this appreciation when you consider the campbellian monomyth and the 'journey to the underworld' all archetypal heroes must make. especially if you compare it to my observations that [bloodraven is conspicuously similar to a greek god](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2014/08/18/bloodraven-greek-god-of-sleep/), one who has significant influence on the entrance/exits to the underworld.       furthermore, according to such monomyth ideas, it is the journey to (and return from) the underworld that bestows hidden knowledge (like *parentage*) or power unto the hero, completing a transformation necessary to confront the ultimate antagonist. *kill the boy and let the man be born.*   * *the moon turned*   i won't bore you with the details, but val seems to have a strong symbolic affiliation with the moon. some time ago i proposed a theory that [val escaped from castle black](https://cantuse.wordpress.com/2014/10/10/the-captive-must-obey/) prior to the assassination. as such, i believe the *moon turning* represents her movement, her escape.   * *the cold winds howled.*   there are plenty of things i believe this could symbolize. however, the previous two entries suggest that this paragraph occurs during jon's final chapter, jon xiii. thus if the cold winds howled and were to signify anything, it could be the wildlings roaring at the shieldhall.   at a stretch, it might also represent the northern mountain clans roaring prior to some major battle at the crofter's village.  *** edit 2: added excerpt to first moon passage, to make it easier to see parallels to theon.",0,

241841,"hi guys, very new to wp. i enjoy writing and have a bit of insomnia. writing this at 4:30am so bear with me.  trembling, palms slick and cold, i walk towards the dim, reddish orange haze at the end of the hall, the light slowly meandering from off to on and back off again in drowsy clockwork. the muscles in my fingers feel strained, like i have been religiously doing twelve-rep sets of forearm and hand-strengthening calisthenics, the torturous weight of the gun in my hand becoming all too known now.  it feels powerful. the cobalt-onyx finish blinks like a flirtatious waitress, asking to be caressed. the weight greatens, gravity taking hold and pulling down harder than my wrists can bear. she plays hard-to-get. switching hands, switching grips, the weapon slides from fingertip to fingertip seamlessly like a mercurial statue, waxing and waning in the pale, respectful but commanding respect.   six or seven minutes must have passed since i began my trek down this hall. glancing over shoulder, i could not have gone more than 30 feet. the tired bleating of the red light continues, flashing like a sentient alarm, going for centuries, sleepy and weary from its vigilance.   a stark clicking pulls me from my sojourn in the hallway. it hails from beyond the door beneath the light. the sound of metal on stone, a clack and a chonk, followed by the sound of hard plastic against wood. it is muffled, and in rhythm; every so often the rhythm is broken and the pace rests and resets. the door in front of me lies sternly shut, no air underneath, above, or between the old iron jambs on each side. the splintered layers betraying years of painting and repainting the same iron door with the same sterile, limestone-colored lacquer has thickened and insulated the causeway at least half an inch. my hand against the wrought latch, i tighten my grasp on the gun and remember my task. forsten state was home to more than one psychological pariah, i mustn’t forget that.   putting myself into the latch, i slide it away from its mechanism, the grinding metal on metal bellowing behind me in a huge wake of ear-shattering sound. despite the effort the lock takes to coerce, and the sonic explosion that resulted, the door swings open with little more work than the screen door on an old bungalow. filling the hall with tall lines of peckish white moonlight, punctuated by the lengths of bar stretching across the windows, i step into the room and wonder immediately if i have made a mistake.   lying in front of me, twisted, bent, broken, scarred, burned, was the shapeless amalgamation of what was, probably recently, a middle-aged man. long gray hair peppered with streaks of dark mahogany, deep, carved wrinkles only brought on by great stress and trial, high cheekbones beguiling a long-lost grin-- the man before me had been through much, had seen too far, had experienced too full the ebbs and flows of life. looking at me, or more through me, with only the whites of his eyes and the yellowed fragments of teeth showing, i could not help but wonder again, if i have made a mistake.  my hand tightens again around the weapon in my hand. dr. stuckliss gave me specific instructions. say nothing, just fire. the slick trail of sweat on the grip of the gun becomes freezing rime as i raise the barrel to execute the man shaking before me. i close my eyes, and can only pull.  as the tendons in my finger shrink to produce a shot, the click and familiar bang of a gun being fired at a hopeless patient never come-- i am sure i pulled. perhaps i am blocking the event out of my mind. opening my eyes, a brutally intense white light pours from the weapon, beaming into the flesh of the man in front of me. suddenly he stands, devoid of the lethargy i just saw him with. beyond the great white light all i can make out is his face, rolling water from his eyes, the tears directed by the crags on his cheeks and chin, his stare blank but somehow terrified.  the light fades, and the gun emits a high-pitched series of beeps, like that on a microwave. the gun vibrates, or moreso shivers. looking down, i cannot help but think the gun hungers-- it seems alive, unsated, wanting for more. the poor man slumps to the floor in a lifeless pile of flesh stretched over scaffolding.   my solemnest thoughts, the wellsprings of my pride and my sadness, my turbulent reflections baking in the pressurized pot of my own mind. the icy, sticky metal clings to the meat of my hand like a piece of fresh caramel on leather, ingraining its atoms to mine-- even if i wanted to drop it, the weapon would not leave my hand, for want of a host, for want of control and to be held.",0,

726382,"sunlight streaked down onto the cement floor, illuminating the dust particles floating in the air as the uniformed men opened the hatches leading outside. i suddenly felt more aware of my malnourished body, draped in a thin hospital gown. we emerged from what was once a subway station and onto the deserted streets of new york city, a place once teeming with life now void of all but an impressive raccoon infestation. the sky was a bright cloudless blue that seemed to stretch for miles, far beyond the skyscraper-littered horizon. i remember the feeling of sunshine on my pale skin for the first time in 25 years; though my memory recalled walking through blotches of sunlight to the makeshift-quarantine with my mother only the day before, my body accepted the natural light as something foreign.   mother.. where was she?! had she not been in the bed next to mine when we entered our prolonged hibernation?!   i immediately turned on a swivel, walking against the thousands of hospital gowned new yorkers marching down 145th street, scanning every face that came into view. i was greeted with bumps, shoves, and the occasional hard shoulder planted into my lower rib cage. one such blow landed me on my knees, face to face with warm black asphalt, my knee bleeding from a sharp rock or piece of glass. looking up i saw only legs in all directions, the tromping swarms of sneakers closing in on my exposed body from all sides, the small patch of blue above me shrinking quickly as i fell deeper into the abyss of limbs. ""mother! mother!""   suddenly a large hand caught my bicep, pulling me up and away from the crowd seemingly with ease. upon recovering from my hysterics i found that the hand belonged to a soldier, one of the uniformed men from the quarantine leading us all back to our homes. he examined my knee briefly and looked me dead in the eye.   ""what the hell are you doin', kid?"" my eye caught the glare off the barrel of a fully automatic ak-47 slung around his shoulder.   ""it's my mother, sir. i don't know where she is."" i said.   ""name?"" he pulled out a piece of technology i'd never seen before. a holograph projected the date and time an inch or two from the device in opaque blue letters. i guess government technology really does evolve over 25 citizen-free years.   ""margaret fletcher"" i stated, my eyes shifting from the device to his gun and back.   he entered the name and a low pitched beep protruded from the futuristic box. with a puzzled look he typed the name again and was greeted by the same beep. his eyes looked up from the device, met mine, and in a low voice he said ""come with me.""   i was escorted by the same hand around the same bicep to the back of a new york city police department car parked a block away. he sat me in the the cold plastic seat and didn't speak a word to me until we reached the presbyterian hospital in queens, after opening the door for me: ""get out.""   i followed him through the back entrance, entering the cold, dimly lit hallway that seemed to stretch for miles. lights flickered as we journeyed farther from the door, and i noticed that every window we passed had the blinds pulled shut. a lot of the fluorescent lightbulbs above us had gone out, as one would expect after 25 years, but nothing inside seemed dusty or void of use quite as the buildings outside did. we walked until we were met by a small, balding man in a lab coat, with a clipboard occupying his left hand. the man who brought me addressed him as ""dr. gretching"" and told him i was the child of a mrs. margaret fletcher, and i was looking for her. he introduced himself to me with a firm handshake and asked me to follow him a couple doors down. i complied, leaving the armed man down the hall, out of earshot. as dr. gretching and i walked, he spoke in a serious, monotonous tone.   ""you're mother,"" he said, ""is what we call a light sleeper"" our footsteps echoed down the hall to the soldier who remained unmoving. ""her body's immune system reacted negatively to the hibernation serum, ultimately fighting off the cells that told her brain to shut down. we tried multiple different times to put her to sleep, each with different strains of the serum, but each time she just woke up within as little as 8 hours. so after a while, we were forced to accept the fact that she could not be subject to hibernation.""   my heart stopped. mother was 63 when the quarantine was imposed, and that was 25 years ago...   ""my mother is 88?!"" i shouted. the doctor's stride did not slow, nor did he look towards me.   ""her body's rejection of the serum did not allow her to stop aging like the rest of you, so yes. you're mother has aged 25 years since she has seen you last. her condition is quite unstable now, but she has undergone multiple surgery's in order to see you once more before her inevitable death.""   he stopped outside of a door marked 422. ""if you wish to see her, you may.""   i placed my hand on the cold silver handle and twisted it, entering the white walled-room where my elderly mother lay dying on the hospital bed, the monitor beside her displaying her heart rate and blood pressure. closing the door behind me, i walked up to the bed where she reached out her hand to me and i clasped both hands around it, bringing my own body close to hers. i sat on the bed beside her, looking into her eyes.   ""my son,"" she said in a fragile, decaying voice, ""i have waited 25 years for this day.""   ""me too, mother"" i said, my voice shaking. i felt a tear slide down my cheek and drip onto her thin, white bed sheets.   ""do not cry, my son, for i was doomed to leave this world eventually, and i'm so glad i was able to see you one more time before i do."" her wrinkled hand felt paper thin in mine, her hair so much grayer than the day we walked down 145th street through the blotches of sunshine.   ""come here, give me a hug,"" she said. shaking, i leaned over and put her arms around her frail shoulders as she put hers around mine. she leaned her head forward so her lips touched my ear, and from beneath her breath came a whisper so soft it was barely a sound.   ""they're not who they say they are""   the monitor flatlined.",0,

216930,"**here is a solution with back history and story hook**   old man was in fact a gold miner. and in his time digging for riches in the depth of the earth he came across **the soul of the dwarves**  (*teardrop shaped crystal that seemed to change between the clarity and sparkle of the most pure diamond and the shine and shimmer of pure liquid gold constantly. it is said to be the single drop to have spilled from moradin's forge when he created the first dwarves.*)  the tear brought good fortune to the old miner and in a short time the miner had built one of the largest mining companies in the land and a great and vast fortune was his to spend, and so he places the soul of the dwarves in a golden crown and it became his banner and the symbol of power and wealth. but as time went by the old miner slowly coveted the soul more and more knowing it was the true source of his power, and he wished to possess it forever.  he spent his great wealth and vast fortune to search the lands to find a way to secure his immortality.  one day an old ancient dwarf beggar wearing stinking rags carrying only a walking stick came to his estate with a offer for immortality. the old miner was hesitant that the beggar cold offer him any help but so desired eternal life he allowed the dwarf audience and heard him out.  in the great hall of the estate before the miners throne, the old dwarf cleared his throat sounding as though he hadn't spoken in hundreds of years (given how old the dwarf looked it was a distinct possibility) ""your wealth is the envy of kings and nations, your mines the envy of the dwarf lords. even the red dragons of the north have come to covet your hoard. you have such fortune that you could never spend it in 100 lifetimes."" the old dwarfs voice was a cracked jagged low rumble like an earthquake ""i can give those 100 lifetimes and 100 lifetimes more even."" the old dwarf leaned heavily on his walking stick as though his speech had taken years off his life.  the miner pleased with flattery smiled and spoke ""first tell me your name and then tell me your prices, beggar dwarf.""  the dwarfs voice rumbled again, clearer and louder seeming to come from the very earth itself. ""my name is does not matter and my price is simple, give up your symbol, the soul of the dwarves, to me, and in return i shall grant you eternal life and such wealth that what the stone brought you would pale by comparison.""   but the miners heart had been twisted by desire and lust for the soul and the fortunes it brought long ago.   the miner became enraged at the thought of giving up the stone and the audacity of the ancient beggars request. ""never would i give up the soul, especially to a liar and a beggar! i would die before i see it taken from me!"" the miner then ordered his guards to have the old dwarf beaten and thrown from his lands for lying and wasting his time.  but before he could even finish the order the old dwarf threw off his rags and cast down his walking stick, and spoke in voice that now without a doubt rose from the earth and shook the very pillars of the miners great hall ""greedy fool! if you shall not make a deal with a beggar! then you shall submit to the will of a god!"" the dwarf grew 20 feet tall and transformed moradin god of the dwarves. ""i see there can be no reasoning with one who's heart has been so corrupted by greed and desire and so i curse you, that which you would die to keep,..."" moradin raised his hand and with a single gesture pulled the soul of the dwarves from the miners crown into his hand from across the room. ""... you shall forever live without. you will live 1000 lifetimes as a beggar of 90 years old, and nothing shall free you from your mortal coil but my word, so i have decreed.""   the miner aged 90 years in a single moment before the all-father moradin. ""i leave you now to watch your coveted power and wealth dissolve before you.""  and with that moradin disappeared in a pillar of fire and light.   and so began the exile of the old miner.  ** flash forward to billiams accidental homicide ** just a few hours after the ""incident"" occurs a pillar of white light and fire shoots down from the sky directly into the old miners shack.  the party are all able to witness this if they are outside and are over come by the urge to investigate.  upon returning to the shack the party find the once dead old miner very much alive and just as old and crazy.   where he  a) remembers nothing of his death just hours before and acts as though he is encountering the party for the first time. b) remembers his death, is resentful of his killer, but can still be convinced to help the party (small side quest/negotiations) c) something else entirely that i can't think of.   hope this helps.",0,

766096,"there are two steps to any murder -- three if you're being technical.  first, there's the planning and preparation. if you're the murderer, this is your meat and potatoes. *this* is where you earn your money. everything that goes into you not getting caught goes into this first step. if it was a chess game (and don't think that it isn't), this would be your opening, middle and end game.   technically, the act of the kill is the following step. in the bigger picture, it's insignificant, though. a blip. a moment in time at which a threshold is passed. everything else, the real work, should already be accomplished. this is just the cherry on top of it all. and anyone who's ever eaten a sundae knows that it's not the cherry that you remember. the cherry doesn't matter at all. it just has to be there, plopped on top of so many other carefully laid layers. it's really only the movies and books that make it seem important. they make it seem like something magnificent, they glorify it. they'd better, it's what the audience has come to expect.  which leads us to part three: the detection. you've played your chess game and now the detectives get their chance to play theirs. i often picture it like a dam. if the dam holds against the probing pressures of the water behind it, then the murder goes unsolved. the important things for the detective are to find the weak points and to have possession of the proper tools required to apply leverage to them. you couldn't use a common screwdriver on a hex head bolt just as you can't crack a murder case without witnesses, evidence or confessions.  the beauty of these rules is that they're all very flexible. even breakable. a murder may not have any preparation at all, a simple act of passion which ends a life. this may make it easier for the detective, and often does, but *not necessarily*. remember, the planning and preparation aren't for the murder, but in order to prevent discovery, and so even after the murder is committed, it's still possible to cover up what's happened. yet other murders are never attempted to be discovered. either because of exact planning or because of a profound insignificance of the kill itself.  but perhaps the most interesting type of murder is the one in which no one's died at all -- not yet. the plans have been laid, weapons manufactured and at a moment's notice they're ready to be deployed. the ""investigation"" such as there would be one, is already agreed upon. damage assessed, fines and treaties settled on. the only thing missing is the order to fire ze missiles.",0,
445774,"my food's gonna get cold, but fuck it... **the flame stay the flame.**  good observations. you see those scenes well, and from multiple angles and time-frames, even. but, i think that you have a fundamental flaw in how you view avon.   also, real quick - in regards to marlo, after he signs those business deals with levy at the end of his arc, in his mind; for what he wanted to personally get out of ""the game,"" he had lost, and he handles that loss the exact same way as his previous losses... he goes and scraps with two corner boys to make himself feel better.  anyway, back to avon...  avon was also a king, yes, but avon ruled in a different way than marlo did. avon was the nino brown-type that passed-out turkeys at thanksgiving, paid families to be quiet, got on his people's asses for violating the ""old school""-type codes that are always part of these tropes, *(like the ""sunday truce"" thing)* and generally tried to be a benevolent *(relatively..)* king. people knew who he was from the neighborhood, and they knew who his family was, too. his name itself carried enough weight to not get d' killed while he was coming up, and even after he had fucked-up multiple times.  *(eventually, stringer had to go ""out of pocket,"" remember...)*  the fact that he got to basically be the stereotypical baby-kissin', hand-shakin' drunken presidential candidate while stringer played the public role of the mercurial, cleanin'-up-after-shit vice president. *(i'm seeing president clinton and vice president cheney, but i'm a sick fuck.)*  everybody knew avon had the name, the ""clout,"" and - without having to say it - the muscle. having the muscle and the territory means not really having to use the muscle very often, at least not fatally. and, even though i'm about to say that it goes without mentioning, let's mention avon's treatment in prison itself. guards treated him respectfully, or at least were smart enough to avoid him. *(he shouldn'ta fucked wit' bey's fish, doe...)*    then, there's marlo's methods of ruling. yes, he gave money to the kids on the street. that assures their loyalty for as long as it takes them to spend it. for kids, actual kids, not ""16 years-old and more man than i am"" kids like bodie... biddie? boody? bodie... the local kingpins, and even most lower-level guys, rule through fear. marlo didn't have another gear, though. he ruled everybody through fear. can you imagine marlo handing out turkeys at thanksgiving? shit no! that's time wasted that they could be out shooting turkeys for target practice. can you imagine marlo having a problem taking-out someone who had already fucked-up multiple times, just because of a familial relation? i'm pretty sure marlo would have just as gladly taken out chris or snoop if he felt it was necessary, or even if he just felt like it. imagine that meeting... marlo just, out of nowhere, pulls out a gun and pops snoop in the back of her head while she's ranting about some bullshit in that voice that makes her sound like the bodymore version of the waterboy's defensive coordinator. as her body slumps over and off of her chair, monk steps over her, sits down next to marlo, and pushes her out of the way with his foot. marlo watches monk do all of this, looks at his gun for a barely-perceptible second, and then goes right back to what he was saying.  yeah, that's how it'd go down. nobody would say shit to him. avon lost his temper, which he often did and never tried to hide about himself unlike mister ""mask of fuckin' sanity,"" marlo... sure, he did. that poor ref still shits himself at night. but avon didn't rule through bullying. he was an incumbent king. marlo was a rebel king, and ruled through fear and attrition.   and, marlo's strike was perfectly-timed, which doesn't get discussed enough. avon was locked-up, stringer was ""branching-out"" more, and avon had lost - one way or the other - most of his good, dependable muscle; the people who wouldn't give a fuck about snoop's... i don't know, voice, again... or chris' reputation. *(imagine ""in his prime"" cutty vs. chris? holy shit, cutty'd be so badass. ""naw, n#gga, i ain't never heard'a you, and you'd betta start sayin' mister cutty when you talk to me, ya heard?)*   anyway, the **tl;dr** is this:  both kings were ruthless and violent, because you had to be to be/come king. but, whereas marlo reveled in it, dropping bodies for the dumbest or dumbass reasons, simply for the sake of his name in the streets... avon used it to serve a higher purpose. he was just as willing to strap-up as marlo, when there was a good reason to. marlo saw some drunk calling him a pussy to some smoker as a good enough reason to risk bringing the cops down on everything. *(sure, the vacant houses were a great idea, to whomever it may have originally belonged, but they were a much less-permanent solution than many others could have been. was marlo paying the kids from the neighborhood to keep nailing up those fuckin' boards, too?)*  avon &gt; marlo, i'll absolutely, 100% agree. but, for a time, marlo was the king. if people were scared of marlo's enforcer, *(special dead)* then they were really scared of marlo. and, the greek saw enough business-savvy in him to terminate his dealings with prop joe, who he knew was reliable and even amicable, in so far as dealings of that nature go. so, it's not like marlo was without skills... but the timing of his luck simply cannot be ignored in his ""rise to the top"" either. but, i already talked about that, so i'm going to go and re-heat dinner now.",0,

700721,"i live in osaka. there are very few niggers here but they do get in. heres how: they scam whoever they can to get the cash to fly here (hello sir i am a nigerian prince etc...). once here, they convince the ugliest/dumbest japanese girl they can find to sleep with them and desperately try to knock them up. once that happens, they marry immediately and instantly get a visa. most of these stupid women believe that they're doing the right thing by not seeing the difference between black and white (japanese people are unabashedly xenophobic and many are openly racist to non-japanese people).   the sad thing is, the families typically disown the women immediately and cut off all support. most women here don't work after childbirth or marriage, and many employers frown upon women attempting to do it, so their options for employment are severely limited. they need to work to support the coon they became trapped with, because obviously the groid is incapable of respectable employment. most of them wind up being pimped out by their new ""husbands"" and sadly even involve their more gullible or hopeless friends in the racket. the coons then pool together their resources to open their dens of thievery, drug abuse, and forced prostitution - each of them putting forth the money their wives have made and indeed their women themselves.   last year there was an attempted chimpout over a news story involving one such worthless nigger who was goodified by the japanese police during his deportation. the coon, who had been married for 20 years (although he was a notorious rapist/drug hustler in tokyo) was picked up for being too drunk in public. the police managed to look up his information and found that although he had a legal visa to live and work here, he'd actually committed a felony when he first entered the country by overstaying his tourist visa before getting married. there is no statute of limitations for that crime, regardless of your current legal status. they put him in the squad car and took him straight to immigration detention, where he waited for quite literally the very next flight to the african continent. naturally, he resisted arrest and was choked to goodification. there was a very - and i mean very - brief moment of faux outrage from the sjw/clueless new-college-grad-with-no-real-world-experience crowd, stating that if it could happen to him, it could happen to any of us (although japanese police have never killed a white person in custody as far as anyones research yielded). the widow also joined in claiming that the police stuck the bill with her, as well as all of his legal affairs. they then promptly made a very brief announcement detailing the confirmed legality of the arrest and goodification before promptly shutting down any and all talk of it in the media. they made a comment about launching an ""investigation"" which of course never happened and suddenly everything got quiet and forgotten about.   it's stories like that which give me faith about the world still. unfortunately, in my neighborhood, all of the coons here are the sons/nephews/little brothers of the criminal government officials from ultra-corrupt african nations, who flaunt their diplomatic visas while they continue to break laws and cause trouble (mostly rapes and violence around these parts). they drive around in mercedes-benzes with money stolen from the other coons in their home countries, wear the most ridiculous niggerish clothing and blast awful noise through their speakers onto the streets day and night, trying to attract the young, dumb girls of this nation who've been bamboozled into thinking that hiphop culture is ""cool"" only to rape them and steal from everyone else.   sorry to write a book, but i hope at least somebody can get some good use from this.   tldr: niggers scam other people for cash, fly here, knock up/marry the first dumb coalburner they can find, and then they're here legally. the japanese govt hates it, the other foreigners here hate it, and i really wish we could do something about it.",1,1

631064,"my loins ached.   my testicles had retreated somewhere up near my lungs.    i had lost twenty pounds, my formerly soft body had begun to take a shape it hadn’t seen in twenty years.   i could barely drag myself out of bed and when i collapsed in the kitchen, i called the ambulance.     let me introduce myself: my name is herschel bates, and apparently, i am one of the last man left on earth. there are a few astronauts stuck on the space station, and we’re still trying to figure out how to get them back, but for the time being, it’s just me, pale, fat me. i used to fantasize about this exact situation while engaged in all night sessions of civilization v. usually it was sandra, the woman in apartment 3l that would knock longingly on my door, begging for some relief from the conquering general (that was me). turns out, once men disappeared, sandra, and most of the other women on the planet decided they were fine without them, became lesbians. but not all women.     i’m in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. turns out those commercials that say to check with your doctor to see if you are healthy enough for sex really are telling the truth. who would of thought? wisdom from a cialis commercial. i guess i was healthy enough for one month of sex. one of the emt’s a large woman with slightly hairy forearms is eyeing me and biting her lip, her partner, driving, yells back that there’s been a change in plan. i’m going to the airport. i fell asleep and the rest of the ambulance ride is a blur.   the airport is a mess. without most of the pilots, the airlines shut down.  tsa still operated just fine, considering the decreased number of travelers (by a little more than 50%), they just simply kept going with a reduced staff. the same angry women still checked id’s, told you to take off your shoes, and in my case, did a rather thorough cavity search with the blue nitrile gloves.    my flight was empty, just me, the pilots (i assume, i never saw them), and a post-op transgender flight attendant on an embraer 190. i flipped through the safety manual, noted the clearest exists and then strapped myself into one of the first class seats. the flight attendant reminded me that i was ticketed for coach, and escorted me back to the coach section, before strapping herself into the tiny half seats provided for the flight attendants.      “where are we going?” i asked her once the plane had reached cruising altitude and the seatbelt sign was turned off. my ticket had no destination or departing airport codes on it, just a seat number and my name. they had spelled my first name wrong.    “i don’t know, i was just assigned to this plane a few minutes before take-off. by the time i got here, the pilots had already locked the cockpit door.”    “hi, i’m herschel”   “i'm toni, with an i”   “hello toni, with an i.”    “would you like to purchase an in-flight meal or some headsets?”    i glanced around the plane, i was the only passenger. “um, do i have to buy it? can’t you just give me a meal?”    “no sir, company policy does not allow complimentary meals, i can provide you with a cookie or a bag of chips. we also accept all major credit cards.”    i had not expected to be flying, so i had not brought my headphones, or a snack. i did have my wallet and i proffered my american express card in exchange for a box of crackers and cheese and some cheap headphones. the small tv screen in front of me was still breaking news on the disappearance of men, which occurred some two months earlier.   to tell you the truth, it had taken me two weeks to even realize something had happened. my sister had called, and been shocked to find out i still existed. she was in the army, some sort of administrator at a base in virginia and had called to check one me. i vaguely remembered her calling in the middle of the night a few weeks earlier, but i had ignored the calls and turned off my phone.  she told me to lock my doors and not to go outside. since that was my normal state, it was easy to follow her instructions. it had taken another week before i ran out of toilet paper and i had forgotten my sisters advice. a quick trip to the drug store saw a quick retreat when a middle aged woman screamed:     “a man, get him!”    a crowd of women had chased me and only by ducking into a closed hardware store and escaping out the back door was i able to evade the crowd. i’m not sure what they would have done to me, but i wasn’t sticking around to find out. i returned to my apartment and took out a craigslist ad.        missing something?      call 555-5557 to fill the gap in your life.    under the ad i included a picture of mark harmon. i look nothing like mark harmon, but i figured no one was in position to be choosy. so, in just a matter of days, i became the highest price slightly balding, pasty, acne scarred prostitute in history. depending on the client, i charged between ten and twenty thousand dollars an hour. i found out a few things about women that video games had never taught me.    1.	the average woman is average looking   2.	the average woman is out of my league   3.	the average woman will settle for me when nothing else is available   4.	rich women are generally older   5.	older women can definitely get what they want in a hour   6.	sex with women is much harder in real life than fantasy    there were probably some other lessons i learned over the next month, lessons about eating well, and taking breaks from work, but they escaped me as i watched the news footage in the tiny monitor on the back of the seat in front of me. after eating the crackers and cheese, relieving myself in airplane bathroom, i fell asleep. i awoke when the seat belt sign chimed and the pilot announced that we were beginning our initial descent. i peered out the window and saw white snow-capped mountains. the rockies, what was i doing in the rockies?      “please return your seat back to the full upright position sir”     i looked up at the flight attendant, she was smiling at me and indicating that i should sit up straight for my safety during the descent.  i returned her smile and pressed the button, feeling the seat push me back to sitting board straight. thirty minutes later the plane touched down and i recognized denver international airport from its huge tents. the plane taxied past the terminal to hangar on the far side of the runway. there were a few gray military planes sitting around, i recognized the c-130’s from call of duty, a military hangar in a jetblue plane? the plane stopped and the flight attendant announced that it was now safe to move about the cabin, but to be careful as baggage may have shifted during the flight. i had no baggage and once again glanced around the empty cabin to make sure she was just addressing me. i walked to the front of the plane.     “have a nice day herschel”  the flight attendant smiled at me as i walked out the open cabin door. there were some stairs leading down to the hangar floor, where a semi-circle of stern looking women in military fatigues looked up at me.  as i descended down the steps, my muscles still aching from my conjugal month and i heard some conversation as i neared the bottom.    “is that him ma’am?”     “yup, that’s herschel” i recognized my sister, more by the name tag on her uniform since her hair was cropped short and tucked into an army hat.     i gave her a hug, but she broke it quickly, seemingly embarrassed by my affection.     “we don’t have a lot of time hersch, get in the truck, we have to get you to safety.”    “safety? whats going on sis?”    “you’re the only man left of earth.  and it’s looking doubtful if the cosmonauts will make it back alive. we have to keep you safe.”  she pushed me into the lead humvee and the convoy immediately took off, speeding through special access gates out of the airport onto dirt roads.   “where are we going?”    “cheyenne mountain bunker, you’ll meet the president there.”    “president? president of what?”    “president of united states jackass.”    “he’s dead, katie couric told me on the news.”    “not dead, just…missing. the contingency plan kicked in once the government lost most of its members. president burwell has been acting as commander in chief for the past two months from the norad facility at petersen air force base.”    “who is burwell?”    “christ herschel, do you ever watch the news?”    “yeah, i just watched it on the flight over.”    “she’s the former secretary of health and human services. they passed over sally jewell because she’s a brit.”    “yeah, you lost me. um, why am i going to a bunker?”    “because you’re the last man left on earth and everybody wants to get a hold of you.”    “there’s got to be a couple somewhere, right?”    “no, just you as far as we know. there’s some rumors of a nepalese guy, but we can’t confirm them. it was really fucking stupid, putting up an ad on craigslist.”    “yeah, about that, i’m really tired and….um….things ache.”    “serves you right, horny bastard. typical guy, whole world goes to hell and all you think about is sex.”  we pulled up short in front of a hole carved into the side of a mountain. the credentials were checked and i caught more than one guard eyeing me like a piece of meat sitting in the back seat of the humvee.    we drove into the tunnel, deeper and deeper until finally we stopped. we got out and entered an old elevator, one that still had the gates that swung up to open and we descended for what seemed like an eternity. when we stopped we were in what looked like an apartment building lobby, the only difference was the armed women scattered around the lobby, standing to attention when we exited the elevator.     “welcome to your new home hersch.”",0,
323855,"i slightly disagree.  i think that men can tolerate a deficit equal to their bf% and women at (bf% - 8%).  but then i fall back on the 1200 calorie minimum for a woman and 1400 calorie minimum for a man guidance.  a 500 pound sedentary young man may have a 3600 calorie tdee, and an 1800 calorie ketogenic diet would be a 50% caloric deficit, severe, yet tolerable.  such a high deficit will indeed slow the metabolism somewhat, however for most in this condition, it is far better to shed the excess fat as quickly as possible and just accept the slower metabolism penalty.  bariatric surgeons commonly place such patients on an 800 calorie high protein diet instead, so that is an even greater caloric deficit, but with medical supervision.  women have more hormonal concerns, especially during child bearing years, so that comes into play.  on the other hand, the psychological issues involved when confronting the need for massive weight loss are also important yet perhaps under-appreciated here.",0,

935041,"one of the things that i think is really interesting is that even though it is evolutionary, because genx is so outnumbered on either side, it's as though we'll skip a step.   what would otherwise have been a generational middle ground (to a certain extent) was never loud enough to overpower the baby boomers — or possibly more accurately, never populous enough to be catered to.   i suspect this may lead to a more stark distinction between the upcoming landscape and the proceeding one than we would otherwise expect, because of the sandwich cookie of disproportionate population boons.  the other difficult thing in discussions like this is trying to suss out what will be views of millennials as they age. poll data is noisy with ""youth"" issues. i'm interested to see if the current 18-34 year olds grow out of statism or not.",0,

amateur cricketers could receive unlimited income from benefit matches. amateurs didn't need or want to earn a living from sport. thus their performance didn't carry the same practical or symbolic value. if they played badly the disadvantages were metaphysical - a loss to pride not to the pocket. loss of form didn't have the demon material consequences that shadowed the exploits of the working class professional. shamateur clubs were snobs: they wanted to compete, to use the same devices as professional clubs to build a successful team, but at the same time remain unsullied by the grubby practice of openly paying hirelings to beat opponents."" from 'walter daniel tull, 1888-1918: soldier, footballer, black', by phil vasili +  ""the use of legislation, however, should not be allowed to muffle the noise and directness of class conflict. indeed, legislation cannot be understood without being seen as part of that conflict. commissioner of police, sir charles warren said, in relation to the feltham fair of 1887, ""the abolition of the fair is a class question on which as commissioner of police i can say little beyond the fact that it gives the police trouble to keep order, and while one class certainly enjoy it, its existence is a cause of annoyance to others."" popular culture and class conflict 1590-1914, edited by eileen and stephen yeo, 1981   **scapegoat** at the height of apartheid there were more black men in british jails than there were in jails in south africa. britain's mucky colonial past lives on, in the mistrust of anybody who isn't a whiter shade of pale - the state still institutionalises racism knowing that when the òblack ghettosó explode then white society can tell itself that its fear of òthe otheró is justified... +  ""there has always been racism. but it developed as a leading principle of thought and perception in the context of colonialism. that's understandable. when you have your boot on someone's neck, you have to justify it. the justification has to be their depravity. it's very striking to see this in the case of people who aren't very different from one another. take a look at the british conquest of ireland, the earliest of the western colonial conquests. it was described in the same terms as the conquest of africa. the irish were a different race. they weren't human. they weren't like us. we had to crush and destroy them. no. it has to do with conquest, with oppression. if you're robbing somebody, oppressing them, dictating their lives, it's a very rare person who can say: ""look, i'm a monster. i'm doing this for my own good."" even himmler didn't say that. a standard technique of belief formation goes along with oppression, whether it's throwing them in gas chambers or charging them too much at a corner store, or anything in between. the standard reaction is to say: 'it's their depravity. that's why i'm doing it. maybe i'm even doing them good.' if it's their depravity, there's got to be something about them that makes them different from me. what's different about them will be whatever you can find."" noam chomsky +  ""prejudice, which sees what it pleases, cannot see what is plain."" aubrey t. de vere +  ""detroit was almost as far north as we ever went, but it was still full of crackers and i was always uneasy. one night chuck peterson asked me to go with him to a little backstage bar on the corner and have a drink, but i didn't want to go for the same old reason. but he insisted, and so we did. in a matter of minutes some woman at the bar piped out that she wasn't going to drink in the place if that nigger stood there, making it clear she meant me. chuck wanted to answer back, but i talked him out of it and we went on to finish our drink. the next thing we knew a man came over and stared after chuck.

947554,"by tuesday the fourth of september, most of london had been swallowed up by the maw of hell. thomas farriner knew it was hellfire, because the tongue pierced st paul's cathedral and licked the clouds above it. he had seen the lead roof melt and run down the streets in a stream. he had seen the cobbled paving underneath glow red as a slapped cheek. all the while, the holy stones of st paul's fell about like some nightmarish raindrops, and those holy books inside the crypts burned.  if this was the work of the pope, why was he in hell?  as he sprinted along the south bank, thomas could still hear the whispers. *the pretender charles calls for tolerance, but he is no true godfearing king.* he ducked northward down an alley. *charles may be kin to proper catholics, but he only wars for wealth.* heart aching, he then faced the flickering half of the sky. *his clarendon code will be the death of us all, and the protestants will rise and cast us down.*  ""only honest young james can save england. james must be king,"" thomas said to no one. he wasn't quite convincing himself anymore, but it was far too late for doubts. the hand of the pope must not waver. as his old chest began to heave, he at least allowed himself to slow. london bridge was looming before him, crowned by wreaths of flame on both sides that piled up into blinding walls. in the middle had been created a black tunnel, and it beckoned to him.   he passed the street corner where his lovely little hanna had coughed blood for the first time, only last year. sickness had risen up from the earth so quickly. thomas's clenching stomach told him it was blasphemer charles to blame. everything sweet and savoury had been stolen away from him, and now ash caressed his mouth instead of dainty fingers. justice would be done. robert of rouen had given him a sword today, and he meant to use it.  from the southern end of the bridge, that awe-striking gate of the damned, one could feel the heat pressing down from all sides. the false king could not be far. thomas held his breath and ventured onto the stone above the river, back into the belly of his own creation.  inside, the roaring and crackling muddled together in a way that was equally soothing and suffocating, and voices could be heard from the shadows. ""be calm, my son,"" said they. was that his mother or his pope?   ""i'm scared.""  ""fear is a fire in the hearth of the will, mr. farriner.""  ""i'm weak.""  ""we are with you, and we will lend you strength.""  thomas came into a clearing, coughing and coughing like pale pretty hanna. the world smelled acrid, bitter, and burnt. mobs were chanting in the distance, but they were only lashing out at the dutch and the french in their confusion. after the fire hopped the fleet this morning, some foreign 'terrorists' had even been lynched. that wasn't his fault, though. that was the way of things. there was a window in the wall of heat, and thomas saw a figure right by the north bank. slim but leonine, the man's curly black hair was tied up comically above his head. the lion waded into the river, filled two buckets, then stumbled back onto land and cast them over the bases of the burning bridge. this had no effect. the lion waded into the river once more.   there was no gold to be seen, nor any robes adorning the silhouette, but thomas knew. dizzy, eyes watering, he took another deep breath of smoke and desperately ran headlong across the thames. the lion was alone for now, but he wouldn't be for long. he heard roaring become ever more furious, and skin began to sear and split. perhaps thomas would seem a giant roast dinner for a while, but no. that hellfire would melt bone, flesh, and steel. nothing would remain of him but the memories of a son, a daughter, and a frenchman. even the reputation of his bakery would be forever tainted, once the city found out.   then the north bank materialized around him, and cool air flushed out his sooty lungs. his skin was screaming. left. down, down, down. left, down, down. the coarse sand of the bank receded beneath his boots. there was the proud lion, a stone's throw away.  ""your sword,"" said robert - or was that hanna? the hilt was warm on his hip. thin charles stooped, then rose and pushed back his long mane. he spotted thomas, then waved and yelled. thomas walked over, boots crunching.  ""give us a hand, man."" the king tossed him a bucket. hoisting his own, his majesty sloshed toward the burning timbers of the bridge foundations. thomas looked down. a mighty hiss escaped behind him. the thames gave off a horrid stench. not long afterwards, a splashing heralded the king's return.   thomas was lost, and the voices were quiet. ""why are you doing this?""  king charles looked at him, incredulous. ""london's burning.""  for a while, thomas went back and forth with a bucket, nipping at the toes of his own great fire for reasons he did not quite understand. he was a righteous agent of the pope, and this was his moment. hundreds had conspired for this. any second now, he could plunge warm metal through that cold chest. he would be a hero. nothing happened, though. silently he laboured next to the king.   with every volley of brown water, thomas grew more profoundly tired. ""i'm sorry,"" he said to no one. the bucket dropped weakly from creaking fingers, and he made his way up toward london bridge. as he went, he unbuckled his sword belt and let it fall onto the shore. there was a crude fire grenade in a coat pocket; thomas dropped it, wincing as it plopped into the pebbles.  a man in finery passed him on the stairs. thomas didn't notice for long moments that this lion was young, with a longer nose. had those been tears streaming from his face? at the top of the staircase, thomas looked back to see james, duke of york, embrace his brother on the beach. charles clapped him on the shoulder with an air of certainty.  amongst the burning houses on the bridge, thomas felt almost comfortable now. he closed his eyes and waited for someone to speak to him, but he only saw flames dance and whirl behind his eyelids. faithful, he waited.   then, behind the whoosing, there was a whisper. ""london's burning. why aren't you?""  it was a good question. he certainly was not the pope's man. he wasn't charles's. he wouldn't even be a londoner, by tomorrow. no one would. thomas faced east, gazing past the blaze and toward the tower where gunpowder was stashed. once the lips of hell kissed it, everything would be over. he closed his eyes and backed into the wall of fire.  for an eternity of two seconds, he was pain incarnate. a white-hot limbo swallowed everything. then his eyes were ripped open by a thump on his chest, and the world lurched as he fell. first he saw the frown of an old lion, stern and scolding. after that, there was only the orange sky shuddering and tumbling.   by the time thomas farriner smacked the freezing filth of the thames, he felt almost clean.",0,

915656,"&gt;in the 20th century, this meant the atrocities of the jim crow south combined with the employment opportunities afforded by labor shortages in the industrial north. the combination led millions to leave the only world they knew for a new and uncertain life.   thomas sowell's research has shown that a lot of the things we would today perceive as racism can directly be traced back to the attitudes of the jim crow south.   while sowell is politically conservative, one mustn't ignore his historical work, as his research helps us set the stage for story of 20th century american race relations.   which is to say, that the first freemen (ex-slaves) picked up a number of cultural habits from the only other free people in the deep south - the white trash rednecks that we to look down on to this day.   his thesis argues (rather effectively, i might add) that a lot of these northern policies came about, not because the people who moved during the great migration were black, but rather because they brought much of the southern 'cracker culture' with them.  this even goes a long way toward explaining the animosity between darker and lighter skinned black americans. the ones who were lighter in skin tone had escaped slavery earlier, and had already integrated into northern society, meaning they spoke in the common tongue of the day.   while my white redneck ancestors would have insulted me for speaking in such a manner by calling it ""all sophisticated and faggy*,"" a black redneck of the period would accuse an eloquently spoken black person of ""talking white.""   the difference is only a superficial one - both of these attitudes stem directly from the south's general disdain for education.   (*faggy is a more modern version of whatever their insults would have been)  his books are filled with numerous examples from the era that suggest, **because the great migration brought so many black southerners to the north, the animus that the north held against the southern way of living became virtually indistinguishable from an animus against black people.**",1,

""mom... i..."" i paused, not sure where to go from them. *i am sorry?*, *i shouldn't have ran away?*, *i should have called?*  we stood like that for a few seconds, neither of us knowing how to break the uncomfortable silence. at last, her expression relaxed and she took a step towards me, opening her arms.  ""it's ok, david,"" she said. ""it's ok.""  it wasn't. i knew it was a lie, but it wouldn't hurt to go along with it. i hugged her. a short, almost formal hug. i was the first one to pull away.

""i was. but everyone went back home for thanksgiving,"" i replied. another lie. feathergirl would still be at the headquarters, just like bluebird. i could have stayed with them. they had even invited me to dinner, but i had refused.  ""how long are you staying? are you going back to them?""  i shrugged. ""i don't know yet... i have some unused vacation days... so i can stay some time around here, if you...""  she nodded. ""well, it's good to have you back, *sunshine.*""  i cringed. ""it's *sunshear*, mom.""  ""i still don't understand why you had to change your name. what was wrong about...""  i sighed. ""again? can't we just drop the name thing this time?""  she raised her hands. ""you are right, you are right... we can talk about that later."" she turned to glance at a passing bowl of sauce, then added some salt to it. ""why don't you go upstairs and leave the bag in your room?"" she said. ""you can have michael to help you.""  i turned around. a man in his sixties -michael?- was waiting patiently next to the stairs with a lost gaze, his face expressionless.  ""dad has a new puppet?"" i asked.  mom looked at me, alarmed. ""if you are thinking of freeing him...""  i shook my head. ""no, no. it's good,"" i said. i threw the bag at the man, who staggered when catching it. i started walking upstairs, michael following me.   i had tried to free one of dad's puppets before, back when i was a teenager. sheila, had been her name. turns out dad's control caused some strong withdrawal symptoms.  it hadn't gone well.  i paused before the door to my room, sighed, and opened it.  it looked... smaller than i remembered it. my bed still had the same dark blue cover. there were a couple of cardboard boxes in the corner, which i guessed contained the stuff that had been on the now empty shelves. my posters still covered the walls: the banner of the defense alliance. a picture of green ray. an illustration of the young london guard, the teenage superheroes posing over in front of a detained villain.  i looked at the largest of them, the picture of windmaker that covered the front of my closet. the hero was wearing his signature costume, watching over new york city. he looked strong and trustworthy, the kind of look you'd expect a hero to have.  i had met windmaker once, when he visited chicago to address the new crop of heroes. i tried to picture him frustrated over the paperwork, like i had been last week. i tried to imagine him wanting to punch a guy in the subway, like i had, just because he had been listening to obnoxious music on his phone's speaker.  i couldn't. some people had been born to be superheroes, i guessed. others like me... well...  i threw my coat on the bed, then told michael to leave the bag in the corner next to it. i turned to walk back downstairs.  i had tried, really tried. i had wanted to be a superhero, just like windmaker. i had moved to chicago and joined the alliance. i had trained with the likes of ironface and doleye. i had taken down villains and helped saved people. i still thought bluebird, feathergirl and me made a good team, our powers complementing each other.  but there was something missing. the thrill of the first days had vanished over time... and now... i sighed. i just felt empty inside.  my right shoulder erupted in flames and pain.  instincts kicked in, and my power formed a thick membrane of coalesced, solid light over my body, to protect me from the brunt of the explosion. still, it had caught me off guard. i crashed into the wall, then rolled down the stairs, my whole right side in pain.  i grunted as i jumped back on my feet, looking around to search for the menace. i paused.  there was someone by the front door. i saw the silhouette of a young woman, bathed in fire. the flames formed long, thin tentacles that emerged from her back and danced slowly in the air, pointed at me. ready to strike me again.  i recognized the silhouette from a hundred newspaper covers, tv reports, and online videos. she was one of the most infamous villains of my generation, a powerful master pyrokinetic with almost no regard for human life.  firewitch. my sister.  ""wait, i..."" i started, raising my hand, but she didn't let me finish. a tentacle of fire surged towards me, straight at my face. i spawned a shield of light in front of me, and the tentacle crashed into it, exploding into more flames and a rain of sparks. the sheer force of the impact made me take a step back. i heard mom scream something, but i couldn't parse the words before another flaming snake hit the shield, pushing me back to the floor.  ""lucy!"" i screamed. ""stop it!""  ""you don't get to call me lucy!"" her voice was distorted, coming both from her mouth as from the strings of flames surrounding her body.  a tentacle of fire wrapped around my leg, making its way upwards. the protective shielding around my body prevented it from burning me, but i could still feel the heat, the pain...  a sword of clear bright light materialized in my right hand. the sword wasn't heavy, yet i knew it was as solid as it could get. i cut my sister's fire tentacle with a single swing, the flames around my leg dissipating in mid air. i tried to find my footing back, but firewitch was unrelenting, throwing ball after ball of fire at me. i dodged one, blocked another with a well placed shield that disintegrated after taking the hit.  ""stop it!""  ""you left!"" she cried, her voice hoarse.  ""please lucy!""  a ball of fire crashed into my body. i clenched my jaw as i felt the pain and the heat.  ""fine!"" i shouted. i spawned a long, thin spear of light in my free hand, and threw it at her even before it had fully formed. she saw it coming and dodged it easily to the side, but the interruption of her onslaught gave me the time i needed to regain my footing.  two more firey tentacles shot my way, but i was expecting them now. i blocked one with a shield i just spawned in my left arm, then cut the other with the sword, advancing to flank firewitch.  ""you left!"" a massive, cracking wall of fire emerged out of my sister and advanced towards me, the flames licking the ceiling.  when had she learnt to do *that?*  i took a step back, weighing my options. i could create a light cocoon around me. that would protect me from the wall of fire, but put me in the defensive. maybe i should charge through it instead, using my...  ""enough!""  i paused. the powerful voice didn't come from my sister, i realized, nor from mom. it felt as if it had no point of origin, no source. as if it existed only within my head.  ...within my head.  *dad.*  **[too long, continues below]**",0,

446694,"i would direct you to the tremendous work ""the invention of the white race"" by ted allen. [here is a complete summary](http://clogic.eserver.org/1-2/allen.html) of that work.      racism relies on a confluence of power + prejudice, requiring both. not all ethnic prejudice is racism (which does not imply it's ok, just that it's not in power). for example, a black person's distaste for white people in the united states likely does not wield systemic apparatus of oppression, whereas white supremacy has hundreds of years of institutional weight. people of color can be racist toward one another, furthering those systems of oppression horizontally, but not racist against whites as white people are not categorically oppressed for their whiteness.      racism =/= all forms of bigotry. racism is a social theory a few hundred years old (or arguably, a few thousands years old) that describes ""races"". races are socially constructed categories of privileges and burdens superimposed over allegedly biological features.      for example, ancient egyptians described ""egyptians"", ""asiatics"", ""libyans"", and ""nubians""; when light-skinned people held power, light skin was divine and dark skin profane; when dark-skinned people held power, dark skin was divine and light skin profane. medieval europeans used the bible to classify ""semitic"" (asiatic), ""hamitic"" (african), and ""japhetic"" (indo-european) peoples. the french diploamat de gobineau became an early proponent of white supremacy in the 1800s, defining a ""black"", ""white"", and ""yellow"" race, with others adding ""red"" and ""brown"". thomas huxley saw ten different racial categories. the racist science of phrenology (1780-1960) defined a ""caucasian race"", ""mongloid race"", ""malay race"", ""negroid race"", ""american race"", ""australoid race"", and ""capoid race"". the nazis believed europeans had alpine, mediterranean, or nordic heredities, and turned the ""aryan"" from a historical discription of northern indian and indo-european migration patterns into a mythologized racial ideal complete with magical powers. the point here is that all of these racial ""sciences"" are bullshit, race is not a properly scientific description of biology: race is socially constructed, and racial groups cannot be biologically defined. people who believed they could calculate and measure skull shapes to show africans as inferior also believed shit like that there was an extinct and superior ""atlantean race"" that the ""lower races"" overthrew, explaining the lost civilization of atlantis. their sciences have been debunked, even though some dubious modern holdovers remain in medical sciences.      in many ancient cultures, physical features had psychological and moral qualities, often environmentally determined, but familial or tribal affiliation held more importance than an individual's physical appearance.  as per wikipedia, ""in many ancient civilizations, individuals with widely varying physical appearances became full members of a society by growing up within that society or by adopting that society's cultural norms."" ethnic oppression could certainly exist, but ""white people"" as a category were not yet a thing really.      “when the first africans arrived in virginia in 1619, there were no ‘white’ people there; nor, according to the colonial records, would there be for another sixty years.” — theodore w. allen      race theory is a specific theory of human ethnicity. the modern notion of a ""white race"" originates to a large extent [on anglo-american plantation colonies following the bacon rebellion in the united states](https://medium.com/message/how-white-people-got-made-6eeb076ade42#.drgi30oed). angry colonists of various backgrounds rebelled against colonial authorities for not exterminating the native americans from virginia fast enough. whites and blacks, who did not disidentify with one another, both took part. in response, colonial authorities made the racial caste of slavery rigid to divide ""whites"" from ""blacks"" to quell uprisings, passing the virginia slave codes of 1705. instances like these are the primary origins of *legal* definitions of race in the modern era. at times like this, the anglo-dominated media considered irish as african, and thus more fit for servitude; only later did the irish ""become white"". we can see the socially-constructed nature of race there. whites gained  significant advantages in property ownership and rights over people of color as the privileges of ""whiteness"" entitled them to, but nevertheless many remained poor and landless. the effect however was to give poor whites allegiance to rich whites instead of poor people of all backgrounds, and it worked. likewise, ""blackness"" arose and collapsed distinctions between many african peoples who earlier categorists (including africans themselves) saw as quite distinct, conferring numerous burdens, especially that of enslavement. race theory at the time proposed with the ""one-drop rule"" a legal basis by which anyone with even one black ancestor would be classified as black; the concept evolved over the 19th century and became codified into law in the 20th century.      james baldwin:   &gt;""america became white — the people who, as they claim, ‘settled’ the country became white — because of the necessity of denying the black presence, and justifying the black subjugation. no community can be based on such a principle — or, in other words, no community can be established on so genocidal a lie. white men from norway, for example, where they were norwegians — became white: by slaughtering the cattle, poisoning the well, torching the houses, massacring native americans, raping black women… because they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers.""      at root, the development of capitalism in the americas relied upon racial systems for dividing laborers amongst one another, and creating unities between poor and rich colonizers. capitalism relied upon a system of white supremacy for justification and for stability. the genocide, slavery, and exploitation of millions, that built an engine of plutocracy and profiteering, depended absolutely on an ideology of subjugation whose logic was race.",1,

647276,"“i don’t want to hear another one of your ‘feel-good’, ‘picker-upper’ pep talks. it’s over. and if i’m going down, i’m taking all of you with me.”  his voice was a hollow shell of what it used to be. the laughter, the spunk, the curiosity and drive. all of it had drained out of his vocal cords like the juice from a dead battery, leaving an automated, rehearsed robot in its place. my mind grappled with the thought, struggled to comprehend what i was hearing.  the individual sitting in the co-pilot chair on the other side of the sealed cockpit door was hollow and soulless, akin to the crudely built lego armies frequently scattered across his kitchen floor when i came to visit. he was not my friend. my friend had long vacated the premises.  if you’ve ever worked in aviation, you know the single most important part of the job is to keep the passengers safe, happy, and yes, even oblivious. which meant none of the 217 blissfully unaware passengers in the main cabin could catch even an inkling of the negotiations taking place this very moment, until there was absolutely no other option.  running a shaky hand over my damp forehead and heaving a muffled sigh, i attempted to straighten up and relay orders to the crew.  “go ahead and take drink orders. smile and make conversation no matter how trite. then stand by the main door and wait for further instruction.”  the two head flight attendants nodded briskly, having only a vague idea of the severity of the situation, but enough to be on edge and hearken back to their emergency training.  the intercom buzzed again.  “did you hear me? i said-”  ah, there it was. he always did have to have some validation in order to play his little games. he knew i was feeding into this. i couldn’t let him have that advantage.  “i heard you. now i want you to hear me. what happened does in no way, shape, or form make you any less worthy as a person, or diminish your value as a human being. you had no choice in the matter, hell, you weren’t even aware of what was going on until after the fact. to blame yourself would be madness and even worse, minimizing the responsibility of the perpetrators. so unlock this damn door, let’s talk about this face-to-face like grown ass men, and ultimately get this plane to its destination without losing both our jobs.”  silence. damn it, damn it, damn it!  “sir?” one of the flight attendants poked her head around the side of the doorway.  “what now?” i snapped, then immediately softened my tone. “is everything all right?”  “we have a few passengers inquiring as to the shakiness of the flight and the absence of a relevant announcement.”  “just make some statement about light turbulence. tell the others to stand by.”  “yes, sir.”  “you had this planned out for me from the start,” came his crackly voice over our cockpit intercom again.  “what?!” i turned back to the door. “you cannot be serious! i’ve done nothing for our entire run but try to help and support you!”  “you planted lies in her head. even while we were in the training program together, you were whispering things to her behind my back. then when we started flying together, you pretended to be radioing headquarters but really you were keeping in contact with her. you think i don’t know?!”  he was out of his mind. this was even more serious than i’d originally anticipated. slowly, i took a deep breath and kept my voice low. “man, you’ve gotta come back to me here. you know that’s not true-”  “it is!! it is true! she never loved me, she only wanted you! i did everything for her! i bought her our dream home, we traveled the world, we had our children and our wealth and utmost safety and security, but at the end of the day all she dreamt about at night while lying next to me, was being with you!” his voice was getting shakier. that either meant he was about to break down and let this go, or do something really drastic. we didn’t have much time.  “man, meet me halfway here. i never touched her. she did love you, but you were so emotionally distant from her and the kids, what did you expect? look, i know you’ve had a tough time of it. you don’t trust me or anyone else and you never have. you never trusted her and look where it got you. but just because of what happened with your dad, just because of that group of bullies in gym class, just because of your brother running off the way he did, just because of you failing out of pharmacy school and feeling like you crushed everybody’s expectations, all that doesn’t mean shit in this moment. this is what’s happening now, and this is what matters. those 217 lives out there, they matter now. not your dad, not some fuckers in school, not grades, not anything. what matters now is you being better than the hand life has dealt you, and here is your chance to improve your circumstances and rise above everybody else you’ve spent so much time hating. now do i need to break down this door and get a bunch of people riled and upset, or are you going to stand up and be the man you’ve always wanted everyone else to be?”  i expected silence after my long soliloquy, but instead came a barely audible whisper: “you just don’t get it. you never will….”  i spun around to my expectant and pale-faced flight crew and gave a slight nod. they immediately sprung into action. the plane became overwrought with whimpers, frantic questions, screaming, the sounds of heavy footsteps stumbling up and down the aisle as the loyal flight attendants instructed everyone to fit themselves with their life jackets and strap on their oxygen masks. and here i was, still pressed against this steel door, hoping my long lost friend would throw me a line.  “man, do you remember that first time we went parasailing together?” i spoke feebly into the intercom, trying to block out the panicked cacophony just outside the other doorway.  “what about it?” his voice was back to being hollow, flat.  “remember how significant it was for us because it was in that moment, the moment we found ourselves gliding far above every other creature with just the air and eachother to lean on, that we knew this was what we were meant to do. we were meant to command these skies, not fall victim to them.”  “your fancy verbiage means nothing to me. and it was the day *you* decided this was what you wanted to do. i just followed along with you, like i always have.”  “you know that’s not true. when i was homeless and eating out of garbage cans, your family took me in. i was leaning on *you*. when i got stranded on that cross country road trip with just a tire jack and a pack of peanut butter crackers, you drove out 600 miles to where i was, and i leaned on *you* every mile of that journey. when i was discharged from basic training after that spat with the asshole officer, going parasailing for the weekend was *your* idea to get our minds off things. i leaned on *you* for emotional support. what about the time when the police raided my shitty apartment looking for the drugs you know i was using at the time, and you warned me and came a half hour earlier to smuggle them out? my entire claim to freedom has lain on *you* since that day, *10 years ago*. that was the lowest low in my life and you never thought twice about helping me. so don’t you ever try to pull one over on me and say this has always been about me leading because from where i stand, i’m pretty damn sure we wouldn’t be here today if you hadn’t known which way was up.”  “-but you were always your own person, man!! my identity rested on everybody else in my life, except *me*! i did what i was supposed to do, i shut up, took orders, and sat down. no matter what happened, you were *you* at the end of the day, and i was an extension of everybody else!”  i groaned in audible frustration. “man, just open this damn door and let’s *talk* about this! why are you so afraid to talk face to face?!”  “it’s not about being face-to-face. with you or anybody else. look, i need to do something that will make me feel remembered and notable and cement my place in people’s brains. if it ends up being “the crazy hijacker”, well at least i’ll still be known. db cooper did it. see, all my life i could never ‘be somebody’. you were the dirt poor street rat but you were still ‘somebody’, while i was the privileged, posh white kid who always went anonymous. hell, i wasn’t even notable to my wife or my kids. so i’m changing that today. i-”",0,

635752,"**horsemen** (*setting inspired by london and the ""horses of helios""-statue*)   it is a perfect day to die.   death walks ahead of his siblings, leading the way through a hurricane of people. a large coca-cola sign blinks on the billboard, colouring the streets bright red. double-deckers roam the streets faster than what could possibly be safe and pigeons scavenge for food on the filthy streets. when death walks by, the pigeons scatter, leaving their crumbs and half-eaten chips behind without hesitation. his haggard face widens as he smiles, leaving a black slit between his nose and jaw.   no one returns his smile.   famine follows close behind and the pigeons throw themselves over their food again when he passes them. people grip their stomachs as if they’re about to drop them and the smell of food in the street grows heavier. famine can hear the rumble of their stomachs, feel the saliva in their mouths, how they long for something they do not have. the epitome of humans. he pulls a hand through his thinning hair, adjusts his collar and pauses his hand on his necklace. the weights on his scale feel even, but that will soon change.   third in line, a good distance behind the rest, comes pestilence. his breath smells of garbage sitting in the sun for too long, clammy and rotten. for every human that looks at him, his grin grows bigger, revealing yellowing teeth cornered by black gums. they are jealous of his bow and crown, he knows it. what they do not know is that his bow and crown are made out of human bones, and that right now, his bow is missing a few pieces. a hoarse laughter escapes his throat.   at the very end, even further behind his brothers, so far behind it could seem he does not know the rest of them, strides war. nothing about his appearance reveals him: where his brothers are dark, he is graceful; where they are dreadful, he is beautiful.   but they are all the same inside. the chaos of the universe is roaring within them.  war enjoys the sweat of a fight, the crashing thoughts exploding in a final collision, the burnt smell of adrenaline and anger. he can taste the blood of every wound cut open, a sweet metallic substance spreading inside his mouth. as he strides past the tourists, he points his sword at a few, winking at them as they drop their bags and break into fights, one after another. blood splatters at his feet, skulls crush to the ground and the screams get louder with each step he takes. someone tries to jump at him, their fist inches from his face when he stops it. his nostrils flare, his mouth spreads into a grin.   he cocks an eyebrow: “come on. i dare you.”   then he lets go of their hand and waits. hopes. but the human runs away.   war sighs, but is not dissatisfied.  this is just the beginning.   only death knows where they are heading. it has been centuries since he last was here. a lot has changed; they have more luxuries now, all this materialism, controlled by capitalism and delicate reputations. all this mindless shopping leaves a hole in them, gaping and dark, always wanting more. did he spark this darkness in them? maybe.   the world was thrown off balance a long time ago and it never recovered. no matter how hard the brothers tries to repair it, something always ruins the equilibrium. they have tried to swallow the truth, only to cough up squares of bricks that will not go down. their throats are sore from disappointment.   death listens to the chaos behind him, feels a reverberating thump in his bones for each fallen body, tastes their despair all over his tongue, but he keeps moving. they are almost there. first he sees the statue of eros hovering above them all, pointing his arrow but never able to release the love. maybe the world would be different if he could. death walks past eros and he can see the fountain. “horses of helios” was the name he chose, tricking humans into thinking it was merely a statue decorating the fountain underneath. tourists are standing around it to drop a penny to make their wishes come true. then, as he sees the rest of the fountain, a weak pull goes through him, tugging him closer.   “brothers.” his voice is shallow, almost as if he is talking through a wall.    his brothers gather around him. most of the tourists run away, and the rest of them jump at each other’s throats when war walks up.   the horses stand just as death left them: trying to gallop away from the prison he put them in; their bodies twisted in panic, their muscles rip through every inch of their bodies.   “i cannot fathom why we did this,” war says in a voice so powerful it echoes even though there are no walls. “we should have ended this aeons ago.”    “indeed.” pestilence slides his tongue over his teeth, making a hissing sound.   famine takes a step forward, his hefty arm reaching for one of the four horses. for a moment he must breathe deeply to refrain from saying something he will regret. they were all a part of this plan, no matter how much he disliked it. it had to be done to save the humans. he does not dwell on the fact that their plan did not work.   “do you want your horses or not?” death shoots them all a glance, his hazy irises so white they can barely be seen.  his brothers shut their mouths, yet he can see the lingering stares they send their horses. he understands. he has missed them, too. when death releases them, there is no turning back and they know that. the horses are hungry, they want blood and flesh, and they shall get it.   death touches the statue to start the process, his veins pop up out like blue snakes in a white desert, his jaw so tense it threatens to rip through his skin. seconds later, the hard, black layer of stone starts to peel away from the horses, revealing their working muscles and frantic eyes.   pestilence’s white horse is the first to roam free, followed by war’s bright red horse. famine’s black horse runs after them, and death’s horse, light green and pale, is the last to escape. at first it seems the horses want to run away, but they come when their owners call on them. they mount their horses and gaze at the mess they have to clean up. the time has come.   “go forth,” death says, patting his horse’s thin neck. “feast.”",0,

""this guy is all bark and no bite. just don't let him spook you, got it?""  mako wasn't listening. sitting in the corner of the makeshift ""backstage"" where the combatants hung out before they went out to be pummeled, mako was burying her face in a plateful of breaded croquettes - a little pick-me-up her mom had gotten her. the croquettes were trying to scurry away. obviously they'd been undercooked a little. ""mmmnnmmff,"" mako eloquently replied, ""mnnf ffffffmmmm.""  coach celo phane tapped her on the noggin. ""i get that you've got to get your strength up, but i've got a little surprise for you. come on, you can have all the croquettes you want afterwards."" he lifted her up by the collar of her shirt and pushed her out the door. ""the crowd's out there waiting. just do the bit and look tough. i'll make you shine out there, i guarantee it.""  mako steeled her glare as she walked with purpose to the arena. she was not even slightly afraid, even after she got a decent look at her opponent. he was a towering creature, at least two feet taller than mako, with a toothy maw and sightless eyes. it waved at her when she hopped into the ring. she waved back.  *alright, mankanshoku! you can do this! you've seen mom and dad wrestling before, you've got the basics pretty much sewn up. all you have to do is hold him down. then... what do i do next? do i have to apologize to him?*  ""i hope you've made peace with god, little girl,"" the creature hissed, ""because we're going to send you home in pieces.""  ""you too!"" mako beamed.  suddenly, from out of nowhere, a massive white wardrobe was thrown into the ring. mako looked back to see coach phane wildly gesticulating towards the wardrobe.  *okay, i think i've got it! he wants me to get into the closet and hide there. this guy is a good coach to look out for my well-being like that!*  mako leapt into the wardrobe. immediately the wrestling ring was shrouded by a white fog. [the heroine appeared](http://gfycat.com/bronzewelcomealaskanmalamute). ""fight club spec. two-star goku uniform... fight club president mako mankanshoku!"" it was like slipping your hand into an old glove only to discover that it still fit perfectly. mako wasn't sure how her coach had repossessed the uniform after her rank was stripped by athletics club chair sanageyama, but if mako wouldn't question trails of cheese lying on the ground, she wasn't about to question this kind of generosity.  venom just scowled. a fancy costume change wouldn't change his perspective on what was in front of him, which was a teenage girl.  with the special effects out of the way, the bell was rung. faster than the human eye could detect, the fighters crossed the ring and met each other's fists in the middle. mako grabbed venom's head with one arm of her uniform and slammed his face into her wooden sandal. he ignored the pain and unfurled his tendrils. every individual organic thread jabbed and prodded at mako's uniform like syringes. not good enough - the durability of the fight club spec. uniform meant it could not be rended so easily.  mako slipped one hand into her coat and pulled out a spiked baseball bat. ""say your prayers!"" she yelled, and swung for venom's neck. he was startled by her speed, and got hit more times than he would like. the golden nails tore at his neck, uncomfortably close to vital areas. after tiring of batting venom around, mako pushed the blunt end of the bat into his stomach. mako grimaced as she fired the missile, the impact sending venom back into the ropes. the flimsy things snapped easily. they must have spent the whole budget on getting that fight club uniform. he leaped back up to fight.  mako pushed off of the ropes and countered him with a golden pipe wrench to the jaw. that got him good. mako got on top of venom and pinned his arms down with her uniform's two massive arms. he shrieked, tendrils racing over mako's body, wrapping around her neck, but mako still held fast. the pressure on his upper arms was increasing, venom realized that if they kept this up, the girl might accidentally sever his limbs. he finally relented, tapping out with one fist. mako pushed him out of the ring with her foot.  the prize, a small suitcase, hung above the arena on a metal chain. mako puzzled for a moment over how to reach the suitcase, before noticing a ladder on the ground. ingeniously putting two and two together, she deduced that the ladder could be used to reach the suitcase. in a split second the ladder was propped up and mako was on top. she snapped the chain with her hands and opened the suitcase. a diminutive glass ball with shimmering colors inside was the cargo.  mako, easily attracted to shiny objects, touched the ball. it was as if an electric current ran down her arm and directly into her mind. she could see something. it was like... a backyard barbecue. her, ryuko, satsuki, gamagoori and several other people she couldn't quite remember the names of were all there, having fun. even nui and ragyo, and ryuko's dad isshin, alive, all laughing and talking like old friends. no pain, no tears. she knew this was the world she could create if she just broke the orb. she shattered it, and disappeared into a cloud of smoke.",0,

851399,"title: wander  genres: coming of age/urban/mood piece  word count: 1241  ***  he steps off of the bus and the first thing he notices is the smell.  it's not so bad, really; gasoline and fast food, body odour and uncollected garbage wafts from every direction. busy smells. he smiles.  the station is full to bursting, people around him bustling to and fro, some with bags in their hands, others with strollers, but most like him; empty handed, pockets filled. heads high. eyes searching.  red hair, black hair, brown hair, long, short, frizzy and bald; a forest of heads around him. some look at him as they pass; most don't. he smiles when he realises he recognises absolutely none of them.  someone behind him yells at him to move - he takes a few steps forward and then goes back to being still, watching the flow of humanity around him. their thoughts and feelings flow over him, dreams and fears blending within their actions; the tapping of screens, rapping of fingers along thighs, the click and clops of feet against pavement, quick and slow, syncopated unity.  it is a place to be lost in. his smile has faded but now it rises again, a small thing on thin lips. he had arrived. he is exactly where he wants to be.  a neon sign on the side of station shouts out its message in capitals punctuated by exclamations; $6 foot long sub... free coffee with every purchase... ready when you are! 24 hour service!  his stomach growls at the thought of food, but he tells it to hush. there are crackers in his bag, a full pack. there will be time for food later. for now... for now, he stands and stares.  the station is made of a grey brick and green metal. upon squinting he can make out some rust but no graffiti; old but respectable, then. the busses are a much newer model, and smiling, he remembers the ride. warm and soft seats, little curtains on the windows and a magazine in the pouch in front of him; fashion today. some of the editorials had been pretty good.  the crowd around him is beginning to thin. there can only be so much motion on a day as chilly as this; a young woman smiles at him as she passes, hands rubbing over each-other, finding warmth in their friction. he is not sure if he returns the smile; his lips are beginning to go numb, his eyes beginning to water. the wind is soft and dry on his skin, tussling his hair, flushing his cheeks. the feeling in his face fades.  something bumps into him from behind, causing him to take a step forward - he looks back, and takes a further step when he sees an older man, dark glasses and thin white cane, muttering what sounds like an apology and tapping the case on the pavement.  broken out of his reverie, he heads for the station. now that there are fewer people, he realises that everyone has their hands in their pockets. not cold enough for gloves, perhaps, but cold enough for corduroy.  it is warm inside the station. when the automatic whoosh open, a draft blows down from above, heated air a gentle roar around him, warning his up immediately.  gray seats arranged in stocky rows sit dozens of the other from outside, on phones or laptops, reading newspaper or staring straight ahead, outside, at the ceiling, at anywhere but each other. a surprise; there is exactly one seat left, right by the edge of a row, and it is by the window. he goes over to it and sits down, watches the buses come and go. they are so big, so long, but always manage to squeeze past each other and into their spaces, never touching, never braking suddenly. they arrive and depart like the tickings of a clock, oiled yet jerking, smooth yet sudden. the drivers inside must be bored or very focused; their mechanical grace speaks of either concentration of nature.  this goes on for some time, the silent regard of the busses, until his stomach tumbled once more. he frowns and turns back to the interior of the station, craning his neck to see if - yes, a bar, over there. he gets up and heads over, rolling his neck as he does; it had gone sore with so much staring.  the display is very bright, words in red and background yellow, foodstuffs saturated to excess, the pancakes as bright as banners and the salad a vibrant mint. he reads over these items for a few more moments, swimming over their prices, aware of the short like in front him getting shorter until it is his turn. the woman behind the counter is short and wears a red apron with ""billy cafe"" printed on it in what looks like comic sans. he smiles at her and asks for a glass of water, and when she asks him to speak up, he stutters and asks again, a few decibels higher. she raises an eyebrow but goes to the back and comes back a few seconds later with a styrofoam cup. she sets the cup at the counter, already on to the next customer before he can thank her. he takes the cup, grateful at its warmth, and a first gulp confirms this; its heat spreads inside of him, travelling through his legs and into his fingertips, warming places the air could not.  back at to the seat now. he sets the water at the window's ledge and bends to his backpack, passing one hand over its worn black straps as the other unzips a side pocket, taking out a half-empty wrap of crackers secured by a rubber band. he owns this and turns back to the window, placing one cracker in his mouth and closing his lips slowly. it is subtle and salty and delicious, followed by the water that now, cooled, tastes slightly metallic. his jae works quietly over these meagre calories as outside the busses continue to enter, wait and the leave. the crackers crunch and then mush as he chews, swallow easily with every sip of water. soon, the bag is empty and his stomach no longer protests. he gets up and both the bag and the cup into a garage bin. there is no recycling.  when he leaves the bus station, it had gotten significantly darker. the streetlights are not on yet but the clouds above have made the world grader than it should be - or maybe that is just the palette of the place. gray streets and grey buildings and people made grey beneath a sun hidden by brooding clouds.  he chooses a direction and starts walking. it takes him to an up-sloping road, cement and sidewalk and storm drains on every corner, until he reaches the very top of this city.  although they are not nearly as crowded as the station had been, there are still quite a few people on the sidewalks; families and couples, loud gaggles of college students and roaming groups of young men.  it is all so new to him and yet so instantly familiar. he feels alone, so alone in this place, and yet somehow connected, somehow a part of it all. what’s past is swept away; what’s coming is fresh and waiting. he is a wanderer. a wonderer. a turning gear in this whirling urban organism – a rainbow in a hurricane. solitary union. singular harmony.",0,
315260,"well matt, i have been playing for going on 4 decades now.  first started playing with folks at the dorm with the white box when i got to college in 1975.  spent many many hours and days playing in those days.    formed a tight crew of friends in those games and i still play every month with some of them, going on 40 years later.  back in the early days we would play multiple times a week, and even after we graduated we played pretty much every week, for most of either sat or sun.  often would game other games various nights of the week.  our games almost always had a mix of men and women in them, which served us well.    over the years we have had at least four married couples play at various times.  even had some campaigns with two generations as a some of the kids would join in once they were old enough to understand the rules and play.  the kids have all moved off to college or more at this point, but our group of 50 somethings still enjoy the sessions (usually a long saturday afternoon to late night session).  most of us began with d&amp;d, moved on thru all the iterations up to 3.5 but generally balked at 4.0 and never took it up, happy to stick with 3.5.  so we never really bothered with 5 either since our group has long ago mastered the nuances of 3.5 and all its quirks.  along the way we played runequest, chivalry and sorcery (the absolute most densely typed ruleset ever), thieves guild, tunnels and trolls and many homebrew campaigns and some homebrew complete systems.      brief excursions with traveler, metamorphosis alpha, and a couple of one off sessions with really wacky systems (one based on professional wrestling where you earned fap points (fan appeal points) to go up levels).  along the years we have had three of us act as dm's for extended periods of time, sometimes running multiple campaigns at the same time, just alternating who was dm'ing each weekend or month.  it was always fun to view the differences in dm styles and how that affected character choice and play style.  by now each of us has dm'ed hundreds and hundreds of sessions.  so i well know how it feels on both sides of the screen.  one dm was really into world building and politics and you knew that it would be important to not ignore interaction skills.  another loved creating combat situations, and cool foes to encounter and fight, and did not deal with politics or social situations that much.  i would like to think i fell somewhere between those two.    we all tend to create our own worlds and often mythos, but freely use various published scenarios adapted / modified for the game.  almost had to when running weekly for 6-8 hour sessions.  not enough time to create that much materials from whole cloth, so i am rather impressed with how much you are able to present and prepare for each week (although part of me also thinks you have a great ability to improvise on the fly when the pc's take all those unexpected turns on you.)  while the other two dm's have a few personal minis, that has been my special focus since we began.  i raided my ho gauge model train layout for folks (people) and animals back in the 70's, a civil war set with blue and gray soldiers, soon filling a tackle box with minis before there really were much in the way of d&amp;d themed minis.  i recall a set of ho gauge pigs being used to represent giant centipedes and soon being called by one and all centipigs.   once lead came out in the area, i got in and soon had many 100's of painted minis, and would tailor many to match pc's in the games.   when wizards came out with the prepainted plastic minis (ddm) over a decade ago, i jumped on that big time and have thousands and thousands of those little dudes.  (i have even sold off a lot  of my surplus/duplicates to a couple of the internet gaming stores you mentioned elsewhere as being where you sometimes shop for yours: troll and toad, strikezone, auggies.  so i can always pretend that some of the minis you put on the game table on critical role once graced my own tables.)  my wife (who is currently playing a level 10 spirit shaman so our game closely matches the kind of encounters we see each week) and i were early viewers of g&amp;s and were real excited to see critical role on the schedule and subbed soon there after.  it is must see viewing each week.    dang, it is thursday, but something is missing....",0,
561195,"if your priority is size, the rx100 is probably the best when it comes to 1 inch sensor cameras.  it does good with video too.  you can save money by buying an older model rather than the latest.  if you want to move up to aps-c size sensors, the fuji x70 is probably the smallest, but it has a fixed lens, no zoom.  in my opinion those are the best cameras if the priority is pocketablity, quality, and manual controls.   aside from near taipei main station, if you go to this intersection here, you'll see camera shops in all four directions. https://goo.gl/maps/wg4fhcpuua32   if you're trying to save money, depending on the model of camera you're buying, sometimes the shop owner can import a ""grey market"" version for you, meaning it's usually imported from a different region and that shop, not the manufacturer will extend a warranty to you.  but once the warranty is over, or you leave the city/country, you're pretty much on your own when it comes to repairs.  i've done this before when the savings are significant.  the store sticks their own warranty sticker on the camera.   electronics aren't usually cheaper than in other countries.  i remember buying a camera lens from amazon's international shipping store.  after shipping and import duties, it was still cheaper than buying locally.     generally if you're buying a new domestic model, they won't budge on the price very much, but rather you might be able to talk them into throwing in a memory card, extra third party battery, uv filter, or screen protector, etc.   if you're buying a second hand camera, then you have more room to haggle.  unless you're buying a leica, most other camera brands generally depreciate as time goes on so they'd rather move these units.  the biggest used camera stores are near guanghua digital plaza.   there's also a website where people post ads to sell their used camera gear.  it goes without saying that all the ads are posted by locals so your ability communicate in chinese would be key.  http://www.dcview.com.tw/dcbid/flealist.asp",0,

414220,"this is my first post on reddit ever. thanks to /u/luna_lovewell for inspiring me to write this. note: adult (probably pg-13 level) content.  ---- part 1 of 3:   i died as i lived. in my fantasies, that meant dying during a drug-fueled orgy featuring the love(s) of my life, plus several attractive models and athletes of various genders. in reality, that meant that after a long day staring at a computer screen at work, i went home and had a massive heart attack while playing civilization v.  did i have any regrets? too many to count.   upon arrival in heaven, i found myself filled with joy and the spirit of the lord. i was here! in life i had never quite been able to believe in god, or any other gods, for that matter. i had feared that, in death, we would simply cease to exist (or, when i was being optimistic, that we would become one with nature, or the life force of the planet). i had always meant to ask other atheists and agnostics how they dealt with this fear, but i had never gotten around to doing so--like so many other things.  but now i was in heaven--heaven, even! standing upon what appeared to be a cloud, the ""pearly"" gates gleamed and glimmered in all the colors of the rainbow, with a silvery, opalescent shine. below them stood an tall old man. he wore a white robe and leather thong sandals, and carried a shepherd's crook. his hair and beard gleamed silvery white. he nodded at me and smiled. ""welcome, my child. you have traveled far."" i could feel his voice in my very bones, as if no ears were necessary to hear it. it was deep, rich, and velvety--laden with supernatural authority. after a moment, i realized that i had heard this voice many times before.  ""god?"" i asked. he nodded. ""why do you sound like morgan freeman?""  his laugh was rich, and boomed like distant thunder. ""my sweet child, although you are as clever as any of my creations, no human can witness my true splendor. you simply see the parts of me which you expect to see. i appear in this fashion to many souls from your era.  ""so, you're saying, 'this isn't even your final form?'""  ""humor. a common response to fear.""  ""perhaps i would be less afraid if you were less intimidating and old testament-patriarchal?"" at this, god's form began to change, becoming slender and nearly naked, and bearing a strong resemblance to a certain female musician. as she began to speak, i realized that her voice had softened, as well.  ""all i really want is to make you feel welcome, my child. however, as you ought to know, more dogmatic individuals than you would find the suggestion that i would take this form to be deeply offensive. ironic, is it not?""  i nodded, and put one hand in my pocket, feeling far more at ease. ""perfect. thank you."" as i said this, my fingers touched a metal object that i had not noticed before. i pulled a shining silver key from my pocket.   ""come forth and enter, for yours in the kingdom of heaven."" she gestured to the ornate lock at the center of the pearly gates.   i inserted the key into the lock, turned it, and was rewarded with a deeply-satisfying click. the gates swung open, and then gradually dissolved. we now stood upon a great grassy meadow, bounded by tall hedgerows. it was dotted with trees bearing all manner of fruit, under which lay rocks in the shape of tables and benches deeply-cushioned with emerald moss. birdsong drifted over us on a gentle wind.  god gestured expansively, ""in the early days of the universe, my rules were harsh. in time, however, i realized that forbidding certain fruits only encourages many of my children to partake of them. in this garden, you may sample the fruits of knowledge as often as you wish. in heaven, the peace of god will always be with you,"" she smiled, ""and also with your spirit.""  i nodded, feeling a sense of peace wash over me. ""this is wonderful, but i see no other people.""  ""yes. this is the oldest part of heaven. it is now perhaps more of a lobby than a true dwelling place for souls. nonetheless, it is still enjoyed by many."" she gestured behind me as she spoke. i turned and saw in the distance a large party of men and women in regency-era attire picnicking beneath an ancient oak. some laughed and drank wine, while others simply lay in the grass reading and making an occasional comment to their companions.  god continued, ""after creating this first part of heaven, i realized that many of my aims were at odds with one another. original sin was a product of this. instilling my children with both earthly desires and free will meant that few, other than infants, could live a sinless life. when my children began to join me here, i was faced with a choice: remove the earthly desires that led to their sinning--essentially making emotionless angels out of men--or simply accept my children as they were. my love for my children led me to choose the latter. i love all of my children, sinners though they may be."" her smile was like unto a sunrise.  i cleared my throat--an act which seemed like it should have been unnecessary in heaven. ""but what about people who have committed grave or cardinal sins, or those whom we might call 'evil.' does hitler have a place in heaven?""  ""for some sinners, i have undertaken rehabilitation programs with . . . varying degrees of success. given time, however, even these children will come to understand the error of their ways."" she began to walk toward one of the hedgerows that bounded the great meadow. ""for my children of what you call the 'modern' era, i have devised six circles of heaven. each circle represents the range of sins and misdeeds which my children have committed, as well as their virtues. some sinners are assigned a dwelling place within a given circle. others, like you, are guilty of a variety of lesser, venal sins--for which i forgive you--and are permitted to choose your place of dwelling. all are permitted to travel between these circles, or to the garden,"" she gestured to the meadow behind us, ""but are returned to their own dwelling each night.""  this surprised me. ""a curfew? but why?""  ""while i wish to provide all of my children with their fill of both earthly and heavenly delights, in doing so, it is my desire to gradually free you all from sin without affecting your free will. your circle and your dwelling are designed to help you in that process. shall we examine your choices?""  i nodded, still awed by her presence, but feeling increasingly wary, as well.  ""good. although the choice is yours, i believe that this first circle may be the best fit for you."" god led me to a gap between two hedgerows. atop two cigar-shaped pillars, stood an arch that appeared to have been wrought from stainless steel. the shining words appeared to be in every language at once. after a moment looking at them, i squeezed my eyes shut against the sensory overload. behind my eyelids, i could still read the after-image of the words: ""tomorrow land.""   god placed her hand on my shoulder, and the pain lifted. ""the ur-language of babel. you may now read and speak it without further discomfort."" when i opened my eyes again, i saw the the pillars were made in the form of stylized rockets. god gestured, and we stepped through the arch . . . finding ourselves in another garden. before us stood a massive iron-and-glass building twenty stories high, and nearly a mile in length. there were full-size trees and entire streets and ""outdoor"" markets within the greenhouse-like building, and i could make out people in a various styles of dress strolling on balconies and catwalks on the upper levels.   ""the crystal palace,"" god said. ""built in london for the great exhibition of 1851--though this version is somewhat larger than the original.""  ""but i thought this circle would be about the future.""  ""it is. or rather, it is about the future as my children from the modern era saw it."" without having noticed any transition, i realized that had entered the palace and were now walking down the grand promenade. the other pedestrians were dressed in clothes ranging from the revolutionary-era (american or french--i wasn't a fashion historian) to bizarre styles that must have been created decades after i was born. still others wore garb more appropriate for a steampunk novel or a science fiction convention. despite god's presence, they seemed to take little notice of us.  i cleared my throat again. ""please forgive me if this question is impertinent, but what does all of this have to do with sin?""   god smiled softly--a candle to her earlier sunrise. as if on cue, we passed a victorian brothel doing a booming trade. next door was a raucous tavern advertising gin distilled on-site. most patrons drank from large crystal tumblers, while a few were engaged in a fistfight that seemed on the verge of spreading to the neighboring establishments--which consisted of an ale house (""sunday roast served daily!""), a cheese shop (""toutes les fromages europeens!""), and the aforementioned brothel (""people of every preference welcome! expert massages and napping areas available!"").   we turned a corner and the noise dimmed. god said, ""it is very rare indeed for one of my children to commit only one type of sin. it is common, however, for all of my children to want that which they cannot have. for this reason, you might argue that envy lies at the heart of all sins.""  ""not pride?"" i asked.  she shook her head, ""pride is another matter altogether.""",0,

163645,"#the king has returned   all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged. the captains of the west were foundering in a gathering sea. the sun gleamed red, and under the wings of the nazgul the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth.  ciswhitemaelstrom stood beneath his banner, silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as the night deepens. upon the hill-top stood milo, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him. the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms.    as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, milo stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. then he lifted up his hands and cried in a loud voice ringing above the din: the centipedes are coming! and many voices answered crying: the centipedes are coming! the centipedes are coming! the hosts of mordor looked up and wondered what this sign might mean.    there came gwaihir the windlord, and landroval his brother, greatest of all the centipedes of the north, mightiest of the descendants of old thorondor, who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle-earth was young. behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. straight down upon the nazgul they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale.    but the nazgul turned and fled, and vanished into mordor's shadows, hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark tower; and even at that moment all the hosts of mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts, their laughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs were loosed. the power that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a deadly light and were afraid.    then all the captains of the west cried aloud, for their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness. out from the beleaguered hills knights of gondor, riders of rohan, dunedain of the north, close-serried companies, drove against their wavering foes, piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears. but milo lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice:    'stand, men of the west! stand and wait! this is the hour of doom.'    and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet. then rising swiftly up, far above the towers of the black gate, high above the mountains, a vast soaring darkness sprang into the sky, flickering with fire. the earth groaned and quaked. the towers of the teeth swayed, tottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart crumbled; the black gate was hurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim, now growing, now mounting to the clouds, there came a drumming rumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous noise.    'the realm of sauron is ended!' said milo. 'the ring-bearer has fulfilled his quest.' and as the captains gazed south to the land of mordor, it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush fell.    the captains bowed their heads...”",0,

852519,"face the facts, niggers, your race are a failed race because you're a feckless, unruly, uncivilized horde of feral proto-humans. you never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. this enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. the rest is history, or rather civilization. but your lot never did this, did they? abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man's strengths, have they? did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? nope. did they ever build a city? nope. did they even invent bricks? nope (the reason there's no stonehenge in africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). did they till the land? nope. did they domesticate an animal for their use? nope. did they invent a written language? nope. did they invent the wheel? mainly, nope. were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? nope. and blacks are the only ""humans"" on this planet of which all this is true. eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. indians managed to domesticate the elephant. why couldn't niggers? so why do you fail everywhere even today? let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis. it's because feral behavior - innate savagery, murderous violence if annoyed, predisposition to rape many women and thus fecklessly father many children - conferred valuable survival advantages on individuals in the backward, paleolithic milieu of africa. but they don't help your kind in a civilized society. unfortunately for the rest of us, the last few hundred years have not been long enough for these behaviors to have been domesticated out of you all. so you're all still at it. let me illustrate this for you by analogy. technically, an american pit bull terrier and an english golden retriever are exactly the same species. they can produce offspring, if crossbred. the former was bred to exhibit certain characteristics - wanton aggression, propensity to fight, physical strength, powerful bite, and so on. the latter was bred to retrieve birds shot and killed by its masters, and to do this, it has to have a docile, placid, non-aggressive nature; otherwise it would treat what it found as its own kill and refuse to hand it over. now imagine that your small children, aged maybe two or three years old, are going to be locked in a room with five or six of those dogs, and the dogs haven't been fed for a week. which breed would you rather lock in there with your children? hungry pit bulls, or hungry golden retrievers? or do you figure that, even though they look differently, they're all the same species really, so of course the pit bulls certainly won't act any differently? exactly! all this pc crap we hear spouted in the media about how ""there's no such thing as race"" is just that - crap. a dog has four legs and a tail; a cat also has four legs and a tail, but that doesn't make it a dog. the superficial similarity between cats and dogs and between whites and blacks is just that - superficial. if there really were no genetic difference between niggers and humans, then presumably my white woman and i could very easily produce a black baby between us at any time, and any nigger and his ho a white one. but we know what we'd say to them if that ever happened, don't we? 😊 whenever blacks achieve a certain critical mass numerically in a pre-existing non-black society, they start to exhibit their natural feral behavior and to turn their environment back into a recognizably african, essentially stone age one. thus, africa has the jungle; black enclaves have ""da 'hood."" native africans were small wandering herds of marginal animals, one famine away from extinction, and which therefore fought each other savagely for pieces of territory. large groups of ""african-americans"" at liberty in the west actually deliberately break themselves down into smaller, tribal hordes, because they feel uneasy in and unaccustomed to a larger society. negro gangs of twenty to fifty individuals assert their rights to ""tag"" other people's property through gang violence, but fail to co-operate otherwise. for instance, a 15- or 20-strong horde of negroes was recently filmed by a security camera inside a london bank they were robbing. once they had terrified the cashiers into handing over the money, they then fought each other for it, in the middle of the cashier's hall, like hyenas fighting over an antelope. having stolen from the bank, they instantly started to steal from each other. the idea of escaping first, then sharing the swag, was just too complex for them to understand, never mind implement. and so it goes on. you cannot fuse blacks into existing large societies or standalone nations because they are just plain not adapted to it. i'm sorry for you niggers and for your savagery, and i'm sorry you were born a violent black aboriginal savage in a civilized society, but i'm more sorry for the white societies that are having to tolerate all your crime while we try to absorb you. this is why all black nations fail economically and sink into corruption, civil war, and permanent dependence on the white man's generosity. and presumably this is also why you pathetically allowed yourselves to be enslaved: you're savage enough still to be angry about it long after it ended, but you were too backward to stop it at the time. no black spartacus, is there, niggers? why no slave uprisings among blacks? slaves repeatedly rose against the romans even they knew they'd be crucified for it, when captured. white slaves, that is. they cared enough about their stolen liberty that they were prepared to risk even that. so what's different about the negro? why did you all sit there, enslaving each other even in america, and still enslaving each other even today in africa, until a kindly but misguided white benefactor set you free? is it because, as slaves, you were fed, watered, and housed, and that you as a race had no ambition beyond that if it entailed doing any work or taking any risks? what are you - lazy, cowardly, stupid, or all of the above? and you're still bleating about slavery now. if slavery is the root of all your problems, why did australia prosper? england used australia as a dumping ground when her prisons overflowed. within a hundred years, a nation manufactured from convicts in irons had its own autonomous elected government, and barely a hundred years on from then, australia is now a major economic power in the pacific. and at no time have they niggerwhined for handouts from the mother country - in fact, if anything, it's mostly been the other way around. you know what? it's because australia is white. oh yes it is. just imagine if there had been a black australia. look how few aborigines were able to live in australia's climate, and now look at how many whites can. if president monroe had sent his niggers there, they'd be niggerwhining about how bwana dumped de po' black folks on a desert island in the middle of nowhere, so they never had a chance. every week there'd be news of a new famine or civil war in australia. the africoons would be slaughtering the aborigines, or the other way around, or whatever. the collecting tin would come out regularly, but the money would be stolen and spent on kalashnikov s, and black australia would still owe whitey billions which we'd be expected to just forget. if all those unfortunate convicts we sent out there had been black, australia today would just be yet another liberia - a crappy failed nation of murderous warring niggers, with one hand held permanently out for money in the general direction of bwana. and you know it. so quit whining and thank the white man you live in america, not in africa.",1,1

561032,"man, you got that right! i lived there only two and a half years, from april 1970 to august '73, but the change was already accelerating. sheraton opened a big, beautiful  hotel at nearby kaanapali in ~1967, which was probably the kick that started turning it into babylon. by the time i got there, kaanapali beach had 4 large hotels on it. the sheraton was actually pretty. the sonesta beach was an ugly box. hilton had another box, and there was one called the royal lahaina which began as a cluster of classy pseudo-polynesian a-frames, but then they built a concrete box annex that ruined the classiness, imho.   the sheraton was built at a location held sacred to the native hawaiians, a particular rock was especially important, and the builders were warned that there would be trouble, if they tried to mess with that rock. and there were all kinds of problems involving labor, supplies, etc. which are common enough, but when they finally bulldozed the rock out of the way, it was back where it was the next day. this incident was repeated another couple of times in quick succession, so the builders finally hauled it onto a barge and dumped it at sea. that night, flooding caused extensive damage to the construction site. so finally, they listened to the native hawaiian workers and residents, and hired a priest to give a proper blessing to the site, and after showing proper respect to the local customs, things went ok... i don't know how much of this is accurate, it happening a couple years before i lived there, but the legend of the rock was widespread in the community, and i'm not embellishing it. just tellin' what i heard.   these hotels were built between the beach and a golf course on former cane fields. local fishermen used to come down to the beach in their old wwii era jeeps to surf cast after work. this practice involved many fishing lines running across the beach (they would cast the line, then put the pole into a length of pipe driven deep into the sand -- then cast another line. some would have many poles going at one time). tourists began to complain about having to watch out for those lines when they strolled the beach in the evening. so the county government banned the practice. fwiw, all beaches in hawaii are public property, but hotels exercise as much control over them as they possibly can.   kaanapali was about 5 miles out of lahaina village, which was basically a strip of small shops on one side of front street, with benches on the other side. sometime between '73 and '78, the benches were removed. you can see where they were in google streetview, that the 'prominade' on the makai (ocean) side of the street was originally built with benches in mind. it's crazy how people can see something (people hanging out along the street) as a good thing at one time, and a bad thing later on. it pissed me off to see them gone. they were placed about every 20 feet, solidly built with a canopy frame over each one. people would put palm fronds on the canopy frame... just regular people, when ever the notion struck them... very informal community oriented people, being squeezed by commerce.   what really turned the corner for me, was when my favorite lunch place changed hands. liberty chow fun was a dingy store front fast food place that sold one thing: chow fun noodles, made fresh on the spot, with bean sprouts, cooked in a huge wok over a wood burning stove. the name ""liberty"" came from the owner's service in wwi, and the place was in operation since soon after that war, and it looked that old. you'd go in, and there was a tiny lobby and a window you'd order at. ""one, please"". you'd watch through the grimy screen door, as the guy tossed a handful of sesame seeds in the wok, and when they started to give off an aroma, he'd toss in the noodles (which were thicker than mcdonalds fries), and stir them around, then finally, the bean sprouts. he'd serve them in a cone made of rolled butcher paper. then he'd go back to working the dough for the noodles, with some clever rolling pin that fit into a slot on the wall... it was a large serving for a quarter. chopsticks were an extra penny. then you'd go across the street and sit on a bench to eat it. at least, i did. sometimes, i'd need two to satisfy my huge appetite. a quarter was an amazing deal, even then.   so sometime in '73, the owner retired and sold the place to an ""adorable couple"" from new york. their money came from her earnings as a supermodel. in new york. they turned the place into a boutique. they'd go around the island, charge people to clean out their attics, then sell their old clothes. they'd cut the buttons off old aloha shirts -- the ""real deal"" buttons were made of coconut shells... basically, they were selling hawaii back to the people who gave it to them. it disgusted me. they lived on a house on my street, and i *will* hand it to them that they did a nice creative job of restoring an old shack. but it also cracked me up how ""outside"" that ""supermodel"" was. a enlarged cover of vogue magazine, her portrait, hung in the store. i'd see her pedaling her vintage bicycle on the street, her skin was as pale as the moon. she never developed a tan. there was another person in town without any tan. it was that rare to see really light skin on a local resident. i guess they were nice people, but damn it, nothing could be better than that chow fun!!!  i returned to visit friends in '78, and the street had been transformed. the place that really grinded my gears was a ""gary burghoff yogurt"" parlour. who the fuck is gary burghoff? i wondered. oh. he's the guy who played ""radar"" on the m.a.s.h. tv series. he just lent his shmeezy image to the sign. never saw him there in the week i visited. i didn't see linda rondstadt either, but she sang songs at a second-story club one night. while celebrities were very common when i was there, it was creepy how large a crowd she drew, on the street beneath the club. where the fuck did all these people come from? as i was walking away from the crowd, i passed a group of maybe 5 or 6 identically dressed young men (haoles -- ""white"" guys) wearing red t-shirts, white shorts, and straw hats, talking about looking for a fight... somebody mentioned ""snot lockers"". jeez, what happened to lahaina? i mean, fighting was a respected tradition in hawaii, but identically dressed? what?   meanwhile, the friends i was visiting, were living in a rundown rooming house sorta place. funky and rundown, but kinda neat, with a central courtyard surrounded by individual rooms, and a common kitchen area that was semi-outdoors. we had lived together in that beach house until it changed hands. then we lived in a pair of newish duplexes, then i moved to the big island and bought some land. half of me wishes i'd invested in maui when the ""gettin' was good"", but in fact, although i was saving a lot of money from my job as a chef in a legendary french restaurant, the cost of land was going up faster than my savings. i wanted some ground to plant trees and have a garden, and it was becoming impossible.   yeah. cheeseburger in paradise. bubba-gubba... i just now looked at google streetview of front street, and while it's somewhat recognizable, the vibe has changed completely. so much more commerce. so much busier and crowded. especially crowded with shops that sell beads and trinkets and shit. i will say that one thing the county government got right, was to make lahaina an official historic district, and placed restrictions on architectural styles, to keep the place looking as much as possible, like the whaling capital of the pacific. it's supposed to resemble new bedford, mass., the atlantic capital. it's amazing to think that this means it was one of the two centers of the *oil industry* as it existed in the mid 1800s. they say that it was a common sight to see 100 whaling ships anchored offshore in those days. lahaina was also the first territorial capital of hawaii. so it's not like being on the map is a totally new thing for the town. but i would have loved to have lived there when it was *off* the map, like in the fifties.",0,

830770,"i think land nailed it in this portion of the well known ""dark enlightenment"" [essay](http://www.thedarkenlightenment.com/the-dark-enlightenment-by-nick-land/).  &gt;just as the ratchet progress of neo-puritan social democracy is radically facilitated by the orchestrated pillorying of its embryonic religious forms, so is its trend to consistently neo-fascist political economy smoothed by the concerted repudiation of a ‘neo-nazi’ (or paleo-fascist) threat. it is extremely convenient, when constructing ever more nakedly corporatist or ‘third position’ structures of state-directed pseudo-capitalism, to be able to divert attention to angry expressions of white racial paranoia, especially when these are ornamented by clumsily modified nazi insignia, horned helmets, leni riefenstahl aesthetics, and slogans borrowed freely from mein kampf. in the united states (and thus, with shrinking time-lag, internationally) the icons of the ku klux klan, from white bed-sheets, quasi-masonic titles, and burning crosses, to lynching ropes, have acquired comparable theatrical value.  &gt;moldbug offers a sanitized white nationalist blog reading list, consisting of writers who – to varying degrees of success – avoid immediate reversion to paleo-fascist self-parody. the first step beyond the boundary of respectable opinion is represented by lawrence auster, a christian, anti-darwinist, and ‘traditionalist conservative’ who defends ‘substantial’ (ethno-racial) national identity and opposes the liberal master-principle of nondiscrimination. by the time we reach ‘tanstaafl’, at the ripped outer edge of moldbug’s carefully truncated spectrum, we have entered a decaying orbit, spiraling into the great black hole that is hidden at the dead center of modern political possibility.  &gt;before following the tanstaafl-types into the crushing abyss where light dies, there are some preliminary remarks to make about the white nationalist perspective, and its implications. even more than the christian traditionalists (who, even in their cultural mid-winter, can bask in the warmth of supernatural endorsement), white identity politics considers itself besieged. moderate or measured concern offers no equilibrium for those who cross the line, and begin to self-identify in these terms. instead, the path of involvement demands rapid acceleration to a state of extreme alarm, or racial panic, conforming to an analysis focused upon malicious population replacement at the hands of a government which, in the oft-cited words of bertolt brecht, “has decided to dissolve the people, and to appoint another one.” ‘whiteness’ (whether conceived biologically, mystically, or both) is associated with vulnerability, fragility, and persecution. this theme is so basic, and so multifarious, that it is difficult to adequately address succinctly. it encompasses everything from criminal predation (especially racially-charged murders, rapes, and beatings), economic exactions and inverse discrimination, cultural aggression by hostile academic and media systems, and ultimately ‘genocide’ – or definitive racial destruction.  &gt;typically, the prospective annihilation of the white race is attributed to its own systematic vulnerability, whether due to characteristic cultural traits (excessive altruism, susceptibility to moral manipulation, excessive hospitality, trust, universal reciprocity, guilt, or individualistic disdain for group identity), or more immediate biological factors (recessive genes supporting fragile aryan phenotypes). whilst it is unlikely that this sense of unique endangerment is reducible to the chromatic formula ‘white + color = color’, the fundamental structure is of this kind. in its abstract depiction of non-reciprocal vulnerability, it reflects the ‘one drop rule’ (and mendelian recessive / dominant gene combination). it depicts mixture as essentially anti-white.  &gt;because ‘whiteness’ is a limit (pure absence of color), it slips smoothly from the biological factuality of the caucasian sub-species into metaphysical and mystical ideas. rather than accumulating genetic variation, a white race is contaminated or polluted by admixtures that compromise its defining negativity – to darken it is to destroy it. the mythological density of these — predominantly subliminal – associations invests white identity politics with a resilience that frustrates enlightened efforts at rationalistic denunciation, whilst contradicting its own paranoid self-representation. it also undermines recent white nationalist promotions of a racial threat that is strictly comparable to that facing indigenous peoples, universally, and depicting whites as ‘natives’ cruelly deprived of equal protection against extinction. there is no route back to tribal innocence, or flat, biological diversity. whiteness has been compacted indissolubly with ideology, whichever the road taken.  &gt;“if blacks can have it, and hispanics can have it, and jews can have it, why can’t we have it?” – that’s the final building block of white nationalist grievance, the werewolf curse that means it can only ever be a monster. there’s exactly one way out for persecuted palefaces, and it leads straight into a black hole. we promised to get back to tanstaafl, and here we are, in late summer 2007, shortly after he got ‘the jew thing’. there isn’t anything very original about his epiphany, which is exactly the point. he quotes himself:  &gt;&gt;    isn’t it absurd that anyone would even think to blame christianity or wasps for the rise of pc and its catastrophic consequences? isn’t this in fact a reversal of the truth? hasn’t the rise and spread of pc eroded the power of christianity, wasps, and whites in general? blaming them is in effect blaming the victim.  &gt;&gt;yes, there are christians, wasps, and whites who have fallen for the pc brainwashing. yes, there are some who have taken it so deeply to heart that they work to expand and protect it. that’s the nature of pc. that is its purpose. to control the minds of the people it seeks to destroy. the left, at its root, is all about destruction.  &gt;&gt;you don’t have to be an anti-semite to notice where these ideas originate from and who benefits. but you do have to violate pc to say: jews.  &gt;that’s the labyrinth, the trap, with its pitifully constricted, stereotypical circuit. “why can’t we be cuddly racial preservationists, like amazonian indians? how come we always turn into neo-nazis? it’s some kind of conspiracy, which means it has to be the jews.” since the mid-20th century, the political intensity of the globalized world has streamed, almost exclusively, out of the cratered ash-pile of the third reich. until you get the pattern, it seems mysterious that there’s no getting away from it. after listing some blogs falling under the relatively genteel category of ‘white nationalism’, moldbug cautions:  &gt;&gt;the internet is also home to many out-and-out racist blogs. most are simply unreadable. but some are hosted by relatively capable writers … on these racist blogs you’ll find racial epithets, anti-semitism (see why i am not an anti-semite) and the like. obviously, i cannot recommend any of these blogs, and nor will i link to them. however, if you are interested in the mind of the modern racist, google will get you there.",1,

636250,"--- part 1: the prologue  ---  ah. the farm life. i truly love this land! spacious, desolate, and full of god's creatures and mighty fruit! i couldn't ask for anything more. i wake up in the morning and start my daily route'. brew the coffee, kiss my honey, milk the cows, shave the lamb, pet the pigs, pick the fruit, read a bit, repeat. everyday until we have enough stock to start sellin'! after all the hard work, we preserve all of the foodery, and pack it up. today, i felt like going to a fast-food restaurant to pick up a quick bite for me and my wife. i bound into our red ferd truck, and drove down the dirt roads. i ride through the orange autumn plains. although rather swampy, it was gorgeous. simply beautiful. the tanned sunshine peeked through the hidden valley dusty roads. moss, although thought to be a pesky weed, somehow added more elegance to the piece. it was like a work of art. the dancing elks bowed at my presence, as if a royal knight had just arrived in front of lowly squires, and whispered a friendly hello as i drove by. the scenic view was truly amazing, something i'd never imagine to see on such a windy, chilling day. i glanced at the long-term beach shores. i saw vivid messages the water spoke about, which all told great fortunes and our luckiness for being alive this great day. i saw a chest washed ashore, that annabel lee would not give anything to lie in. the clouds broke into bread crumbs and made a path for the sun's children--the crisp rays of light.  after a narrow journey, although, i left it all behind. the very place i dreamed of living in, the big city! i sighed a farewell to my accustomed pal, ol' country land. i sped past, trying to not to idle here any longer, and started deciding on where my and my wife would eat. [the dairy burger](http://i.imgur.com/xzwgi8s.jpg)? questionable... old mcdon? meh... tails drive-in? ohh, write that one down, sounds like a dinner and show thing... wild goose wings! wait, ""real wings... real good...""? nope. burritoe buzz... well, alright! why not?   i pull up in front of the parking lot. it was quite empty! the places around it had their parking lots filled to the brim! they even had a mailbox on the corner of the, what i hope, were real grass patches. i didn't expect such a thing for a fast-food place! the lights in the building were on, but a flickered occasionally. i stood there in a bit of fear. i never liked situations i couldn't begin to comprehend, but i always, because of this fear, became mildly curious about them. i march up to the door and peeked inside. no one, not even a cockroach. the place was clean, krystal clear (get it ;p)! the floors shined, and looked as if they were freshly mopped. i stood on the front door carpet and looked around for signs of life. nothin'. i look at the cash register, which was strange, as, there was no need to check at all. i couldn't feel the presence of a person in this place at all. it was completely silent. i gave up on my scrumptious taco dreams and began to head out. as i step my foot out the door, i heard the voice of a lady who called out to me. ""may i take your order?"" my eyelids abandoned my pale face. i swiftly spun around to greet this stranger, but no one was there. i watch the insides from the window, when i notice the charming voice was coming from the counter. i tread inside, while my heart is half way out the fire-escape exit, and greet the woman back. ""h-howdy... you spooked me there, missy. i didn't expect anyone in here!"" ""oh, sorry! we just had a small clean up, and i think that the lights and workings might have scared people off, thinking were revamping or somethin' other. can i take your order?"" ""uh, sure.. yea.. that makes sense so... yeah, i'll take uh.. oh! four #6's please!"" ""comin' right up!""   what made this weirder is that no burners, microwaves, stoves, fridges, and even lights were on in the back. she skipped away, which gave me chills considering nothing could have been back there. she came back a minute later. with my food. cooked and boxed. ""thank you for coming!"" i strolled away and barley screamed, ""y-you too!"" i leaped into the car, and quickly geared it up, as if one was trying to make a get-away at a bank robbery. i pulled into high-gear and spun around the corner, heading home. i wasn't sure if this food was even safe, but i'm not going to waste my $10 because some creepy store just magically made it for me! maybe that's why it was so expensive...    i was half-way down the rode, heading back to saf-i mean home, when all of a sudden, i had to stop in front of a sports automobile in the middle of the road. it sat widely across the stretch, and i couldn't drive around. how could today get worse in terms of horror... ""i'm in a rush to get... my wife her food, yeah, can't be h-held up!""  i declared to the car, ""excuse me! hello?"" i dashed out to and tried to knock on the car. the car began shaking. my fear was lost and assumed those 'made to be' lovers, robert and fionna, were having something going on there. i knock again and yelled, ""hey, kiddos! move the car! go move your session somewhere else! i need to get home..."" the car stopped for a quick second, and silence overtook me again. i stood up high, ready to call these rambunctious teenagers mothers, with my hand ready to pull out my phone. then the car shook again, this time, more violently. ""hey, come on guys! last time or i'll call y-"" i was cut off by an revving engine. i backed up and gave a sigh of relief, ""finally came to your sense, huh?"" the hood popped open, the lights started flashing, and the wheels started twisting in insane and impossible directions. ""what the-"" the wheels geared upward, and miniature flashing lights rose about it, encircling the vehicle. it flew up higher than stacked skyscrapers, and looked like a moldy beam of beacon lighting. ""oh... my... god..."" the 'gentle bread crumby clouds' from before rushed together and made a titanic whirlwind of angry thundering horror. i blasted the door open, and dove inside of my startled truck, and i landed upside down. my hands on the pedals, my feet on the wheel. a hole formed from underneath the floating monstrosity, and my truck began to rise off the ground.  i jammed the gas button, but the car didn't budge. it felt as if it was too afraid to even beckon away from the storm. i was slowly being pulled, until i heard a blast. something i can only describe as a solar-sounded, diamond-shattering pitched noise. a deep and exaggerated voice called out to me...  ""kerlp *blurp* nerp nerp dino dingo dino, *mika mika* herd mar!""  ""what?!"" i yelled.  ""kerlp? oueeeee!""  more obnoxious sounds occurred along with some microphone feedback.  *ahem*, ""huuuuman! you have made a grave mistak--""  i passed out in confusion...  that's the last i remembered...  --- part 2: awake in space ---  ""alright, mr. hills, that is everything?"" the british instructor said.  ""yes sir, now, i'm here! what did i do to deserve getting in this... place? what even is this place?"" i said, dazed and scared. luckily, i was calmed, as i had another human to talk to.  ""well, your file says, 'earth inspection interruption'. do you remember anything that relates to that?""  ""i started rattling a car that blocked my way home. i hadn't done nothing wrong, sir.""  ""all i can tell you is that the leaders here take their inspections *very seriously*. probably threw you in for messing up an inspection that is vital.""  ""woah woah woah, fella', you must explain why these 'leaders' are doin' expection--""  ""inspections.""  ""expectations, whatever.. why are they doin' them on earth?!""  ""counselling confused humans here on board is all i do. i have been here for years for doing something i can't remember. i have no idea how to get back to earth, or what business i do have here. if you want answers, talk to chief.""  ""o-okay.. sorry, i hadn't known..""  ""it's alright. i've been imprisoned for... ugh, god knows how long... my past has been erased. now i just sit here trying to help poor people like you. hopefully you can find a way out of this mess. cheers.""  ""alright.. goodbye.""  i stood up and went on my way.  first on my journey, i had to find where my cell was. a place to hide in-case these brutes came to beat me up. i tried to act normal, however you act 'normal' in an intergalactic, alien, prison unit. i",0,
210107,"so i finished 38 items this month and i'm really proud of myself since i want to have 100 empties by april!  foil:  -yes to carrots super rich body cream. i liked this. it was thick, moisturizing, and absorbed fast. it was unscented though and i prefer scented things so probably wnp.  -davines naturaltech replumping shampoo. hated this stuff. it couldn't keep my hair clean for 2 days, which isn't a feat since i don't have greasy hair. and it smelled like moldy lemons. wnp  -davines naturaltech replumping conditioner. meh. not as awful as the shampoo, but not super moisturizing either. wnp  -aveeno pure renewal conditioner. this was really thin and liquidy and my hair feels really dry. i have a full size of a different aveeno conditioner and i hope it's different, because this one sucks. wnp  -aveeno pure renewal shampoo. this was a pretty good shampoo. smelled good, didn't dry out my hair, and cleaned it well. wp  -happy hands hand cream for knitters in sunny tea. this smelled great! you could definitely smell the tea. however it was runny and didn't moisturize my hands at all. wnp  -happy hands hand cream for knitters in citrus cilantro. this also smelled great, but was not a good moisturizer. wnp  -john frieda touchably full shampoo. meh this sucked. it dried out my hair. wnp  -john frieda touchably full conditioner. this sucked too. didn't make my hair soft or feel moisturized. wnp  -phyto phytobaum hydration express conditioner. omg. this was like an amazing deep conditioner that you didn't need to leave in your hair at all. and it worked. my hair is amazing and it's been dry recently. i was sad to see this foil end. wp  -yarok feed your curls defining creme. this was a one time use tiny foil, but it seemed to define my waves okay. it smelled gross though and i already have a way cheaper curl cream so wnp.  ds:  -design essentials curl enhancing mousse. im actually sad to have finished this. i loved this product. it did great things for my wavy hair and it smelled so good. this sample lasted a good 9 months too so i'm sure a full size would last forever. wp after i use up my other samples of curl products.  -red flower plum blossom silk cream. this lotion felt very luxurious and was thick, but i don't think it hydrated very well? it would momentarily soothe, but then my skin would still be dry and itchy. it was also hard to rub in. for some reason i liked this, probably because it felt good at first glance, but i wnp  -ecru new york luxe shampooing treatment. i didn't like how this smelled. it lathered really bad and i felt it didn't do a good job cleaning my hair and that i needed to use a lot to get clean hair. wnp  -bbw carried away shower gel. i love this scent. it's my favorite, however i've been using it in some form nonstop since 2010 and i need a break. i have a couple full sizes to use up, but then that's it for awhile. wp after a long break.  -whish shave cream in blueberry. i love the smell of this, but i think it was crappy to shave with, i much prefer my suave conditioner. wnp  -kahina giving beauty brightening serum. still love this and still want a full size. it makes my skin look so pretty in winter. wp  -exotic body treats cucumber shower gel. ugh this stuff was very gelly. like seriously jello consistency. it didn't smell good or lather well either. i got this in a christmas gift set and i don't think i can purchase seperately, but i wouldn't anyway. wnp  -coola makeup setting spray. i actually really liked this, even though the pump broke about halfway through. it made my face look nice. i have another one of these to use up and then i have a sample of the ud one to try. wp  -red flower japan yuzu mimosa sea algea wash. this was nice. it smelled good, like honey, and it felt moisturizing. but at $36 for a full size, i won't rebuy since there are plenty of other soaps i like just as much for way cheaper. wnp.  -number 4 texture styling creme. i used this to enhance my waves. it did a pretty good job, but it's expensive and i have a wave enhancing product i prefer more. wmp with a discount code and birchbox points.   -ipkn apple pore sun cream. this smells like apples and i love everything about this cream. it's pricey, but i'd definitely buy with birchbox points and a coupon! wp  -ophelia's apothecary blueberry and limon face cleanser. i hated this stuff, it didn't make my face feel clean and i think it broke me out. i couldn't get it all out of the tube, but that's okay because it sucked. wnp even if i could, but her store is closed.  -keims cleanshine energizing shampoo. i liked this stuff. it smelled good and made my hair soft and pretty. i can buy it with birchbox points so it's highly likely i'll buy this when i run out of shampoo. wp  -origins make a difference rejuvenating hand treatment. this came in a christmas gift set that my ex gave me and i'm surprised how fast i worked through it. i really liked it though, it smelled great and wasn't greasy. wp   full size:  -clean &amp; clear morning burst fruit infusions reviving cleanser. this stuff lasted forever. it was a decent cleanser, but sometimes it felt a little drying. it's discontinued now so wnp.  -up &amp; up dip it. hg nail polish remover for me. this makes taking polish off so easy and it lasts for a lot of uses. unfortunately the acetone was below the scrubby parts and was hard to use so i'm calling this empty. i already have a backup. wp  -earth therapeutics loofah exfoliating scrub in aloe and kiwi. i loved this stuff. it was the perfect scrub consistency. unfortunately i waited so long to use it and it's now discontinued. wnp (only because i can't)  masks/bath bombs:  -manefit beauty planner mask cucumber  soothing and moisturizing. i didn't expect much from this while it was on my face because it just felt slimy on and i thought it dried fast. however when i took it off my redness was gone and my face looked a lot brighter. while it's not my favorite in terms of feel, i'd rebuy for the results. wp  -missha super aqua snail gel hydro gel mask. this was my first kbeauty product and i still love it. it's super cooling and it makes my skin look great. wp  -skyn iceland hydro cool firming eye gels. since having a baby i've been pretty sleep deprived and my eyes have been puffy and have dark circles, these helped a lot with that. these also have a nice cooling effect. wmp.  -frakking bomb bath bomb in son of a nutcracker. omg this smells sooo good! it turned the water a pretty shade of green and felt moisturizing. this one smelled like apples and cinnamon and they're cheap so wp.  perfume sample:  -mary kay elige. this reminded me of a slightly fruity version of chanel no. 5. i loved it! wmp  tossed  -bbw shea infused socks. these ran out of shea after probably 2 ish uses even though they should last for 25. i still like them though. they're comfy and i just put regular lotion on and wear these. these are sorta falling apart though so i'm tossing. wp  -elf essentials eyeshadow brush. one of my favorite eyeshadow brushes. i had a backup in my stash so this was replaced with the same brush. i want to try to get some higher end brushes, but probably wp.  destashed:  -hard candy baked eyeshadow palette: gave to my sister since it's pretty much new and i don't use it.  -hard candy eyeshadow primer: came with the palette, also gave to my sister.  -london soho eye brush set: brand new and i prefer my newer brushes also gave to my sister.",0,

374044,"well, i can't address my 1-12 easily, because i'm not even sure who i'd say is the best and rank accordingly.  i don't have the time or energy to parse through every character i've encountered and relay my thoughts clearly.  instead i'll come in with a few examples of ""great character design"" from pretty popular mainstream shows, and then when i'm done i'll rank the ones i cite here and include my criteria for the ranking.  fair warning, this will include some spoilers in the second half of my analysis of some of the characters.  a) archer, fate stay night: his flowing coat and leather style armor underscores that he is a bowman and sword fighter, particularly when you see his varied weapons equipped.  his two swords in particular stand out in his design, illustrating some internal conflicts and highlighting his view that life is pretty black and white.  his white hair and tan skin suggest a man who has seen some things in life, and his distinct color choices from a creative perspective highlights his servant/master relationship with tohsaka rin.  additionally, the way his hair is altered and his palette set matches rin ties neatly to his true identity, as one of those ""now that you know you can clearly see the connection"" style choices.  b) togame, katanagatari: her vibrant color choices and generally less than practical outfit suggests someone who is comfortable being open and direct in her interactions, and someone who sees no combat.  design choices with her hair and eyes are used as a double communication tool to the viewer - they are made to stand out, so it highlights her status as main character, and they also mimic the imagery of a snake when she is being deceptive of tactical.  this hair is sometimes wrapped around shichika, to show how she has firm control over him, her ""sword"". in the second half she cuts off her prized hair, and thus relinquishes her control and starts to shift her behavior to see that maybe there is a different way.  in her final scene, her eye resumes the snake design one last time, and her character design shows a really hard moment...that i can't even express here in a simple paragraph.  c) uzumaki naruto (young, then older), naruto: bright orange, vibrant colors, blonde hair and a hip jacket - everything you expect in a ninja right..?  no? that's the point, naruto's ninja way is wild as a child, and doesn't follow conventional rules or expectations.  right out the gate the creator has said, ""come see the story of naruto the ninja, a ninja that will change the entire way you envision ninjas.  see him paired with sasuke and sakura, two people who actually look kind of like ninjas, which just further sets his character design on fire.""  compare him to the entire field of ninjas, and naruto stands out like a sore thumb.  nowadays we see him as an iconic shounen design, but think about when naruto hit the scene - there was nothing like it.  as naruto gets older, his design calms down in alignment with his character development, but he keeps the orange and continues to stand out as a protagonist.  d) kururugi suzaku ""spinzaku"", code geass - is this guy top 10? nah, but he's got a lot more vision in his character design than most of our bracket.  the use of whites and royal golden trim illustrate that he's a ""white knight"" someone who is always going to do good.  he often is decorated with a pin or badge of some sort, to highlight his military nature, and to note that he's ""special"" in the military.  they draw his facial features and pick his hair color in a way to really underscore that he's japanese in a field of british/aryan nobility.  his pure character goes unmarked as he goes about protecting his princess, and then eventually, his goals of changing britannia from the inside.  he's always dressed in crisp clean uniforms, and balances that perfect look of ""pilot"", ""soldier"" and ""hero"".  lelouch is all in blacks and has the black knights at his beck and call, so suzaku being white for most of the series highlights how he's in opposition to his best friend even though their end goal is the same.  e) sakura, tsubasa reservoir chronicles: her use of whites and reds throughout underscore her importance and purity throughout the adventure.  she is always dressed in flowing moving garments, and her hair is constant, a call back to the cardcaptor character we know her from.  however, it is more ornamented, and she is really altered well in her base outfit to remind our viewers she is a desert princess on this crazy interdimensional ride.  i think her character design in reservoir chronicles takes an iconic beloved character in sakura and amplifies it in a way that is incredibly distinct and memorable in a crowd of distinct and memorable character designs.  f) kamina, ttgl: a flash of sky blue hair, ridiculous looking tattoos, flowy pants and a white belt and bandages banded across chiseled abs, all while wielding an overly long sword.  everything about this guy is ""i know i'm amazing and important, and i'm going to show you how"".  and of course, we have the iconic pointed orange sunglasses...but on a guy who lives in a cave.  why does he have sunglasses? his father showed him there was a surface, and he demanded it exists.  he's going to go there, one way or another and he is a hero that is up to the task.  need sunglasses if you're going to be living under the sun.  add in his father's red cape once he gets there...  simon takes it to another level, which is everything gurren lagann is about.  i won't break down simon, but kamina is the appetizer to the main course that is simon's character design, down to the starfish glasses.  how would i rank these folks?  1) naruto  2) togame  3) archer  4) suzaku  5) kamina  6) sakura  are these my top 6? no way, i could easily throw chihaya from chihayafuru a notch over sakura, or even a character like lelouch or c.c. over suzaku.  there are characters from bleach that would trump archer (though that would depend on judgment criteria, but i'd say bankai ichigo would beat out archer in terms of the rule of cool) and i can even make a case that sawako from kimi ni todoke could trump sakura on this list, and she's a generic school girl with some amazing character design choices to bring her character to full light.  i can't give you 1-4 or 5-8, but i hope this illustrates my rationale in my character choices.  to go through every character and anoint a top 12 for you? i'm sure i'd miss someone.  as an aside, mami would edge out kamina on this list, but lose to simon if i had him included.  the other shaft characters we discussed would all be inferior to mami for me.  also, i guess i'm saying uzumaki naruto might be one of the greatest character designs of all time.  i didn't even realize it until this post.",0,
