464861,"well, it's not like i spent the majority of my time leading up to being 14 years old thinking ""you know what..? losing my virginity in front of an entire party would be pretty much the worst thing ever, i should maybe avoid that"" but in retrospect, having that thought may have prevented the most tawdry example of teen behaviour seen by me from occurring..  i was born in humpty doo, well, in darwin hospital but i lived in humpty doo.  this is in the middle of nowhere so when i was old enough to be schooled, we moved toward civilization in a valiant effort to give my life some validity. after being banned from nearly every school in the territory (it's not a state) - i was diagnosed with adhd and add and whatever else that basically means i had a warp speed imagination and little to no patience. (re: i was a kid)  it wasn't that i couldn't concentrate - it was that i'd finish the work given to me in a heartbeat and then suddenly be atop a castle i built out of chairs fighting invisible monsters with streams of my urine and a hat rack.  finally i was sent to a montessori school, this place cottoned onto what was happening and just kept feeding me work. it was decided that darwin didn't present either myself or my younger sister with many options, now that i was nearing high school age and all.  so we moved, to brisbane - for opportunity. we just happened to move to logan.  to give you an idea, that’s kind of like going to las vegas to play slot machines, but then getting someone to chop off your arms at the airport and throw your wallet into a deep well or mine of some description.   so the scene was set, i was in brisbane, was a year and a half ahead of everyone at the new school, so i was all of 13 in grade 8.  i found it hard to make friends at this school, the first thing i was asked when i got there was ""are you a surfie or a homie"" - i grew up riding motorbikes, hunting kangaroos, writing poetry and listening to both sound garden and nirvana (my first two tapes ever, bleach and sound gardens one) - so my answer was pretty much ""there's a beach near here..??"" (there wasn't)  christmas rolled round, i'd managed to make a few friends by succumbing to herd mentality. well, not really but i knew that kids my age loved destruction so resorted to my old adhd playbook of throwing things into fans etc.  the school holidays started and i was invited to stay at a mates house in a closed estate, one of those housing estates with their own golf course.   it was for a bunch of year 11/12'ers from another school who lived there, we just found out through the channels.  the night of the party we arrived in a small group of about 5 guys, all being in year 8, i'd just turned 14 the same year and we were by far the youngest people at the party. the guys i went with were still caught up in what i liked to call an ""over-appreciation"" of hip-hop culture, meaning at the time, hats worn high, baggiest pants ever, we're all white - you get the picture.  i personally never dressed like this, but these guys were kind of accepting of me, so i didn't highlight the fact they looked like a hilarious underage walking hip hop pantomime.  when we walked in, my gangster friends immediately started doing what they did best, stealing shit.  i also was keen on stealing, but not peoples goods, i wanted to raid the fridge and cupboard and make myself an alcoholic delight.  fast forward 10 minutes, i've found a bottle of kalua and a large bottle of milk, i go back out the front with one of the gangster-kids and we lay on the gutter taking turns swigging on this 3 litre bottle of nefarious concoction.  fast forward, 45 minutes.  i am so fucking drunk, this is probably the second time i've ever danced with inebriation and boy, are we cutting up the rug - so to slur.  i end up out the back of this party, i see two girls sitting on a retaining wall, i know one of them as a chick in year 12 at my school, so i saunter over with the confidence of a drunk yet pre-pubescent pirate.  after they both laugh at me for a while for being 14, being at the party, being drunk and for wearing white pants (i'm an idiot at the best of times, this was one of my gary busey fashion moments, of which would make up the majority of my still-young life) - they kissed each other in front of me.  i must have looked like a hungry person watching a hot dog eating contest as when they finished the chick i knew pushed me together with the other girl she was with, who i didn't know.  she was very drunk as well, but had no qualms with making out with me, a 14 year old. we kept making out for a while, things started to get a bit hot and heavy so the other girl i knew from school left us alone, in retrospect i now know she must have gone inside and gathered everyone to come and watch what was about to occur.  the girl i was with started to take off her pants, i remember thinking ""holy crap! it's gonna happenn!!!1(one!)!"" whilst foibling about, taking her pants off.   pulling my busey spec white pants down to my knees, i had the shock realisation that i was completely flacid, i must have been so drunk that the excitement in my brain hadn't yet transferred to my weiner-area.  i looked down, beyond my limp ham-javelin she laid there, pants removed, drunk and disorderly..  i didn't know what to do - thoughts went to porn movies, what do they do..??  i started slapping my weiner on her face.  i don't even know why.  she was reluctant at first but after a bunch of slaps she got the message and started blowing me, which helped.  once i gained crotch momentum, i repositioned myself and started to err  ""make party"" with this mysterious older drunk woman.  i was going away at it for a while, being drunk meant that despite this being my first time dancing the pork-sword shuffle, i had the stamina of a ukranian stump-pulling mule.  after about 30 mins of so, i looked up and was horrendously shocked to find that the entire party was standing out the back, watching. pointing. laughing.    throwing cups even.  i don't know how i didn't notice earlier, there was heaps of them..  i decided that i needed an awesome plan to both;  a) flee the scene b) return to the party with everyone none-the-wiser.  i looked behind me, there was a large group of bushes leading to the golf course, so i stood up, weiner exposed and fled through the bushes onto the golf course where i regrouped...  with myself.  i fastened my belt and cut a long route back round to the front of the house, my intent being to casually walk in the front door and be like ""sweet party, wish i got here sooner""  so, i walked in, and everyone looked at me. there was a brief moment of silence.  some guy pointed at my knees and yelled ""hey it's that fucker guy!"", i looked down to see both knee's of my ridiculous white busey pants were completely soiled in both green and brown, from grass and other sediment.  fail.  the whole party laughed at me some more so i just threw my hands in the air and said ""fuck it!"" and then sat under the dining room table sculling more heinous kaluah mix.  a bit later on, a bunch of girls from the grade above me arrived, specifically the ""glamour group"" (that really snarky yet sexy group of girls who are really mean to anyone who actually has a personality)  when the party ended, myself and one friend went back to this random house with a bunch of younger guys and the entire glamour group.  at the house everyone went inside and they put on a b grade porno,  i was kind of just realising what had happened and walked out the back to the pool area and laid on a deck chair, looking up at the stars.  ""whhhyyy!?"" i screamed into the night air.  one of the girls from the glamour group heard me yelling and came outside, she sat with me and asked me what was wrong.  i told her ""i just made the worst mistake ever.. i lost my virginity in front of an entire party""  ""oh that was you!""  she quickly grabbed all her friends and shut the door to the house, leaving all the guys inside watching b grade porno.  they surrounded me on deck chairs and spent the next 2 hours all asking questions and being all quiet while i answered, i was like a sex-ed columnist or something.  i didn't glamorise what happened, i told them i felt cheap, dirty - and that for what is supposed to be a special moment for a person, well, i'd pretty much taken that idea and done a huge shit on it. then kicked it a few times.  sorry for typing such a long story, i just thought it was worth sharing for those patient enough to read.  :-)  and is it spelt “weiner” or “wiener”? &lt;- as the latter doesn’t seem right to me..",1,-1,-1
650100,"even then, depending on what you're playing and which map you're in, blowing a vanish to put someone on drs isn't a good idea (sap shares drs with a ton of much more easily casted spells, and requires you to be close). better to save vanish to evade cc or immune something (i always saved it for death coil or similar). vanish is much more commonly used to alleviate pressure on your own team.  also, i assumed you meant 1v1, as rogues have been one of the least annoying classes in 3v3 for a really long time (unless something has changed since mop, when i last played).",0,,
268556,"well just look at their biggest political issues: pot, free healthcare, and free college. i'm all for those things, but other things are much more important. as an american, it seems pretty painfully obvious that tons of people here just never amounted to anything and are stuck with a useless degree from an expensive university with no real skills. again, real issues, but only their focus because it immediately benefits them.",0,,
121791,"research into men's health issues, particularly cancers, has been underfunded for years. for example, see the prevalence of campaigns like pink ribbon and compare them to their male counterparts (if you can even name them). this lack of funding is mirrored in government spending, where women often have special representation (in the form of a minister for women, office for women's health, or similar) while men do not.  problems like male suicide (men make up 75-80% of suicides in the western world) are ignored, while a small rise in suicides amoungst women can and has attracted lots of media attention.  these problems are fixable, so there's nothing ""pointless"" about drawing attention to them. it's not a case of ""women do it so we *can* too"", it's a case of ""women do it so we **should** too"".",0,,

386880,"the key skill is patience in not jumping ahead. this comes naturally - as you finish each piece, you will start to see how spending more time on cleaning flash and filling cracks would have helped.  +1 for cleaning flash, spray primer (i like matte gray) and thinning your paints.  remember that miniatures will be seen from several feet away. while it's tempting to make them realistic, exaggerated effects tend to work best.  **washes**  to bring out texture, take a darker version of the base color, nice and thin (the consistency of milk), and then paint into the grooves.  best for highly textured areas.  don't do this on big, flat areas, it just makes them look dirty.  experiment for the right consistency: too runny and it seeps away and pools up, too thick and it won't stay in the grooves.  a nice beginner's technique since it doesn't require much accuracy.  **blacklining**  outline areas in a dark color (sometimes black, but dark brown often works well).  where the wrist meets the sleeve, all around the icon on the warrior's shield.  use wash consistency.  **drybrushing**  to highlight raised areas, take a paintbrush you hate, put on a dab of undiluted paint, then wipe it all off on a napkin.  all of it.  when you're done, stroke it over a textured area on the miniature, and it will bring out the detail like magic.  any moisture on the brush or miniature (e.g. wet paint) will fuck you.  a nice beginner's technique since it doesn't require much accuracy.  an effective, simple way to do metal is to paint it black and drybrush it silver.  **highlighting**  requires some accuracy.  to emphasize raised areas (the nose, a crease in fabric, the edges of armor plates), mix up a lighter version of the base color (e.g. with a dab of white) and paint all the raised areas the lighter color.  this looks ridiculous up close, but is a great way to make a miniature 'pop' at the distances you normally see it.  large bumps get highlighted in a slightly lighter color, sharp edges get highlighted in a much lighter color.  as you get better, the quick techniques tend to drop away in favor of manually highlighting everything.  a robe, for example, might be:  * prime gray * base color medium red * paint inner folds dark red * paint raised areas bright red * paint thin pink lines along the sharp edges  **mixing paints**  it helps to get some control with paint mixing.  i like to use golden acrylics fluids - like the vallejo paints, you can dispense these one drop at a time.  this lets you mix fairly accurately with recipes: the base color might be two drops red, one drop brown.  the darker color might be that same recipe with a drop of black; the highlight color with a drop of white.  very useful if you paint over multiple sessions, or if you want the same color on several miniatures.  **color choice**  when i first started, i was overly concerned with painting things the obvious color - leather was brown, for example.  it's much more effective to plan the color combination first.  a simple way is to choose two complimentary colors - e.g. red/green, blue/orange, yellow/purple.  i'm fond of slightly muted colors.  you can make this by mixing with black/white/gray, which reduces the color strength, or you can mix in a complimentary color - green with a tiny dash of red, for example.  ""cyril"" does some amazing things with simple color choices.  this [scrap thrall](http://www.coolminiornot.com/29294?browseid=3066719) is basically red and white, but the 'white' is actually slightly green, which makes an excellent compliment to the red areas.  notice the really great blending on the big fist, with each area going from dull green to rust red.  **palette**  get a palette, almost anything non-porous will do. (e.g. wax paper) this will allow you to mix colors without recipes.  buy a bottle of acrylic extender, and you'll have unlimited ability to blend up a gradient of color on your palette.  this lets you start **blending**.  the red robe i mentioned above: you can now mix up intermediate colors  **blending**  let's say you've got a mini with a robe; it has large folds, so you have deep recesses and large raised areas.  the raised areas are bright red, the recessed areas are a deep crimson.  how do you get a smooth color transition between bright and dark areas?  there are some fancy techniques that involve extender and wet-on-wet blending, but the easiest way i know is to mix up an intermediate color (say, 50/50 crimson/bright red), make it fairly thin, and then paint a stripe of it down the join.  the join will still show, but that's fine.  once it's dry, you can do it again - but with a stripe of different thickness.  this way, over 3-6 translucent coats, you'll wind up with a nice transition.",0,,

193519,"crouched down on the boat in twelve rows of eight, plus six in the front row, are one hundred and two women, the furtherest back a commanding and imposing woman of indeterminate age, black flowing hair with a broad band of silver giving her a badger like appearance. read dodi smith's 101 dalmatians, smith's description in that book of cruella de vil plus the number of sufferers, evokes disturbing literary images, hell is full of similar ironies. her acolytes seem to have each arrived at different times later, the furtherest from the back and thus the latest arrival, a woman in her fifties black hair streaked with grey, her bony lezzo's face expressing only anxiety and an immediate readiness for departure. as she and her companions in their turn chant the litany and then the response to the rosary.   the landing had another occupant, another of the guards in a sentry box affair carved into the stone, a young soldierly type dressed in a full length white smock, shoulder length fair hair held by a circlet of some bright metallic substance. armed with a broadsword, he fixed his gaze upon me like i was a candidate for execution, and adjusted his grip on the sword. i noted that he and his sword seemed more than capable of causing the death of the mummified body on the terrace, and of severing satan's leg.  philemon tells him to put up the sword explaining i was on tour… i proceeded to go straight ahead when philemon indicates our way is to the right, thru an entrance and into another cavern, the way goes downward via a ramp, deeply rutted and strewn with boulders. incredibly a large boulder is inching upward, balancing it seemed upon the shoulders of what first appeared to be another stone, the proportion that of a tennis ball and a basketball the smaller bearing the larger. read homer describe the torment of sisyphus, even as the carrier gets the stone so close to the top so does the burden become too much, straining and stressing this mighty man, in physical form a tom thumb. yet we know from legend and rhyme that tt, was a particularly nice guy, sisyphus never came to this end by being nice. the weight becomes too much and the stone topples from his shoulders and rolls back down the incline, he races downhill after it, the sandy floor of the cavern rolled flat just here the sand slowing the stone. running sisyphus gets behind the stone, checks its motion and hoists it upon his shoulders. he traverses the rolled flat sand and runs up the first third of the twenty meter incline, he enters one of many deep ruts in the soil, and the stone appears to be inching steadily upward of its own volition. he emerges where the rut is shallower with the stone firmly upon his shoulders, upward till unsteadily, the stone falls from his grasp and rolls back…  we proceed down the ramp and across a dark sandy place, the light coming from my guide the only illumination. our way seemed long, presently from the darkness ahead came a dim flash like distant lightning, as we proceeded in that direction a red glow lit the horizon, another flash and drawing closer the roar and crackle of flaming fire. the flashes were coming regularly and had become explosions, we were at the entrance to another giant cavern, the inner view as for an industrial furnace. long high stacks of burning bodies, like haystacks in a grant wood painting, stretched to the horizon in three directions, it was great. philemon says, …this is it, he seems proud, he asks, …what do you think, i tell him i think its great. a mighty flash as a human being atop an adjacent high stack of corpses explodes into a pillar of bright yellow flame, we proceed in that direction. thru the glare of the flame, the corpse stack is about five meters high, about two hundred long, and open or unfinished after a section of about thirty meters at our end. beyond in the fiery haze higher stacks, six and seven meters high laid out four hundred meters long, by two hundred fifty wide, millions of corpses burning in the fire.  standing amid all this is a critter glowing green amid the flame like the other guards, with a more or less human upper torso, from the waist down shaggy hair and feral hind legs with cloven hooves. he is a faun, he has a goatee beard and a long faun’s face with short sharp horns protruding from a mop of curly hair grown right down his spine, he has mr spock type pointed ears. he has a dark olive skinned clergyman in a full nelson going on a hammer lock, he breaks into a broad smile when philemon introduces us, the priest has his eyes fixed upon a patch of soft golden light, and has his most sickening pastor's smile on his face. he proceeds to ask, ...what's the joke, he does not finish. within the light, like on a computer screen, the image of well manicured garden, and an expensive car on a white gravel driveway, ivy is climbing on a wall past an ecclesiastical arch. a young person decked out for his first communion has got out of the car, and the clergyman's speech turns to a scream, as his face freezes into a mask of terror and horror combined, and bright yellow flame explodes out of his body.  the guard folds the latest entry into hell downwards from his knees, and locks his inner arm onto an adjacent corpse. from a large box like balloon, with a square hole in the bottom like the trapdoor on a gallows, tethered a couple of meters overhead, tumbles the naked body of a european man. picture a spiv from the reeperbahn in hamburg, or yet a muscovite hoodlum white slaver. he crashes a few meters onto the corpse pile, the keeper grabs his left ankle and drags him leg first up, and locks that ankle into the pile. the euro is made of stern stuff, with his free leg and both arms he tries to climb back up the wall of flaming corpses. too bad about the other ankle though, the keeper grabs him and applies the hammer lock, the golden light appears, the victim starts blubbering about being molested in a public toilet while still a teen… does not help his cause any, he explodes into bright yellow flame. next a teen suicide blubbers before exploding into flame, then one after the other two elderly japanese men, mutual suicides one supposes, then a sikh doctor tries to mitigate before he too explodes into flame.",0,,

602518,"the laughing man's skin was very different from ours. i think that was what drew the young ones to him and kept the elders wary when he first emerged from the forest at the edge of the world.  while my people are ash-and-stone colored, dark enough to hide from greatwings at night but light enough to hide among the stones when hunting amblyopses by the daylight of the lumycia, his skin changed color over the course of his stay from a brown like hands which have worked the earth to a pale pink-yellow like the inside of a snail shell. where my people have rough skin, the stranger's was soft like overripe prupermyca except where he sported small scales at the tips of extremities and a mop of fibers atop his head. even on that first day, when his strange shape first emerged silhouetted against the familiar wall of macrobrachymycia, i knew everything was about to change.  if it was his looks attracted our interest, it was his stories which held it. i was not quite a young one any longer, but though i was still not old enough to be an elder, i'd pretend like i was. like them, i thought myself to old for stories around the fire each night but, like the elders i pretended to be, i found myself drawn in. oh, those stories, like nothing i'd ever heard!  the language alone was enough to pique curiosity: entirely unlike our own, but somehow still completely understandable. the stranger called it universal, though such a word had no meaning to us. before each story, the laughing man would clarify that there was truth to the tale, though many of the elders did not trust his truths. he spoke of so many wondrous things, i did not believe him, myself. not at first. in the beginning, he spoke primarily of worlds, of a great sky of clear air instead of our own stone sky, of a sky beyond the clear air which was made of inky and infinite nothingness, of flames in the nothing-sky bigger than the whole world which are so far away that to feel them is like standing by a pleasant fire. he told of fantastic life-forms, some which he claimed lay in the world of the sky of open air beyond our stone sky, near enough to walk to. each night after the stranger spoke, i found my dreams populated with stone worlds and air worlds flying through the nothing-sky, or with the green stationary giants with brown skin which was rough like ours but which ate only air and light, or the great wide water deeper than the stone sky is high and full of life so varied that the stranger could not even name them all.  the laughing man stayed for two highwaters, and in that time i found myself drawn to him. his presence gave the young ones a distraction during the day which freed their usual caregivers to work in the fields, but the elders still wished that the young ones not be left alone with the stranger, however amicable he may be. and so it came to be that i joined the laughing man each day as he minded the young ones and told stories. though his tales changed every day, it was not because he was lying or creating new additions to what he'd already said. he told a different story each day because he had enough to do so, and sometimes more than one a day, and he told them whether the young ones listened or not for i believe he knew that i was always listening. there was so much in the mind behind those smiling eyes, so much i wanted to know.  and so it went for two highwaters, the laughing stranger speaking and me listening as we tended the children. he taught them games and tricks and dances, and he taught me about the worlds beyond the stone sky of my world. there was so much i wanted to ask, but at the forefront of my mind there was one pressing question. it was near the end of the second highwater of his stay that i plucked up the courage to ask.  the children were out in the fields playing a game he'd taught them, where one chases the rest like a canifugit herding amblyopses and labeling the captured ones ""it"", and the laughing man was prodding at a piece of lumycia which had fallen from the stone sky.  ""why did you come here?""  ""for this.""  ""a chunk of lumycia?"" i did not understand.  ""no, this."" he left the glowing lump of fungus and spread his arms. ""i came to your planet in the hopes of mapping it, of identifying some species, and looking for intelligent life.""  ""but 'planet' is the world with a sky of air,"" i recalled from his stories.  ""well, yes, some planets are.""  ""our sky is stone. why did you come to here?""  ""it's winter on the surface,"" he explained unhelpfully.  ""winter?""  ""cold. a long time of very cold. your planet spends four months--two highwaters, to you-- on the dark side of its rotation. have i told you about rotation?""  rotation was when the ball of the world turned to face or turned its back on the flame it circled in the nothing-sky. ""yes.""  ""when this part of the planet's turned away from its sun, it gets very cold and dark, and that is your planet's winter.""  i did not understand. i lived in a world of stone skies, not a planet with a sky of air and a fire to circle. ""but why come here? where did you come from?""  ""my ship's broken. i need to fix it, but i got here right at the start of winter. i had to choose between staying with my broken ship and possibly freezing to death, or looking for better shelter."" he smiled,""i think i made the right decision. when this highwater ends, i'll leave again.""  ""are you going back to your world?""  ""no."" the stranger's smile faltered, and when it came back there was something off about it, something artificial. ""but i'll find something. i always do.""  he left then to join the children at their game, leaving me with only more questions.  the stranger's popularity waned as his stay drew to a close. his stories, once fantastical tales of far-off worlds, began to center closer to home. some of the elders took offense, and others flat-out disbelieved him. it was one thing to tell stories, but another to claim to come from beyond the stone teeth that mark the end of the world as all our legends say they do. it is one thing to emerge from the eternal forest, the cradle of our people, but another to claim that it has an end which can be walked to. still, as sensibilities and beliefs were bruised and his following lessened, i stayed on. as his time with the village grew shorter, i asked found myself pumping him for more and more and more. i liked to think i was coy or clever about what i planned to do with my knowledge, but i now realize he knew what was happening.  ""what's past the forest?""  ""a cliff face, which goes about a half-mile straight up. 1400 staves, to you.""  ""what's at the top?""  ""a ledge, which leads to a tunnel.""  ""through the tunnel?""  ""the tunnel's a labyrinth, a maze.""  ""how do you get through?""  i was not a very deceptive young one. two days after the laughing man left, i followed.  it is strange, how something can be both longer and shorter than you anticipate. under the branches of the macrobrachymycia, where greatwings swooped and hunted overhead and no lumycia grew to mark day and night, each moment grew into an eternity. i found myself thinking that, even if i did not make it to the stone teeth at the end of the world, i would have nearly as many stories to tell as the stranger had.  the white greatwing, the hungry blind mycrivore, climbing the wall of the world, the string through the labyrinth--that last was a length of fishing twine the stranger had taken from my village when he left. when i reached the maze of tunnels, there on the wall outside the entrance was a metal spike with the string tied around it, leading into the darkness beyond like a hand rail. though i saw many wonders down the narrow passages, my hand never strayed from that twine.  then the roaring white water which fell down, down, down a pit to nowhere, the greatwing roost, an empty village, and the silverfern field. it spread in all directions, delicate reflective leaves below and a strange, white-glowing lumycia overhead, so vast that the walls of the world were lost to sight and the stone sky hung low. i found the stranger's track through the field easily for he had carelessly, or perhaps purposely, trodden down a clear trail through the fern. i considered how far i had come, and realized i must be over 3000 staves above the ground on which i'd begun, having walked a continual incline. i must be high enough to touch the sky of air, as i could nearly touch the sky of stone above me now.  the longest part of the journey was through the silverfern fields. the strange lumycia glowed white at all hours, making day indistinguishable from night save for by hunger.  at the far end of the fern was another forest, but this one entirely unlike my own. no macrobrachymycia, but trees--small, but still the light-eaters the stranger spoke of. strange beings like soft miniature greatwings which stood atop branches rather than hang underneath sang sweet, tuneless notes. the forest was small, hardly three staves of trees before i reached the shore of a wide, still pool. water lapped gently at the edges, and something with a voice both musical and hoarse croaked and splashed into the calm water. i was unconcerned with all of this, for what i saw was more amazing even than the light-eating trees.  fear tried to bind me in place at the edge of the forest, but rapture held my eyes open and led me forward until my feet were touching the edge of the pool. around me, great arches and peaks, columns and hanging daggers of stone rose and dipped from floor and ceiling. the stone teeth.  strange light like warm honey over gold shone between the arches and played off the water. from within or beyond, i could not tell, came the sweet smell of alien flowers and tuneless, distant music. behind me, my world stayed as ever cool and dark. before me, the air moved like a thing alive and beckoned from across the water. it was then that i truly understood that the stone teeth was not where my world ended.  it was where the world began.",0,,
606741,"journey's beginnings - [dmt]  ""on the trip to the house, i felt a strange calmness in regards to the trip. i have only had one other disappointing lsd trip long ago. i remember a distinct nervousness before the lsd trip and the prevailing nervousness also kept me from attempting salvia in the past. however, this did not exist before this trip. rather, there was a strong 'calm' about me as i drove to the location in complete silence, preparing myself for the journey i was about to embark.  upon arrival, everyone was ready to go. we had abstained from marijuana the entire day in order to remain clear-headed before the journey, yet it seemed to be the farthest thing from our minds. as we sat in his room, preparing the first cannon (i was going first), i still remained eerily calm even though i had no idea what was awaiting me on the other side. once ready, the lights were killed and a light, transient playlist was queued up. we planned to allow full immersion by preparing the room in a way that the subject was seated in a what was essentially a large pillow-chair facing a blank wall.  the time came to begin my journey--i had purchased a new piece just for the occasion and we were using the parsley sandwich method. i eyeballed out what i later calculated to be ~20mg. lightly vaporizing the top layer of parsley, keeping the dancing flame from igniting it, i slowly inhaled and held my first hit for approximately thirty seconds. i repeated with the second hit. i felt the world around me begin to form and shape itself, the material existences bending and twisting at the will of the gods and colors the auras began emanating from everything. by the time i brought the mouthpiece to my lips for a third hit, the vibration were so strong i felt as if i was being pulled between two worlds. i took the third hit, finally lighting the top of the parsley, but only gently to get a top-cherry burning. as i laid my head back and exhaled, i was lost to this realm.  i was swirling flashing colors everything. spinning and twirling and flashing the most beautiful colors i had ever seen. all of a sudden things began to take a form. a backdrop of gold-outlined ""cards"" with a pitch black center filled the entire vastness of existence in what felt like a perfect circular pattern around me. while i was mesmerized by the colors portrayed before me, i felt that there was more to be reached by focusing into the black center rather than the gold outline.   shapes began spiraling out of the wall, forming what looked serpentine made of smaller versions of the card backdrop. this serpent-card structure's colors included red, black, golden yellow, and white. atop the head of the serpent was a head with ram horns and a long snout. the head seemed to have a feminine, inviting quality to it, although very distinctly animalistic with a greenish color to the snout and yellowish horns with bright yellow tips. the creature stared at me, as if trying to decipher who or what i was and felt to be trying to communicate with me. its eyes held the same feeling as the black openings of the backdrop, but so much more powerful--as if it held all the answers i was seeking. it was at this time i felt a horrible nausea (shouldn't've eaten that protein bar just before partaking) and ended up purging into a bin nearby. the vision of the ram-serpent hung in front of me even as i purged, as if telling me that its meant to happen. i was able to pry my eyes open to some degree at this point, staring down into the trash bin and saw the whole twisting, astoundingly luminescent being pulsing energy into me as i watched it move so fluently. it appeared as if it were bound to this small bit of space in this world as i laid back and closed my eyes again.   i watched the colors begin to pull back and felt as if i, too, was being pulled back. a new backdrop took place, consisting of gleaming pale-yellow-to-white bars of alternating extensions and distensions. the bars appeared to be made of a high-gloss marble and shone as such. from this emerged seven angels looking to be composed of the same material. they appeared to grows from the wall, jutting out as if reaching out for me. i felt a song emanating from them as if they were trying to pull me closer to them. i reached out, trying to stay with them, but felt myself being pulled further and further from their reach.  as the angels fell further and further from my vision, i regained my ego and opened my eyes, but the sacrament had not finished showing me what it had to show. upon opening my eyes, the entire worlds was vibrating with energy. not in the same way the trip was in the beginning, but in a much more complex fashion. the auras no longer came from only material objects. instead, i saw every bit of energy in the world flowing freely through me and through everything. i saw how connected everything was. this was not a new experience as this idea dawned on me long ago. however, i never could've imagined seeing it as it truly is nor understood it as it truly is had i not witnessed it myself. the energies radiated in the fluer-de-lis pattern, with the central point of each aura glowing a bright and strong red and emanating this energy out in perfect harmony with every other aura.  i sat there for a few minutes absorbing everything i has just experienced and watched the oev's begin to fade. once i was sufficiently functional to stand, i rose and prepared my friend for his journey.""",0,,
493366,"“nazi methamphetamine” tabletop recipe: standard equipment needed (5 grams): 7.5 grams iodine prill or iodine crystals ephedrine or pseudoephedrine….1665 pills produces 5 pure grams sodium hydroxide…………………1 pint red devil lye 3.5 grams red-phosphorus…...5000 matchbook’s 250ml glass flask…………………2 20oz plastic jug’s…………………2 coffee filters……………………….6 electric coffee cup warmer….1 6’’ or longer rubber hoses…...3 plastic gallon jug’s…...1 the push/pull does not take a lot of skill but does take a bit of understanding of what one is dealing with. first of all this method does require some very watched items. red phosphorous and iodine crystals can bring unwanted attention if ordered from different supply companies. if by chance one cannot seem to obtain these items anywhere, there is still hope. it is possible to obtain these items otc (over the counter) at your nearest supermarket. if one can get one's hands on lab grade without getting a one-way ticket to the slammer, it is well worth it. the striking pads of matchbooks contain a small amount of red phosphorous. it is not pure, so consider cleaning it up a bit before use. it is possible to convert iodine tinctures to iodine crystals. tinctures can be found on the shelves of many different supermarkets, and come in 30 ml bottles of 2% iodine in solution. tinctures are also available at cattle supply houses, in pint and gallon sizes, which contain 7% iodine in solution. iodine prill, a common name for iodine powder or pellets often available in cattle supply stores as well, works great just the way it is. there are many different ways to collect red phosphorous from the striking pads of matchbooks. scraping it off with a razor blade is a simple collection process. a better way is to cut the strikers off and soak them in acetone until the red phosphorous falls off. it takes a very large number of strikers to obtain a large enough pile to do anything with, but it is a proven method in use by many people. when all of the phosphorous falls off the paper, remove the paper, filter the acetone/red phosphorous through two coffee filters, rinse with distilled water, and let dry. now mix up a solution of 20% sodium hydroxide. that is 20% grams of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of distilled water. place the dry red phosphorous in a beaker or flask of choice and add the hydroxide solution to it. heat this mixture on low heat for a few hours, and then filter through two coffee filters again. when dry, rinse with hot distilled water a few times and let dry. this will produce a more pure powder that will fire off a push/pull reaction.  to convert 2% iodine tinctures, the following are used: 500 ml 2% iodine tincture 125 ml muramic acid (hardware store strength) 235 ml hydrogen peroxide (3% topical solution) 862 ml distilled water to convert 7% iodine tinctures, the following are used: 1 pint of 7% tincture 3 pints of 3% peroxide 2 oz. of muriatic acid '/a cup of distilled water pour the tincture in a one-gallon milk jug, add the muriatic acid, and mix it all together well. let this mixture sit for half an hour. now add the 3% hydrogen peroxide, with thorough mixing, and let it sit for another half an hour. next, add the distilled water and shake vigorously until your arms tire, then let it sit for another half an hour. there should be an orange layer on top of a dark grey layer. the grey layer is what you want. the grey layer is iodine crystals that have crashed out of solution. pour off the orange layer, add more fresh distilled water to them, and shake again. let it sit for a few minutes, and then pour off the orange solution again. repeat this process three times, and after the third time, pour the contents through two coffee filters. now one must wring dry the crystals in the coffee filters. wring dry, put them in another stack of coffee filters, and wring them out again. keep doing this until one gets a nice solid dry ball of crystals. that is it. one should have nice iodine crystals that will work in the reaction. store the crystals in a dark-colored jar or bottle. warning: when making one's own crystals from tinctures, wear eye protection and chemical resistant gloves. remember that iodine is poisonous, so be safe, and work outdoors.  figure 40 the push/pull set up stopper’s, lids &amp; hoses sealed tight! as one can see from figure 40, it is very easy to construct the apparatus for this reaction. a small clear beer bottle can replace the flask if one is not on hand. this setup easily scales larger or smaller for different size batches. if, for example, one wants to do a 20-gram batch, use a 500 ml flask or bottle and two 64-oz. plastic gatorade jugs. make sure all the hoses scale in place because one does not want any leaks. the reaction can be very quick, but other times it may not be. keep a bucket of dirt or sand at hand to smother any possible phosphorous fire. a phosphorous fire is a possibility, so be on the safe side. with lab grade red phosphorous and iodine crystals, the ratios by weight are 1-gram pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl to 1 gram of iodine crystals to 0.5 gram of red phosphorous. with otc chemicals, the ratios are 1-gram pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl to 1.5 grams of iodine crystals to 0.7 gram of red phosphorous. so now, let us get started with the reaction. first thing to do is set up the push/pull vessel. fill the first water tank with distilled water % of the way full. the second one leave empty. one can either put the drain hose from the second tank down the drain past the u trap or in a bucket of cat litter. weigh out the pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl and place inside the flask or bottle, no more than a 10-gram batch in a  250 ml size flask or bottle. next weigh out the iodine crystals and put them inside with the pseudoephedrine/ephedrine hcl. mix them together very well and stopper the flask or bottle and place it in the freezer for around 3-4 minutes. weigh out the red phosphorous. take the flask from the freezer, the reactants should be dark and may be a dark thick-looking mud. place the red phosphorous in the flask, mix in good with a glass rod, and hook it up to the water tanks. if the drain hose is down the drain, it is time to turn on the water to keep the fumes down. if using lab grade chemicals, one may have to add a few drops of distilled water to get the reaction going. for otc chemicals, one should need no water; just heat the reactants a little and it should be fine. do not flood the reaction with water! place the flask on a coffee cup warmer or in a hot water bath. when the reaction starts, take it off the heat. during the first phase of the reaction, the mixture turns to a thick liquid and starts bubbling. the small bubbles will be somewhat silvery looking. some gas may now be pushing into the first water tank and water into the second. the contents inside the flask will raise some. a light yellow-colored mist and white fog inside the flask is normal. continue to add, on and off, heat to maintain an easy bubbling reaction, at least around 15-20 minutes or until bubbling begins to slow. in the next phase, increase heat to the flask; slowly raise it up to between 160°-180° f. the reaction should begin to bubble very rapidly. the color of the reaction will change to a dark purple or reddish with a yellow tint. the small reaction bubbles will start turning into big bubbles that collapse into large holes. the reaction should be pushing gas into water tanks, but a lot harder this time. the contents will rise quickly, and may start to smoke. if so, remove from the heat and swirl the contents around in the flask to get the smoking to stop. swirling will also keep the •reactants from rising too high. let react until all ^seems to be dead inside the flask (no reaction) even with applied heat. a pull may be noted. if not, that is all right too. sometimes there is no pull with small reactions. tilt the flask. if reactants slowly flow off the bottom and sides and are not longer stuck, it should be finished. let cool to room temperature, and then add 100 ml of distilled water. next, in an open flask and on water bath, heat the mixture at 150° f for 30 minutes in order to free the contents. filter all the red phosphorous out of the mix. a couple of coffee filters also works well for filtering the red phosphorous out, the color should be clear to pale yellow. if one gets a dark orange or red color that does not filter out, the reaction might not be complete or the adulterants in the pills may have messed it up. if this is the case, try putting the red phosphorous back into the water from which it was filtered. heat it up to about 200° f for two hours to complete it. if this does not work, the crap in the pills may have messed the reaction up. now it is time to base and extract the meth base with a non-polar solvent such as toluene. wash the solvent/base layer with distilled water a few times, and dry with dehydrated epsom salts. gas the solvent/base layer to get crystals of methamphetamine.",0,,

849247,"&gt;... and though china has relaxed its profoundly wrongheaded one-child policy, ...  the policy that saved china, they mean? who writes this crap? they're at 1.3 billion people. if they hadn't adopted this policy, they'd be in an even worse situation; one that would only spiral downwards - instead of the one they're in now, which will be an issue - but a one time bump to deal with.  it just gets better:  &gt;but like south korea--and, for that matter, japan--china is not terribly hospitable to ethnic outsiders, including members of non-han minorities native to china. observers tend to overstate the level of ethnic homogeneity in china, not least because the han category masks tremendous cultural diversity. ""hanness"" is as broad and contingent a category as ""whiteness.""  two of these countries are very homogeneous. one is not. china has a large han majority, yep, in the mixup there are over 56 ethnic groups - and the reason ""han"" grew so large is because many of the historical ethnic groups just ended up 'being han'. it sounds like the dude that wrote this went there and took one look at them and said ""well, they look alike, it's all just one ethnicity i guess.""  there's definitely a sort of 'racism', the undertone of it - like our media (this article is a prime example if you ask me) has with east asia, but that's a deep cultural thing - and almost all the ethnic groups within china hold it. (when you have a history that literally makes you the oldest (and first?) continuous civilized 'sort of nation but mostly just the region' in the world, well, there's a lot of pride there)  i find this hilarious:  &gt;china, traditional notions about culturally inferior ""barbarians"" intermingled with western forms of scientific racism to form a distinctively chinese racial consciousness in the 20th century. the ""yellows"" were locked in a struggle with their equals, the ""whites""--and both were superior to the ""blacks,"" ""browns"" and ""reds.""  sounds almost like wishful thinking. it's more ""nation"" based than ""race based"", and ""whites"" in an equal struggle? if the article writer is first going to enter that area he/she should at least know that a typical chinese mainlander (of any ethnic background) tends to see a ""white person"" as just as much as a 'hairy barbarian from a young culture' as anyone else.  they all have a thing for paleness though - but that goes back to the same reasoning as it did in any culture. whatever trait the 'nobles' and 'rich people' might end up with (for cultures where wealth or status allowed sheltering and typically never being outside - it was paler skin), people end up seeing as good fashion. (for many of our cultures/regions, darker skin might be seen as better fashion - due to the extra *effort* we need to get that, etc. same shit.)",1,1,1

641800,"it makes perfect sense to add other psychoactive substances to marijuana.  marijuana varies wildly between genus (indica, sativa, ruderalis - ditch / gross), quality (swag, regs, kine or kind bud / kb's) strain (ak-47, blueberry yum yum, green crack, sour diesel, purple haze, columbian red, chronic, black russian, etc.), growers can change even the same strain to be completely different from plant to plant and season to season then finally you get to the dealers who at the end of it are trying to get paid too.  the majority of dealers deal under the one pound range so every dollar counts to them and if they can get an oz. of swag for 60 bucks and put twenty dollars of pcp in it and sell it at the price of regs there gonna make roughly 40% over what they would've if they would've bought the regs and sold them themselves.  especially with upstart dealers its something to look out for unless your specifically looking for sherm (pcp and weed). given the clientel that those dealers serve its fairly easy for them to pass it off as just good grass to inexperianced cannabis users.  fortunately its fairly easy to evaluate marijuana.  dryness is an important factor, the dryer it is the easier it is to break up, but the wetter it is the harder it is to get it to ""roll"" or to get your blunt to joint to light.  things to look for is marijuana that falls somewhere in the goldilocks area of wet and dry for you that will have a medium to light green color, purple or black, or even white! though the whiteness comes from the ""crystals"" where the thc is stored (called keif in its raw form), which is one of the biggest things to look for.  also the hairs, usually orange but they also vary.   also on the subject of pcp laced weed.  it can get you very, very, very high (think high two or three days later off of one bowl kinda high).  so high in fact that it kinda ruins the experiance of regular marijuana.  it also has the potental to be highly psychologically addictive and its a very powerful disassociative that causes out of body experiances, feelings of oneness, anger, euphoria, feelings of invincability and or being superman (no joke).  it can be both very dangerous for the user and those around them.  usually weed is laced with pcp because it's cheap and you get really high.  but if its not around there are ways to lace it with methamphetamine, cocaine, opiates, ecstacy, lsd, pyschosilibin, or almost any other thats cheap or easy to get or manufacture.  there is also a small risk of dealers who want to keep customers using very small amounts of highly addictive substances within there product. in a similar manner to the way ecstacy is usually cut with highly addictive substances (heroin and meth being probably the most common).  to answer your question, no marijuana is not dangerous within itself.  its ld-50 is outrageously high...  you'd run out of air before you can put enough in you to kill yourself.   if your interested in marijuana the best bet is find a more experianced and trusted friend to help see you through it until you have a general feel for the substance itself and its effects.  hold bags and smell a lot (smell gives it all away but its hard to describe, go for sweet pine trees, fruity, or even sometimes skunky to start), look at it, study it.  load bowls and roll joints and blunts. use grinders, or break it down with your fingers or even, as some do, golden scissors. eat a browny and taste it.  most important, do something!  being high is so much better when your doing and if you start being high and active earlier in your pot smoking it will be easier not to turn into a lazy stoner (and no-one likes a lazy stoner).  finally you'll get a feel for it after a few years and develop your own connections and preferences and won't have to worry about what your friends say cause you'll know better and support your local norml.   best tip of the day - never buy from or sell to someone who wont get high in front of you - ever!  they're narcs and you will go to jail.  bearing in mind that selling / buying usually carries a heavier sentence.  also keep in mind any laws regarding schools / churches / government buildings and the increased fines and or jailtime that may come with them.  for those interested heres how drugs look where i live.

914322,"harmful to the earth? lots of evidence you presented there, i dont know where to start. youve got it all wrong though, consumption is not harmful - youre referring to co2 there, which is a life giving gas. plants need co2 to create oxygen, more co2 = more food for us. our cars and our exhaling is not causing the increased co2 either, as evidence shows its the sun heating up, which is heating the other planets in the solar system at a similar rate.  back to peak oil, heres some more info for you by pjw:  what the researchers found http://www.oralchelation.com/faq/wsj4.htm when they analyzed the oil field with time lapse 3-d seismic imaging is that there was an unexplained deep fault in the bottom corner of the computer scan, which showed oil gushing in from a previously unknown deep source and migrating up through the rock to replenish the existing supply.  furthermore, the analysis of the oil now being produced at eugene island shows that its age is geologically different from the oil produced there after the refinery first opened. suggesting strongly that it is now emerging from a different, unexplained source.  the last estimates of probable reserves shot up from 60 million barrels to 400 million barrels.  both the scientists and geologists from the big oil companies have seen the evidence and admitted that the eugene island oil field is refilling itself.  this completely contradicts peak oil theory and with technology improving at an accelerating pace it seems obvious that there are more eugene islands out there waiting to be discovered. so the scientific community needs to embrace these possibilities and lobby for funding into finding more of these deep source replenishing oilfields.  the existence of self-renewing oil fields shatters the peak oil myth. if oil is a naturally replenishing inorganic substance then how can it possibly run out?  the future of oil  this year in particular we have seen a strong hike in oil prices and are being told to simply get used to it because this is the way it is going to be. in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita gas prices have shot up http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2005-10-02-gas-prices-usat_x.htm amid claims of vast energy shortages. americans are being asked to turn off lights, http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/politics/03letter.html?ex=1129003200&amp;en=a07828b8a83a01d4&amp;ei=5059&amp;partner=aol change thermostat settings, drive slower, http://www.belleville.com/mld/belleville/news/12808568.htm insulate homes and take other steps. meanwhile the oil companies continue to make record profits.  flying in the face of the so called peak oil crisis are the facts. if we are running out of oil so quickly then why are reserves being continually increased and production skyrocketing?  in the 1980s opec decided to switch to a quota production system based on the size of reserves. the larger the reserves a country said it had the more it could pump.  earlier this year saudi arabia reportedly increased its crude reserves http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=61713&amp;d=7&amp;m=4&amp;y=2005 by around 200 billion barrels. saudi oil is secure and plentiful, say officials. http://www.arabnews.com/?page=6&amp;section=0&amp;article=44011&amp;d=29&amp;m=4&amp;y=2004  “these huge reserves enable the kingdom to remain a major oil producer for between 70 and 100 years, even if it raises its production capacity to 15 million barrels per day, which may well happen during the next 15 years,”  is this the normal course of behavior if we are currently at the peak for oil production? the answer is no, it's the normal course of action for increasing production.  there have also been reports that russia has vastly increased its reserves http://www.powerpolitics.org/archives/000004.html even beyond those of saudi arabia. why would they do this if they believed there would be no more oil to get hold of? it seems clear that russia is ready for unlimited future production of oil. http://www.vialls.com/wecontrolamerica/peakoil.html  there is a clear contradiction between the peak oil theory and the continual increase in oil reserves and production.  new untapped oil sources are being discovered everywhere on earth. the notion that there are somehow only a few sources that the west is trying to monopolize is a complete myth, promulgated by those raking in the massive profits. after all how do you make huge profits from something available in abundance?  http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_wsj-oil_oil.htm a wall street journal article by peter huber and mark mills describes how the price of oil remains high because the cost of oil remains so low. we are not dependent on the middle east for oil because the world's supplies are diminishing, it is because it is more profitable to tap middle east supplies. thus the myth of peak oil is needed in order to silence the call for tapping the planet's other plentiful reserves.  richard branson has even stated his intention to set up his own refinery http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4255156.stm because the price of oil is artificially being kept high whilst new sources are not being explored and new refineries not being built.  ""opec is effectively an illegal cartel that can meet happily, nobody takes them to court,"" branson has said. ""they collude to keep prices high.""  so if more refineries were built and different resources tapped, the oil prices would come down and the illegal cartel opec would see profits diminish. it is no wonder then that the argument for peak oil is so appealing to opec. if no one invests to build refineries because they don't believe there is enough oil, then who benefits? opec and the oil elites of course.  it seems that every time there is some kind of energy crisis, opec increases production. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4264642.stm the remarkable thing about this is that they always state that they are doing it to ease prices, yet prices always shoot up because they promulgate the myth that they are putting some of their last reserves into the market. analysts seem confused and always state that they don't believe upping production will cut prices.  in a recent report the international monetary fund projected that global demand for oil by 2030 would reach 139 million barrels a day, a 65 percent increase.  ""we should expect to live with high and volatile oil prices,"" said raghuram rajan, the imf's chief economist. ""in short, it's going to be a rocky road going forward.""  yet independent analysts and even some within opec seem to believe that the demand for oil is diminishing. why the contradiction?  the peak oil and demand myth is peddled by the establishment-run fake left activist groups, opec and globalist arms such as the imf.  rolling stone magazine http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/_/id/7203633?pageid=rs.home&amp;pageregion=single7&amp;rnd=1111922613104&amp;has-player=true&amp;version=6.0.12.857 even carried an article in its april issue heavily biased towards making people believe the peak oil lie.  the scientific evidence also flies in the face of the peak oil theory. scientific research dating back over a hundred years, http://www.conspiracyplanet.com/channel.cfm?channelid=63&amp;contentid=2819&amp;page=2 more recently updated in a scientific paper published in 'energia' suggests that oil is abiotic, not the product of long decayed biological matter. oil, for better or for worse, is not a non-renewable resource. it, like coal, and natural gas, replenishes from sources within the mantle of earth.  no coincidence then that the russians, who pioneered this research have pumped expenditure into deep underground oil excavation.  we have previously scientifically exposed the scam behind peak oil. here is a 1 hour+ audio clip http://www.prisonplanet.com/audio/110405peakoil.mp3 featuring alex jones' comments on peak oil and then the analysis of respected scientific commentator dr. nick begich who presents evidence to suggest the idea of peak oil is artificial.  a dangerous fallout precedent being set is that people on both the left and right believe wars are being fought in order to tap the last reserves of oil on the planet. the ""coalition of the willing"", whoever they may be for any given war, will not pay particular attention to refuting this claim because it allows them a reason to start and continue said war.  even though many will see it as immoral, many will subconsciously attach it as a reason for the war. in reality the war is purely for profit, power and control, oil can be a part of that, but only if the peak oil claim is upheld.  if we continue to let the corrupt elite tell us we are wholly dependent on oil, we may reach a twisted situation whereby they can justify starvation and mass global poverty, perhaps even depopulation, even within the western world due to the fact that our energy supplies are finished.  peak oil is just another weapon the globalists have in their arsenal to move towards a new world order where the elite get richer and everyone else falls into line.  http://www.prisonplanet.com/archives/peak_oil/index.htm",0,,
760808,"if you're living in a part of the world where internet access is cheap, you might want to watch the [photography critique videos of zack arias](http://www.zarias.com/?cat=82) - he's got a lot to say about presenting a good portfolio to prospective clients, and i found it quite interesting.  i'm kind of new at this my self, so feel free to disagree, but here's what i think about your photos:   * [siblings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3764983147/in/set-72157622897229814/) - the girl on the left has a telegraph pole growing out the top of her head, and the photograph is tilted but there doesn't seem to be a compelling compositional reason for it. she's nice and in-focus but her eyes are in shadow and there's this distracting bright white shape in the background over her shoulder.  * [departure](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3764983143/in/set-72157622897229814/) - i like your concept: like looking through a forest of legs at different distances. you almost had a nice composition with the person in yellow being framed by the black pants to the left and the right - but there's more coloured, in-focus stuff on the far right, and there's brightly coloured blobs in the distance at the very top of the frame. crop out those distracting elements, and maybe boost the exposure a little, and this would look better.  * [shoes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3691335769/in/set-72157622897229814/) - i really dig the ochre and red and brown of the monks' clothing against the pale road, and the yellow painted line reinforces their clothing and their direction - well spotted! the only thing i have to say about this photo is that the brightest spot is the... bag... thingy at the top left, which is unrelated to the subject and doesn't quite match the colours and intrudes across the frame-edge, all sins of composition. crop it off and focus on the visual rhythm of the monks' feet, and you'll be fine.  * [monk2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3692142018/in/set-72157622897229814/) - this one's not so good. the camera-tilt is distracting, but i'm not sure what it's distracting me *from* if you wanted to contrast the two monks, one with hat and one without, you'd need to have them evenly spaced against an even background. if you wanted the guy on the right, he's just about to bang his nose against the edge of the frame - very uncomfortable. you could make a better photo by focussing on the guy on the left in his natural, unposed bemusement, but maybe not a *great* photo.  * [mongolia](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3692140236/in/set-72157622897229814/) - nicely draped, colourful flag, held up against a clear blue sky... but again, the brightest part of this photo is the building clipped off the left, not the subject. also, beautifully framed in the arch of the raised arm and the descending flag is... uh, a red traffic light. if that's deliberate, i'm not quite sure what message you're trying to get across with this photo. also, random assorted body parts in the background are a bit distracting.  * [ordførar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3692140764/in/set-72157622897229814/) - an interesting looking guy, with interesting-looking clothes, captured in an energetic pose. good stuff! a pity about all the distracting detail in the backgrounds, though. i see you're using the kit 18-55mm kit lens - you might consider shelling out for a fast prime like the af-s 35mm f/1.8 or the af 50mm f/1.8 - at wide apertures it's easier to get the shallow depth-of-field required to blur away all the distracting background.  * [profit!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3624488735/in/set-72157622897229814/) - this picture is under exposed, and could probably do with some white-balance work.  man, this is taking a while... forgive me if i fast-forward to the photos where i have something significant to say. :)   * [fish](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3604351967/in/set-72157622897229814/) - gaah, the edges of the steps he's sitting on don't line up with the edge of the frame! so annoying! also, there's quite a bit more room above his head than there is to his right or below him; which looks a little unbalanced.  * [branch](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3691519807/in/set-72157622897229814/) - love it. the green and brown on the left, the blue and black on the right; lines and angles on the left, circles and natural blobs on the right; low-contrast on the left, high-contrast on the right; blurry and indistinct on the left, sharp focus on the right. the single worst thing about this image is the bokeh; the kit 18-55mm lens tends to make somewhat distracting, hard lines instead of a totally smooth blur, but there's not really much you could have done about that and as i mentioned it kind of adds to the creative contrast.  * [street ""art""](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3611288154/in/set-72157622897229814/) - if you're going to take a photo that invites the viewer to compare two equal and opposite things - say, a blue painting on a white square and a red painting on a white square - you should make sure that they really are equal - that the camera is square-on and there's no visible perspective or tilting. then you can introduce other elements like the bicyclist to break up the pattern a little - but you need to start with a pattern.  * [batllo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/a-s-d-f/3614228711/in/set-72157622897229814/) - this is so filled with interesting curves and patterns of light, and the mysterious female framed in the most distant arch is an excellent addition. it does seem a bit under-exposed, but if you boosted the midtones the lovely light-rays might get blown out, so i dunno.  i'll also second what other people have said about contrast in your b&amp;w photos. with colour, you can only boost the contrast by so much until it looks silly, because humans tend to see in colour and we have expectations about what things should look like. if you're looking at a black-and-white picture, however, it *already* doesn't look like what we expect, and so you can push the contrast much, much further  before it begins to look silly. get to know the 'levels' or 'curves' feature of your favourite photo-editing tool, and have a play around.  edit: in the interests of fairness, here's [my flickr best-of set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/thristian/sets/72057594095750331/) for you to pick apart. :)",0,,

hub around which many of the ancient sygian civilizations began. many of those civilizations still endure in the form of cultural practices, but also as nations. among those, there is eboria, hyroch, and the rain kingdom. sygians also have a presence in caleban and lodain, where they have mixed so heavily with palians that many people are considered two races at once, though racial considerations are almost ignored in these crossover regions.  sygians are a medium-built, robust people who are known for their industriousness and their bravery in battle. they are pale-skinned, with hair and eyes that are fair.   varlothi  the varlothi are native to the regions in and around the nation of varloth.  they derive their name from their nation, which means ‘father-land’. they also consider themselves to be the ‘first people’, as they were the first civilization to emerge, centred around the land of five rivers, known as aumedhra, or ‘god’s hand’. they are known as the 'eternal people', as the nation of varloth has existed in its current form for millennia, avoiding revolution and recovering in the face of disaster.  varlothi are morphologically distinct from most other races. they are very tall and thin, have long angular faces, ashen skin, straight black hair, and eyes that can be any colour, though most commonly red. they are very long-lived, having lifespans of up to 200 years, and are generally known for their intelligence, pragmatism, and organization.     mordunni  the mordunni are native to the island of morduin and surrounding areas.  they are related to the varlothi, who tried and failed to colonize morduin, a barren land of fire and ash. the colonizers soon scattered, mixing with the natives (the giants) and taking the blackroot. this plant gave them their distinct black scleras but also increased their aggression and lifespan. over the ages, this ethnic and diertary shift created a culture that was highly distinct from the varlothi, one that is aggressive and expansionist.   mordunni are tall and robust. they are known for ruthlessness, organization, and prowess in battle. they have black hair, red eyes, and grey skin.  aullothi  the aullothi are native to the south-eastern corner of ros.  they derive their name from the varsithian word aula, meaning ‘south’, as the birthplace of their civilization is to the south of varloth. they live in great numbers in the city-states around the three seas, but also in the desert areas further inland. the larger nations that are thought of as ethnically and culturally aullothi are kalash, adara, izhil, and the paradise island of laurek.   aulians are of medium build, but slight. they are generally known for their ingenuity and adventurous spirit. they have dark skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes.  palian  palians are native to south-western ros. they are known often as ‘southerners’.   like sygians, the palians derive their name from the cradle of their civilization, the river pallas. however, their culture spread quickly through trade and exploration, both on sea and on land. today, many nations can count their heritage and culture as distinctly ‘palian’, such as antassar, helkaera, khedimar, and so3uthern lodain. there are also some palian footprints in caleban as well, a testament to the breadth of the old antean empire.  paleans are of smallish build, and they are known for their quick wits and agility. they are olive-skinned, with dark hair and eyes that are generally brown or green.  **mythology**  i have not entirely fleshed this part out yet, but i have a rough idea. this is how it begins, though keep in mind that this is a preliminary draft and i'll probably change a lot of stuff:  chapter one: udum  in the beginning, there was udum, a wild storm of dark roiling fire, and this was all. this form existed out of time, and its origins stretch back into the peerless infinities the likes of which neither mortal nor god can fathom.  the udum was by its nature wild, destructive, and insane. but in this way, it was also blessed with an arbitrary and aimless nature. and thus, despite its irredeemable evil, it eventually and quite accidentally bore the fruit of good. after countless aeons of this udum, the dark fires coalesced in such a way as to produce order, and thus from the furious depths was born a being of brilliant white light.  chapter two: aumea  the first sound his virgin conscious was graced with was the harmonious and beautiful ringing of his own birth, a resounding “aum”, which had been so loud and piercing as to push back the roiling flame. and in those first moments, all he knew was this sound and an awareness of himself. therefore, aum was his name, and he proclaimed it. this was the first thing he did.  upon realizing himself thusly, he sought out the external realm. all around him was a swirling dark fire, and slowly the ringing of his birth was drowned by the horrible roar. and the darkness began to close in on his womb of harmony. the flames began to strike him, and they burned hot and cold as this is the nature of pain and udum. but in his short time of life, aum had realized the power of righteousness, and upon being inflicted so, cast out part of himself in defense. these fragments of aum launched out into the abyssal fires, and pushed them back forever, creating the sky. and these particles which held back the darkness were to be the stars. thus the heavens were created, and also a large and generous realm of peace that was to belong to aum, which he named aumea. this was the second thing he did.   then, aum was tired, and so he slept.  (fyi, this beginning could be construed as a 'big bang'. that's why it is the way it is.)   chapter three: trivium  upon awakening, aum observed the stillness of his realm, and began to sing, for it was all that he knew and all that brought him joy. but soon, he found himself wanting of a greater harmony that would resound to the edge of the stars, and thus he needed more voices.  therefore, he sought to make company for himself. he recalled two stars from different portions of the heavens. with his right hand, he recalled a blue star, and with his left, a red one. upon seeing these stars manifested in this way, aum looked to himself and noticed his pure white glowing majesty. aum then came to the realization that the stars had been tainted by udum, which they held at bay. the red had within it an aspect of the scalding heat, and the blue star, an aspect of the biting cold. but lo, he said “fuck it”, for the stars still shone brightly and were for the most part virtuous, and he could not divide himself further, lest he divide his own holy power.   aum then took these two stars, and with a gentle malleation, he forged them into two beings. the red one was ros and the blue one yssa, and they were his daughters.  their form was different from their father’s. having been forged by hand, aum had created the two beings as beautifully as he could, and made them with supple curves and lithe bodies. therefore, they had a form that was feminine.    together, the three began to sing the first song, a song of such beauty that the mortal minds cannot begin to describe it, as nothing of our time has matched it, and nothing more beautiful has ever come into existence. the song was of such beauty in fact that the daughters of aum were moved. they were moved to the point where the imperfect kernels of passion within themselves lashed out, and they could sing no longer. and even they, creatures of unfathomable might, could not withstand the beauty and began to weep.  aum, feeling the natural concern of a father, sought to help them, but the two rejected his helping hand, for their passion was so great, and their tears were many. with every approach he made to ros, she revolted in anger. aum warned her thrice that he would punish her if she continued, but alas, he had made her imperfect, and she continued to push him away with increasing violence.  and then she struck him with a hand that was obscured in darkness, and burned like fire. and though she expressed her immediate regret, aum saw the dark flame within her. aum thus showed that he was not a kind god, but above all else a just one. therefore, he smote her with righteous fury, and plunged his hand into her chest and removed her flaming heart from which the passion had originated. he cast the heart as far as he could, into udum.    so, now maimed and heartless, ros fell into a deep sleep that was not unlike death.  now, aum turned to yssa in anger, fully expecting her to act as her sister had. but instead, she recoiled in fear, begging her father not to maim her as he had her sister. and aum saw that yssa’s imperfection was of a different nature than ros’s. where ros had been passionate, yssa was melancholic. and being a caring father, aum sought to comfort her, and as he loved her and made her in his ideal of beauty, he made love to her.    and after all this, aum left yssa to herself, with a filled womb and her sister’s heart lying by her. and going from this sorry sight, he acknowledged to himself that the creation of his daughters was a mistake, as he had denied aumea perfection. tired and saddened, aum retreated from the world, climbing high above where yssa stood, and his glowing dissipated, becoming only one star among many. the land fell into night.  chapter four: quinqennium  now alone, yssa lay down and wept. her tears were so great and her sadness so prolonged that they fell like a torrent for an entire age. and this rain gathered and formed lynerion, who was both the ocean and its master. borne of tears, he was a being of writhing feeling, and therefore his realm was one of furious animation. in his expansive sea, waves crashed and storms brewed.  and then yssa felt the life in her womb grow. at first it was passive, but through the age of her sadness it quickened, and the unborn being within her began to stir. then one day, the child kicked so hard and the pain was so intense that yssa bore him. she brought him into her bosom, and she named him agaias as such was the word for life. yssa’s love faded, as she saw within him an aspect of aum, and could only think of how the allfather had maimed her sister. so fearing that this child would deliver her to a similar fate, she cast him aside into the vastness of lynerion. then she retreated far and away, to a point where she hoped her child would not find her.  the sea around the child swirled, but agaias was strong. he held himself above the water and called out its master. lynerion then appeared, towering above the waves in tempestuous majesty. “who dares seek out lynerion, master of the ocean?”, he boomed.  “it is i, your brother agaias.”, said the child. “we are kin. i seek only to find our mother, and i hope that you will aid me in this endeavor”.  lynerion then proclaimed, “the ocean reaches to each end of the heavens, dear brother. but where our mother has gone is the one place my realm does not reach.”  then agaias said, “take me to this place”. and so lynerion did.  riding upon an enormous wave, the two journeyed, and soon they came to an enormous land that was the sleeping body of ros, half-submerged in tears. as they came to the rocky shore, they found that the land was cold and lifeless, and that it was covered in a blanket of white snow.   and so through the land they marched, standing among its highest mountains, as from here a greater portion of the land could be seen. in lynerion’s footsteps rivers and lakes were formed, and in agaias’ steps, the first forests were borne, though only pines, as they were all that could withstand the cold. this is why rivers begin in the mountains, and why copses of pines hang on their slopes.   the two began to travel far to the north. it became colder, and yssa’s weeping could be heard in the bitter wind. at the northernmost point of the land they finally found her, retreated in a cavern of blue ice from where all winds came. with caution, the two entered, and descended into the cavern’s deepest reaches. there, they found yssa, and agaias spake thusly:  “why, mother, hast thou thrown me away? do you not hold any love for me in thine heart?”  still weeping, she responded, “alas, i can give my love for no one, such is my sadness.”  “then why be you so sad, dear mother?” he asked.  “my sister lies heartless and in a dreamless sleep. i cannot feel joy, and as long as this continues, the land will be cold and covered in a blanket of mourning.  lynerion, restless of all this talk, then spoke to her. “i will find her heart, and return it to her bosom.” and he stormed out of the cave and off.  then with nothing more to do, agaias left the cave, and slept in a low part of the land waiting for lynerion to return. where he lay, a forest of giant pines sprouted, and as he slept, the forest was of an uncommon silence.   meanwhile, lynerion searched near and far across his realm for the heart of ros, but could find it nowhere. and then, looking to the eastern heavens, he saw a star that burned like red fire, and he knew that this was the heart of ros. so for ten hundred days he travelled, and finally came to the heavens. here, his realm fell off before him like a waterfall. he reached as far as he could for the star, and as he tried to pluck it, it unfolded into a great winged serpent of fire and doom, and it was narsis. ______________________  this is all i have!!! i wish i could finish the story, but that's it. i don't have anything else so far.   keep in mind,

334211,"this post appears to be somewhat old so i will refrain from making this a direct reply to “toobis”. he seems like a young guy who, like us all, has a lot to learn. as a black man who attended private schools most of my life, this is not the first time i have come across this sentiment and the feelings that seem to be behind them. now i don’t know exactly why black history month was created, but i can tell you why it is important. if anyone out there (outside of african-american history professors) can honestly tell me that they learned any of the following information in high school i will immediately retract this post and completely change my world view.   listed below are a few inventors and scientists of african decent. it took me all of five minutes to compose this list, so i am baffled by toobis’ “list of three”. i was planning a bigger list, with explanations of their major accomplishments, but why make it easy. look them up, if you would really care to know.   w. e. b. du bois benjamin banneker dr. charles richard drew lewis howard latimer frederick jones granville woods  robert flemming jr. – had to list this one, he invented the modern guitar folks!!!  african-americans also held the first patents for the fire extinguisher, the gas furnace, the spark plug, the air conditioner, and one of the first carbon filaments for light bulbs. but then again only black people use those, so never mind.  what’s that? you say you want something more recent, fine… how about some colored people who are still alive…  http://www.sciencespectrumonline.com/artman/publish/article_3.shtml  or look up mark dean, who has done pioneering work for years at ibm. honestly, i didn’t even know ibm was allowed to hire black people, amazing!   my point here is simple. the day we don’t need black history month is the day when people know granville woods as well as they know alexander graham bell. ask a female historian about the whitewash of women’s contributions in history, they know what i am talking about.    we have been doing a lot of good things in this country for a look time. they’re just not in our history books.",1,,2

[learn from da 'gos](http://imgur.com/ywc8o).  browns and blues are best in spring. avoid using things in the pumpkin and wine color areas, as they’re very distinctly fall colors, and will look out of place. the less patterned, the better. if you have a pattern, try to keep it clean/sharp looking.  ##in summer:   use as [high contrast](http://imgur.com/5lifj) pieces. navy and deep brown pair very well with the red and blue pastels that are iconic in the summer. you can use more adventurous fall colors like wine and blueberry if you’re pairing them with things that scream summer. wine chinos + white oxford, with honey brown belt + shoes, for example. avoid olive colors, and if you’re going for a color that’s yellow or orange, make sure it looks more like an ice cream flavor than a leaf. this is summer, after all. either flat colors, or big geometric patterns with a very light color.  ##in fall:  go nuts. seriously. earth tones are easily the most forgiving group when it comes to mixing and matching. pair browns, greys, and navy [generously](http://imgur.com/bfu6j). get easy contrast from navy + brown combos. if you’re wearing khaki chinos, make them darker, but things like scarves and coats can still be lighter tans. brown leather shoes all day every day. in fact, brown leather everything. there are basically two ways to go with fall outfits: [muddy and monotone](http://imgur.com/dzk4v), or [high contrast](http://imgur.com/1wgqe). both involve mixing a lot of colors, the trick is in making them all very similar or very different. patterns should be very small/fine (with the exception of things involving squares [flannel/tartan/gingham] – those can be all over the place and still work) or massive, in the form of [very thick knits](http://imgur.com/v7oog) and fabrics. keep the contrast low within the pattern.   ##in winter:  [use the least saturated of the bunch](http://imgur.com/rilcl). the rich colorful natural things are dead now. love is over. browns, navys, and any shade of grey are still fair game. make them prominent, and use the lighter stuff only for contrast. creams and khakis can still be used in large doses, but tread carefully, it takes a bit of panache to pull this off. textures should be chunkier here. thick knits, heavy tweeds, dense wools.a safe rule in winter is the darker or more desaturated, the better.  ###overcast/dark/desaturated:  these are your blacks, charcoals, and other drab things. the less saturated an item is, the farther it falls into this category.  ##spring/summer:   use the lighter end of this stuff. whites, light greys, light-medium khakis and tans. if it has a pastel or earthy equivalent, you’re probably better off with that.   ##fall:  pair earth tones in big pieces. balance the dark stuff with [rich, medium browns](http://imgur.com/ckd2w) and blues. [greys of all color are great in fall](http://imgur.com/zwoek). don’t try to work a major black piece into a fall outfit unless you’ve multiple pieces to really bring it in strongly. eg: black coat, boots, gloves. if you have the choice between black and charcoal/dark grey for anything fall, go grey when you can.  in fact, that rule applies pretty much forever to everything, until you get into very formal clothing.  ##winter:  this is when these things really shine. it’s the one season when you can go heavy on the black, so make the best of it. [layer](http://imgur.com/95n3f) lots of blacks, greys, and white/khaki. aim for either a [few layers of dense fabric](http://imgur.com/37yw1), or a [lot of lighter, thinner layers](http://imgur.com/5hiao). blacks and greys in winter are similar to earth tone in fall, in that you should shoot either for a muddy mix, or crisp, [layered contrast](http://imgur.com/1ajqn). if you have a pattern here, make it in the knit. herringbone, houndstooth, etc. subtle plaid/tartans in shades of grey are popular this year, but are fairly formal and somewhat difficult to pull off. white takes so much steez but [oh god the payoff is huge](http://imgur.com/q6q7v).",0,,

895001,"check out the imgur post for a closer look at these blushes! please take everything with a grain of salt cuz it's the internet and also technology noob.  i cleansed and moisturized my arm to simulate what you might do on your face. primed with smashbox photo finish primer. powdered with hourglass ambient lighting powder in diffused which i now regret because there is fine microshimmer alllll over my arm. it's making me doubt my purchase. my arm looked like a twilight vampire in direct daylight. you can sort of see it in the photos. do i want my face to look like this? hopefully my arm looks really pretty in the photos haha.  a stripe of estee lauder double wear stay-in-place makeup in **desert beige 2n1** (light to medium beige with warm neutral undertones) and a stripe of **tawny 3w1** (tanned beige with warm undertones) on the bottom. i hope that might help to give you an idea of what the blush might look like on skin darker than mine. my face and body are tanned to nc25 right now.   swatched with my otherwise useless small domed bh cosmetics brush and cleaned on a 100% polyester cloth in between swatches. then finger swatched on the bottom.  ---  ***estee lauder deluxe all-over face compact pure color blush (3) bronze goddess powder bronzer*** - pure color blush 08 peach passion; coral pink with golden shimmer. pure color blush 02 pink kiss; matte wine red. both were powdery. 02 had decent pigmentation. long lasting. hand me downs for the win  ***urban decay naked flushed in native*** (discontinued) - hot light-medium pink. sheer, took a lot of building to get to this pigmentation. i haven't tried the other flushed palettes so i can't say if this is typical. faded from my face quickly.  ***hourglass ambient lighting blush in mood exposure*** - dusty rose with silvery microshimmer. pink toned. long lasting.  ***tarte amazonian clay 12-hour blush in exposed*** - matte beigey pink nude.  ***nyx hd blush in taupe*** - i use this for contour but *technically* it's a blush. cool taupened purple. very matte. chalky and least pigmentation. hard to blend. develops hard pan easily.  ***clinique cheek pop in 05 nude pop*** - yellowed beige pink with gold satin overlay. this one surprised me. i kept swatching because i could not see it showing up but then i tilted my arm and there it was. creamy feeling.  ***tarte amazonian clay 12-hour blush in fanciful*** (le): cooler, darker version with more purple of estee lauder 02 pink kiss. a matte, bright, pinkened and reddened wine. highly pigmented.   ***nars blush in goulue*** (exclusive) - neutral-cool wine. almost satin finish. very soft and pigmented. i need to use a light hand with this lol.  ***becca shimmering skin perfector pressed in rose gold*** - technically not a blush but i use this as a blush topper  or eye shadow somedays. gosh it's pretty and over the top on me. peachy beige pink with strong golden shimmer. not terribly long lasting when i use it.  ---  i was going to blend out the upper portions of the swatches to simulate how you would actually wear them but i had just got hit with some big news and forgot about all that.  it could just be the nature of the foundation on *my* skin but it seemed that the tawny foundation darkened the blush and made it appear slightly more orange or brown. i'm sure this is far from realistic.   before you say anything or judge, yes i know there are scars. no, they are not self harm nor do i have anything against self harm. i don't want to defend or explain myself but some people might be wondering. they are from an accident i had as a child. i recommend using a tacky base on top of scarred skin so that makeup will stick to it, and to set it.  my favorite blushes are the hourglass, clinique, nars, and tarte for their longevity. not really sure why i did all these swatches i think i'm just obsessed with blushes and cheek sculpting (but not contouring) as of late.",1,-1,0
830064,"sorry for butting in to your discussion, but i've seen the tanning vs fairness creams argument a lot, so i want to pitch in with my side of the story.  the difference between tanning salons/sprays and fairness creams is how they're advertised- there is no tanning advert which claims that tanned people are superior to paler people or that you won't get a job/get the boy or girl of your dreams just because you're not tan. however, fairness creams regularly imply that dark skin is undesirable, dark people are inferior and that dark people don't deserve jobs/loving partners because of the colour of their skin. they also associate darker skin with bad life outcomes and lower social strata. in short, tanning salons/creams haven't created an epidemic of people who have inferiority complexes while fairness creams have. pale white people don't believe they are inferior to tan white people or that they deserve less than their tanned counterparts. they don't suffer from self-esteem issues where they cry about why they are pale.   i'm an indian girl from india and i see firsthand the way this obsession with fairness has destroyed the confidence of people around me. being a dark girl myself, i was bullied relentlessly by the boys in my class for around 2 years. however, i was lucky that my parents didn't believe in this tripe and never said/say such crap to me, therefore i was able to get out of it and see myself as beautiful. others aren't so lucky because many a times, dark children are told by their own families that they aren't as good as their fairer counterparts. they are constantly told they are ugly and they end up with very ugly inferiority complexes where they believe light is right. some of these dark children end up bullying other dark children too, and the oppressed becomes the oppressor. it has got to the point where good-looking dark people are not acknowledged at all because being dark is immediately associated with being ugly. in india, there is no such thing as a beautiful dark person. if you're dark, people give you backhanded compliments and are almost surprised that they could find a dark person good looking.   also, there is job discrimination that dark people face. do pale people in the us face discrimination because they are not tan? some professions which are out of reach for dark people in india are- acting, front end jobs in the hospitality industry like receptionists, air hostesses/stewards, lead dancers, marketing positions in the corporate sector etc. name the last time you saw a girl of mindy kaling's colouring in indian cinema or on indian tv as a lead or even just in a positive role. dark people are invariably cast in negative roles. it has become a societal problem where dark people are being discriminated against when it comes to marriage, jobs and are being bullied in schools and workplaces.   the fact is that our ""preference"" for fair skin has transcended from being just that into an ugly bias against dark skin. it is further compounded by the fact most indians come in varying shades of brown- light to dark, and indians with kareena kapoor's complexion are in the minority. so, ultimately you are creating a nation of losers who believe that they can never be as good as their lighter counterparts and start behaving slavishly in their presence. i've seen dark people with no confidence kowtowing to fairer people because they actually believe that dark skin is inferior. i've also seen indian people fawning over white people for just 'being white' and nothing else. you can be a junkie, but indian people will believe that you are vishnu reincarnated. we have an exchange program with an american university so a lot of americans (usually white) come over every semester, and they become popular pretty quickly for just being white americans. mind you, these same people wouldn't be popular in their own country, but in india where whiteness is venerated, they suddenly become gods.   also, i really laugh when the indian media uses the euphemism ""dusky"" to refer to actresses like priyanka chopra, bipasha basu, rani mukherjee, deepika padukone etc, because they are not even dark, they are just not as white as cheesecake. it is widely known that all of them have lightened their skin and actresses like kajol and rekha had to work hard to become lighter so that their value would increase. the truth is that i've never seen a leading lady who is as dark as nina davuluri or mindy kaling in the indian media. it's a cop out to say that garnier light- endorsing priyanka chopra is ""dark"" when she has become progressively lighter since she started.   well, this turned into a huge wall of text, sorry for that. my main point is that we are creating generations of people who aren't comfortable in their own skin and hate their own colour. being brown isn't something indians should run from. it's an evolutionary advantage that developed to protect us against indian weather, and we should celebrate it instead of denigrating it. it's healthy; just look at majority white societies- they never degrade any physical features that are typically white like light eyes or light hair. they are self-confident people who don't teach their own to devalue themselves and this is why they were able to colonize and control the world.",1,-2,-1

347826,"the sun beat down over the city, oppressive and cloying. my uncle stood next to me, his hand resting heavily on my shoulder.  ""today, you fulfil your duties to this great land. your father would've been proud.""  i looked away from him, hating the blush that crept up my cheeks. it was a matter of public knowledge that my father had never thought of me as anything but a burden, a dead-weight, much less with pride. only in death does he manage to garner sympathy from the poor people whose lives he tyrannically ruled until only days ago.   i feel like someone has ushered me on stage with no rehearsals and no prompter, left to flounder and improvise in front of a nation for an audience. my father planned to rule indefinitely. at least until he had fathered enough bastards to choose someone other than me to succeed him. so why bother teaching me the ways of the sultan?  in the distance, i see a procession weaving through the heat haze hanging over the streets. the palace granite was blessedly cool, with fans of grey-green fern leafs growing up the walls and along the ceilings; i sit not on my fathers throne, but on a raised reed mat with curtains of muslin and richly embroidered bright coloured linens. simply imagining the dry heat of the city makes my head throb.  my uncle's hand tightens on my shoulder, and his face contorts into a leer with gleaming eyes fixed on the swaying bodies of the bridal procession.  ""i envy you, my child. any one of those supine beauties oiled and spread on my bed would make me the happiest man in the kingdom. actually, two would make me happier!""  he chuckled. disgusted, i cringed from him, shirking his hand from my shoulder. i felt i should say something, protect these women from the dirty words of this old, grizzled man. they were now my citizens, i realized. another responsibility.   a huge ribboned banner slowly appeared as the procession ascended the white stone steps, held high by the matron priestess in her flowing floral shawls. behind her, a line of fifteen women; fifteen of the most beautiful women imaginable.   the matron stepped aside to usher the first before me. she curtseyed deeply, holding her skirts with hands fluted prettily to the sides. her hair fell as a cascade from head to waist, curled under like waves of ink. when she arose, her eyes were that of rubies; deep maroon accented by long, black lashes. her face could have inspired a thousand artists for a thousand lifetimes, each one more besotted than the last.   ""my sultan, i offer you my beauty. never again will you look wistfully upon the moonlit oceans and wish for a goddess or angel, for you only have to look at me.""  i stared at her, agape. i took a gulp of wine to quench my suddenly dry mouth. my uncle sneered and said;  ""and what would you ask in return, great beauty? what would be your price to wed?""  she blushed prettily, demurely hiding her face with a lace fan.   ""my dowry is that of ten thousand gold circlets. the sultan is surely rich enough to afford my family that bequest, for the pleasure of my face and body?""  i choked, spitting the wine on the floor at her feet. ten thousand?!   my uncle laughed, smacking me on the back.   ""bargain!""   for a moment, i considered. she was art incarnate, a moving painting from the mind of a great artist. but the words of my mother rang in my ears; ""beauty is temporary, marriage is indefinite."". i watched her closely, and said;  ""surely the honour of marrying the sultan is worth more than such a bequest?""  her sneer was instantaneous and repulsed. quick as a flash, she smiled, fluttering her fan daintily. she began to stutter a response, but i held up a hand.   ""in the commoners court, a woman gives gold to her betrothed. as the sultan, i do not need gold. but i do need a wife who marries for the want of a good marriage, not of a good wealth.""  she looked faint, speechless. finally, she found her voice.  ""you won't offer...anything?""  i shook my head.   ""i find the insinuation that a person can be bought and sold disgusting. i am happy to provide an allowance for my wife, or she is welcome to pursue a career if she wishes. i am not buying a slave, i am finding a partner.""  her hands shook, her face tight with barely concealed rage. she curtseyed again, stiffly this time, and faced the matron. the matron, with a face of shock and confusion, nodded her leave.  the next bride stepped forward. she was dressed in more lavish clothes, emerald silk with jade buttons. her pretty auburn hair was styled elaborately on her head but she wore an expression of discomfort.  ""will you also deny me a bequest, sir?""   i nodded. she laughed a little, and said;  ""i am the second most beautiful, and worth five thousand gold circlets. i will find another man, but you will be hard pressed to find a woman to marry for nothing.""  the matron clapped a hand to her mouth, eyes wide.   i told the girl to take her leave. she did. i sat up straighter; my uncle began to say something, but i silenced him with a look.  ""if any of you here require something from me before marriage, even though i ask nothing of you in return, please take your leave, for i am not in the habit of trading slaves or harlots.""  the matron fainted. ten courtiers rushed to her side, propping her on downy pillows and plying her with strong-smelling jasmine salts.   one by one, the beautiful girls in their finery filed past me, out of the palace and back into the courtyard. i felt as if i stood in a flock of paradise birds; bright coloured feathers, lush fabrics, charms and jewels and silks and lace and a mist of fine perfume.   my uncle turned on his heel and followed them. i could hear his lewd thoughts and the calculations quickly going through his mind. i wagered his gold would be greatly depleted come the evening.  sitting back into my mat, i sighed and rubbed a hand over my eyes. a small cough brought my attention back to the room, and i pulled back the fallen muslin curtain.   a girl, no more than my age, stood in front of me. she wore the thin cotton white tunic and pale cream leggings of a peasant. her tunic was fastened around her waist by a thin leather cord, but it only accentuated her underfed form. her skin was golden bronzed, with freckles and a light silvery scar running across her throat from jaw to below the neckline of her blouse.   she looked at me defiantly. i was briefly frightened, my pulse quickening as she walked towards me. i had never met a peasant.  ""who are you?"" i asked.  ""my name is ariadne, sir. since you asked me for something, may i now request you return the favour, and grant me a bequest?""  surprised, i found myself laughing. i hadn't laughed in a long time.  ""very clever, ariadne. sure, go ahead.""  ""i ask you, sultan, to accompany me home.""   for the first time in my life, i walked the streets of my city. the noise, the smells, the sights, the heat! merchant vendors shouted their wares and bargains, beggars sat in the footwell of doors, spices piled two feet high sat on barrels by a hawk-eyed old lady with withered skin like a crumpled map.  ariadne walked next to me, holding my arm. her touch was familiar, something so presumptuous i gasped a little but found it pleasant and comforting in this strangeness.   we walked onwards, followed at a distance by a number of footmen and courtiers anxious to get in good favour with the new sultan.  finally, we stopped at the edge of the city. here, the great white walls that surrounded us ended; beyond, nothing but rolling hills of ochre sand and, in the very far distance, a shadow of the next city.     well, almost nothing. ariadne tugged my arm and motioned me to the left, just further than the first curve of the wall. there, the sun cast a shaded area behind the high buildings of the city. and there, among the remains of what looked like a couple of broken horse-carts and tarps, were living a community of children.   ariadne brought me to them. i stepped carefully past strewn rubbish and filth, holding my robes high and trying to ignore the trickle of some unknown liquid between the toes of my sandals. a few children were playing on the ground, building castles from the sand and crude dolls of paper and twine. one boy, not much younger than i, sat against a merchant barrel, reading a dog-eared picture book to three infants huddled round him, hair matted to their heads with grease.  more sat, each dressed in rags and thin as a strand of hair.  ""great sultan of shak'hebib,"" ariadne gestured towards the slum, ""these are your people. one gold circlet could buy them a shed to live in. ten gold circlets could buy them maize paste and clean water for a year. twenty gold circlets could buy them a small flock of antelope, to herd and milk and sell for meat or dairy. i have walked with you through this city, beside you. i have heard your pockets. you carry with you at least one hundred gold circlets. i know you are not in the habit of buying people, but i travelled today to offer myself to you as a wife, for one hundred gold circlets, so i can give my family a life. i am not much to look at, but i can learn how to be a good wife. a dutiful wife. i ask you this, for them.""  she stuck her chin out, eyes defiant but her voice broke a little as she finished her speech.  i stared at her, my eyes filled with sorrow and pity and a thousand emotions for a world i never knew people, my people, suffered through.   i took her hand, and looked at her properly. this time, i saw her as infinitely more beautiful than any other woman i had ever seen.      edit: thanks for such a great prompt! my first post on r/wp but i couldn't get this one to let go of me ahaha. also i only just realised that you were referring to a real fictional world (dune i think?) but hey ho, it's done now.",0,,

the call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too. can a shout be silent? he turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only . . . a weirwood. it seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures and hairline cracks. the tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the sky. wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face. red eyes looked at him. fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him. the weirwood had his brother’s face. had his brother always had three eyes? not always, came the silent shout. not before the crow. he sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something else, something terrible. death, he knew. he was smelling death. he cringed back, his hair bristling, and bared his fangs. don’t be afraid, i like it in the dark. no one can see you, but you can see them. but first you have to open your eyes. see? like this. and the tree reached down and touched him. and suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice. before him the skirling pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the colors of an autumn afternoon. a vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to castle black. then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it. there were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host. some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others trained for war. he watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses no larger than ants. the sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting faintly on the wind. their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened stakes, no neat rows of horse lines. everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth. he spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion. tendrils of dark smoke rose from a thousand cookfires. this is no army, no more than it is a town. this is a whole people come together. across the long lake, one of the mounds moved. he watched it more closely and saw that it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived. and the thing riding it was huge as well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man. then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of wings. as he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out of the sky. a shrill scream split the air. he glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting out the sun . . . “ghost!” jon shouted, sitting up. he could still feel the talons, the pain. “ghost, to me!”  ------------------  the night was windless, the snow drifting straight down out of a cold black sky, yet the leaves of the heart tree were rustling his name. “theon,” they seemed to whisper, “theon.” the old gods, he thought. they know me. they know my name. i was theon of house greyjoy. i was a ward of eddard stark, a friend and brother to his children. “please.” he fell to his knees. “a sword, that’s all i ask. let me die as theon, not as reek.” tears trickled down his cheeks, impossibly warm. “i was ironborn. a son … a son of pyke, of the islands.” a leaf drifted down from above, brushed his brow, and landed in the pool. it floated on the water, red, five-fingered, like a bloody hand. “… bran,” the tree murmured. they know. the gods know. they saw what i did. and for one strange moment it seemed as if it were bran’s face carved into the pale trunk of the weirwood, staring down at him with eyes red and wise and sad. bran’s ghost, he thought, but that was madness. why should bran want to haunt him? he had been fond of the boy, had never done him any harm. it was not bran we killed. it was not rickon. they were only miller’s sons, from the mill by the acorn water. “i had to have two heads, else they would have mocked me … laughed at me … they …”  -----------------  lord eddard stark sat upon a rock beside the deep black pool in the gods wood, the pale roots of the heart tree twisting around him like an old man’s gnarled arms. the greatsword ice lay across lord eddard’s lap, and he was cleaning the blade with an oilcloth. “winterfell,” bran whispered. his father looked up. “who’s there?” he asked, turning … … and bran, frightened, pulled away. his father and the black pool and the godswood faded and were gone and he was back in the cavern, the pale thick roots of his weirwood throne cradling his limbs as a mother does a child. a torch flared to life before him.  ----------------  this one is maybe....  the kettle was in the corner by the hearth, a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a heavy lid. maester aemon said a word to sam and clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table. a few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot. with a raucous scream and a clap of wings, a huge raven burst out of the kettle. it flapped upward, seeking the rafters perhaps, or a window to make its escape, but there were no rafters in the vault, nor windows either. the raven was trapped. cawing loudly, it circled the hall, once, twice, three times. and jon heard samwell tarly shout, “i know that bird! that’s lord mormont’s raven!” the raven landed on the table nearest jon. “snow,” it cawed. it was an old bird, dirty and bedraggled. “snow,” it said again, “snow, snow, snow.” it walked to the end of the table, spread its wings again, and flew to jon’s shoulder. lord janos slynt sat down so heavily he made a thump, but ser alliser filled the vault with mocking laughter. “ser piggy thinks we’re all fools, brothers,” he said. “he’s taught the bird this little trick. they all say snow, go up to the rookery and hear for yourselves. mormont’s bird had more words than that.” the raven cocked its head and looked at jon. “corn?” it said hopefully. when it got neither corn nor answer, it quorked and muttered, “kettle? kettle? kettle?”  ----------------  the lightning flash left jon night-blind, but he glimpsed the hurtling shadow half a heartbeat before he heard the shriek. the first thenn died as the old man had, blood gushing from his torn throat. then the light was gone and the shape was spinning away, snarling, and another man went down in the dark. there were curses, shouts, howls of pain. jon saw big boil stumble backward and knock down three men behind him. ghost, he thought for one mad instant. ghost leapt the wall . then the lightning turned the night to day, and he saw the wolf standing on del’s chest, blood running black from his jaws. grey. he’s grey.  -------------------  will try to find more once i remember where they are in the books...",0,,

327327,"getting into the chair didn't hurt as much as he had feared, and that was good, because previous experience had shown him that he would hurt plenty afterward. she set the tray of food down on the bureau, then rolled the wheelchair over to the bed. she helped him to sit up - there was a dull, thudding flare of pain in his pelvic area but it subsided - and then she leaned over, the side of her neck pressing against his shoulder like the neck of a horse. for an instant he could feel the thump of her pulse, and his face twisted in revulsion. then her right arm was firmly around his back, her left under his buttocks. ""try not to move from the knees down while i do this,"" she said, and then simply slid him into the chair. she did it with the ease of a woman sliding a book into an empty slot in her bookcase. yes, she was strong. even in good shape the outcome of a fight between him and annie would have been in doubt. as he was now it would be like wally cox taking on boom boom mancini. she put the board in front of him, ""see how well it fits?"" she said, and went to the bureau to get the food. ""annie?"" ""yes."" ""i wonder if you could turn that typewriter around. so it faces the wall."" she frowned. ""why in the world would you want me to do that?"" because i don't want it grinning at me all night. ""old superstition of mine,"" he said. ""i always turn my typewriter to the wall before i start writing."" he paused and added: ""every night while i am writing, as a matter of fact."" ""it's like step on a crack, break your mother's back,"" she said. ""i never step on a crack if i can help it."" she turned it around so it grinned at nothing but blank wall. ""better?"" ""much."" ""you are such a silly,"" she said, and came over and began to feed him.  he dreamed of annie wilkes in the court of some fabulous arabian caliph, conjuring imps and genies from bottles and then flying around the court on a magic carpet. when the carpet banked past him (her hair streamed out behind her; her eyes were as bright and flinty as the eyes of a sea-captain navigating among icebergs), he saw it was woven all in green and white; it made a colorado license plate. once upon a time, annie was calling. once upon a time it came to pass. this happened in the days when my grandfather's grandfather was a boy. this is the story of how a poor boy. i heard this from a man who. once upon a time. once upon a time.  when he woke up annie was shaking him and bright morning sun was slanting in the window - the snow had ended. ""wake up, sleepyhead!"" annie was almost trilling. ""i've got yogurt and a nice boiled egg for you, and then it will be time for you to begin."" he looked at her eager face and felt a strange new emotion - hope. he had dreamed that annie wilkes was scheherazade, her solid body clad in diaphanous robes, her big feet stuffed into pink sequined slippers with curly toes as she rode on her magic carpet and chanted the incantatory phrases which open the doors of the best stories. but of course it wasn't annie that was scheherazade. he was. and if what he wrote was good enough, if she could not bear to kill him until she discovered how it all came out no matter how much or how loudly her animal instincts yelled for her to do it, that she must do it . . . might he not have a chance? he looked past her and saw she had turned the typewriter around before waking him; it grinned resplendently at him with its missing tooth, telling him it was all right to hope and noble to strive, but in the end it was doom alone which would count.  she rolled him over to the window so the sun fell on him for the first time in weeks, and it seemed to him he could feel his pasty-white skin, dotted here and there with minor bedsores, murmur its pleasure and thanks. the windowpanes were edged on the inside with a tracery of frost, and when he held out his hand he could feel a bubble of cold like a dome around the window. the feel of it was both refreshing and somehow nostalgic, like a note from an old friend. for the first time in weeks - it felt like years - he was able to look at a geography different from that of his room with its unchanging verities - blue wallpaper, picture of the arc de triomphe, the long, long month of february symbolized by the boy sliding downhill on his sled (he thought that his mind would turn to that boy's face and stocking cap each time january became february, even if he lived to see that change of months another fifty times). he looked into this new world as eagerly as he had watched his first movie bambi - as a child. the horizon was near; it always was in the rockies, where longer views of the world were inevitably cut off by uptilted plates of bedrock. the sky was a perfect early-morning blue, innocent of clouds. a carpet of green forest climbed the flank of the nearest mountain. there were perhaps seventy acres of open ground between the house and the edge of the forest - the snow-cover over it was a perfect and blazing white. it was impossible to tell if the land beneath was tilled earth or open meadow. the view of this open square was interrupted by only one building: a neat red barn. when she spoke of her livestock or when he saw her trudging grimly past his window, breaking her breath with the impervious prow of her face, he had imagined a ramshackle outbuilding like an illustration from a child's book of ghost stories - rooftree bowed and sagging from years of snowweight, windows blank and dusty, some broken and blocked with pieces of cardboard, long double doors perhaps off their tracks and swaying outward. this neat and tidy structure with its dark-red paint and neat cream-colored trim looked like the five-car garage of a well-to-do country squire masquerading as a barn. in front of it stood a jeep cherokee, maybe five years old but obviously well cared for. to one side stood a fisher plow in a home-made wooden cradle. to attach the plow to the jeep, she would only need to drive the jeep carefully up to the cradle so that the hooks on the frame matched the catches on the plow, and throw the locking lever on the dashboard. the perfect vehicle for a woman who lived alone and had no neighbor she could call upon for help (except for those dirty-birdie roydmans, of course, and annie probably wouldn't take a plate of pork chops from them if she was dying of starvation). the driveway was neatly plowed, a testament to the fact that she did indeed use the blade, but he could not see the road - the house cut off the view. ""i see you're admiring my barn, paul."" he looked around, startled. the quick and uncalculated movement awoke his pain from its doze. it snarled dully in what remained of his shins and in the bunched salt-dome that had replaced his left knee. it turned over, needling him from where it lay imprisoned in its cave of bones, and then fell lightly asleep again. she had food on a tray. soft food, invalid food . . . but his stomach growled at the sight of it. as she crossed to him he saw that she was wearing white shoes with crepe soles. ""yes,"" he said. ""it's very handsome."" she put the board on the arms of the wheelchair and then put the tray on the board. she pulled a chair over beside him and sat down, watching him as he began to eat. ""fiddle-de-foof! handsome is as handsome does, my mother always said. i keep it nice because if i didn't, the neighbors would yap. they are always looking for a way to get at me, or start a rumor about me. so i keep everything nice. keeping up appearances is very, very important. as far as the barn goes, it really isn't much work, as long as you don't let things pile up. keeping the snow from breaking in the roof is the oogiest part."" the oogiest part, he thought. save that one for the annie wilkes lexicon in your memoirs - if you ever get a chance to write your memoirs, that is. along with dirty birdie and fiddle-de-foof and all the others which i'm sure will come up in time. ""two years ago i had billy haversham put heat-tapes in the roof. you throw a switch and they get hot and melt the ice. i won't need them much longer this winter, though see how it's melting on its own?"" he had a forkful of egg halfway to his mouth. it stopped in midair as he looked out at the barn. there was a row of icicles along the cave. the tips of these icicles were dripping - dripping fast. each drop sparkled as it fell onto a narrow canal of ice which lay at the base of the barn's side. ""it's up to forty-five degrees and it's not even nine o'clock!"" annie was going on gaily as paul imagined the rear bumper of his camaro surfacing through the rotted snow for the sun to twinkle on. ""of course it won't last - we've got a hard snap or three ahead of us yet, and probably another big storm as well - but spring is coming, paul, and my mother always used to say that the hope of spring is like the hope of heaven."" he put his fork back down on the plate with the egg still on it. ""don't want that last bite? all done?"" ""all done,"" he agreed, and in his mind he saw the roydmans driving up from sidewinder, saw a bright arrow of light strike mrs roydman's face, making her wince and put a shielding hand up - what's down there, ham? . . . don't tell me i'm crazy, there's something down there! reflection damn near burned m'eye out! back up, i want to take another look. ""then i'll just take the tray,"" she said, ""and you can get started."" she favored him with a glance that was very warm. ""i just can't tell you how excited i am, paul."" she went out, leaving him to sit in the wheelchair and look at the water running from the icicles which clung to the edge of the barn.  ""i'd like some different paper, if you could get it,"" he said when she came back to put the typewriter and paper on the board. ""different from this?"" she asked, tapping the cellophane-wrapped package of corrasable bond. ""but this is the most expensive of all! i asked when i went into the paper patch!"" ""didn't your mother ever tell you that the most expensive is not always the best?"" annie's brow darkened. her initial defensiveness had been replaced by indignation. paul guessed her fury would follow. ""no, she did not. what she told me, mister smart guy, is that when you buy cheap, you get cheap."" the climate inside her, he had come to discover, was like springtime in the midwest. she was a woman full of tornadoes waiting to happen, and if he had been a farmer observing a sky which looked the way annie's face looked right now, he would have at once gone to collect his family and herd them into the storm cellar. her brow was too white. her nostrils flared regularly, like the nostrils of an animal scenting fire. her hands had begun to spring limberly open and then snatch closed again, catching air and squashing it. his need for her and his vulnerability to her screamed at him to back off, to placate her while there was still time if indeed there still was - as a tribe in one of -those rider haggard stories would have placated their goddess when she was angry, by making sacrifice to her effigy. but there was another part of him, more calculating and less cowed, which reminded him that he could not play the part of scheherazade if he grew frightened and placatory whenever she stormed. if he did, she would storm all the more. if you didn't have something she badly wants, this part of him reasoned, she would have taken you to the hospital right away or killed you later on to protect herself from the roydmans - because for annie the world is full of roydmans, for annie they're lurking behind every bush. and if you don't bell this bitch right now, paulie my boy, you may never be able to. she was beginning to breathe more rapidly, almost to hyperventilate; the rhythm of her clenching hands was likewise speeding up, and he knew that in a moment she would be beyond him. gathering up the little courage he had left, trying desperately to summon exactly the right note of sharp and yet almost casual irritability, he said: ""and you might as well stop that. getting mad won't change a thing."" she froze as if he had slapped her and looked at him, wounded. ""annie,"" he said patiently, ""this is no big deal."" ""it's a trick,"" she said. ""you don't want to write my book and so you're making up tricks not to start. i knew you would. oh boy. but it's not going to work. it - "" ""that's silly,"" he said. ""did i say i wasn't going to start?"" ""no . . . no, but - "" ""that's right. because i am. and if you come here and take a look at something, i'll show you what the problem is. bring that webster pot with you, please."" ""the what?"" ""little jar of pens and pencils, "" he said. ""on newspapers, they sometimes call them webster pots. after daniel webster."" this was a lie he had made up on the spur of the moment, but it had the desired effect - she looked more confused than ever, lost in a specialists"" world of which she had not the slightest knowledge. the confusion had diffused (and thus defused) her rage even more; he saw she now didn't even know if she had any right to be angry. she brought over the jar of pens and pencils and slammed them down on the board and he thought: goddam! i won no - that wasn't right. misery had won. but that isn't right, either. it was scheherazade. scheherazade won. ""what?"" she said grumpily. ""watch."" he opened the package of corrasable and took out a sheet he took a freshly sharpened pencil and drew a fine on the paper. then he took a ballpoint pen and drew another line parallel to the first. then he slid his thumb across the slightly waffled surface of the paper. both lines blurred smudgily in the direction his thumb was travelling, the pencil-line slightly more than the one he had drawn with the pen. ""see?"" ""so what?"" ""ribbon-ink will blur, too,"" he said. ""it doesn't blur a much as that pencil-line, but it's worse than the ballpoint-ink line."" ""were you going to sit and rub every page with your thumb?"" ""just the shift of the pages against each other will accomplish plenty of blurring over a period of weeks or ever days,"" he said, ""and when a manuscript is in work, it get shifted around a lot. you're always hunting back through to find a name or a date. my god, annie, one of the first thing you find out in this business is that editors hate reading manuscripts typed on corrasable bond almost as much a they hate hand-written manuscripts."" ""don't call it that. i hate it when you call it that."" he looked at her, honestly puzzled. ""call what what?"" ""when you pervert the talent god gave you by calling it a business. i hate that."" ""i'm sorry."" ""you ought to be,"" she said stonily. ""you might as well call yourself a whore."" no, annie, he thought, suddenly filled with fury. i'm no whore. fast cars was about not being a whore. that's what killing that goddamned bitch misery was about, now that i think about it. i was driving to the west coast to celebrate my liberation from a state of whoredom. what you did was to pull me out of the wreck when i crashed my car and stick me back in the crib again. two dollar straight up, four dollar i take you around the world. and every now and then i see a flicker in your eyes that tells me a part of you way back inside knows it too. a jury might let you off by reason of insanity, but not me, annie. not this kid. ""a good point,"" he said. ""now, going back to the subject of the paper - "" ""i'll get you your cockadoodie paper,"" she said sullenly. ""just tell me what to get and i'll get it."" ""as long as you understand i'm on your side - "" ""don't make me laugh. no one has been on my side since my mother died twenty years ago."" ""believe what you want, then,"" he said. ""if you're so insecure you can't believe i'm grateful to you for saving my life, that's your problem."" he was watching her shrewdly, and again saw a flicker of uncertainty, of wanting to believe, in her eyes. good. very good. he looked at her with all the sincerity he could muster, and again in his mind he imagined shoving a chunk of glass into her throat, once and forever letting out the blood that serviced her crazy brain. ""at least you should be able to believe that i am on the book's side. you spoke of binding it. i assume that you meant binding the manuscript? the typed pages?"" ""of course that's what i meant."" yes, you bet. because if you took the manuscript to a printer, it might raise questions. you may be naive about the world of books and publishing, but not that naive. paul sheldon is missing, and your printer might remember receiving a book-length manuscript concerning itself with paul sheldon's most famous character right around the time the man himself disappeared, mightn't he? and he'd certainly remember the instructions - instructions so queer any printer would remember them. one printed copy of a novel-length manuscript. just one. ""what did she look like, officer? well, she was a big woman. looked sort of like a stone idol in a h. rider haggard story. just a minute, i've got her name and address here in the files . . . just let me look up the carbons of the invoices . . . "" ""nothing wrong with the idea, either,"" he said. ""a bound manuscript can be damned handsome. looks like a good folio edition. but a book should last a long time, annie, and if i write this one on corrasable, you're going to have nothing but a bunch of blank papers in ten years or so. unless, of course, you just put it on the shelf."" but she wouldn't want that, would she? christ, no. she'd want to take it down every day, maybe every few hours. take it down and gloat over it. an odd stony look had come onto her face. he did not like this mulishness, this almost ostentatious look of obduracy. it made him nervous. he could calculate her rage, but there was something in this new expression which was as opaque as it was childish. ""you don't have to talk anymore,"" she said. ""i already told you i'll get you your paper. what kind?"" ""in this business-supply store you go to - "" ""the paper patch."" ""yes, the paper patch. you tell them you'd like two reams - a ream is a package of five hundred sheets - "" ""i know that. i'm not stupid, paul."" ""i know you're not,"" he said, becoming more nervous still. the pain had begun to mutter up and down his legs again, and it was speaking even more -loudly from the area of his pelvis - he had been sitting up for nearly an hour, and the dislocation down there was complaining about it. keep cool, for god's sake - don't lose everything you've gained! but have i gained anything? or is it only wishful thinking? ""ask for two reams of white long-grain mimeo. hammermill bond is a good brand; so is triad modem. two reams of mimeo will cost less than this one package of corrasable, and it should be enough to do the whole job, write and rewrite."" ""i'll go right now,"" she said, getting up suddenly. he looked at her, alarmed, understanding that she meant to leave him without his medication again, and sitting up this time, as well. sitting already hurt; the pain would be monstrous by the time she got back, even if she hurried. ""you don't have to do that,"" he said, speaking fast. ""the corrasable is good enough to start with - after all, i'll have to rewrite anyway - "" ""only a silly person would try to start a good work with a bad tool."" she took the package of corrasable bond, then snatched the sheet with the two smudged lines and crumpled it into a ball. she tossed both into the wastebasket and turned back to him. that stony, obdurate look covered her face like a mask. her eyes glittered like tarnished dimes. ""i'm going to town now,"" she said. ""i know you want to get started as soon as you can, since you're on my side - "" she spoke these last words with intense, smoking sarcasm (and, paul believed, more self-hate than she would ever know) ""and so i'm not even going to take time to put you back in your bed."" she smiled, a pulling of the lips that was grotesquely puppet-like, and slipped to his side in her silent white nurse"" shoes. her fingers touched his hair. he flinched. he tried not to but couldn't help it. her dead-alive smile widened. ""although i suspect we may have to put off the actual start of misery's retum for a day . . . or two . . . perhaps even three. yes, it may be as long as three days before you are able to sit up again. because of the pain. too bad. i had champagne chilling in the fridge. i'll have to put it back in the shed."" ""annie, really, i can start if you'll just - "" ""no, paul."" she moved to the door and then turned, looking at him with that stony face. only her eyes, those tarnished dimes, were fully alive under the shelf of her brow. ""there is one thought i would like to leave you with. you may think you can fool me, or trick me; i know i look slow and stupid. but i am not stupid, paul, and i am not slow."" suddenly her face broke apart. the stony obduracy shattered and what shone through was the countenance of an insanely angry child. for a moment paul thought the extremity of his terror might kill him. had he thought he had gained the upper hand? had he? could one possibly play scheherazade when one's captor was insane? she rushed across the room at him, thick legs pumping, knees flexing, elbows chopping back and forth in the stale sickroom air like pistons. her hair bounced and joggled around her face as it came loose from the bobby-pins that held it up. now her passage was not silent; it was like the tread of goliath striding into the valley of bones. the picture of the arc de triomphe cracked affrightedly on the wall. ""geeeee-yahhh!"" she screamed, and brought her fist down on the bunched salt-dome that had been paul sheldon's left knee. he threw his head back and howled, veins standing out in his neck and on his forehead. pain burst out from his knee and shrouded him, whitely radiant, in the center of a nova. she tore the typewriter off the board and slammed it down on the mantel, lifting its weight of dead metal as he might have lifted an empty cardboard box. ""so you just sit there,"" she said, lips pulled back in that grinning rictus, ""and you think about who is in charge here, and all the things i can do to hurt you if you behave badly or try to trick me. you sit there and you scream if you want to, because no one can hear you. no one stops here because they all know annie wilkes is crazy, they all know what she did, even if they did find me innocent."" she walked back to the door and turned again, and he screamed again when she did, in anticipation of another bull-like charge, and that made her grin more widely. ""i'll tell you something else,"" she said softly. ""they think i got away with it, and they are right. think about that, paul, while i'm in town getting your cockadoodie paper."" she left, slamming the bedroom door hard enough to shake the house. then there was the click of the lock. he leaned back in the chair, shaking all over, trying not to shake because it hurt, not able to help it. tears streamed down his cheeks. again and again he saw her flying across the room, again and again he saw her bringing her fist down on the remains of his knee with all the force of an angry drunk hammering on an oak bar, again and again he was swallowed in that terrible blue-white nova of pain. ""please, god, please,"" he moaned as the cherokee started outside with a bang and a roar. ""please, god, please - let me out of this or kill me . . . let me out of this or kill me."" the roar of the engine faded off down the road and god did neither and he was left with his tears and the pain, which was now fully awake and raving through his body.",0,,
171249,"i know two sisters, aged 58 and 60.  the 58 year old has tanned since it became popular in the 80's.  the 60 year old got a very, very bad sunburn while she was a teenager, and has carefully avoided the sun ever since.  she actually burned her tear ducts - her eyes now constantly water.  the 58 year old looks 65.  her skin is leathery and completely covered in very fine wrinkles.  the 60 year old looks 45-50.  her skin dries out badly in the winter, but looks healthy most of the time.  i don't think constantly being tan is good for you.  natives of climates where the sun is out in strength all year have dark skin, they are better able to handle that kind of punishment.    my family is norwegian.  a friend asked me last month while i was wearing a skirt and boots if i was wearing stockings or if i was actually that pale.  i have gotten sunburned while wearing sunscreen, long sleeves, pants, and a baseball cap and spending an hour or two loading a truck on a forklift.  (i think it was the reflection off the ground that got my face, i wasn't expecting the attack on my neck and ears.)  the burn was so bad i was forbidden to go outside during sunlight hours until it calmed down several days later.  a few years later, i went to saudi arabia in the winter, and spent a lot of time working outside.  i was careful to build up a base tan, and managed to avoid getting burned the entire 4 months i was there.  this experience led me to be a big believer in base tans.  i have not yet, but will go to a tanning booth or lay in the sun to get one if i ever am pasty and plan to go someplace sunny.  when i get a burn, i get flu like symptoms.  i get a fever, nausea, dehydration, and can't eat.  i can't even count the number of times i've gotten this bad of a burn while wearing spf 50 or above properly, reapplying every 3 hours.  i feel like it's safer to avoid that and tan than it is to risk it.  i also have an ongoing vitamin d deficiency.  i'm supplementing it, but it definitely lessens when i have even a hint of a tan.  the sun is not all bad, it's just really difficult for some of us to control how much we get.",1,-2,-1

157090,"hey buddy,  i burnt myself a whole new cd collection for the cd wallet in my car a few months back, mainly made up of music i hadn’t heard before.  this is what i'm listening to right now, a brief description of each album, the best tracks, a musical comparison and rating for you.  (obviously imo)   *kasabian - west ryder lunatic pauper asylum*  a really good british band, great driving music - similar to.. hmm.. not sure really, but if you like interpol, the strokes, thats sorta music you'll probably love this.  it’s music from people with long, angled hair cuts, who are exponentially more talented than you are; done right.   - 8.5/10   *thievery corporation - radio retaliation*  teeming with medium paced electronica, lashings of instrumentals from the sub-continent, scratching and utterly smooth in execution, i've been addicted to thievery coropration since i heard a track called ""lebanese blonde"" years and years ago - this album is beautiful, transcendal and definately worth owning.    an absolute joy for stoners, hippies or even just for lovers of cruisy tunes.   - 8.5/10   *calvin harris - ready for the weekend*  i downloaded this album looking for a particular song that wasn't even on it. there are a couple of tracks on here that have been radio raped (track 06; coming home..?? track 13 - dance wit' me.. sigh) and on the whole; the album was pretty average.    the standout by far is track 04 ""you used to hold me"" -  which i actually had stuck in my head for a week.  ""ready for the weekend"", the track itself on the other hand is terrible. a few friends came over to take me to the pub and this song came on, i was literally giving excuses as to why they were having to listen to it.  *""i just got the album and am seeing how it is..  i swear!""*  - 4.5/10   *ministry of sound – chillout sessions 11* (2 disc set)  more of the same, i only got this while waiting for 12 to come out which should be wonderful.  - 7/10   *the white lies – to lose my life*  a decent band, i’m unsure of their origins but this album’s not too bad. a bit lighter-on than kasabian, the 1st track off the cd is the one most people will know. they remind me heaps of the band that sung “you don’t need this disease” – whoever that was.  - 7.5/10   *interpol – our love to admire*  a pretty damn good album from what i assume is an american indie band, tracks 04 and 05 are the big hits from the album (mammoth and some other song that rocks) but i love track 03, a tad slower but sometimes that’s what i want, and need.  - 8/10   *mstrkrft – the looks (2006)*  i got this as a precursor to the aussie dance artists latest album, “fist of god” – it’s much more low-key and track 4 is easily my favourite – it’s almost verging on break beats – which to me is some of the most attitude filled music that makes even the whitest emo bang his head, clench a fist and squeal “yiiiiieaaahh boii!!” at the person next to him.  (re: phat)  - 7/10   *mstrkrft – fist of god (2009)*  his latest album; featuring tracks such as “1000 cigarettes” and “fist of god’ is pretty good as well but track 7’s vocals really did it for me, pick of the bunch after you’ve heard the whole thing a few times. definitely moer gimmicky than “the looks” – but no the whole, more content, and it’s production value comes through.  - 8/10   *grizzly bear – veckatameist*  wow.  just..  wow.  the best, most original album from a band i have heard in a while; this tickles me in a way that great muse album did in terms of overall brilliance, but is so much more indie and underground at it’s core.  the only comparisons i can make to this band are:  - track 02, with the piano music sounds a little like ben folds fives best work  - track 07, once it kicks in sounds eerily like alex lloyd, an australian guitarist and singer. (listen to “trigger” from him to hear similarities)  very very good, well done gb.  - 9/10   *empire of the sun – walking on a dream*  because if these guys took a collective shit then set it on fire; the sound effects would win awards, conquer nations and instigate group sex sessions the world over.  - 8.5/10 – almost impossible to dislike.  (that eos is so hot right now..)   *royksopp – junior (2009)*  ahh royksopp – you’re a genius motherfucker.. full of smooth, varied electronica with great sampling and even better vocals.  tracks 01, 02, 03 are all brilliant; especially 03, which has grown and grown and grown on me. (vision one)  - 8.5/10   *animal collective – merryweather post pavillion*  in the same, overly pretentious vein as kasabian, they’ve gone for some bullshit album title – but hey, the title does not make the album and this one’s pretty damn good in its own right.  i’m not a music connoisseur so i can only say this strikes me as some form of electronic indie music, very layered, probably could be heard many, many times and constantly offer up treats for the listener.  - 7.5/10   *patrick watson – wooden arms*  apparently patrick watson is sampled on some of coldplay’s work; it’s telling too as each of his tracks is emotionally fraught with melancholy, adventure and occasionally a hopeful sunbeam of guitar and vocals mixed in.  sometimes haunting, always beautiful – a first time for everything means if you haven’t heard of this guy before but like deep music, do yourself a favour and try it out.  - 8/10   *handsome furs – face control*  kind of like a mix up of kaiser chiefs, maximo park and the futureheads, with a tad more electronic influence, this is an energetic album with good, brit-style vocals for those who like that sort of thing.  - 7/10   *passion pit – chunk of change*  an interesting album, passion pit are kind of like an infusion between the electronic and light-industrial – almost like ladytron in a way, but not identical, no way.  sometimes their vocals remind me of “architecture in helsinki”, or “the go team’s” work – which isn’t a bad thing – more playful if anything.  - 7/10   *passion pit – manners*  i’m fairly sure this is the most recent album from them; maybe i’m mixed up but i prefer this album to the other offering, a distinct evolution.  if you were to get one of the two, get this one.  - 8/10   *muscles – guns, babes, lemonade*  disappointing, although i don’t know why expectations took a hold of me so..  not the worst thing out, but still enough to make one take to their own privates with a rusty old nordic cheese grater.  the underlying music isn’t so bad, but i kind of find the guy singing, and the lyrics themselves rather lowest common denominator.  (don’t worry lady gaga, your title is still safe)  i just get the feeling he doesn't take his music seriously; in the same way that the fat girl in your neighbourhood who wears lycra pants and slowly walks around the block, sarcastically chewing hubba bubba and winking at all the boys doesn't take her excercise seriously.  - 4/10  *the eels – hombre lobo*  a cool, almost folksy at times album, reminds me of that band named after a motorcycle gang/club, they sung a song called “aint’ no easy way out” – the best song on this album is “fresh blood”, track 07 – and is possibly one of the best songs to drive to during a rainy night, ever.  on your lonesome, looking up at the rear vision mirror casually with each feathered strum of the guitar; the wolf howling on the track causing the hair on the back of your neck to rise as you pull into a hungry jacks drive through –  it’s music for bad motherfuckers that’s for sure, despite the fact you’re just getting a shake or some shit.  - 8/10   *the prodigy – invaders must die*  now, if you’re anything like me, prodigy’s “breathe” was at one point the most intriguing piece of music you’d ever seen. relatively sheltered at a young age from music, i saw the film clip to breathe and at that point wanted nothing more than to walk a crocodile around my block on a leash with crazy peroxide spikes, piercings and the uncanny ability to roll my head around in an almost disjointed fashion.  fast forward and boy, nothing has changed, prodigy was the absolute shiznit back then; which means they’re forever destined to be compared to those days.  this album isn’t as good as their earlier stuff, but it holds up on it’s own merits in places, and “warriors dance” actually isn’t a bad track at all. (track 06)  - 7/10   *phoenix – wolfgang armadeus*  where the fucking shitting hell have these french motherfuckers been the last 25 years of my life.;  this entire album rocks.  for anyone who likes anything with guitars and singing, get this album and get happy, it’s the golden baguette of the english singing, french indie music scene.  almost every track is brilliant but the obvious “lisztomania” and “1901” are the one’s that are getting radio play.  - 9/10   *crystal castles – crystal castles*  a different album, interesting sounds and warping vocals make up the most of this electronic treat – the first track on it is seared in my brain at the moment actually, some really good voice-effects are used rather well.  sometimes their music is almost technical sounding.. like what i imagine the tiny, internal sound of computers working away might sound like..  you’ll know it when you hear it, a distortional method of playing with the effects.    oh, and track 03 is fucking cool.. but let the album ride, it’s a journey.  - 7.5/10   so yeah, that’s what i’m listening to at the moment and what i think about it so far, it’s been a fun voyage.",1,1,

854458,"i've had an ice cream maker for a little over two years and have made two quarts a week for basically that entire time.  i used to have the freezer-core attachment to my kitchenaid, until i wore out the bottom through overuse and it started leaking blue coolant.  now i've got an awesome new machine with a built-in compressor - no more waiting for something to freeze!  and, of course, no messing about with ice and rock salt.      by far, without a doubt, and by a large margin the best ice cream recipes i know come from david lebovitz.  he's got a book of them, and a blog, and he writes columns for newspapers sometimes, but i'll save you the trouble of looking up recipes by telling you the whole secret right now.      basically every flavor ice cream you could ever want can be made using variations on the following simple base:      - 2 cups heavy cream. - 1 cup whole milk. whole. don't try and fool anyone - this is ice cream. - 3/4 cup granulated sugar. - 1 pinch kosher salt. - 6 egg yolks.      always make custard-based ice cream.  unless you're making sorbet.  custard is just better.  always.       1.  1 cup cream and 1 cup milk go into a medium saucepan (i use nonstick only because it's got a black bottom, so the light-colored custard has good contrast), with the sugar and the salt - warm these up to dissolve everything and keep them over medium-low heat       2.  whisk the egg yolks till they're light colored, temper the yolks with the hot mix, and dump everything back into the saucepan.       3.  stir constantly with a silicone spatula, scraping the bottom of the pan, until your custard thickens.  pour the custard through a strainer into the remaining 1 cup cream (still cold from the fridge) in a kitchen bowl.  i'd recommend metal for heat conduction, but it's ok if it's not.  cover with saran wrap, chill down to 4 degrees c in the fridge, and churn according to the directions on your machine.  pack the soft-serve into containers of an appropriate size and freeze down in the freezer for a couple of hours.  or just eat it, either way.      ********      all flavorings can be added in one of a handful of basic ways.      1.  steep herbs and spices in warm milk/cream:  after you've dissolved your sugar and salt, but before you temper your egg yolks, add your flavorings of choice to the saucepan and steep them like tea, with carryover heat only, for up to an hour.  mint, rosemary, actual tea, vanilla, almond and dozens more can be added like this.  last week i used anise seeds, and the week before it was lavender flowers.  use this method for most anything you want to flavor the base uniformly.      2.  add a shot of something nice to the custard just before you churn.  for a batch the size i recommend above (makes about a quart when you're all done) don't add more than a double - even that will make your ice cream pretty loose when you're done, since the alcohol depresses the freezing point, making it harder to get good ice crystal formation.  if you do manage to freeze something too alcoholic your texture will suffer - the ice cream maker isn't cold enough to freeze the etoh solution down fast enough to get nice small crystals.  my favorite here is amaretto - goes great with chocolate swirls... or anything, really.  good dark rum is also good - brandy, irish cream, cognac, whiskey - take your pick.  avoid gin.  trust me.      3.  mix in chunks during the last 5 minutes of churning.  when your ice cream is starting to have texture but hasn't really firmed up yet add chunky mix-ins.  you have to add them late or the ice cream won't be solid enough to support them evenly throughout the batch, but if you wait too long they won't get distributed evenly.  the window here is pretty forgiving - it's ice cream, after all, it won't be bad - but practice makes perfect.  cookie chunks, chocolate chips, candied cherries, peaches, or strawberries - all these come in here.  try drizzling in melted bittersweet chocolate (about 5 oz will do for a batch of the size above) - the chocolate will harden as it hits the cold ice cream and the dasher will break up the long strands into little ripped-up chunks called straciatella.  i like these way better than chocolate chips, for some reason.  if your mix-in is wet be careful not to muddy your ice cream: try to drain your cherries well before putting them in or everything will turn pink and taste like cherries.  i mean, hey, that can be nice, but it's not always what you're going for.  a hint here: chop up your pieces finely.  it's better to have lots of little chunks than big chunks, because inevitably a bunch of big chunks will get stuck together and some ""poor"" soul will get a whole spoonful of 80% cacao chunk, and no ice cream.  and then they'll whine about it.  and you'll have to trust me again when i say that it's really annoying to listen to someone whine about eating chocolate.      4.  stir in ripples as you pack your pint.  if you've got fudge, caramel, fruit syrup, or anything liquid-y add dollops in between scoops as you pack the soft serve into a container as it comes out of the churn.  this is even more forgiving than the mix-ins: you'll feel like there's just giant scoops of liquid dispersed unevenly around plain ice cream, but when you go to scoop it out after it's been frozen down it'll be just fine.  i save the syrup i get from candying fruit and add it here, after thickening it up a little.  chocolate cherry swirl... oh yeah.      just about everything else is a variation on these themes.  i leave out, of course, the secret to the one true chocolate ice cream, but that's a story for another post.      *******      as for flavor ideas, try some of these:    - rosemary chocolate - lavender honey (i add candied peaches to this too, sometimes) - use 3/4 cup of honey here instead of the sugar. - amaretto straciatella - almond cherry chocolate chip (steep roasted almonds in the base like tea, then add chocolate chips and candied cherries as mix ins: it's like cherry garcia, only better) - baileys/chocolate - green tea (use good japanese matcha for this - it comes out better than chinese teas, in my experience) - butternut squash (w/ spiced pecan mix in) - this is a variation: roast the squash, blend up the flesh, sub out half a cup of milk and half a cup of cream for a cup of puree - maple syrup with walnuts - as with honey, sub out the sugar for the syrup. - mint with praline almonds (or chocolate chips, if you're feeling traditional) - coconut rum (sub out half a cup of milk for coconut milk, add shaved coconut mix-in, add a shot and a half of dark rum before churning) - apple (or pear) brandy (vanilla base, little candied apple chunks as mix-ins, 1.5 shots good brandy before churning) - vanilla bourbon (use the good stuff, folks, it's worth it)      or really anything else.  once you've added 3/4 cup of sugar, just about everything tastes sweet.",0,,

(avoid getting egg white on the tube, or the pastry will stick to it.) press well to seal. set aside to let the egg white seal dry a little.  4.	in a deep heavy saucepan, pour enough oil to reach a depth of 3 inches, or if using an electric deep- fryer, follow the manufacturer’s directions. heat the oil to 375°f (190 °c) on a deep fry thermometer, or until a small piece of the dough or bread cube placed in the oil sizzles and browns in 1 minute. have ready a tray or sheet pan lined with paper towels or paper bags.  5.	carefully lower a few of the cannoli tubes into the hot oil. do not crowd the pan. fry the shells until golden, about 2 minutes, turning them so that they brown evenly.  6.	lift a cannoli tube with a wire skimmer or large slotted spoon, out of the oil. using tongs, grasp the cannoli tube at one end. very carefully remove the cannoli tube with the open sides straight up and down so that the oil flows back into the pan. place the tube on paper towels or bags to drain. repeat with the remaining tubes. while they are still hot, grasp the tubes with a potholder and pull the cannoli shells off the tubes with a pair of tongs, or with your hand protected by an oven mitt or towel. let the shells cool completely on the paper towels. place shells on cooling rack until ready to fill.  7.	repeat making and frying the shells with the remaining dough. if you are reusing the cannoli tubes, let them cool before wrapping them in the dough.  cannoli shell preparation, cutting out the dough circles, sealing the dough around the form, frying the shells, finished shells ready to fill  *pasta machine method:*  1.	divide the dough into 4 equal pieces. starting at the middle setting, run one of the pieces of dough through the rollers of a pasta machine. lightly dust the dough with flour as needed to keep it from sticking. pass the dough through the machine repeatedly, until you reach the highest or second highest setting. the dough should be about 4 inches wide and thin enough to see your hand through  2.	continue rolling out the remaining dough. if you do not have enough cannoli tubes for all of the dough, lay the pieces of dough on sheets of plastic wrap and keep them covered until you are ready to use them.  3.	roll, cut out and fry the cannoli shells as according to the directions above.  for stacked cannoli:  1.	heat 2-inches of oil in a saucepan or deep sauté pan, to 350-375°f (176 – 190 °c).  2.	cut out desired shapes with cutters or a sharp knife. deep fry until golden brown and blistered on each side, about 1 – 2 minutes. remove from oil with wire skimmer or large slotted spoon, then place on paper towels or bags until dry and grease free. if they balloon up in the hot oil, dock them lightly prior to frying. place on cooling rack until ready to stack with filling.  **directions for filling:**  1. line a strainer with cheesecloth. place the ricotta in the strainer over a bowl, and cover with plastic wrap and a towel. weight it down with a heavy can, and let the ricotta drain in the refrigerator for several hours to overnight.  2.	in a bowl with electric mixer, beat ricotta until smooth and creamy. beat in confectioner’s sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and blend until smooth. transfer to another bowl and stir in chocolate, zest and nuts. chill until firm.(the filling can be made up to 24 hours prior to filling the shells. just cover and keep refrigerated).  **assemble the cannoli:**  1.	when ready to serve..fill a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain or star tip, or a ziplock bag, with the ricotta cream. if using a ziplock bag, cut about 1/2 inch off one corner. insert the tip in the cannoli shell and squeeze gently until the shell is half filled. turn the shell and fill the other side. you can also use a teaspoon to do this, although it’s messier and will take longer.  2.	press or dip cannoli in chopped pistachios, grated chocolate/mini chocolate chips, candied fruit or zest into the cream at each end. dust with confectioner’s sugar and/or drizzles of melted chocolate if desired.",0,,

534557,"so this started out decently but devolved into a sort of mini-story and i didn't want to go back and rewrite it, so it's probably going to be at least 20,000 characters long :) sorry for the long read and the relatively mediocre story, hope it's enjoyable though! part 2 is nearly finished :d    -----  my team is: ***  **professor x**  **colossus**  **ultimate hulk**  **jubilee** (i've written her as still having her energy ""firework"" powers. sorry if this is not allowed, i'll edit it in that case!)  **storm**  **rhino**    -----    it was a cool, clear morning as the battered delivery truck pulled up alongside the entrance to the gargantuan weapon x facility in an undisclosed location close to the canadian-united states border at around five am. the early morning sun peered out over the dull pastel of the clouds, it's golden tendrils illuminating the peeling paint and rusted metal hinges of the facility. not surprising, considering it hadn't been in proper usage since the weapon x programs of the late 1960s.  the driver of the old van pulled up alongside one of the multiple gates leading into the facility from the front and rolled down the window. before her stood a middle aged man in some sort of military uniform and flat cap, with an automatic rifle of some description slung over one shoulder, his hand seemingly caressing the top of the barrel. he shot the driver a look of suspicion before speaking up in a distinct northern english twang, ""morning, ma'am. state your business please."" the driver of the vehicle, a young asian woman in an oversized beige coat and with a slightly outlandish hair-and-glasses combination, spoke up hesitantly, ""i'm..uh..i'm a driver. have a delivery of..uh..weapons.""  the man shot her a look that said *there's something you're not telling me.* before responding, ""what's a woman like you delivering to a place like this for?""  ""oh so you don't think women should drive? is that it?""  ""that's not what i meant, ma'am. what i meant wa-""  ""good. now let me through."" she paused momentarily, ""please.""  the man heaved a heavy, exasperated sigh, ""okay, alright. id card please. standard routine."" she handed over a decidedly real looking identification card to the middle-age man, who gave it a once-over before handing it back to her and speaking in a reluctant grumble, ""alright. you're cleared. go on through.""  ""thank you very much."" she shot him a saccharine false smile and carefully guided the van through the gates after she was buzzed in, cautiously aiming to park it out of sight of the guards at the gate. the driver's ear hissed and a voice spoke out from the small intercommunication device attached to it, ""jesus, jubilee! what the hell was that!? the whole 'don't you think women can drive thing'? you nearly got us stopped!""   ""sorry, 'roro, i didn't think anything of it. i'll be better next time."" she responded sarcastically, earning her a scoff from the voice on the inter-com. ""enough. jubilee, storm, stay on task."" the voice was that of an aging man. it was firm but not overtly strict or angry, and seemed to hold a certain kindness - a tolerance perhaps - to it's tone. much like the man himself. ""sorry charlie, our fault."" storm apologized.   ""yeah, i guess i'm to bla- hey wait! shit! guys, we've got a problem!"" jubilee spoke in a near-whisper, but she sounded urgent enough to make the two passengers hidden in the back of the van stand alert. the third occupant of the vehicle was a giant of a man, with cropped black hair and deep blue eyes that showed torment and suffering beyond his physical appearance. he spoke with a slight russian accent, which seemed to come to prominence during difficult situations such as the one he was currently facing, ""what is it, comrade?""  ""uh..the guys from the gate. they're all sort of...rushing over here. with guns. and they're shouting something.""   ""alright, alright. jubilee, keep calm. act natural, don't do anything too rash."" storm spoke as if guiding the young woman who had finished bringing the van to a stationary halt. the middle-aged man came rushing up to the car, hands on the weapon slung across his midsection, and jubilee could make out at least a dozen more similar looking soldiers take positions around the van, looking as if they were aware of some sort of threat within the vehicle.   *well, they're not wrong.* jubilee mused, almost aloud.  the soldier with the flat cap unhooked some sort of small electronic monitor from his belt and clumsily punched a combination of buttons on the small lcd screen before speaking in a less than enthusiastic manner, ""mrs jubilation lee. sorry for the disturbance ma'am. we're going to have to ask you to leave your vehicle please. slowly and carefully now.""  ""miss.""  ""i'm sorry ma'am?""  ""miss jubilation lee."" she glossed over him once with a look of mock disgust as she stepped out of the van's cabin with her hands above her head. the guard returned the scanner to his belt and cautiously raised the barrel of his gun towards jubilee. he held up a hand in a wave, motioning two of the soldiers behind him to take up positions at the rear end of the truck, ""we're going to have to ask you to come with us, ma'am.""  ""i wouldn't do that if i were you."" she spoke directly to the two men who had moved a second earlier, ""and i'm quite sorry.""  ""ma'am? sorry for what?"" he asked, but it was more out of curiosity than confusion,  ""for this.""  in less time than it took for the soldier to react, jubilee flicked her hands outwards in a burst of light. football-sized globules of multicoloured energy seemed to appear out of nowhere in her palms, pulsing and radiating. there was a hoarse whirring sound as she cocked her arms back, followed by a series of short crackling bursts as the balls hovering above her hands spun into motion, colliding with the nearest two men like bright fireworks dissipating in the night sky, sending them hurling to the floor. as the other soldiers turned attentively and trained their barrels on her, she gave a single, simple command,  ""now.""  the rusted doors of the van blew off their hinges so quickly it seemed the action had preceded the order, with a whining metallic snap - the impact flooring the two men who had been stood near it. from the van's storage came two people, so different they looked to be out of some sort of comedy circus act. one was a woman, short and thin, with wispy white hair trailing down her back and light brown skin, and the other was a herculean amalgamation of human-like facial features and thick, gun-metal silver skin from head to toe, akin to a giant steel robot with human emotions. one thing they did hold in common, however, was the frighteningly quick way they sprung into action. colossus leapt forward, practically surging his way out of the confines of the truck, and floored the two guards closest to him with two sharp, precise blows that were powerful enough to punch through a small car. it was a miracle it didn't kill them on the spot.  the woman, whose eyes had rolled back to a pure white, stood facing the remaining soldiers in front of her with a look of pure rage engrained onto her small face, as if she had become a different person almost. she raised her arms like some sort of orchestra conductor and there was a shrill *whoosh* that cut through the air, like the wind had suddenly picked up an astonishing amount of speed, followed by a large gust of easily visible wind. a miniature tornado. it seemed to rise out of the ground like some sort of angered demon giving off plumes of supercharged wind, rotating faster and faster and closer and closer until it reached the feet of the soldiers less than ten metres in front of her, sweeping them up effortlessly and hurling them through the air like small paper dolls.   ""any more, comrades?""  colossus challenged,  ""no, i think we're good"" storm responded. she flipped the switch on her inter-com, ""charlie, it's me. we're inside. ran into a bit of trouble but we're good. no doubt they'll be more of them deeper in though.""  xavier responded, ""good work. the main control room is where the plans are stored, but it's in the building in the far left-hand corner of the complex, so you're going to have to navigate your way through one by one. i'm sorry, but that aren't any alternatives.""  ""piece a' cake."" jubilee chimed in, ""won't even work up a sweat. c'mon, let's get going.""  she slid her comically inappropriate pink glasses over her eyes and turned on her heels towards the first factory building.  *this is gonna be a long morning.*  *** **restricted-access sentinel production facility, undisclosed location, canada** ***  ""...and this'll work?""  ""yes.""  ""how d' ya' know?""  ""i'm smarter than you, aleksei. i know what i'm doing.""  the titan of a man who had asked the original question gave a low grunt, partly out of reluctant understanding and partly out of a somewhat rational hatred towards his brash speaking companion, before turning back to the task at hand. his equally large gray-skinned friend spoke up,  ""professor, we're in position.""  ""good. wait for the signal.""  ""what signal would that be?""  ""you won't miss it.""  before they had chance to switch off their inter-coms there was a deafening, shrieking explosion that pierced the air with a shrill. there was a burst of superheated light from deep within the bowels of the factory, hurling heavy chunks of brick through the air in every direction, followed by a scalding wave of orange-tinged dust, so hot that it managed to singe the hairs on the arms of the giant gray monster barrelling down on the multistory factory from its eastern fence.  ""intruder! eastern front! all units, high alert! level zero threat! we are crimson! i repeat! level zero threat! we are crimson! mobilize the sentinels!""  the voice came clamoring through the dispensable military radios with startling urgency.  *** **continued in part 2**. ***",1,,0

503549,"hair color, skin color and hair color all have to do with pigment.  hair's pigment is eumelanin and has two subtypes, black and brown- brown and blonde hair has the brown eumelanin and black is, well, for black hair.  pheomelanin is dominant in red hair.  the more melanin the darker the hair, white and grey is from a lack of melanin (melanocytes stop or decrease production).  when chemically removing melanin (bleaching), if you start at black it will ho through several colors before you reach that blonde or white that is typically desired.  all hair has some pheomelanin.  pheomelanin is more chemically stable than black eumelanin but less chemically stable then brown.  this is what causes the red, orange and yellow tints you see as the pigment lifts.  skin color is mostly due to melanin, especially in darker skin.  people with light skin is determined mainly by the bluish-white connective tissue under the dermis and by the hemoglobin circulating.  the red color (blushing) is from arterioles dilating.  light skin can be darkened by tanning.  it's been observed that women have lighter skin than men, and this is theorized to be due to calcium absorption which is needed during pregnancy and lactation- vitamin d (from sunlight) helps absorb sunlight.  melanin is produced by melanocytes in a process called melanogenisis.  melanin is triggered by an enzyme called tyrosinase, which created the color of hair, skin and eyes.  again, there are two types of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin.  eumelanin is found in hair, areola and skin and the hair colors black, brown, yellow and grey.  it is more abundant in people with dark skin.  pheomelanin, a pink to red hue, is found in large quantities of red hair, lips, nipples, glands of the penis and vagina.  the amount and type of melanin and genes is controlled by genes, simply put.  dark skin theorized to be for skin protection, and light skin is theorized to be in relation for the need of vitamin d absorbsion.  [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_skin_color) wiki goes into more detail about skin, both the variations of the genes as well as the evolution of skin color.",1,0,0

finish remains. it's a weird way to describe it but i feel like the sparkles in this hourglass powder are more controlled and evenly spaced. in comparison, bm glow's sparkles seem to patch and concentrate, so i have areas where there is more powdery sparkle. individual sparkles appear to be smaller but reflect more light as they are brighter and stand out more. i was mistaken and thought that the hourglass sparkles are bigger because they were brighter. not 100% but i think that they reflect more light because when i turn my arm to catch the light, it seems that they *miight* be smaller because the reflection disappears and sinks into my skin. i assume that this gives a more ""dimensioned"" look, whereas bm glow will try to sparkle no matter what angle you view it at. in direct sunlight, people will be able to see that your face is glittery so beware. that's why i'm not a fan of the ambient lighting powders because i don't want to look like a disco ball. when photographed with this on my face, there doesn't really seem to be an effect. i like how it looks in the daylight. it coats my features in a fine cool-toned glow. i can see the moonlight effect they were trying to achieve here. but i don't think it's a very noticeable glow on my nc20-25 skin. i think this would be beautiful on fair skin. on an aside, dim lighting (the yellow one) is uber glittery and more sparkley and horrendous in direct sunlight than ethereal light.  bm glow accentuates the skin's texture on my arm. it's like i can see individual skin flakes. it's far more shimmery overall. there are some intensely shimmery sparkles and other sparkles that are more dull. on my face, it gives a cool, bluey glow. very natural and pretty looking. once blended in, it doesn't budge. i used this all over my face like you would with a finishing powder and got a very slight white cast and lots of sparkle. it looks more noticeable and prominent.  bm matte gives a luminous finish while muting sheen. it's not very effective at setting or mattifying over extended periods. it blends easily and is not very pigmented. it reminds me of the middle banana shade in the tarte rainforest of the sea highlight palette in that they are fine, thin, dusty powders and that people don't think it does much but when you look very closely you can see its effect. i scraped it as it  developed hard pan very quickly. actually it was always hard. hard to get product out of too. it has a white cast so be careful of putting on too much. it's a little bit chunky too.  similarities: both are very fine, white-based powders. the sparkles are silver. both are easy to blend in.  differences: bm glow has a more peach tone to it but it is not perceivable once applied to the face. there is a higher concentration of sparkle in bm glow. hourglass ethereal light is far more pigmented.  blending bm glow and matte makes glow more opaque by giving it a white base. i bet you could use this to strengthen your highlight which is cool. at this point when you blend it in it looks quite similar to ethereal light because ethereal light is more opaque and has a white backing than glow on its own. ethereal light is still more ashy and opaque than the blend. the blend still retains glow's textured highlight. it is noticeable that the blend is more warm toned than ethereal light as ethereal is a straight white. i think the blend gives a sheen underlay versus glow's pure silver sparkle.  is bareminerals glow a dupe for hourglass ethereal light? in terms of the sparkle effect, yes. bm glow is a better highlight and should not be used all over whereas hg ethereal light can work as a highlight (more subtle) and can be used all over. bm glow should not be used as a finishing powder. bm matte is not the best mattifying powder out there. it is not very effective at setting makeup or mattifying for extended periods of time. bm glow does not give the ""ambient lighting effect"" that hourglass totes. the bareminerals translucent powder duo and hourglass alp have different effects and purposes but are similar enough in certain ways that will allow for interchangeable use as a highlight. if i had to choose i would prefer the hourglass powder because i don't have any finishing powders and because i like wearing a cool tint in the winter. i already have highlighters and matte powders so the bareminerals powder duo is not necessary for me. but ultimately i don't really want either of them.",1,1,
709446,"i was at a graduation party for a fairly good friend of mine—a “grandma and grandpa brought the veggie spread” party, not a “keg’s in the back under that passed out homeless guy” kind—when at about 9 pm it became clear that the evening had gone into cardiac arrest. seventeen years old and with no other party to go to, my best friend kabir and i refused to face the reality of heading home early, a friday night wasted on small talk and celery sticks. instead, we got to talking.  “you should streak,” kabir said, as casually as he would offer me a cigarette, “c’mon, everyone would love it. they loved it at that party last week. and people just kind of expect that kind of thing from you now.”  he was right. last week’s streaking was a successful attempt at resuscitating an equally dead shindig, a stunt that involved me sneaking around some grandparents, screaming “happy birthday to you” at the birthday girl while pointing at my violently wiggling bits, jogging down the street until kabir and my clothes caught up with me, and becoming headline news at school monday morning. and this was just a boil in a rash of other naked antics, not the least of which was a constantly recurring bet that i could get undressed in ten seconds or less, or else lose a dollar to the challenger. (if i had a dollar for every time i lost that bet, i would break even.) i was the prometheus of bare-ass, and indeed streaking was just what people came to expect from me. but tonight just wasn’t right for it.  “where would i go?” i asked, sizing up the eight-foot cinder block walls that lined the graduate’s house. “once i got to the backyard, i’d be stuck. and vulnerable. you’d have to pole-vault to get over these walls. no way it would work.”  kabir was upset by the refusal to perform, so i racked my brain for a better and more viable option. a thought condensed like hot breath on my skull.  “what if i shit in the sink?”  kabir laughed out loud. there was a beat of radiant silence, and then he was serious, “holy shit, ben. yes. you have to do it. it’s ridiculous. you have to do it.”  that was all it took. with one simple proposal i had cast a spell that would drastically change and ultimately define the next two years of my life. it was an idea so outlandish and beyond anything i’d ever done that there was no possible way to say no to it. the momentum of it was intoxicating. so while kabir coolly mingled with unsuspecting party-goers, i raced to the snack bar and set upon eating every bit of fiber i could find. this unfortunately left me with only a slice of chocolate cake and the twiggy vines from some worn-out grape clusters, but when life gives you lemons, you turn that shit into poop. and that’s just what i did. after nearly twenty minutes of gnawing twigs and chugging water—twenty minutes where i did not once question the absolute hilarity and brilliance of this deed—i went and got kabir.  “showtime,” i said, electric with anticipation. he followed me to the guest bathroom. this was my moment, the superman in his phone booth. “watch the door,” i said, “i’ll be out in a minute.”  the graduate’s guest bathroom is as vivid in memory today as the day i defiled it. blue porcelain toilet and sink, blue mosaic detailing, cream-colored hand towels. a genuinely nice guest bathroom, and the stage for one of the most perverse parlor tricks ever performed. the most peculiar thing about evacuating into a sink is just how high off the ground it requires you to be, legs flopping about like an incontinent dunce in a backless high chair. not to mention all that lower back strain from hovering. but perseverance is the secret to sneaky excrement—it’s just slightly more important than a busted moral compass—and soon i was feeling the silent intestinal whisper of a job well done.  there was a knock at the door.  “who is it?” i stuttered, praying to hear kabir’s voice. i did not. i heard nothing. and then another knock, faster and louder than the first. “just a minute!” i whined, panic descending like burning mudflow, and it was only then that i realized there was no easy way out of this bathroom. i had never considered an exit strategy. the window was too small and too high up, there were no air conditioning vents. i was trapped in this room with a turd as black and evil as a brimstone brownie, and the only way out was through whatever unsuspecting person resided on the other side of that mahogany door. there was no way around this. i flushed the toilet for appearance’s sake, splashed water on my face, and opened the door. in front of me was the graduate’s nephew, a kid no more than six years old who i had met earlier that evening. a kid with oversized glasses and a blonde bowl cut. a kid who had done nothing in his life that would make him deserving of that guest bathroom. time slowed as i passed him, and the only thing i remember hearing is his tiny innocent soprano asking “what’s in the sink?” before i was out the front door and speeding off in my car.  i was five minutes away from my house, had just finished forcing myself to cry to henry gross’s “shannon,” when i realized that i had left kabir at the party. alone. in what was surely a torch-bearing ben-hating mob at this point. i raced back and found him across the street from the graduate’s house, by himself, head shaking slowly. “what the fuck, ben?” was all he said as he climbed into my car, the only relevant question at the moment, and all i could answer was, “i know. i know, i know, i know.” we drove the rest of the way in silence.  we got home a little after 10 to find my parents awake and unsuspecting. their laid-back enjoyment of our presence at such an early hour was so unexpected and refreshing that all the events of the evening just fell away, like that, a sooty smoking jacket left by the door. i was home, and everything instantly felt fine. kabir and i sat out on my porch late into the night, drinking beer in the warm summer starshine and making up dirty limericks, never once seriously considering the soiled sink. my favorite limerick follows:      there once was a guy from versailles,     who liked to put his dick in his eye.     one day he broke through     to his cerebellum, it’s true,     and skull-fucked himself till he died!  i fell asleep that night with a pillow-soft conscience and a smile on my face. i awoke the next morning to my cellphone ringing. without a second thought, i answered it. it was the graduate’s dad. “hello, ben. are your parents home, and may i speak to them, please?” there are no curse words deep enough to convey the disintegration in my stomach that followed this question, and as i silently hung up the phone i began to realize just how horrible this day was going to be, the promise of consequence slowly washing against reality like a tide of cold piss.  tl;dr: shat in a girl's sink at her graduation party. it was a pretty bad idea.",0,,

112218,"thank you :d  [greens palette analysis](http://i.imgur.com/hatuuuj.jpg) going l to r, top row then bottom...  **top row**  * **mufe 646 latte-** i consider this to be (on me) medium-light (leaning more medium) warm-neutral brown. it's heavily yellow, not heavily orange, which makes it quite different from mac soft brown. i find i don't like using this with my normal eye looks- it isn't orange *enough* and it's slightly too dense and pigmented to be used in a very fluffy/diffused application. it works better as an ""edge"" color where you can see a bit peeking out as it gives some visual heft and definition. works well with greens and i think it would work well with blues and silvers on warm-toned people too, as the contrast wouldn't be jarring orange + cool. this might look too yellow on cooler-toned people. i don't like it with bronzes as it's too yellow and not orange enough.  * **coastal scents fools gold-** this is a fairly sheer matte, it reminds me of mac mattes in that it swatches terribly but applies perfectly well. i actually *like* the formula of coastal scents mattes because i find them to be more refined than something like the mug mattes, which just are the eyeshadow equivalent of a seagull taking a dump on me. just overload, so dense, all at once, hate it. anyhoo, this is not like that. it's quite a greenish, sickly yellow color which makes it not versatile but very good for softening up the matte green edges here and melding them with the yellow-brown. i don't think i could use this with anything but a green look and have it work well. certainly not with purples and *probably* not with browns/bronzes. maybe with a gold look actually (like a real yellow-gold.)  * **mac plumage-** i loooove this color. i owned it back in high school, panned it and lost the remaining bits in college, and repurchased this recently during a mac sale. i find it to be a wonderful texture- my favorite for mattes. it resembles mac sketch- bad in swatches, heavenly and dense on a liner brush, soft and buildable but true-to-hue on a blending brush. really excellent with brown eyes, it's not too obviously ""blue"" but if worn alone will definitely read peacocky. i used it in this look on the lower and upper lashlines, and that gave more intensity to the shimmery colors layered on top without relying on really dark colors like black (which overwhelm me in the daytime) or a color like a dark brown which will muddy the greens of the look and take it to a too-neutral/subtle place imo.  * **mufe 322 khaki-** i have no excuses- i bought this bad boy because i needed a sophisticated green to use in a crease with my olive looks. i wouldn't recommend anybody do this unless they are in the habit of wearing olive smoky eyes at least 1x a week, i mean...you just don't need an army green matte shade unless you are trying to blend out green eyeshadow. it's not a workhorse for a lot of looks unless you already plan to wear greens that much. that being said, this does not blend out to a muddy brown, it's a true olive green that diffuses with the trademark mufe texture- silky and pigmented but able to be buffed out into a gentle gradient. this color is neutral- if it were any warmer it would pull brown. but it's not a cool or ashy/gray shade. so i think if you are in the market for an olive matte (and only then) this is a good option. for those who've never dreamed of wearing olive matte shadow in their life, the chances that you are truly missing out are near-zero.  **bottom row**  * **mug desert sands-** we already know how i feel about mug matte textures so i'm going to skip another tirade. but this color is very unflattering for my skintone when worn allover or all through the crease. it's a sickly yellow-gray kind of brown that pulls too dirty and too dense to be sheered out to anything but a bruise-y looking patch. however. in small doses, it's basically a denser version of fool's gold and therefore good for using in very limited parts of the crease. would work 10000x better on people with skintones deeper than mine (let's say nc25 and above but closer to nc30 i think.) it would also work on people who are super true-warm toned and not olive-skinned like myself. i think it would possibly work on paler, cooler girls because it would have a greater, more obvious and artistic ""contrast"" whereas it just gets muddy on my skin.  * **coastal scents elven gold-** the texture of this is not ideal- it has those flaky shimmer particles and a sheer base that are kinda shitty in a highlight shade. but it layers exceptionally well over darker shimmery colors to give that nice inner-lid gradient. it's a yellow-green pearly shade that leans more green than yellow. again only a must-have if you do green eye looks frequently. would look nice with turquoise, dark green, olive, and possibly blue (teal-leaning blue.) wouldn't be of much use in a rosegold, warm, etc type of application, so if those are the colors you lean to, this will be useless in your collection. if   * **dawn eyes cosmetics sandcastle-** this is an indie shadow i pressed myself. it's a warm, reflective green olive-with-gold color with no dirtiness/brown undertones (like the ones in sumptuous olive from mac for instance.) it's not purely metallic- there are very fine glitter/shimmer particles as there are with almost every indie shade. i love the color so much because it doesn't turn muddy swamp brown on me but the texture is nothing like a mainstream, smooth shadow. i prefer ud metallic shades because they're tightly packed but almost wet-feeling. really easy to blend with no fallout. this requires a patting motion and a lot of care but the color is honestly perfect for my warm skin and brown eyes, so it's doable for me. i think this is best for people who find that olive-shimmers go brown or yellow on them. it ""keeps"" its green on my warm skin, which is why i love it so much. it's lighter used alone, looks more like a sage [green](http://i.imgur.com/8yqo3zl.jpg?1) without any base but i used the mufe khaki shade as a base which made it read slightly deeper and more intense.  overall this palette is constructed to really optimize the earthy, golden warm olive eye i go for. i don't think this palette could be used by someone with very deep skin because of the lack of vibrant jewel tones. the muted nature and warm undertones are exactly what i go for but these colors (with the exception of plumage) wouldn't work for hunter-green or emerald type looks

preparation #1 uses any amide, or lysergic acid as  starting material. preparations #2 and #3 must start with lysergic acid only, prepared from  the amides as follows:   10 g of any lysergic acid amide from various natural sources dissolved in 200 ml of  methanolic koh solution and the methanol removed immediately in vacuo. the residue is  treated with 200 ml of an 8% aqueous solution of koh and the mixture heated on a steam  bath for one hour. a stream of nitrogen gas is passed through the flask during heating and  the evolved nh3 gas may be titrated is hcl to follow the reaction. the alkaline solution is  made neutral to congo red with tartaric acid, filtered, cleaned by extraction with ether, the  aqueous solution filtered and evaporated. digest with meoh to remove some of the  coloured material from the crystals of lysergic acid.   arrange the lighting in the lab similarly to that of a dark room. use photographic red and  yellow safety lights, as lysergic acid derivatives are decomposed when light is present.  rubber gloves must be worn due to the highly poisonous nature of ergot alkaloids. a hair  drier, or, better, a flash evaporator, is necessary to speed up steps where evaporation is  necessary.   preparation #1   step i. use yellow light   place one volume of powdered ergot alkaloid material in a tiny roundbottom flask and add  two volumes of anhydrous hydrazine. an alternate procedure uses a sealed tube in which  the reagents are heated at 112 c. the mixture is refluxed (or heated) for 30 minutes. add  1.5 volumes of h2o and boil 15 minutes. on cooling in the refrigerator, isolysergic acid  hydrazide is crystallised.   step ii. use red light   chill all reagents and have ice handy. dissolve 2.82 g hydrazine rapidly in 100 ml 0.1 n  ice-cold hcl using an ice bath to keep the reaction vessel at 0 c. 100 ml ice-cold 0.1 n  nano2 is added and after 2 to 3 minutes vigorous stirring, 130 ml more hcl is added  dropwise with vigorous stirring again in an ice bath. after 5 minutes, neutralise the solution  with nahco3 saturated sol. and extract with ether. remove the aqueous solution and try  to dissolve the gummy substance in ether. adjust the ether solution by adding 3 g  diethylamine per 300 ml ether extract. allow to stand in the dark, gradually warming up to  20 c over a period of 24 hours. evaporate in vacuum and treat as indicated in the  purification section for conversion of iso-lysergic amides to lysergic acid amides.  preparation #2   step i. use yellow light   5.36 g of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml of acetonitrile and the suspension  cooled to about -20 c in a bath of acetone cooled with dry ice. to the suspension is added  a cold (-20 c) solution of 8.82 g of trifluoroacetic anhydride in 75 ml of acetonitrile. the  mixture is allowed to stand at -20 c for about 1.5 hours during which the suspended  material dissolves, and the d-lysergic acid is converted to the mixed anhydride of lysergic  and trifluoroacetic acids. the mixed anhydride can be separated in the form of an oil by  evaporating the solvent in vacuo at a temperature below 0 c, but this is not necessary.  everything must be kept anhydrous.   step ii. use yellow light   the solution of mixed anhydrides in acetonitrile from step i is added to 150 ml of a second  solution of acetonitrile containing 7.6 g of diethylamine. the mixture is held in the dark at  room temperature for about 2 hours. the acetonitrile is evaporated in vacuo, leaving a  residue of lsd-25 plus other impurities. the residue is dissolved in 150 ml of chloroform  and 20 ml of ice water. the chloroform layer is removed and the aqueous layer is  extracted with several portions of chloroform. the chloroform portions are combined and  in turn washed with four 50 ml portions of ice-cold water. the chloroform solution is then  dried over anhydrous na2so4 and evaporated in vacuo.   preparation #3   this procedure gives good yield and is very fast with little iso-lysergic acid being formed  (its effect are mildly unpleasant). however, the stoichometry must be exact or yields will  drop.   step i. use white light   sulfur trioxide is produced in anhydrous state by carefully decomposing anhydrous ferric  sulfate at approximately 480 c. store under anhydrous conditions.   step ii. use white light   a carefully dried 22 litre rb flask fitted with an ice bath, condenser, dropping funnel and  mechanical stirrer is charged with 10 to 11 litres of dimethylformamide (freshly distilled  under reduced pressure). the condenser and dropping funnel are both protected against  atmospheric moisture. 2 lb of sulfur trioxide (sulfan b) are introduced dropwise, very  cautiously stirring, during 4 to 5 hours. the temperature is kept at 0-5 c throughout the  addition. after the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1-2 hours until some  separated, crystalline sulfur trioxide-dimethylformamide complex has dissolved. the  reagent is transferred to an air- tight automatic pipette for convenient dispensing, and kept  in the cold. although the reagent, which is colourless, may change from yellow to red, its efficiency remains unimpaired for three to four months in cold storage. an aliquot is  dissolved in water and titrated with standard naoh to a phenolphthalein end point.   step iii. use red light   a solution of 7.15 g of d-lysergic acid mono hydrate (25 mmol) and 1.06 g of lithium  hydroxide hydrate (25 mmol) in 200 ml of meoh is prepared. the solvent is distilled on  the steam bath under reduced pressure. the residue of glass-like lithium lysergate is  dissolved in 400 ml of anhydrous dimethyl formamide. from this solution about 200 ml of  the dimethyl formamide is distilled off at 15 ml pressure through a 12 inch helices packed  column. the resulting anhydrous solution of lithium lysergate left behind is cooled to 0 c  and, with stirring, treated rapidly with 500 ml of so3-dmf solution (1.00 molar). the  mixture is stirred in the cold for 10 minutes and then 9.14 g (125.0 mmol) of diethylamine  is added. the stirring and cooling are continued for 10 minutes longer, when 400 ml of  water is added to decompose the reaction complex. after mixing thoroughly, 200 ml of  saturated aqueous saline solution is added. the amide product is isolated by repeated  extraction with 500 ml portions of ethylene dichloride. the combined extract is dried and  then concentrated to a syrup under reduced pressure. do not heat up the syrup during  concentration. the lsd may crystallise out, but the crystals and the mother liquor may be  chromatographed according to the instructions on purification.   purification of lsd-25   the material obtained by any of these three preparations may contain both lysergic acid  and iso-lysergic acid amides. preparation #1 contains mostly iso-lysergic diethylamide and  must be converted prior to separation. for this material, go to step ii first.  step i. use darkroom and follow with a long wave uv  the material is dissolved in a 3:1 mixture of benzene and chloroform. pack the  chromatography column with a slurry of basic alumina in benzene so that a 1 inch column  is six inches long. drain the solvent to the top of the alumina column and carefully add an  aliquot of the lsd-solvent solution containing 50 ml of solvent and 1 g lsd. run this  through the column, following the fastest moving fluorescent band. after it has been  collected, strip the remaining material from the column by washing with meoh. use the  uv light sparingly to prevent excessive damage to the compounds. evaporate the second  fraction in vacuo and set aside for step ii. the fraction containing the pure lsd is  concentrated in vacuo and the syrup will crystallise slowly. this material may be converted  to the tartrate by tartaric acid and the lsd tartrate conveniently crystallised. mp 190-196  c.  step ii. use red light   dissolve the residue derived from the methanol stripping of the column in a minimum  amount of alcohol. add twice that volume of 4 n alcoholic koh solution and allow the  mixture to stand at room temperature for several hours. neutralise with dilute hcl, make slightly basic with nh4oh and extract with chloroform or ethylene dichloride as in  preparations #1 or #2. evaporate in vacuo and chromatograph as in the previous step.   note: lysergic acid compounds are unstable to heat, light and oxygen. in any form it helps  to add ascorbic acid as an anti- oxidant, keeping the container tightly closed, light-tight  with aluminum foil, and in a refrigerator.",0,,

329503,"copy pasted from www.teaclass.com  talking tea - lesson #03  ---  now that you've learned a bit about properly tasting tea, let's discuss how to effectively talk about tea. the ability to accurately describe the appearance and aroma is critical to sharing your passion for tea. in this lesson we'll discuss some of the more commonly used terms and what they mean. this is best done in person, but we'll do our best to make it easy.  the leaf - **leafy or full leaf:** used to describe teas that have large, open leaves. most often these are oolongs or white teas like white peony. wiry: used to describe teas that have long, thin, tightly rolled leaves. an easy example would be a black tea like keemun concerto.  **needles:** used to describe teas that are either just the leaf bud (not yet opened), or young, opened leaves which have been tightly rolled back into the needle-like shape they had just before opening. most often these are white teas like silver needle or green teas like anji duet.  **pearls or pellets:** used to describe teas that have been rolled into round balls. most often these are oolongs like jasmine pearl or green teas like gunpowder. **note:** *if the roll is relatively loose, it is sometimes called a ""curl"" since it has not been rolled into a perfect sphere.*  **tippy:** used to describe teas that have very visible white buds (buds may appear golden in the case of oxidized black teas). most often these are whites, oolongs or black teas like golden monkey. flat or pan fired: used to describe teas that have been pressed flat (usually by being pan fired). most often these are green teas like dragonwell. traditionally this approach is associated with chinese teas. pan fired teas tend to have a grassy, slightly roasted aroma and flavor.  **steamed:** used to describe teas that have been steamed. most often these are japanese green teas which can be identified by their dark green color and ""shiny"" leaves. their aroma tends to be sweet and briny (like seaweed). a good example is sencha. broken: used to describe teas where the leaves have been broken into smaller fragments during rolling. most often these are black teas like the base used for cherry. broken teas tend to be slightly less expensive and deliver a stronger cup when brewed for the same amount of time.  -----------  the liquor -   the liquid that results from brewing tea is called the *liquor*. the potential colors (especially if you include tisanes and flavored teas) run the spectrum of the rainbow. there is no right or wrong here. get creative and look for terms that you are comfortable with but that are also descriptive. for example, use straw instead of pale yellow; amber instead of orange; jade or emerald instead of green; khaki or olive instead of tan; copper instead of light brown; and mahogany or cognac instead of dark brown.  **flavor and aroma**  the sense of smell and taste are so intricately linked that we'll address them together. one thing to keep in mind is that an unfamiliar word means nothing to a customer. it's useful to know the proper word when talking to a connoisseur, but watch your audience and shift to more general language if necessary.  **astringent:** tea is filled with natural antioxidants, also known as polyphenols. these provide the health benefits in tea and also a good portion of the taste. polyphenols bind with our saliva and create a dry sensation on the tongue and sides of the mouth. they also provide the brisk, tannic bite that is associated with tea. whereas bitterness is a center-back of the tongue experience, astringency is sensed more along the sides of back of your tongue with a physical sensation that is similar to sour. also important to note: astringency is a physical sensation, whereas bitterness is a flavor - the two can easily be confused, but they are different. while astringency may take some getting used to, at the proper levels it is actually a highly prized characteristic of the finest teas. cup an excellent first flush darjeelings for a good experience with astringency.  **vegetal:** this is the proper descriptor for what makes a green tea green. synonyms include herbaceous, crisp, green, and grassy.  **briny:** most often associated with steamed japanese green teas, briny is a good synonym for the seaweed-like taste of these wonderful teas. briny evokes notes of asparagus, spinach, kelp, and the aroma of the sea. often, in finer japanese green teas like gyokuro this taste is accompanied by a wonderfully refreshing and bright sweet, fruity, finish.  **floral:** this term evokes a warm, bright, sweet, pleasant aroma something like perfume. it's a bit of a loose term, but some of the best examples of floral teas are the high-mountain green oolongs like ali shan. look for the exquisite notes of lilac blossoms with a smooth, buttery finish when cupping these teas.  **roasted or toasted:** especially common among chinese green teas is a unique flavor that lies somewhere between roasted chestnuts, walnuts or almonds and straw or hay. sometimes called nutty, this flavor is generally created by pan-firing or certain tea drying techniques. cup a dragonwell for an example of this flavor.  **umami:** if you consider yourself a foodie at heart, this is a term that may already speak to your palate. umami is the fifth taste component (in addition to salty, sweet, sour and bitter). it is the physical experience of taste; the mouthfeel of the tea. consider chicken broth: it is salty, certainly, but it also has a rich, savory, buttery taste to it that is far from salty, sweet, sour or bitter. this savory flavor is umami. search for this richness alongside the bright, fruity notes of a gyokuro and you'll begin to see what the nuance of flavor and aroma is all about.  **muscatel:** what does a tea from darjeeling taste like? a connoisseur will immediately answer ""muscatel"". this term is borrowed from the white, muscat grape used for making certain sweet, sparkling wines. muscatel is brisk, astringent, bright and floral with a dry finish. the best examples are first flush darjeelings.  **strong:** this one is pretty straight forward. it has a lot of taste! common synonyms include full bodied, bold, rich, robust and heavy.  **earthy:** earthy may overlap at times with strong, but it is also savory, woody, musty and sometimes sweet. think mushrooms and potting soil. this may be hard to associate with tea, but cup a good chinese yunnan and you'll see what we mean.  **malty:** the word is borrowed from the rich, caramel sweetness of fermented barley or wheat. while the process is completely different in tea, some strong black teas like the assam harmony offer this honeyed, brown sugar richness. often malty teas are also highly astringent, but not always. chinese keemuns are sometimes malty without astringency (smooth).  **smooth:** teas with a full body but without the astringent ""bite"" often associated with tea may be called smooth, soft, mild, mellow or round. chinese keemuns are great examples of a very rich tea that is always smooth. oolongs may also be regularly characterized as smooth.",0,,
954741,"ahh... an excellent question, and i have just the answer for you.  remember when michael jackson was a negro?  i do.  remember how in the early 90's he was suddenly a cracker?  well, thru a complex process known as skin bleaching, you too can be ghostly white and creepy!  first off i want you to go down to the hardware store and buy a porcelain bathtub, with 2 holes cut out of the front section for the hot / cold water adjustment handles.  the spiggot will come over the top of the tub, as i like it to.  also buy 20 gallons of clorox bleach, a pumous stone , sand paper, and a box of nerds candy, because hey, life aint sweet but you can be.  go home, place the bathtub in your living room on the floor, fill it with bleach.  you should have the song ""goodbye horses"" of silence of the lambs fame playing on continuous loop during this process, at high volume.  take off all your clothes, and lay in the bathtub of bleach.  begin vigorously scrubbing yourself head to toe, alternating between the sand paper and the pumous stone, you want to get the bleach as deep into your skin and pores as possible to cause the affect you desire, that is , bleached ghost white skin.  do this vigorously for exactly 37 minutes an 18 seconds, at that point, stop.  are you bleeding?  does it burn like the fires of hades?  good, you are on your way.  get out of the tub, and dry off.  now i want you to break into a hospital.  you'll need some coveralls, and a ""guillermo"" name tag.  go in thru the front door of the hospital, and begin looking around for other janitors.  go introduce yourself as the new guy, exchange pleasantries and be on your way to learning the difficult , illustrious job of minimum wage hospital janitor.  after a few hours you will get a break, instead of going out back and getting high with the other mexicans , you will go and steal 2 syringes, and then leave the hospital.  stop at the store on the way home, and purchase yellow food coloring.  don't fuck around, get the high quality shit here, at least 2 dollars per bottle, get 3 bottles , just in case.  go home and lay down on your couch, fill the syringes with the yellow food coloring, inject one syringe full of yellow food coloring into each one of your iris'.  now you are pale, and have yellow eyes, you are almost there my friend.  next step, you will need a metal file / small saw.  this is relatively straight forward, you are going to file your fangs down to sharp points to look more like a vampire.  if you really wanted to go all out you could do that, as well as file all your other teeth down so they are much lower in your mouth than your fangs, but that would be very time consuming and this fad won't last forever.  last step, gather several bottles of super glue, several boxes of silver glitter, and vaseline for a little extra shinyness to counteract the dull grey super glew.  combine all of these ingredients in the bathtub that you used earlier.  lay in the bathtub.  make sure to coat every pore of your body with the sparkly substance for maximum ""fabulousness"".  when you emerge and it dries, you may feel light headed, you may indeed die after several hours, so you must move quickly to impress the women with your identical to edward appearance.  now you *look* identical to edward, congratulations.  to *act* like him, you need to always appear one bottle of pills away from suicide, and use incredibly corny pick up lines to hit on young women, preferably women around the looks 18 but probably isnt but its ok because pedophelia is cool in this universe type of women.  once you find her, stalk her, mercilessly.  it would be best if she was just as seemingly hopelessly depressed and pothetic as you.",1,-2,-1

423712,"the point of leaving out the politics is because ultimately they don't matter here but i'll go down the rabbit hole real quick.  blaming capitalism generally leads to calls for a different form of society/government.  the most common being socialism and/or communism.  which might work in a theoretical setting but in the real world it doesn't (because people have free will).  this then leads to governments having to ultimately use the threat of violence to enforce their will (and this is really true of any government, just try not paying one's taxes in any country and then resist the government when they try and take the taxes).  then because the government has the majority of the power you've now created a ""weak link"" or ""single point of failure"" for which those who want power (especially the ones who are greedy for power) will flock to.  and if your society is able to reasonably prevent such a single-point-of-failure system from failing then it would likewise not fall under a proper capitalist system (vs say a crony capitalist system or how for the past several years the government has tried to pick winners and losers).  i mean lets look at venezuela and see how they're doing.  or cuba.  or the history of the ussr and how many people were killed when they switched (and how they later fell apart).  or china and just how many they killed in their swap, tienanmen square, horrible corruption issues they had for years, etc.    it's late(early) and again i don't feel that the xcom subreddit is the proper place for such political talk.  a talk about the greed of the companies is one thing as it affects the game(s) here, but that isn't an issue of our economic system, it's an issue of our society and of human nature.",0,,
106726,"[*olivia shakespear (born olivia tucker; 17 march 1863 – 3 october 1938) was a british novelist, playwright, and patron of the arts. she wrote six books that are described as ""marriage problem"" novels. her works sold poorly, sometimes only a few hundred copies. her last novel, uncle hilary, is considered her best. she wrote two plays in collaboration with florence farr. olivia was the daughter of a retired adjutant general, and had little formal education. she was well-read however, and developed a love of literature. in 1885 she married london barrister henry hope shakespear, and in 1886 gave birth to their only child, dorothy. in 1894 her literary interests led to a friendship with william butler yeats that became physically intimate in 1896. following their consummation he declared that they ""had many days of happiness"" to come,[1] but the affair ended in 1897. they nevertheless remained lifelong friends and corresponded frequently. yeats went on to marry georgie hyde-lees, olivia's step-niece and dorothy's best friend. olivia began hosting a weekly salon frequented by ezra pound and other modernist writers and artists in 1909, and became influential in london literary society. dorothy shakespear married pound in 1914, despite the less-than-enthusiastic blessing of her parents. after their marriage, pound would use funds received from olivia to support t. s. eliot and james joyce. when dorothy gave birth to a son, omar pound, in france in 1926, olivia assumed guardianship of the boy. he lived with olivia until her death on 3 october 1938. contents [hide] 1 early life and marriage 2 w. b. yeats 2.1 friendship 2.2 love affair 3 pembroke mansions 4 dorothy and ezra pound 5 later life and death 6 novels: description and reception 7 list of works 8 notes 9 references 10 sources [edit]early life and marriage olivia's father, henry tod tucker (b. 1808), was born in edinburgh and joined the british indian army as an ensign at age 16. he rose to the rank of adjutant general in bengal, but retired in 1856 at age 48 owing to ill health. within a year of returning to britain he married harriet johnson (b. 1821) of bath. the couple moved to the isle of wight where their two daughters were born: florence in 1858 and olivia on 17 march 1863. soon after they relocated to sussex where their third child, henry, was born in 1866. in 1877 the family moved to london and raised their daughters in a social world that encouraged the pursuit of leisure. olivia often visited her many johnson relatives in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin lionel johnson—the only one of many uncles and cousins not to join the military—who went on to become a poet and friend to w. b. yeats.[2] it is likely that olivia received little formal education; she may have been educated by tutors, and appears to have become well-read as a young woman.[3] in 1885 olivia married henry hope shakespear, a man described by terence brown in the life of w.b. yeats: a critical biography as ""worthy"" but ""dull"".[4] born in india in 1849, he was descended from 17th-century east london ropemakers and, like olivia, came from a military family, although of less prestige and wealth than the tuckers and johnsons. john harwood, olivia's biographer and author of olivia shakespear and w. b. yeats: after long silence believes henry probably saw an opportunity to increase his social standing and annual income in wedding olivia. he had attended harrow, studied law, and joined a law practice in 1875. the couple were married on 8 december 1885, and honeymooned in boulogne and paris. olivia's father endowed them with a comfortable income in the form of a trust. nine months after the wedding their only child, dorothy, was born on 14 september 1886; they likely discontinued physical relations after the honeymoon, and olivia realised quite soon that the marriage was devoid of passion.[5] yeats' biographer alexander jeffares writes, ""she was unselfcentered, unselfish, deeply imaginative and sympathetic and, until she met yeats, she seems to have accepted the fact of her unhappy loveless marriage"".[6] shakespear dissolved his legal partnership in the late 1880s—his partner may have been embezzling from clients' trusts—and formed his own practice. harwood writes that shakespear's attitude to the situation showed a certain amount of ""timidity"" on his part and a definite ""dislike of scenes"". during this period olivia moved from socialising with military wives to literary women: valentine fox (unhappily married to a kent brewer) and pearl craighie, a divorced american writer who published as john oliver hobbes.[7] [edit]w. b. yeats [edit]friendship an 1896 portrait of w.b. yeats by his father john butler yeats is the frontispiece of celtic twilight. accompanied by pearl craighie, on 16 april 1894 olivia attended a literary dinner to launch the yellow book. olivia was seated opposite w. b. yeats.[6] recently returned from visiting maud gonne in paris, yeats was in london for the production of his play the land of heart's desire.[8] the two were not introduced that evening but yeats, probably through lionel johnson (who became disruptively drunk at the dinner), enquired about the woman seated opposite.[9][10] yeats was deeply affected, later writing in his memoirs of the encounter: ""i noticed op*](//#carlton)",0,,
611936,"if you like ""hard"" science fiction that goes into details of possible physics, etc., check into the *hyperion* series.  it talks about things like ... oh, [here's a passage](http://lichen.phys.uregina.ca/eclectic/endymion.html):  &gt; skinsuits go back many centuries, the working concept being that the best way to keep from exploding in vacuum is not a bulky pressure suit as in the earliest days of spaceflight, but a covering so thin that it allows perspiration to pass even while it protects the skin from the terrible heat, cold, and vacuum of space. skinsuits had not changed much in all those centuries, except to incorporate rebreathing filaments and osmosis panels. of course, my last skinsuit had been a hegemony artifact, workable enough until rhadamanth nemes had clawed it to shreds. ...  &gt; the ship was within a couple thousand klicks of the startree and decelerating hard. palou koror made a motion and jumped easily onto the thin balcony rail, balancing against the one-sixth-g. drivenj nicaagat followed suit, and then lhomo, then aenea, and finally -- much less gracefully -- i joined them. the sense of height and exposure was all but overwhelming -- the great green basin of the startree beneath us, the leafy walls rising into the unblinking distance on all sides, the bulk of the ship curving away beneath us, balancing on the slim column of fusion fire like a building teetering on a fragile blue column. i realized with a sickening feeling that we were going to jump.  &gt; *do not worry, i will open the containment field at the precise instant you pass through and go to em repulsors until you are clear of the drive exhaust*. i realized that it ws the ship speaking. i had no idea of what we were doing. ...  &gt; she let go of my hand and we spun away from one another. the containment field parted and ejected us a safe distance, the fusion drive paused as the five of us spun away from the ship, then it relit -- the ship seeming to hurtle upward and away from us as its deceleration outpaced our own -- and we continued dropping, that sensation was overwhelming, five silver, spread-eagled forms, separating farther and farther from each other, all plummeting toward the startree lattice still several thousand klicks beneath. then our wings opened.  &gt; *for our purposes today, the lightwings need only be a kilometer or so across*, came palou koror's voice in my ears. *were we traveling farther or faster, they would extend much farther . . . perhaps several hundred kilometers.*  &gt; when i raised my arms, the panels of energy extruding from my skinsuit unfurled like butterfly wings. i felt the sudden push of sunlight.  &gt; *what we feel is more the current of the primary magnetic field line we are following*, said palou koror.  &gt; vision shifted. i looked to my left to where aenea fell, already several klicks away -- a shining silver chrysalis set within expanding gold wings. the others glowed beyond her. i could see the solar wind, see the charged particles and current of plasma flowing and spiraling outward along the infintely complex geometry of the heliosphere -- red lines of twisting ever-shifting chambered nautilus, all this convoluted, multilayered, multicolored writhing of plasma streams flowing back to a sun that no longer seemed a pale star but was the locus of millions of converging field lines, entire sheets of plasma being evicted at 400 kilometers a second and being drawn into these shapes by the pulsing magnetic fields in its north and south equators. i could see the violet streamers of the inward-rushing magnetic lines, weaving and interlacing with the crimson red of the outward-exploding sheets of field current, i could see the blue vortices of heliospheric shock wave around the outer edges of the startree, the moons and comets cutting through plasma medium like ocean going ships at night plowing through a glowing, phosphorescent sea, and could see our gold wings interacting with this plasma and magnetic medium, catching photons like billions of fireflies in our nets, sail surfaces surging to the plasma currents, our silver bodies accelerating out along the great shimmering folds and spiral magnetic geometries of the heliosphere matrix.  if you're *really* into hard scifi also check out *dragon's egg*.  it speculates about life evolving on a star under super high energy and gravity.  the whole book takes place during the moments when a human ship arrives at the star, and their scanning the surface with a laser causes multiple civilizations to rise and fall on the surface, culminating (after a couple of hours earthling time) with the aliens achieving far superior technology.  *dune* is also excellent.  the series turns into harder scifi as it goes along, and covers thousands of years of the universe's history under one near-immortal dictator.  sort of like the *foundation* series by asimov.  *dune* is very psychological, like *foundation* -- it talks about how to control populations, speculates about military forces made solely of women, etc.  last but not least, i recommend *ringworld*.  that's on the border between scifi and fantasy, but is also quite good.  *ringworld* explores the concept of a large ring built around a star, thousands of earths wide and built from unimaginably strong material.  the series covers the adventure of an unlikely trio crash landing on the structure and follows their exploration and friendships with the various species of humans living there.  it is quite sad that the english literature people are all so focused on old books.  science fiction is the best and most interesting kind of fiction, according to me.  it's only partly about the technology -- what makes it a *story* is the lives of the humans involved.  scifi explores human fates on an epic scale, planets, populations, whole galaxies of humanity, good and evil.  you might also consider almost anything by crichton.  from *jurassic park* (the book, not the movie) to *andromeda strain* to *timeline*, he thoroughly researches the background elements of his story to produce a compelling technical explanation for the plot.  *sphere* is also far out.  (don't judge the books by the movies)  wikipedia has this to say:  &gt; a notable recurring theme in crichton's plots is the pathological failure of complex systems and their safeguards, whether biological (""jurassic park""), military/organizational (""the andromeda strain"") or cybernetic (""westworld""). this theme of the inevitable breakdown of ""perfect"" systems and the failure of ""fail-safe measures"" can be seen strongly in the poster for westworld (slogan: ""where nothing can possibly go worng .."" (sic) ) and in the discussion of chaos theory in jurassic park.  his detailed, realistic explanations of the systems is what makes the books so interesting.  i have to say that out of all the books and series i have ever read, *hyperion* is by far the best.  not necessarily *objectively* -- whatever that means; *hyperion* just happens to touch on all the things that interest me the most, and really well.",0,,

138695,"i've been working on putting together a blog post on olive skin, so here's what i've got:  **how to know if you have olive skin:**  * your veins are an even mix between green and blue. * gold and silver jewelry both look fine on you; bronze/brass probably looks even better. * your skin looks slightly greenish compared to other people in natural light. see the comparison images of olive skin vs. other undertones [here](http://makeup-charts.blogspot.com/2012/01/determining-your-skin-tone-and.html) and [here](http://makeup-charts.blogspot.com/2012/01/dark-skintones-from-tan-to-bronze-can.html). * in foundation lines that have warm/cool/neutral options (ex. l'oreal true match, estee lauder double wear, lancome teint idole, coverfx), the different options are all too strongly saturated in color, with none ""greyed out"" enough to really match. (the swatches [here](http://www.shamelessfripperies.com/swatches/charlotte-tilbury-light-wonder-foundation-review-swatches/) give an idea of this, with the more olive-y shades on the left. i also have some swatches of neutral and warm-toned foundations next to the more olive-y mufe 117 and revlon buff [here](http://imgur.com/vfxssnz) that may help.) * you tan to a warmer skintone easily (but may still get sunburned at times). * you look washed out in pastels and good in jewel tones.  **olive-toned beauty bloggers:**  i've updated my [makeup blog spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rd0m1cocv08jrvwba2elgdj5nrjkvluhkl3mrfaujbu/pub?output=html) to list undertones, including olive undertones. the olive identifications are based on foundation matches (for instance, armani lsf 6, any of the mufe hd olive shades) or, wherever possible, on the bloggers' own identifications. if you think any of my identifications are wrong, or if i'm missing any olive-toned bloggers, please let me know!  **color cosmetics:**  seconding what everyone else says about pastels not being great on olive skin. personally, i lean fairly neutral, so i've found that both warm and cool colors work for me, as long as they're neither too warm (very orange-y) nor too cool (very blue-based). colors that are more neutral-to-warm or neutral-to-cool work best for me. so for instance, pinky corals can work for me, but very orange-y corals don't look as good. and most importantly, muted colors look much better on me than brights.  for lipstick, berry, plum, and burgundy colors work well (i like revlon crush, tarina tarantino floriculture, mac craving, and bite plum), as do dusty roses and mauves (a few of my favorite mlbb types are jordana terra crave, revlon pink truffle, and mac cosmo). brick reds or other muted reds also tend to work (mac brick-o-la, nars cruella, revlon adore and romantic, guerlain coque d'or). as far as pinks go, i've found that reddish pinks (like mac on hold) can work pretty well. for nude lipstick, peachy pinks like nars barbarella seem to work, though i really need to wear heavy eye makeup with them or they wash me out. for blush, i really like peachy pink (thebalm hot mama), plum (thebalm cabana boy), dusty rose (tarte exposed), and pink-y coral (thebalm frat boy).  i don't wear a ton of eyeshadow, but i definitely prefer bronze over gold (ex. maybelline bad to the bronze) and also like burgundy (like maybelline pomegranate punk) and browns.  **color correcting foundations:**  i haven't personally tried color-correcting foundations that aren't olive enough, but it is an option. if a foundation is too yellow, you can mix in some blue to turn it greener. (on the color wheel, yellow + blue = green.) mufe chromatic mix comes in blue. an example of how this works is [here](https://instagram.com/p/5zpd3ae7z2/).  you can also mix in some green to color-correct a foundation, as shown [here](http://procrastinatingpretty.com/blog/2015/4/8/foundation-cocktail). some green options are yaby corrector or foundation in wasabi or boots no. 7 ""colour calming"" makeup base.  **olive-toned foundation list:**  this is a list i've been working on for some time, based on online recommendations from makeupalley, blogs, and other places. i have not been able to personally view/confirm all of these as olive-toned, and i would love to add more shades to the list, so your input would be great! if a foundation listed here is not olive-toned, please let me know, and if i'm missing anything, please also let me know (ideally specific shades rather than brand names).  first, some links to foundation swatches:  * [olive nc25-35 matches](http://www.behonestbeauty.com/p/i-figured-theres-no-bigger-challenge.html) * [olive nc35 swatches](http://beautyofspontaneity.blogspot.mx/2014/02/foundation-matching-for-medium-yellow.html) * [olive skin shade matches for nc37-40](http://10ambeauty.com/about/olive-skin-shade-matches/) * [foundations for nc37 olive skin](http://missmaven.com/olive-beauties-this-ones-for-you/)  **light skin:**  * bourjois healthy mix - 51 - nc15 - [swatch](http://klasycznie.blogspot.com/2014/04/clarins-skin-illusion-testy-swatche.html) * revlon colorstay - buff - nc15 - [swatch](http://klasycznie.blogspot.com/2014/03/mufe-hd-czy-revlon-colorstay-testy.html) * almay tlc - buff - nc15 - [swatches](http://soundlysensiblebeauty.blogspot.com/2014/01/almay-tlc-truly-lasting-color.html) * make up for ever ultra hd - y225 (117 in the old hd formula) - nc15 - [swatches](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeupaddiction/comments/3cvm28/comparison_swatch_mufe_hd_117_vs_mufe_ultra_hd/) * kevyn aucoin sensual skin enhancer - sx03 - nc15 - [swatch](http://www.reddit.com/r/makeupaddicts/comments/285uz0/i_could_really_use_some_help_figuring_out_my/ci7sa4d) * nars sheer glow - gobi - nc15 - [swatch](http://missmoehrchen.blogspot.com/2015/03/update-helle-foundations-im-vergleich.html) * becca ever-matte shine proof foundation - shell - nc15 - [swatch](http://soundlysensiblebeauty.blogspot.com/2014/09/becca-ever-matte-shine-proof-foundation.html) * shu uemura lightbulb fluid foundation - 974 light honey - nc20 * guerlain lingerie de peau - 31 ambre pale - nc15 - [swatch](http://klasycznie.blogspot.com/2013/04/promienna-pena-zycia-cera-shu-uemura_13.html) * meow cosmetics - inquisitive ocicat - nc5; sleek ocicat - nc10-15; frisky ocicat - nc15-20 - [swatches](http://art-and-beauty-by-maggielet.blogspot.com/2010/06/meow-cosmetics-mineral-foundation.html) * tarte amazonian clay - fair sand - nc15  **light to medium skin:**  * koh gen do aqua - 213 - nc20-25 - [swatch](http://www.beautyprofessor.net/2013/12/koh-gen-do-maifanshi-aqua-foundation.html) * bourjois healthy mix - 52 - nc20-25 - [swatch](http://www.shamelessfripperies.com/swatches/charlotte-tilbury-light-wonder-foundation-review-swatches/) * bourjois healthy mix - 53 - nc25-30 * kevyn aucoin sensual skin enhancer - sx07 - nc25 * ardency inn americana custom coverage concentrate - light-medium olive - nc25 - [swatches](http://www.beautyprofessor.net/2014/05/ardency-inn-custom-coverage.html) * tarte amazonian clay - light medium sand - nc25-30 * ex 1 invisiwear liquid foundation - f200 - nc25-30 * ud naked skin foundation - 4.0 - nc25-30 * maybelline superstay better skin foundation - warm nude - nc25-30 - [swatch](http://www.behonestbeauty.com/2015/07/first-look-maybelline-superstay-better.html) * laura mercier silk creme in oil free and moisturizing edition (2015) - sand beige - nc27-30 * it cosmetics cc cream - light - nc27-30  **medium skin:**  * make up for ever ultra hd - y365 (123 in the old hd formula) - nc30 * armani luminous silk - 6 - nc30-35 - [swatch](http://www.beautyholicsanonymous.com/2013/11/giorgio-armani-luminous-silk-foundation/) * mac face &amp; body - c3 - nc30-35 - [swatch](http://beautyofspontaneity.blogspot.mx/2014/02/foundation-matching-for-medium-yellow.html) * dior - diorskin nude - 31 sand - nc30-35 * nars sheer glow - stromboli - nc30-35 - leans yellow * ex 1 invisiwear liquid foundation - f300 - nc35-40 * ud naked skin foundation - 6.0 - nc35-40 - [swatch](http://10ambeauty.com/urban-decay-naked-skin-foundation-2/) * korres wild rose foundation - wrf4 - nc37 * laura mercier tinted moisturizer - sand - nc37 * flower beauty bb cream - bb3 - nc37 - [swatch](http://www.ishahxbeauty.com/2013/01/flower-bb-cream-shade-bb3-swatches-and.html) * maybelline fit me - 220 natural beige - nc37 - [swatch](http://beautyandthemuslimah.blogspot.com/2015/04/foundation-swatches.html) * maybelline fit me matte - 220 natural beige - nc37 - [swatch](http://www.beautyholicsanonymous.com/2015/08/maybelline-fit-me-matte-foundation/) * maybelline fit me matte - 228 soft tan - nc35-37 * becca ultimate coverage complexion creme - olive - nc37-40 - [swatch](http://kpsays.com/becca-ultimate-coverage-complexion-creme/) * becca ever-matte shine proof foundation - olive - nc37  **medium to dark skin:**  * make up for ever ultra hd - y405 (153 in the old hd formula) - nc40 - swatch * make up for ever ultra hd - y445 (173 in the old hd formula) - nc45 - swatch * ex 1 invisiwear liquid foundation - f400 - nc42 * ex 1 invisiwear liquid foundation - f500 - nc45 * i would love to add more olive options to this category especially, so please let me know what i'm missing!",1,,1
978176,"[pt2 2]  ""the pipes froze over. so we had to shut the water off. we have someone coming out tomorrow to fix it, but you'll just have to wait until then,"" said my mom to my sister.   britney was standing in the kitchen looking livid. her clothes were still soaked in sweat and she looked hot and tired after her volleyball game. her beautiful brown hair was tied up in a sloppy ponytail on her head. she was standing with one hand on her hip, and her shirt had lifted up a little bit on the side, exposing the string of her sexy pink thong. her large breasts were heaving up and down under her tight uniform top.  ""mom i just played in a fucking volleyball game! i'm disgusting! i can't wait till tomorrow. and what about the toilet paper? i already....'went to the bathroom' by the time i noticed it was gone.""  ""well honey, the water will be fixed tomorrow. i think you can go one day without showering. and i was heading to the store anyway. so i'll pick up some toilet paper while i'm out. you might as well go change your clothes.""  ""mom i'm covered in sweat. i smell terrible. i don't want to ruin a perfectly good outfit. i'll just keep my volleyball uniform on until i get to shower tomorrow.""  ""well at least change your panties sweetie. if you just went...'number two,' and then pulled your thong back up, i'm sure it's quite nasty. you'll probably start to chafe. so at least go change that.""  just hearing my mom talk about my sister's filthy thong put an extra strain in my pants. my cock was already painfully hard after adam had rubbed it in my room. but if it was possible, it had gotten even harder. i looked over and saw adam was rubbing the bulge over his shorts while he listened to my mom and sister argue. i looked over to him and mouthed the word, ""soon."" he looked back and nodded with a smile.  ""fine!"" my sister screamed. and with that, she stormed out of the kitchen and headed back towards the bathroom. adam and i hurried back to my room to get out of her way. from inside my room, we heard the bathroom door slam. then, after a couple of moments, we heard britney stomp down the hallway to her own room. then, we heard the door to her own bedroom slam.  adam and i looked at each other.  ""i think this is it dude. she must have taken off that fucking thong. it must be just waiting for us in the bathroom. are you ready to do this?"" i said.  ""are you kidding me bro? i'm about to cum in my fucking pants. let's go get that thing.""  adam and i quietly open the door of my bedroom, and tiptoe across the hall to the bathroom. we go into the bathroom, and quietly close the door behind us. the smell coming from the toilet is strong as we search for our treasure. the floor is pretty spotless. i open the closet door and look down into the fairly full laundry basket. all of a sudden, i freeze. there, sitting on top of the pile, is our treasure.  it is the tiniest little thong i've ever seen. i'm sure it used to be a brighter shade of pink, but clearly, this thong is one of my sister's favorites. the bright pink has turned a paler shade after much use and many trips through the wash. as i said, my sister is in great shape, but her ass is very large. she says it helps her play more physical in her basketball games, the other sport my sister plays other than volleyball. so as i look down at the tiny piece of pink fabric, it boggles my mind to try and imagine how she fits into this skimpy thing. i pick up the dirty thong and hold it up in the air for us both to see. even holding it away form my face, the stench is unbelievably strong. a mix of sweat, cum, piss, and shit invade my nostrils. i look over and adam has already released his thick hard cock form his pants. he's looking at the thong in my hands as he begins to stroke his hard meat.   the thong feels relatively heavy for a pair of panties. clearly, all the liquids in it are weighing it down. as the liquids begin to dry and become sticky, the thong had closed itself into a tight ball. i had to peel it apart in order to get a good look at it. as i do, i start to rub my hard cock over my jeans with my other hand. first, i inspect the crotch. britney clearly wasn't hydrated enough, because there was a dark yellow stain right in the middle of the crotch of her panties. there were white stains in the crotch as well. maybe it was just natural secretion. or maybe britney enjoyed seeing her teammates in those skimpy volleyball outfits as much as i did. who knows. i then examine the back part of the thong, which is really nothing more than a string. the string is stained brown, and i know that this little piece of cotton had spent hours wedged up in between my sister's beautiful ass crack, touching her dirty, smelly asshole. with no toilet paper, she hadn't had a chance to wipe, and i know britney had pulled this thong back up over her shit stained asshole before going into the kitchen to argue with my mother. it turned me on so much to think about my sister wearing this thong over her thick, tanned ass.  i started to think about what went through britney's head when she wore the thong. did it make her feel sexy? when she got dressed in the morning, did she just stare at her beautiful sexy, toned, tan body in the mirror, with only this tiny little thong to cover her most intimate area? did she stare at her large full breasts that hung down form her chest, and realize how fucking hot she looked? did it make her feel dirty to know that she was wearing panties filled with her own sweat, and piss, and cum? lost in my thoughts, i almost didn't realize that i had unzipped my pants and was now stroking my hard cock.   ""dude, i gotta smell that thing.""  adam jolted me out of my daydream. with both of us openly stroking our dicks with one hand, we walked towards each other. i held the thong up in the air, and adam and i, standing less than a foot away from each other, both leaned forward to smell the filthy panties. we both put our noses into the material, with only the thin cotton separating our noses from each other. our cocks were probably only a few inches from each other. then, we each inhaled deeply. the smell was unbelievable. as we inhaled the sweaty smell, i though about the hours of exertion britney had put into the thong, with all the sweat accumulating down in the volleyball shorts covering her ass and pussy. however, the smell of the piss and shit is what made me want to cum right then and there. piss and shit, associated with an ugly, fat woman, or a guy, does nothing for me. that would repulse me. but knowing these bodily fluids were coming from a goddess like my sister got me so fucking hot and bothered. i thought about how amazing it would be if i could kneel down behind britney, peel down her tight shorts and thong, and just bury my nose into her dirty, smelly asshole.  adam took a step back.  ""dude, you know i'm not gay right"" he asked me.  ""yea of course man. i know how much you love chicks. you're always trying to smell their panties, especially your moms.""  ""right. so i wanna ask you to do something, but don't think i'm being gay or anything.""  ""ok,"" i responded.  ""dude, i'm so fucking hard. i can't stop thinking about your smoking hot sister in this tiny little fucking thong. i'm trying to visualize her stroking my cock or wrapping her hot lips around it, but it's hard to do, since i know my hand so well. so...would you...like, wrap those panties around my cock, and stroke it? and i could pretend like it's your sister doing it? and our skin won't actually be touching. cause the thong will be in the way.""  i know most of you cynics out there wont believe it, but adam and i really aren't gay. but sometimes, when you're caught up in a super fucking erotic moment, like we were at the time, the taboo nature of tings makes you do things you wouldn't normally do in a less aroused state.  ""sure dude. only if you return the favor,"" i responded.   with that, i took the filthy, shit and piss filled panties and wrapped them around adam's hard tool. even though the damp panties, i could feel the heat emanating off his cock. i had jerked off in front of adam tons of times, and felt his cock over his pants, but i had never felt another man's cock so directly before. with his eyes closed, adam made a moaning sound as i began to stroke his cock with the thong. thinking about the dirty panties, britney's shit still in the toilet, and the way britney looked covered in sweat in those tiny spandex volleyball shorts during the game, i started to stroke my own cock in rhythm with stoking adam's. i began to stroke faster and faster, getting more and more turned on, getting closer and closer to cumming, when all of a sudden i heard,  ""what the fuck are you two doing!?""  i immediately let go of adam's cock and took a step back. britney was standing in the doorway, still wearing her dirty, tight volleyball shorts and sweaty uniform top. her face was red and she looked pissed. with all the excitement, we must not have heard her come in. adam and i stood there frozen, with our hard dicks sticking out of our shorts, and britney's piss and shit filled thong still gripped tightly in my right hand.  to be continued...",0,,

""my skin is called white. ""  if your dad is from kenya and african, and your mom was from lebanon.  what would you go by?  and even though it is nonsensical, most people probably call you muslim or think of you as muslim.  it isn't right, but that is my point.  wouldn't it be better to call you half-lebanese half-european as opposed muslim or white?  ""korean amie""  i don't designate people and don't use the term korean amie all the time, no.  but, people from korea or india i introduce from their country sometimes, where it is relevant.  sometimes it is offensive to say a korean person is from china, etc.  i have never called anyone yellow.  i use the term kenyan for people from kenya, etc, etc.  ""no one cares about your opinion, least of all me.""  exactly, you are proud that you aren't listen.  me, i was actually trying to understand what you were saying.  now i know.

335731,"the highwayman by alfred noyes part one  the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.    the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.    the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,    and the highwayman came riding—          riding—riding— the highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.  he’d a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,    a coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin. they fitted with never a wrinkle. his boots were up to the thigh.    and he rode with a jewelled twinkle,          his pistol butts a-twinkle, his rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard. he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred.    he whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there    but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,          bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.  and dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked where tim the ostler listened. his face was white and peaked.    his eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,    but he loved the landlord’s daughter,          the landlord’s red-lipped daughter. dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—  “one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i’m after a prize to-night, but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,    then look for me by moonlight,          watch for me by moonlight, i’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.”  he rose upright in the stirrups. he scarce could reach her hand, but she loosened her hair in the casement. his face burnt like a brand as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;    and he kissed its waves in the moonlight,          (o, sweet black waves in the moonlight!) then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.  part two  he did not come in the dawning. he did not come at noon;    and out of the tawny sunset, before the rise of the moon,    when the road was a gypsy’s ribbon, looping the purple moor,    a red-coat troop came marching—          marching—marching— king george’s men came marching, up to the old inn-door.  they said no word to the landlord. they drank his ale instead.    but they gagged his daughter, and bound her, to the foot of her narrow bed. two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!    there was death at every window;          and hell at one dark window; for bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.  they had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest. they had bound a musket beside her, with the muzzle beneath her breast! “now, keep good watch!” and they kissed her. she heard the doomed man say— look for me by moonlight;          watch for me by moonlight; i’ll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!  she twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!    they stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years till, now, on the stroke of midnight,          cold, on the stroke of midnight, the tip of one finger touched it! the trigger at least was hers!  the tip of one finger touched it. she strove no more for the rest.    up, she stood up to attention, with the muzzle beneath her breast.    she would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;    for the road lay bare in the moonlight;          blank and bare in the moonlight; and the blood of her veins, in the moonlight, throbbed to her love’s refrain.  tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! had they heard it? the horsehoofs ringing clear;    tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear? down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding—          riding—riding— the red coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still.  tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!    nearer he came and nearer. her face was like a light. her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,    then her finger moved in the moonlight,          her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  he turned. he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood    bowed, with her head o’er the musket, drenched with her own blood!    not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear    how bess, the landlord’s daughter,          the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  back, he spurred like a madman, shouting a curse to the sky, with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high. blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat; when they shot him down on the highway,          down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.  .       .       .  and still of a winter’s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,    when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,    a highwayman comes riding—          riding—riding— a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard. he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.    he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there    but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,          bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.",1,-1,1

820010,"i'd suggest checking out cocoa pink. it seems they haven't started selling fall scents yet (probably very soon) buy if you googled it last year's scent list comes up.  surprisingly apple, caramel, and fall/leaves scent is less common then you'd think. here's a few suggestions, but sadly not all have all three notes. you could consider layering scents too. there's also a few in the same scent ""family"", i thought you might like based on what you described.  * harvest wreath - a colorful array of newly harvested apples piled high in aged oak baskets below fragrant dried wreaths adorned with an abundance of dried lingonberries lit up by brilliant red and yellow autumn leaves grounded with cinnamon vanilla.   * black apple noel  -  cp black, juicy golden delicious apples smothered  in a mouthwatering sticky sweet caramel coating and rounded out with ghostly ribbons of vanilla bean noel.  * bobbing for apples - orchard peaches, honey crisp apples, glowing jack o' lanterns, pumpkin flesh, and layers of creamy vanilla with just a touch of the warm patchouli fragrance of witch's brew.  * cozy cabin in the woods - white cedar trees heavily laden with soft piles of snow, sweet sandalwood, crackling freshly chopped firewood roaring from inside the glowing fireplace with the heavenly aromas of creamy sugared vanilla and gingerbread floating through the air.  * fear of witches (wiccaphobia)  – warm baked bread fresh from the oven, gentle wisps of bonfire smoke drifting through the frigid autumn air and smooth buttery caramel sprinkled with coarse black sea salt is your best bet in keeping them at bay.   * fear of ghosts (phasmophobia) -  glowing marshmallow orbs and smoky vanilla spectral mists swirl aimlessly around an old bonfire in the crisp october night air – fresh vanilla puffed marshmallows, toasted marshmallows, hints of bonfire smoke among scattered sharp grains of white rice to ward unwelcome spirits away.  * halloween apple harvest - 3 favorite fall treats all wrapped into one mouthwatering fragrance. sugared candy apples, gooey caramel apples and toffee smothered gala apples all decorated with candy corn.  * halloween night -  honeycrisp apples coated in buttery melted caramel, bourbon vanilla, crumbles of muscavado sugar, white sugar and candy corn.  * samhain - ancient oak trees cloaked in blankets of oakmoss with dying crimson leaves at their base surround the haunted cabin. apparitions form and disappear in the blink of an eye and the delicate yet earthy notes of sheer vanilla, aged patchouli, fresh dirt, neroli, dried rose petals and misty white musk are all that remains.  * union hotel - flemington nj's most haunted location, once a bustling hotel in the early 1900's with classy bar and restaurant has now been shut down and abandoned, many people have experienced apparitions who have explored its decaying interior since.  mugs filled with steaming hot buttered rum tinged red with blood oranges, sliced of rum raisin cake drizzled with brown sugar, maple, butterscotch and caramel with haunting notes of aged polished oak banisters and sparkling amber.  i know you said no pumpkins, but these ones sound so perfect otherwise. i'm just going to leave these here in case there is any chance you'd try them:  * smashed pumpkins - the scent of decorated pumpkins and jack o lanterns strewn about smashed to pieces by mischievous children on hallows eve: raw pumpkin flesh, pumpkin pulp, fresh crimson apples dripping with warm caramel, steaming hot buttered rum and sticky melted marshmallows.   * winchester house kitchen - the distinct aroma of autumn in the winchester house kitchen with notes of aged oak, fresh baked pumpkin pie, 5 fold orange essential oil coated in the warm essence of light muscovado sugar, fresh ginger, sticky gobs of benzoin, warm buttery caramel simmering on the stovetop and just the barest hint of clove.  * scarecrow - warm notes of pumpkin accented with vibrant autumn leaves, birch trees, apple butter combined with purple sage surround the old scarecrow with his pumpkin head, dressed in a sun-faded plaid shirt and worn jeans overstuffed with golden hay.  here is some suggestions for cinnamon foody scents:  * apple cinnamon funnel cake*~ inspired by a quaint little shop in the georgia mountains.  we just had to make a scent based on their fabulous apple cinnamon funnel cakes topped off with a dusting of powdered sugar.  * honey cinnamon rolls* - warm fragrant cinnamon buns smothered in white honey infused cream cheese frosting topped with smashed sugared pralines.  * mexican hot cocoa* - a steaming mug of creamy gourmet hot chocolate infused with fresh milk and stirred with a cinnamon stick.  * apple pie donut *- sugar sprinkled donuts filled with apple pie filling tinged with hints of spiced cider.  * cream puff *- tastes like dessert.  delicious mouthwatering cream puff pastries with a dusting of cinnamon.",0,,

980798,"**hunters**: handpicked from the finest of the arkan military. hunters go through augmentations that allow them both keener reflexes and a heightened eyesight. the real kicker is the augmentation that allows them to survive the intense strain of the combat stim dubbed 'red mist'. without it, the stim would likely cause them to tear muscles and experience seizures during use. the stim is extremely intoxicating.  when a hunter uses a stim, they will gain a slight healing factor, in addition to a beast-like rage, allowing them to shred through the enemy's armour as if it were paper thin with extreme speed and prejudice.  hunters are equipped with a light armour that allows them to easily manoeuvre through enemy forces, though it is not very durable - hunters must be able to reliably dodge and weave through enemy fire. hunters are equipped with an energy blade and a small arms firearm, both wielded during combat.  hunters are deployed as shock troopers in groups of four and above at a time, depending on the urgency of the situation. non-lethal is a no go, hunters will frequently return to base drenched in blood.  hunters will mostly associate only with each other, stinking of blood, bile and disease.  **rangers**: mostly pre-war veterans. beacon's elite marksman. often deploying alone, rangers can stay in the field for months at a time with minimal human contact. they've seen more bloodshed than any other division, always opting for a lethal approach to any objective. it's rare to see them stationed at any base of operations, and almost impossible to see any more than one ranger at any given location.  rangers are extremely flexible, and can lend aid to almost any mission type. they specialize in long range tactics and are comfortable with any sniper.",0,,

263755,"the raven:  edgar allan poe (1845)  once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. `'tis some visitor,' i muttered, `tapping at my chamber door - only this, and nothing more.'  ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. eagerly i wished the morrow; - vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost lenore - for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named lenore - nameless here for evermore.  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating `'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door - some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door; - this it is, and nothing more,'  presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, `sir,' said i, `or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you' - here i opened wide the door; - darkness there, and nothing more.  deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `lenore!' this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `lenore!' merely this and nothing more.  back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. `surely,' said i, `surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore - let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; - 'tis the wind and nothing more!'  open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore. not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door - perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door - perched, and sat, and nothing more.  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, `though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,' i said, `art sure no craven. ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore - tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!' quoth the raven, `nevermore.'  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore; for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door - bird or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber door, with such name as `nevermore.'  but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only, that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered - till i scarcely more than muttered `other friends have flown before - on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' then the bird said, `nevermore.'  startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, `doubtless,' said i, `what it utters is its only stock and store, caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore - till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of ""never-nevermore.""'  but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door; then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore - what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking `nevermore.'  this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, she shall press, ah, nevermore!  then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. `wretch,' i cried, `thy god hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore! quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost lenore!' quoth the raven, `nevermore.'  `prophet!' said i, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! - whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted - on this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, i implore - is there - is there balm in gilead? - tell me - tell me, i implore!' quoth the raven, `nevermore.'  `prophet!' said i, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if bird or devil! by that heaven that bends above us - by that god we both adore - tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named lenore - clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named lenore?' quoth the raven, `nevermore.'  `be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!' i shrieked upstarting - `get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore! leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!' quoth the raven, `nevermore.'  and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, and the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted - nevermore!",0,,

278999,"when one breaks through for the first time, here is no debate to be had.  the first time one crosses over, there is no preparation other than full submission of the self to the source.  perhaps this may interest you:  journey's beginnings - [dmt]  ""on the trip to the house, i felt a strange calmness  as i drove to the location in complete silence, preparing myself for the journey i was about to embark.  upon arrival, everyone was ready to go. we had abstained from marijuana the entire day in order to remain clear-headed before the journey, yet it seemed to be the furthest thing from our minds. as we sat in his room, preparing the first cannon (i was going first), i still remained eerily calm even though i had no idea what was awaiting me on the other side. once ready, the lights were killed and a light, transient playlist was queued up. we planned to allow full immersion by preparing the room in a way that the subject was seated in a what was essentially a large pillow-chair facing a blank wall. the time came to begin my journey.  lightly crisping the top layer of parsley, keeping the dancing flame from full contact, i slowly inhaled and held my first hit for approximately thirty seconds. i repeated with the second hit. i felt the world around me begin to form and shape itself, the material existences bending and twisting at the will of the gods and colors the auras began emanating from everything. by the time i brought the mouthpiece to my lips for a third hit, the vibration were so strong i felt as if i was being pulled between two worlds. i took the third hit, finally lighting the top of the parsley, but only gently to get a top-cherry burning. as i laid my head back and exhaled, i was lost to this realm.  i was swirling flashing colors everything. spinning and twirling and flashing the most beautiful colors i had ever seen. all of a sudden things began to take a form. a backdrop of gold-outlined ""cards"" with a pitch black center filled the entire vastness of existence in what felt like a perfect circular pattern around me. while i was mesmerized by the colors portrayed before me, i felt that there was more to be reached by focusing into the black center rather than the gold outline. shapes began spiraling out of the wall, forming what looked serpentine made of smaller versions of the card backdrop. this serpent-card structure's colors included red, black, golden yellow, and white. atop the head of the serpent was a head with ram horns and a long snout. the head seemed to have a feminine, inviting quality to it, although very distinctly animalistic with a greenish color to the snout and yellowish horns with bright yellow tips. the creature stared at me, as if trying to decipher who or what i was and felt to be trying to communicate with me. its eyes held the same feeling as the black openings of the backdrop, but so much more powerful--as if it held all the answers i was seeking. it was at this time i felt a horrible nausea and ended up purging into a bin nearby. the vision of the ram-serpent hung in front of me even as i purged, as if telling me that its meant to happen. i was able to pry my eyes open to some degree at this point, staring down into the trash bin and saw the whole twisting, astoundingly luminescent being pulsing energy into me as i watched it move so fluently. it appeared as if it were bound to this small bit of space in this world as i laid back and closed my eyes again.  i watched the colors begin to pull back and felt as if i, too, was being pulled back. a new backdrop took place, consisting of gleaming pale-yellow-to-white bars of alternating extensions and distensions. the bars appeared to be made of a high-gloss marble and shone as such. from this emerged seven angels looking to be composed of the same material. they appeared to grows from the wall, jutting out as if reaching out for me. i felt a song emanating from them as if they were trying to pull me closer to them. i reached out, trying to stay with them, but felt myself being pulled further and further from their reach.  as the angels fell further and further from my vision, i regained my ego and opened my eyes, but the sacrament had not finished showing me what it had to show. upon opening my eyes, the entire worlds was vibrating with energy. not in the same way the trip was in the beginning, but in a much more complex fashion. the auras no longer came from only material objects. instead, i saw every bit of energy in the world flowing freely through me and through everything. i saw how connected everything was. this was not a new experience as this idea dawned on me long ago. however, i never could've imagined seeing it as it truly is nor understood it as it truly is had i not witnessed it myself. the energies radiated in the fluer-de-lis pattern, with the central point of each aura glowing a bright and strong red and emanating this energy out in perfect harmony with every other aura.  i sat there for a few minutes absorbing everything i has just experienced and watched the oev's begin to fade. once i was sufficiently functional to stand, i rose and prepared my friend for his journey.""",0,,

145871,"people will jest about your comment, claiming it's another ""illuminati conspiracy"", but i don't think that was it at all.  rather, i think you're more stuck in the 20th century cold war period - america might have got involved in everything way back then as a means of undermining communism (for example, [operation gladio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_gladio), where america basically exerted their covert influence throughout the whole of europe), but following the fall of the ussr and the weakening of communist ideology, one would hope that american forces have somewhat gave up on their covert influencing. it's a feasible claim, even if a stretch of the imagination. i don't want to say definitively ""don't be silly, the cia won't be involved!"" when ten years down the line we could see the release of files claiming that the stockholm riots were a cia experiment to undermine the idea of multiculturalism.   what i am going to say, however, is that the idea of america being involved in any way is *extremely unlikely*. similarly, whilst states did anything to justify greater control in the 20th century, here in the 21st century it seems increasing liberalism is becoming the predominant ideology.  personally, my two cents is that it came about as police negligence (albeit, even then it's questionable, as aren't swedish police normally unarmed?), then the media (on a slow news day) picked it up and made it into some event about so-called ""riots"" that haven't actually happened. from there, we get to your idea that the government, *under media pressure*, will feel inclined to then preach about increasing control etc.  with your claim that most of the rioters don't live in the area, that seems perfectly feasible, on the basis that such were claims also of the london riots (i understand, these swedish riots are nothing like those in london) - that perpetrators weren't locally recognised, but were outsiders who had travelled to the city specifically to wreck it with justification of a ""riot"". this is more likely, ofcourse, in the claims that the ""riots"" have ""extended"" to places over the country like gothenburg now - more than likely it's just a few people who caused trouble initially deciding to just take a train and cause trouble there.",0,,

218868,"but that's what's wrong here. i'm not attacking anyone for their ideas or even being stubborn about my own. yes, i'm more on the liberal side of the spectrum but i come here to get a different perspective. i'm asking honest questions that i would actually like to hear someone's take on (if i'm coming across as condescending or rude, by all means tell me). i understand that most conservatives/liberals will never change the mind of the other through a political discussion, but to to talk down to me and downvote my comments (i don't care about the karma, it's just the principle) is the kind of attitude that, i think, is hurting our country the most right now, regardless of who's in power.  by dismissing anyone from the opposite party, we only divide ourselves more. it's easy to call the other side ignorant or what have you, but it's way more productive to try to understand their perspective.   do you feel a hate or dislike towards me because i have an opposing viewpoint? if so, then something is terribly wrong.",0,,
251892,"ok, not knowing your body-type or the climate you live in, let me try some general tips:  * *neutrals are your friends.* while this isn't a hard and fast rule and accent colors have their place, your wardrobe as a whole will work much, much better if it is composed primarily of neutrals. these include: black, cream (or nude), navy, army green, white, khaki, and charcoal gray. in addition, i strongly advocate for wearing semi-neutral jewel-tones, like emerald, deep blue, aubergine, mustard, etc. it's almost impossible to mix any of these colors together (neutrals + jewel tones) and not look at least half-way decent. as an added bonus, they tend to look good on pretty much everyone. if you take away anything from this comment, let it be this bullet point, it makes that big of a difference.  * *fit.* it's been mentioned, but it really warrants restating. too small is pretty much always a bad thing. too big can be ok if you balance the proportion with something slimmer (a slouchy sweater with skinny jeans is a staple of mine), but there is a fine line between fashion 'oversized' and just plain 'too big.' the more formal the piece, the better it needs to fit, but ideally, you won't buy anything unless it fits like a glove or you are willing to get it tailored so that it does.  * and on a related note, *know your body type.* play to your strengths and obscure your faults. if you are curvy, don't hide those curves under a billowy dress or shirt, belt at the waist. (leather belts for day, please!) if you have short legs, tunic-length shirts aren't really your friend as they only make your torso look longer, but if you are leggy without much torso, go for those longer tops to balance you out in the other direction. as per other advice here, experiment/spy on others to figure out what looks right on you.  *focus on the basics.* if you want to look classy, you really only have to worry about a few key items in classic silhouettes. let's work from the bottom up.  * *pants:* find yourself a pair of nice jeans in a dark blue (aka slimming) wash in either slim fit or bootcut. you could also go with black if you are getting multiple pairs. this depends on your size, as skinnies on less than tiny girls aren't always flattering. bootcut jeans are a nice classic shape that will stand the test of time. avoid flares. that goes double for bedazzling of any sort. they don't have to be $300 designer denim (i'm not convinced on the quality of these anyway. fit? yes. quality? meh.), they just need to fit you well. also, have them tailored to the right length for you. there is nothing classy about raggedy bottomed jeans that have been torn to shreds by walking on them day in and day out. if you want more than one pair, consider getting them tailored to different lengths, one for when you wear heels and one for when you wear flats. (i however just err on the longer side and roll my jeans if i wear them with heels). also consider a nice pair of dress pants if you have need for them. j crew has a few styles you might like at a fairly reasonable price. basic black should be enough to cover you for most occasions until you start working after school (assuming you end up in and office job). these should fit more loosely than the jeans. they should have a little give to them since dress pants tend to stretch less and be made of less-forgiving fabric than jeans, but in general look for slim fitting with a boot-cut-like ankle.  * *tops:* ok there are a million shirts a person can wear, but in general, for a classic look, you want: a) a well-fitting black or blue blazer (edit: or if you want something trendier, try a 'boyfriend' fit blazer that is a bit oversized and relaxed fit) b) a few nice, well-fitting but not tight-fitting button downs in colors like pale blue, light gray, white, or a white + stripe, c) some comfy v-neck sweaters and cardigans in any of the neutral or jewel-tone colors listed up there somewhere (wear alone or over a t-shirt for everyday, or with a button-down underneath for office-appropriateness), and d) if you are the girly type, some feminine blouses in silk, crepe de chine, etc, that will dress up nicely. for a preppy look, throw a blazer on over a button-down or a v-neck, or both at once. add skinny jeans. outfit. for going out look, throw blazer on over girly blouse, add jeans. outfit. rinse and repeat as necessary. just try different combos of these items and you will have plenty of classy options to work with.  *footwear:*  * *ditch the sneakers, seriously.* there are a few cute sneakers out there (i have a soft spot for converse), but in general they don't lend much class to any outfit. consider trading them out for ballet flats. instant upgrade. for more unpleasant weather, try riding boots in classic black or dark brown. they're available at wide range of price points, but get a nicer pair and treat them well, and you will have them a long time. also, oxford shoes are still pretty big right now and they are quite classy if you want another flat shoe with more support than ballet flats.  * *for dressier occasions,* there are a million shoes to choose from, but you will be well served by a classic pair of black pumps at a decent height (3-4 inches if you can handle it, that's what she said, etc). they can be worn with cocktails dresses or jeans and a nicer top for more casual outings. if you want to be a bit trendy, try a nude-colored sandals or pumps instead. these are extra awesome because they lengthen your legs like whoa if you are wearing a dress. if you feel like you would wear heels during the day, i recommend some cognac-colored gladiator sandals. actually a flat version of these would be nice, too.  *fancy-pants clothes:* i'm afraid i'm running out of steam here, so let me be brief.  * lbd - the little black dress is your friend. it should fit well, not be too revealing nor cover you up too much. interesting but not too distinct where it will be obvious to your social circle that you get a lot of wear out of it.  * general tip: balance how much skin you show by covering up another part of your body. for instance, i like minis to wear out at night, but i always wear them a top with full chest-area coverage or even with full sleeves to balance out the skin shown on my legs.   and lastly, if anyone has made it to the end of this novella i seem to have written, for the love of god, no vpl. visible panty lines can be easily cured with the application of thongs. there are plenty of comfy versions out there, hanky panky makes the best, but they are a bit expensive. victoria's secret has a knock off i have yet to try, but that look promising. really though. vpl. it makes you look like you don't care. and that is not classy.   edit: shit, i forgot i was going to add: a trench coat will lend instant class to any outfit you wear this spring. at your age, go for hip to mid-thigh length and in classic khaki (my fave) or navy blue or black.  edit2: fuck, i really could just go on editing this all night, but one last thing. i don't know if you still carry a backpack for school, but if you do, consider trading it out for a cross-body messenger bag in a rich caramel-colored leather, or even carrying your books in a larger shoulder bag. makes a world of difference.  ok, i think i'm done.",0,,

the horsehoofs ringing clear;    tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear? down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding—          riding—riding— the red coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still.  tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!    nearer he came and nearer. her face was like a light. her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,    then her finger moved in the moonlight,          her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  he turned. he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood    bowed, with her head o’er the musket, drenched with her own blood!    not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear    how bess, the landlord’s daughter,          the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  back, he spurred like a madman, shouting a curse to the sky, with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high. blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat; when they shot him down on the highway,          down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.  .       .       .  and still of a winter’s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,    when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,    a highwayman comes riding—          riding—riding— a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard. he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.    he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there    but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,          bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.",1,-1,1

489216,"mccain did not vote for it.  hagel and lugar {ranking member on foreign affairs} both voted against.  democrats voted roughly 60-40 in favor.  this bill was not partisan politics.  hagel [rocked his speech](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-clemons/no-false-choices-chuck-_b_41917.html) {heavy edit follows}:  *today, the middle east is more combustible and dangerous than any time in modern history. it is experiencing political upheaval driven by the israeli-palestinian conflict, religious and ethnic differences, radical islamic fundamentalism, terrorism, despair and the war in iraq.  forces and events in the middle east cannot be neatly categorized. the swirl of middle east history creates layers upon layers of complexity. there is little transparency in the middle east. that is a reality that is inescapable and cannot be assumed away. to ignore this reality is to risk being trapped by false choices. . .false choices such as the question, ""which is worse -- iran with nuclear weapons or war with iran?""*  *these are not our only choices in dealing with the middle east and iran. diplomatic initiatives, un mandates, regional cooperation, security frameworks, and economic incentives are part of the mix of international possibilities that must be employed to comprehensively address the challenges of the middle east.*  *we will fail to protect and advance america's interests -- in the middle east and around the world -- if we allow ourselves to be trapped in a self-constructed world based not on reality but on flawed assumptions and flawed judgment leading to flawed policy and dangerous miscalculations.*  *the united states must approach the middle east with a clear understanding of the complexities of the region. our strategic policies must be regional in scope...integrating iran, iraq, syria, the israeli-palestinian conflict, violent islamic extremism, access to energy supplies, and political reform into a comprehensive policy equation.*  *iran has cooperated with the united states on afghanistan to help the afghans establish a new government after the taliban was ousted. iran continues to invest heavily in the reconstruction of western afghanistan.  from these common interests emerged common actions working toward a common purpose. it was not a matter of helping america or strengthening america's presence in central asia. it was a clear-eyed and self-serving action for iran. complex sets of factors drive the dynamics inside iran as well as iran's actions in the middle east.*  *iran is not monolithic. iran is governed by competing centers of power. the president and the parliament -- known as the majles -- are elected. but it is the supreme council, lead by the supreme leader. . .currently grand ayatollah ali khamenei. . .who serves as the commander in chief and has formal authority over iran's armed forces and foreign policy.*  *ayatollah khamenei has the power to dismiss iran's president. yet another body -- the council of guardians -- screens presidential and parliamentary candidates, and reviews laws passed by the majles.*  *supreme leader khamenei did not support president ahmadinejad's presidential bid. in december 2006, ahmadinejad's supporters suffered major defeats in elections for municipal councils and the assembly of experts. last month, an iranian newspaper owned by ayatollah khamenei admonished ahmadinejad to remove himself from the nuclear issue.*  *two-thirds of iran's population is under the age of 30. iran is undergoing a generational shift that will shape iran's outlook. . .and its opinions of the united states. . .for decades to come.*   *iran's young people use the internet in large numbers, wear american jeans, listen to american music and are positive about america and the west. we do not want to lose this pro-american generation by turning them away from us. they are the hope of iran. they bristle under the heavy yoke of the ayatollahs' strident limitations of personal freedom.*  *we blundered into iraq because of flawed intelligence, flawed assumptions, flawed judgments, and questionable intentions.  the united states must find a new regional diplomatic strategy to deal with iran that integrates our regional allies, military power and economic leverage.*  *our differences with iran are very real. however, by refusing to engage iran, we are perpetuating dangerous geo-political unpredictabilities. engagement creates dialogue and opportunities to identify common interests, demonstrate america's strengths, as well as make clear disagreements.*   *diplomacy is an essential tool in world affairs using it where possible to ratchet down the pressure of conflict and increase the leverage of strength.*  *a regional conference led by iraq would be an opportunity for the united states to engage iran, with an agenda that is open to all areas of agreement and disagreement.*  *contrary to the masses of nearly all other muslim nations, and contrary to the declining popularity of the us in the world, iranian people are favorably disposed towards the united states. an offer of serious, frank discussions with the regime on all of these issues will, regardless of whether the regime accepts or rejects the offer, be a win-win situation for the united states, for the iranian democrats and for the existing un coalition against the regime's adventurism.*  *we must be clear that the united states does not seek regime change in iran. we must be clear that our objections are to the actions of the iranian government. . .not the iranian people.*  *engagement should not be limited to government-to-government contact. . .but rather find new and imaginative ways to reach out to the iranian people.*   *part of that initiative could be offering to re-open a consulate in tehran. . .not formal diplomatic relations. . .but a consulate. . .to help encourage and facilitate people-to-people exchange.*  *the failure of iran to comply with yesterday's un security council deadline to halt its uranium enrichment activities should be an opportunity for the united states to reaffirm and expand the international consensus to address iran's nuclear program. as dr. henry kissinger, former secretary of state and national security advisor, wrote in the washington post last november:*  *a diplomacy that excludes adversaries is a contradiction in terms. . .diplomacy -- especially with an adversary -- can succeed only if it brings about a balance of interests. . .to evoke a more balanced view should be an important goal for u.s. diplomacy.*  *without a wise and integrated strategy, we risk drifting into conflict with iran.*  *america's military might alone will not bring stability and security. . .to the middle east. that is an enduring fact of international relations that the late president ronald reagan understood well.*  *president reagan was always clear and resolute that the soviet union was our foe. . .that deep, fundamental differences divided the united states and the soviet union. he referred to the soviet union as the ""evil empire.""*  *yet it was president reagan who, in 1986, almost reached an agreement with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to abolish nuclear weapons. president reagan understood the need for america to engage. . .to understand our friends and our adversaries. . .to explore our options. . .to identify common interests.*  *president reagan understood that great powers engage because they are secure in their beliefs and purpose but humble and wise in their policies and actions.*  *the united states must have a policy on iran...on iraq...on the broader middle east...that the american people understand, and will trust and support. our words and our actions must seek to make america more secure, and the world more peaceful and prosperous. the world must know that, like all sovereign nations, the united states will defend itself and its interests, but that military conflict will always be the last resort.*  *the american people are deeply concerned about our direction in the middle east. a u.s. military conflict with iran would inflame the middle east and global muslim populations, crippling u.s. security, political, economic and strategic interests worldwide.*  *america cannot sustain political, diplomatic, economic or military engagement in the middle east without the support of the american people. america's policies must help lead the region out of the crisis.*  *today, some of america's own actions are undermining the very interests that we must protect and advance in the middle east. a recent poll conducted by zogby international in the countries of arab allies. . .egypt, jordan, lebanon, morocco, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates. .

922084,"three hundred years ago, courts of justice could be blinded by superstition. in those dark times, people in positions of power could snuff out the light from any candle of hope that the condemned still held for life. innumerable falsely accused victims were burned at the stake, ignited by the flames of flourishing injustice, and fanned by the falsehoods spoke by their peers. sadly, no joyous sunrise would come to end their tortured nights of captivity.  but three hundred years later, courts remain hoodwinked by dishonesty. three hundred years later, lives are still tossed to the proverbial pit of fire. three hundred years later, people in positions of power demonstrate that they are impossibly all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-hearing by summarily judging the actions of others and then doling out executions with omnipotent strength. and so i share with you today a reiteration that acts can be neither omniscient nor omnipotent, that we all have faults, and by extension so do our governments and judicial conditions.  in a sense, capital punishment is like writing a cheque to purchase the life of a criminal. a payment, some argue, that is cheaper than supporting lifelong imprisonment. yet the laws of australia, canada, the united states of america, and numerous others guarantee the ""unalienable rights"" of life and liberty. our past actions liberated slaves and all but abolished slavery. our present actions show that we believe the authority to limit the life of a human being belongs to no one. but coldheartedly, these representative cheques continue to be cashed at banks of justice, even though banks of life and liberty would return them marked ""insufficient funds""!  we must refuse to endorse banks of justice that continue to honour such cheques. we refuse to believe that money can indemnify human lives, regardless of the crimes in question. these deplorable bank drafts must be nullified to redeem our courts of justice and our humanity.  every moment that our voices remain silent widens the gap between being human and being humane. there is an urgency that cannot, must not, be ignored. every hour of apathy lends credence to legalized vengeance. now is the time to speak out for those lost voices smothered behind iron. now is the time to turn our backs on barbaric states. now is the time to tell the people in power that killing is wrong. now is the time to teach compassion to all of our children.  lives are lost forever by ignoring the fierce urgency of now. the dark winter veil of cold-blooded murder will not be lifted until the springtime infusion of life is guaranteed throughout our societies. and those who believe that tomorrow will be just another day will have a rude awakening if the executions continue. there will be neither rest nor tranquility in the world until unconditional life is granted to all its citizens. the snowstorm of revolution will not end until the clear dawn of humble justice emerges.  and to the people united on the peaceful threshold of merciful justice: do not embark in wrongful deeds. life cannot be sanctioned by vengeful actions or riotous demonstrations. no, the right to life will not be chartered by outbursts of physical violence. our actions must embody this monumental goal; we must segregate villainous force from moral force.  when light from our morality is used to judge the shadows cast by criminals, we must appraise ourselves and our laws by the same rays of ethics. to do otherwise places governments and judicial systems beyond the reach of mediated introspection, beyond the grasp of justice itself. by this beam of self-inspection, when a death sentence is dispatched we lift the offender to the moral equality of societal norms, and find ourselves standing deep inside the shadows of criminals.  we shall not walk in those shadows.  we will walk without the spectre of hypocrisy to haunt our footfalls. and as we walk, our steps bring us closer to a golden era that waits ahead.  we cannot turn back.  there are those who oppose the progression toward leniency. they raise statistics like a stoic hammer, driving the belief that executing murderers will reduce homicides. however, this interpretation does not a nail in the coffin make. numbers are tools to add weight to debates; debates that must be continually cross-examined for applicability and accountability. yet statistics are also the claw to the hammer's head, pulling out deterrence arguments by suggesting that legitimising murder through the death penalty actually raises the rate of homicides!  so we will not be satisfied by statistics. we can never be satisfied as long as the guiltless are slaughtered. we cannot be satisfied when fallible humans are the judge and the jury to deadly trials. we can never be satisfied while the press pilots our opinions with sensationalized stigma. no, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until tolerance towers like the tallest of trees and forgiveness flowers like an endless forest.  let us be mindful that forgetfulness is not a bedfellow of forgiveness. to forget that many death row inmates committed terrible crimes would let befall a grave injustice. by the same token, to overlook that the dead can only be exonerated posthumously defiles the memory of innocent victims. instead of incapacitation, let criminals atone for their crimes with positive contributions to society. instead of martyrs, make them educators. instead of miscreants, fashion them material makers. instead of misfits, mold them as missionaries. instead of being slain for malevolence, give them the chance to change.  even though we face the turmoil of retribution, we can see the tenets of redemption. within these tenets, i, too, have a dream.  i dream of a day when no human will have the right to revoke the life from another.  i dream of a day when miscarriage of justice does not result in fresh flowers to a solitary grave, but in the freedom of an unjustly accused prisoner.  i dream of a day when even the ghosts of salem massachusetts, whose deaths were inconceivably shackled to ""spectral evidence"", and whose memories still mock modern justice, may finally find peace.  i dream of a people who understand that no heated crime warrants a cold resolution by death; that death is unjustly everlasting when pit against both fleeting and permanent transgressions; and that humane disciplines can meet the needs of society while being a fair reproach for felonies.  i have a dream today!  i dream of a world where we can judge our justice systems as though they were individuals: not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. where at the highest courts of international law we find that justice is morally, ethically, and logically consistent across all countries.  i have a dream today!  i dream of a world in which mercy opens the door of knowledge to reveal that the real truth in any situation can never be known entirely. a world in which we are keenly aware that the whirlwind of motives, emotions, psyche, and actions behind a trial cannot be judged and punished with absolute conviction. a world that has cast off the rattling chains of death to embrace the foundations of life.  i dream of a world without injustice buried within injustice. a world where the poverty line does not foreshadow a flatline. a world where the accused wealthy and the convicted poor face their fates with equal outcomes and equal opportunities. a world where the concept of just justice is not an ironic fairytale, but a practical reality.  this is our dream, a dream inspired by an extraordinary man.  in the spirit of dr martin luther king jr, a man who made an enormous march for liberty, these words strive to be an extension of his ideas, a continuation to his ideals. but this time the walk is for life. and along the road to the global abolishment of capital punishment sits a world that is one small step closer to unity. it is only through this journey will our collective conscience truly be free at last.  http://davidjarvis.ca/essays/capital-punishment.shtml",0,,

974198,"i don't know what advice you got before - here's some more.   find out your color season. spring, summer, autumn, winter   wearing the wrong season makes you look... funny. uncomfortable. for me, it makes me feel (and look, i think) freaking enormous.   you are... probably not a summer, or a spring. (judging from what i can see of your skin color and hair) that's cool, me either.   summers are usually blonde and blue eyed, with pink or yellow-pink undertones.  springs generally have strong link undertones and are often red headed and pale or have light brown hair, just fyi.   that means, avoid pastels. pastels are for springs, and i'm happy enough to let them have 'em.   (except blue. freaking everyone looks good in blue. maybe not every blue, but most blues. i'm not going to mention blues any more. you probably look spectacular in blue, just saying.)    also, avoid bright, hot colors. bright red, lime green, hot pink, etc. those are the realm of the summers.   springs and summers look great in white. most other people, less so.   (these are not rules to make you stop wearing what you want to wear. wear what makes you feel fabulous. but! if colors are not making you feel fabulous, and you want to start, follow these guidelines, figure out your seasonal color family, and see how you feel.)   i wish i could see your face. then i'd tell you for sure what your season is. pm me a face pic, if you're interested in my non-expert analysis.   if you are an autumn, you are going to feel comfortable and contented in brown. i heart brown. also, olive green, or sage green or dusty foresty green. dusty and muddy colors generally. maroon. plum. maybe rusty orange and rusty red.   if you're a winter, you're going to feel your elegant best in jewel tones. do you know your jewel tones? learn them, love them. they're the prettiest. also, often only sold at the more high end stores. (like, banana republic, instead of old navy. boo hoo, your clothes are higher quality. oh well!)  cheat sheet: jewel tones are deep, rich colors. deep red. emerald green. amethyst. sapphire.   autumns often have darker hair, or auburn tones. olive skin is commonly an autumn feature, i think, as are green and hazel eyes. winters are often pale and have dark hair, also, often not pale. i've seen some stunning very dark skinned winters. winter colors are more universally flattering than many other seasons, by the way. many people can wear them.   you can be more than one season, too. i'm an autumn/winter (as should be obvious, since i'm totally biased). just play around with colors and see what makes your hair and skin and eyes look gourgeous, and what colors make you look like an awkward cupcake, or a dingy slump. and when they do? remember, it's that ugly-ass color's problem, not yours!   i hope this helps you on your journey toward wearing color!  ki worked in a jewelry store when i was a teenager, and my boss taught me all about color seasons. totally changed the way i dressed, and the way i felt about wearing color. thought i would pass it on as best as i could.",0,,

932239,"by cindy warner http://www.examiner.com/x-2366-sf-opera-examiner~y2009m2d19-tackling-weighty-issues-in-the-realm-of-the-gods  opera is known for tackling weighty issues.  the territory of gods, royalty, warriors and  women.  so i was watching the view recently and sherri sheperd says she has an opera singer friend who feels concerned about his weight. not for his own health or well-being so much as marketability. on that note each of the singers i have chatted with recently have also mentioned health. fred matthews, siggy seigel, greer grimsley. so isn’t it funny when performers get questioned for baring too much? to me it just goes back to the question of what is art, particularly with the anna nicole smith opera in the works.  incidentally there’s a great picture of greer as jtb from santa fe, photographed by ken howard in 2006.     a reviewer says jokanaan, john the baptist, would probably look like hell after his imprisonment and a biblical diet of crickets so why is greer performing bare chested. i say the audience sees jtb through salome’s eyes as desirable. his clothes would have been in tatters as any mortal’s spirit would have been. so has santa fe reviewer charles downey seen the sexy dvd from covent garden? it’s salome played by maria ewing and michael devlin as john the baptist? michael wears nothing but his white hide, a wild mane of black hair and a loin cloth. yet downey praises greer’s apocalyptic performance. commanding even from the cistern, resonant, the high point of the production.  although downey notes:  i know that salome sings a lot about jokanaan's white body, but i don't think it requires him to be costumed bare-chested, as grimsley was here. in fact, to be true to the story in the gospels, jokanaan would probably look pretty much like hell warmed over, after living on grasshoppers in the wilderness and then rotting in herod's prison.  so i ask you, charles downey, why ask why.  as for anna nicole, greer got back to me with his and his wife luretta bybee's vote on who to play anna. he agreed with me, mam. maryann mccormick. it turns out mam performed in venice with greer in die walkure. she emailed me on tuesday.  someone told me today that there is an article in the paper (maybe the new york times) about this commission. elaine padmore is spearheading it.    mam also says about greer and luretta:  they are so great. greer is such a terrific singer and colleague. we sang in venice together in die walkeure. he is easily the best wagnerian baritone around today!  i also had coffee and lunch with opera photographer john martin this week, who asks, what makes anna nicole’s story an opera. he and i went to the grove on fillmore on a rainy tuesday morning. she died, i said. and he seemed to agree and elaborated or one-upped me. first your son, then you. well, i felt bad with my cough and cold but not that bad.  needing sustenance after my earl grey with honey and his cappucino, he and i moved on to la boulange across fillmore.  it offers french onion soup each day. they offered a comforting bowl of french lentil too. john and i got onto the subject of his book on opera singers and i mentioned the controversial nature of the costume for john the baptist in salome. john martin will be photographing cast members backstage this season instead of supering for the first time in many years. he said perhaps i could help out. he wants to get those photographed to tell stories to go with the photographs.  he also mentioned he used to photograph architectural details in pacific heights, a few blocks away. i’ve been walking a couple of french bulldogs there all week and admired a brick structure with columns at the front door, the entire façade covered in glorious vines that must have taken a hundred years to grow. it’s old money along broadway and pacific he said, the gettys.   i put the red polo shirts on bev and bistro and went promenading with a view of the bay from the golden gate to alcatraz.  down the five flights of stairs . . . the elevator has been out all week and somebody even got stuck in it.  i'm knackered . . . but i've been writing my column with a view of the victorians and their rooftops and a catholic cathedral and a sandstone colored synagogue with it's slate black dome . . . rain or shine . . . photo by travis rew.  john says the vines i mentioned on that pacific heights mansion are actually bad for the brick, they keep in moisture. nevertheless he says the houses were immaculate, not a speck of dust, and usually just one couple living in them.  the stories they must have to tell with their view of the bay.  in closing, john sent a photo.  here's natale dessay, the french coloratura soprano and one of siggy's favorites, photographed by john martin last summer.  what does she see over her shoulder?  do you remember her after lucia di lammermoor at at&amp;t last june on that warm summer night, tossing her baseball cap to the audience?  other members of the cast came out waving foam fingers?  go giants, we're number one! meanwhile morgan jones is looking forward to the academy of friends celebration of the oscars on sunday.   she volunteers with the sfopera, sfsymphony, and the sfballet.  she and her son myles super at the opera. morgan emails i have had artist receptions to prepare brownies for, and am getting my brownie truffles into stores, and coffee houses.  i am currently preparing for the academy of friends gala on sunday, feb. 22nd, 1200+ ""serendipity! brownie truffles"".  then i have to begin preparing for the sf international chocolate salon, march 21st.  weighty issues on hold.  i imagine it will be a special year at the academy of friends, which is an aids and hiv fundraiser.  specifically with milk and marin's sean penn up for awards.  this year it's billed as a night of superheroes, villains and divas.            greer grimsley impressions, passions, stand by me, dreams  siggy team player part i and part ii  anna nicole smith opera  tosca featured in film milk tosca and how opera's embattled stay in fighting shape  fred matthews sang porgy &amp; bess 756 times  fred matthews produces cavalcade of stars iii february 2009  sfo unveils salome for 2009  sfo's summer of love 2009  opera announces 2009/2010 season  new orleans music producers     contact the writer at sfoperaexaminer@yahoo.com.  mam headshot courtesy of mam  photos of morgan jones and truffles courtesy of morgan jones  for more info:  www.sfopera.com",1,0,

(with high quality theatrical makeup, this usually only happens if you've been wearing a massive coverup of it or wearing it for too long.)  **   also - on the fake blood recipe left by somerandomredditor, if you're not using it in your mouth or eyes, add half corn syrup, half johnson's baby shampoo. that way it won't stain the hell out of anything it touches. if you want clotted blood, add a tiny bit of creamy peanut butter to the mixture, too, which thickens it and makes it less clear.",0,,

""balance"" on a plane is relative.  if it depended on the load being ""exactly"" balanced on one spot, then they would weigh you and your carry-on's. and the plane would be every unstable.   a 747, like any other plane,  has a range (somewhere in the length of the wingbox) where it wants to be, and the weight of people, loaded cargo containers and fuel (alot of fuel) they put the load somewhere in that range. i believe it is called the mean aerodynamic chord (mac).   because of the overall discrepancy of the load (heavy people in the front, in your example) the plane will want to go a little up or a little down (or roll a little left or right).   that difference happens every single flight.  they know that stuff.   on the control flaps on the plane, there are smaller ones, called trim flaps.  they can rotate a wheel or level and move them all slightly up or down. they roll them until the plane will fly level, not slightly up or down. then the controls are balanced, kind of like setting the tire alignment in your car, so you are not constantly pulling on the wheel to keep it driving straight.   however - overall all plane weight at take off and cruise - more weight = more gas.   since they have been removing unneeded stuff, extra trays, getting lighter carts, and every pound is being shaved as the rising fuel costs removes their profit.",0,,

570519,"**i actually participated in that post**. saturday's scheduled for the ""mob w/pitchforks"" thingy, if you want me gone that badly.   i'm mexican. pretty proud of it (our food is awesome). i'm also kinda brown (nc30) and i like playing ""oh my good i'm a *minority* makeup industry doesn't care about me even if they totally do"" and *appropiation police* in the cj.   we don't have an overt discrimination problem around here. we think foreigners are exotic (which i've been lead to believe might be an actual form of discrimination? i'm not sure on that) and might have shiny mirrors (actual historical reference, fuck yeah) and more delicious food, so we're cool to them. black people are awesome and we want to touch their hair. asians look cool with their slanted eyes (more on this later).  but among us? holy shit. most of us manage a balance between low-key racism and low-key acceptance.   we might be cool with indigenous culture, because food and pretty patterns, but we still call indigenous people in the public transport ""pinche indio"" (which might be the equivalent of ""fucking redskins""?). or instead of using ""raised by wolves"" we use ""recién bajado del cerro"" (just came into civilization from their indigenous community in the mountains?). we acept black people and ""mi negrito"" (my... little black man?) is actually affectionate and not considered racist. but ""está bien pinche negro"" (your skintone is fucking dark) is an insult. ""tener ojos de regalo"" (""gift eyes"" because you haven't opened them yet) is an insult.   so, still, as a whole, we think our ideal person is tall,  white-ish (nc20?) with big eyes and likes indigenous culture, but doesn't show their characteristics and is not actually connected to them.   talk about contrasts.   how does this work into cjing, you might ask. as someone who has faced this all her life, the fucking pale thing is something i face irl daily. in both sides of the coin, because i'm not really dark. couple years ago, i got a coral shirt. my dad told me ""it lights you up"" which is a nice compliment. my mom said ""it makes you look whiter"". da fuq, mom?   i'm the crazy lipstick person in the office (not really, i wear some purple and that's it). i work in marketing research, which is woman-friendly (kinda) and more forgivable about... highlights(?) in your look. she told me i look good in vibrant colors, and when i told her she'd look good in them if she wanted to use them, she said no. ""i'm not as white as you. you look good in them because you're white"" . and, woah, whitewashed even though my parents still understand dialect from their birthplace. just because she thought she was too dark for lipstick. she's always thinking about looking whiter.   so the whole ""i'm pale"" and ""no i'm paler"" thing does bother me. a lot. because frequently, too frequently, it comes from the ""i'm paler and thus *better* than you"" perspective. i understand that it might be a way to ""appropriate"" something they used to be mocked about, but it's likened to a systematic and cultural problem and it does create a certain blindness to other's problems.this attitude, in my experience, resonates irl and makes it socially acceptable to be low-key racist. problems that can't be fixed with fucking therapy because they will still face them each day, not only in highschool.   now, let's talk about sugar skull makeup.   or, catrina makeup, as i'd rather call it.   when i first noticed the us doing the whole ""sugar skull"" makeup thing, it *gave me life*, for lack of a better expression. it was awesome. some of the posters came from a ""this is so pretty and i tried it hope it's respectful even though i'm not sure if this means anything"" which, okay, i can understand and feels nice. like being ""glomped"" by another culture because they think you're pretty and cool. i'm more than okay with that. if sugar skull makeup or bindis or whatever is your gateway to get to know more about another culture, go for it, you have my blessing (not that anyone would care about it).  and then there were two other types of people: the one which fetishized it and the one that reduced the ""cultural"" aspect of it, sometimes even introducing so many weird elements that it's not even remotely near the original. they could paint a skull with an usa flag on it and it would still be nearer to sugar skull makeup.   those... still gave me life. but i call those posters ""catrinas"". see, posadas, one of the most featured and influencial artist in the whole catrina thing, meant that as a critic. catrinas mocked the priviledged class in the porfiriato (porfirio díaz, our very own dictator, mandate) who wanted to be frencher than french, but only manged in the exterior.  before you tell me that posadas' catrinas do not wear makeup (good observation!... and one skull candy posters are not usually aware of) the fancy clothes serve the same purpose as the makeup: to help a willfully ignorant person pretend to be wordly and educated when they couldn't find their own ass if they tried. to disguise with clothes (and makeup) the fact that they do not understand a culture different from theirs but they are willingly using it. to exemplify with excess how the priviledged turn a blind eye to real problems.   and they are doing it themselves, which i find pretty fun.   and then came the sjw.   see, there are people concerned about appropiation. they might not be completely sure what's about, but sometimes they feel someone is mocking another culture or erasing it's contribution to whatever is being talked about. they might call you out in a ""you're being kind of a jerk"" fashion.   and there are people who see *any* trace of another culture and it doesn't matter if the post was in good intentions or not. they are appropriating jerks, so they draw their highhorse and proceed to ride it all through the internet and tell them to shut up about it, because they don't know the culture and whatever.   when, frequently, the sjw is equally uninformed about what he's defending. and it's treating the outsider(?) culture as something rich and exotic and naïve that must be protected. which might be even more fetishizing that the original ""offending"" post. [see here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cxb5qviuwaavsa6.jpg)  heck, being an informed sjw doesn't stop them from fetishizing things. which is way creepier (and crappier) than the ""appropriating"" thing/person.  that's what i make fun of.  nice of you to mention the gays. because you can, totally, ""appropriate"" the gay movement while still supporting them not out of the good of your heart, but because you're a perverted asshole.   i read fanfic. not ashamed of that (some of those are even good!). there's slash or yaoi, which mean two dudes going at it. cool. representation! talk about gender norms! porn!  i think almost everyone in the slash community is pro-gay rights. which sounds cool. but isn't. there's a good portion of them that are pro-gay rights, but just when it's about dicks because vaginas are icky (even if the have one). lesbians are uncool and should still be banned (too many body parts they don't feel attracted to) and gay dudes are adorbs because they love is pure and they look cute (they feel actually comfortable fapping to them).   they are fetishizing gay people. some of them take pics of unaware gay couples to ""squee"" over them and to share with others. but only the couples that are ""right"" are okay. you know, the pretty guys going at it. two manly bears going at it, icky that's perverted. that's fucking creepy and disgusting.   so yeah, sometimes people defending other ""cultures"" or sexualities or whatever does rub me wrong. because it's about fetishizing it, which is a form of alienation (or something like that, my english is disappearing at this hour) in itself or to make them feel good about themselves. clicktivism, if you like it. they are not actually interested in that culture or that movement, they just want to cover their quota of being a nice person.    tl;dr  i think the whole pale princess thing does promote low-key racism as a good thing and a lot of sjw doesn't understand the culture they are defending either.",1,1,-1

730113,"november 14, 2009 10:44 pm           jamie's therapeutic touch day spa expands  by cheril vernon the palestine herald  palestine — a year after moving to a new location on crockett road, jamie’s therapeutic touch day spa has doubled its space to almost 4,000-square feet, adding private rooms for nine hair stylists and nail techs.  “this is so exciting that we have come this far,” rhone said. “five and a half years ago we started in a 8x12 (square foot) file cabinet room. i have been so blessed, and just so happy we can give back to palestine in a healing, healthy environment.”  the day spa now has four private massage rooms, five private hair styling rooms, facial rooms, sauna room, aqua detox room, spray tanning room and two manicure/pedicure areas.   to celebrate the expansion, jamie’s therapeutic spa will host a palestine area chamber of commerce ribbon-cutting ceremony at 5 p.m. thursday. an open house and re-grand opening event will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. saturday.  “we are now a full-service day spa — you can literally spend eight hours here relaxing in your robe,” rhone said. “you can get a facial, a massage, get your hair done, going from one treatment to the next.”  with special “spa food” brought in by jt’s custom catering, rhone said customers don’t even have to worry about leaving the spa to eat.  “it’s a one-stop shop — you don’t have to go to the big city to get special treatments — it’s all right here,” rhone said, noting they also offer specialized services including botox, permanent makeup and airbrushing.  in fact, rhone’s newest treatment — ashiatsu oriental bar therapy, a unique form of barefoot massage — is available at the spa, the only place currently in east texas.  during this treatment, the therapist grips bars installed over the treatment table in order to balance themselves and use the pressure of their feet to massage with aromatic oil.   ""it's much more effective for my clients to use my body weight and my foot, which is much larger than my hand, to apply just the right amount of pressure,"" rhone said.  the therapists use wooden bars bolted into the ceiling or a portable apparatus with overhead bars to maneuver above their clients and to support a portion of their body weight as they vary the amount of pressure they apply with one foot, or sometimes both feet. that combination helps create ""the longest stroke ever and the most luxurious massage on the planet,"" rhone said.   “i have been wanting to take this class forever, so after 33 long hours i am now trained to perform this amazing treatment, and i am so excited. through research, this massage modality is now a well-documented, effective, non-surgical technique for the treatment of chronic lower back and neck pain,” rhone said.  the treatment is recognized as such by the american massage therapy assocation, and approved by the associated massage &amp; bodywork professionals and the national certification board for therapeutic massage &amp; bodywork.   “we pride ourselves in taking the highest education possible and bringing new services and treatments each year to the spa. our goal is to bring at least one new machine and two new treatments each year to the spa,” rhone said. “everyone at jamie’s therapeutic touch day spa is passionate about what they do and we are constantly searching for innovative and result oriented treatments. i also just got back from training on air brush makeup, so that is very exciting to add to our extensive menu of services.”  jamie’s can accommodate brides with their makeup needs and anyone else for special occasions such as for proms, ladies night out or even birthday parties for kids.  “we can do all-day bridals where we can do airbrush and their makeup,” rhone said. “we also now have a photographer, greg laudadio, for bridal photo packages.”  for the kid birthday parties, parents can bring in their daughters for mini treatments just for kids.  “we will pamper them and teach them how to take care of their skin,” rhone said.   a national registered personal trainer monnie giles also has been added to the staff at the spa. giles will offer personal training and boot camp classes.  “we are now offering spa boot camp three days  a week. this will be a great addition to our weight loss packages and helping our clients reach their weight loss goals,” rhone said. “we do the boot camp interval training at different locations — every week we change up the one-hour sessions. one week we met at davey dogwood park, another time at the track. it’s challenging but it is for all fitness levels whether you are a beginner or someone who already works out several times a week.”  giles also will lead a walking group to help motivate those who are interested in exercising.  also in the works are “diva” dancing classes and yoga classes.  “we also added our infrared dry sauna to our many new treatments. the sauna burns 900 calories in 30 minutes, so beneficial to people with arthritis muscle spasms, pains, fibromyalgia and many other problems. we also bought another aqua detox machine to be able to accompany three people at the same time,” rhone said.  jamie’s therapeutic touch also offers numerous retail products that include face and body care, aromatherapy items, purses and jewelry.  “we will have the chamber ribbon cutting on thursday at 5 p.m. with dan manuel leading us in prayer, and we would love to invite the public to it,” rhone said.  saturday will be the open house and re-grand opening from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. with freebies for the public.  “we want to invite the public to come and meet our staff, receive free makeup makeovers, free face and body sugaring, mini facials, skin analysis, skin scanning and chair massage,” rhone said. “jolonda will be here doing permanent makeup and dr. isom will be here doing botox.”  reservations are needed for the botox and permanent makeup treatments.  a live remote with “the breeze” 102.3 will be held from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and with kyyk 98.3 from 2 to 4 p.m. with giveaways.   refreshments for the open house will be provided by jt's custom catering and ben e. keith. jeweler mary rainwater also will have a trunk show at the spa. sponsors for the open house are foster’s security, dogwood junction, dogwood sales, westmoreland custom designs and printing, joel's decorating center, sanders tires and bouquets by katie.   jamie's therapeutic touch is a member of palestine young professionals network and palestine area chamber of commerce. rhone is a member of palestine junior service league and harvey woman's club. rhone was named best massage therapist 2008 by the palestine herald-press readers choice and jamie's therapeutic touch day spa was voted best day spa for 2008 and 2009 by the palestine herald-press readers choice. rhone is a licensed skin care therapist (aesthetician), licensed massage therapist and licensed makeup artist. rhone has taken over 1,000 advanced training hours of continued education classes to bring new treatments to the day spa.    clients at jamie's therapeutic touch may choose from a variety of services including: botox;

298852,"reeves is crap paint. try using it up as a paint you sketch with rather than finishing a whole piece with it. the reason why economy (or student) quality paints such as reeves are not so great (even for beginners) is because if you try to do any sort of color mixing with them, you end up with mud. reason why is because the pigment to medium ratio is poor (less pigment and more fillers/mediums in the tube than a more pricey brand). i teach art classes to beginners and i am now requiring that they purchase artist-grade acrylics, oils or watercolours for class. here's a bit of a shopping list for you... obtain the following: golden-brand paint in these colours: hansa yellow opaque, quinacridone magenta, phthalo blue (red shade) or ultramarine blue, burnt umber or burnt sienna, zinc white and titanium white. also, pick up some golden acrylic glazing medium (gloss) or retarder medium to mix into your colours instead of adding water. adding water to acrylic polymer emulsion paints breaks down the paint, therefore resulting in a less saturated, washed-out or ""dull"" surface. you can mix water with watercolour paints, but try using acrylic mediums such as the glazing medium instead of water. the paints i mentioned and the medium will run you about $60-$70 depending on where you live (the stuff is cheaper in the usa). if you have any questions at all about art materials, please message me and i will answer your questions. i've worked in art supplies for a some years now and have extensive product knowledge about the stuff.  as far as composition goes, i get my students to use their own photographs only. the reason is because if you take photos off the net (even though you are giving your painting away this time around), the composition has already been solved for you, so you aren't learning much when it comes to that. use your own photos and crop them using a [viewfinder window](http://sites.google.com/site/rachelshirleypaintings/making-the-artist-s-viewfinder) to obtain a composition for your work. oh, and also another good practice tip would be to sketch out at least 5-10 different compositions in thumbnail format in a sketchbook (using a pen or pencil or whatever you want). that way, you will have a nice little plan before starting on a canvas.  it is always best to draw or paint from life when you can, but when you can't get outdoors to paint, be sure to stick with your own photos (or composites even; you could do this in photoshop and then print it out).  when mixing, do not use black. i say this because it is good to learn colour theory, and then make up your mind whether or not you'd like to use black to darken areas. complimentaries create neutral grays, so for example: red &amp; green, blue &amp; orange, yellow &amp; purple. theoretically, you can mix equal parts of any two complimentaries and obtain black. add white and you get grey. zinc white is a good one to start with because titanium white can be overpowering. try mixing both whites together in order to create a ""mixing white"" and then use that when tinting (tint = adding white to a color). another little trick to obtain black (and subsequent grays) is to mix ultramarine blue and burnt umber. you can mix ultramarine blue and burnt sienna to create a warmer black/grey.  and now, for some books that you simply must purchase and read through! i'm real picky when it comes to good art instruction books... so here are my recommended selections :)  [color &amp; light by james gurney](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0740797719?tag=httpwwwstud00-20&amp;camp=8641&amp;creative=330649&amp;linkcode=as1&amp;creativeasin=0740797719&amp;adid=0t5wzsdt1xqxedxepbwz&amp;)  [landscape painting by mitchell albala](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0823032205?tag=httpwwwstud00-20&amp;camp=8641&amp;creative=330649&amp;linkcode=as1&amp;creativeasin=0823032205&amp;adid=08nyrhykgtbnbtkxafzk&amp;)  [composing pictures by donald graham (disney's art instructor for many years)](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/193524700x?tag=httpwwwstud00-20&amp;camp=8641&amp;creative=330649&amp;linkcode=as1&amp;creativeasin=193524700x&amp;adid=05bc698pba2e2rsmffex&amp;)  [carlson's guide to landscape painting  by john f. carlson - written in the 1920s, this is the definitive book on landscape painting. the man's writing is sharp, witty and to the point)](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0486229270?tag=httpwwwstud00-20&amp;camp=8641&amp;creative=330649&amp;linkcode=as1&amp;creativeasin=0486229270&amp;adid=1hmc9f2keqsf77xt81dc&amp;)  one more thing... failure and criticism from others (and yourself) are your friends. failure will drive you to create better work, and criticism will help you know where you aren't doing so well. praise is great, but it can be extremely dangerous because if too many people praise you and not many give suggestions then where are you at exactly? you won't know if you've made a mistake (especially if you are just starting out).   quantity (and quality) are everything... paint paint paint! paint one a week or even daily if you can! create your next post on reddit when you've completed 30 paintings. seeing your progress would be nice. start a blog to keep track of your progress. also, try and enroll in a night class at your local art university/college. take the basics like life drawing first.  oh, and... paint for yourself, first and foremost. do not give a shit about ""is this going to sell?"". do not care. just do it for yourself. and don't be afraid to create something out of your comfort zone (pure abstraction or something with shocking subject matter).  good luck!",0,,

582666,"here. this is beauty before european colonization:   bambara (mali) - the bambara are not unmoved by the beauty of a woman's form; they can distinguish a well-formed body from a malformed one, a pretty woman from an ugly one, and they find a coppery skin more attractive than one of ebony black. (henry 1910:217)  tallensi (ghana) - in skin colour they vary from black through chocolate brown to bronze, which the natives call ""red"" (bon-ze'e) and regard as the most attractive bodily hue. (fortes 1945:7)  hausa (nigeria) - light skin colour, referred to as ""red"", ranks high in the hausa criteria of beauty; many variations of colour, from black to a very light reddish brown are seen. (smith 1965:264)  ibo (nigeria) - in ibo culture, however, these yellowish or reddish complexions are considered more beautiful than the darker, ‘blacker,’ complexions. ... it is true that, in west africa, government has for many years been identified with pale-skinned europeans, but the ibo evidence suggests that preference for paleness of complexion is indigenous. (ardener 1954:71-72)  azande (sudan) – of the women and girls, some with babies, he kept the most beautiful in zande eyes, those brightest of eye and clearest of skin and with full breasts, for his couch. (evans-pritchard 1937:60)  berti (sudan) men and women affirm without any hesitation that men are black, hot and hard and women are white, cold and soft. (holy 1988:471)  somali (somalia) - men appreciate women of good height and stature, with good hips and breasts, and plump but not fat. a reddish tinged skin is thought highly of in preference to a dark dull black. (lewis 1962:13)  masai (kenya, tanzania) - further requirements for being regarded as beautiful are an oval face, white teeth, black gums, a skin color as light as possible ... (merker 1910:18)  rundi (rwanda, burundi) – beauty does not count very heavily, but a man is not displeased if people notice that his wife is attractive and well-fleshed, has a long and narrow nose, a light skin, and is somewhat like a cow. (albert 1963:203)  ganda (uganda) - there is, in respect of the ordinary negroid complexion, a preference for paleness deeply rooted in the ganda ideal of beauty. ... the ganda concept of skin pigmentation considers light coloured complexions to be differing shades of white. a dark brown skin colour is said to be — eruyeru, that is, somewhat white. a really brown-reddish-yellow person is said to be mweru = white, which in comparison would be considered to be blonde; and this in the ganda aesthetic language is considered as red = myufu, the most perfect skin pigmentation. (lugira 1970:34-35)  nairobi (kenya) – in the future the increasing use of skin lightening creams such as ""ambi"" may eventually reduce the importance of natural skin color. but whatever the case, in nairobi of the 1960’s, as throughout much of kenya, the lighter ""brown"" girls are usually considered to be more beautiful than ""black"" girls — and the more successful prostitutes are invariably ""brown."" (mcvicar 1969:242)  ila, lunda, luvale, and chokwe (zambia) - here too words meaning literally ""white"" are commonly used to refer to light skins though ""red"" may also be used. light skins are admired just as much as is shown to occur among the ibo, and young girls discussing the possible attractions of various young men have often been heard to emphasize ""very black"" as a point against someone. in the past at least one attraction of a light skin apart from its intrinsic appeal was the fact that the tattooing stood out against it in strong contrast. very black skins are not infrequently thought to go hand in hand with inherited witchcraft and a light skin to indicate its absence. dark-skinned women conscious of their possible disadvantage have been heard to tell men that light-skinned women will be found to be sexually unsatisfying. (white 1954)  ngoni (malawi) - young men say that what they like in a girl is a light skin colour, a pretty face, and the ability to dance and to copulate well. (barnes 1951:30)  kgatla (botswana) - ... the generally admired type is a light-skinned girl of somewhat heavy build, with prominent breasts and large, firm buttocks. (schapera 1966: 46)",1,1,-1

 if it was the case, why didn't he say so?  it's not like it wouldn't have helped his case more than stating that paris had an undisclosed medical condition that they couldn't even provide papers to the judge to prove.  &gt;my understanding is that l.a. has so many ms-13 cholos to deal with, they don't give a shit about some spoiled heiress on a dui charge.  which is part of the problem. it means there is two types of justice, one for rich white celebrities and one for everyone else.  most of the other people in the jail already didn't get the special consideration of not going to jail on the dui and first parole break.  she, unlike most of the other inmates that could have been let out, was specifically sentenced to 45 days without home arrest being an option.  &gt;for the record, it was more than 10% of the sentence being reduced by half.  how do you figure?  45 day sentence with 3 days served is not more than 10%.  &gt;&gt;if someone gets parole and repeatedly breaks parole, justice is served if &gt;they go to jail.  &gt;she did.  then what's your problem?  &gt;&gt;if you want to feel contempt for someone, feel contempt for blah blah blah  &gt;how about if i instead feel contempt for a system that puts 4x the percentage of its population in jail than any other nation?  how about not being a twit and misquoting me?  if you don't want to copy the entire text, you don't need to, but converting it to blah blah blah is just insulting me.  how does the fact of the country's number of inmates being 4x the rest of the world possibly support the blog's argument, and your argument, that paris hilton received too harsh a sentence?  if anything, it shows that paris got off easier than most everyone else.  &gt;the point is, they're not. normal people get sent home early, like she was, becasue they just don't have the resources to deal with every bullshit pissant with an axe to grind because they lose their poor innocent prweshus baby to whatever school shooting, drunk driver, terrorist bullshit and decides there needs to be a bunch of laws that inconvenience the rest of us. and when normal people get released early it's not a big deal.  you're ranting.  normal people don't get to have therapists brought in on a daily basis because they can't deal with the fact that they are incarcerated.  normal people don't get sent home early after only 3 days on a 45 day sentence.  the fact that you are trying to make this about people who have personal axes to grind, and that you're inconvenienced somehow over drunk driving laws, just says to me that you have major issues in your life.  did you get inconvienced by getting arrested for drunk driving?  are you trying to defend poor paris because you feel her pain?  give me a break.  &gt;like i said, the l.a. sheriff has gang-banging murderers and other violent criminals to deal with. if they're going to have to deal with media drama, it's got to be either a double homicide or full-blown riot to make it worth their time. they don't need the distraction of babysitting to satisfy the schadefreude of a bunch of loser haters.  ooh, you know the german word, or you read the other reddit comments on this.  actually, the word is schadenfreude.     sorry, but taking pleasure in seeing her pain isn't the point.  it's that people are happy that a person who's shown herself to think she's above the law and above the rest of the people maybe will have to grow up a little now and realize that there are consequences.  if the la sheriff can't handle his job, and a single celebrity is too much for him to keep incarcerated, i'm sure someone else will be happy to take over for him.  frankly, if he doesn't like the media drama, he should perhaps tell his officers to stop arresting people for giving police dogs dirty looks.  the la police cause a lot more drama for themselves than they get from having paris hilton incarcerated.  if he disagrees and doesn't think she should be there, then he should take it up with the judge, and not change her sentence against the judge's specific orders, regardless of the opinions of paris fans like yourself.  &gt;&gt;the fact that paris chose to become a celebrity and actually takes steps to be famous is ignored here. any celebrity that goes to jail, or screams and cries when taken to court, is going to be newsworthy. this comes with &gt;being a celebrity. if one doesn't want the negative attention, one should refuse the positive attention too.  &gt;the truth of paris' ""crime"" comes to light.  hardly.  since you obviously don't have the reading comprehension to understand what i wrote, i'll spell it out for you.  paris chose to become a celebrity.  as a celebrity, anything one does becomes news.  the bigger a celebrity one becomes, the more newsworthy one's idiotic actions become as well.  if you don't want your dumbshit moves to become television news, then either don't make the dumbshit moves or don't become a celebrity.  it's really not that complicated.  one becomes a celebrity so that one become either rich and/or famous.  she was already extremely rich, therefore she wanted to be famous.  she achieved that, but few prizes in life don't come as double-edged.  unfortunately, you seem such a rabid pro-paris fan that i doubt if you're capable of seeing past your own fandrool.  the blog brought up the celebrity status.  i touched on it in response.  you responded to that as if i detest paris because she's a celebrity.  this says a shit load more about you than it does about me.  the fact that you put quotes around ""crime"" indicate you don't believe paris committed a crime.  is this because you believe dui isn't a crime?  or that paris, being a celebrity, can't possibly be held to the same standards as the rest of us?  i doubt if you'll answer that though.",1,-1,

how can you make a vampire movie without anyone sucking blood?  robert pattinson  it's alright, i think this movie already has more than enough sucking.  int. billy burke's house  billy burke is cleaning his gun and drinking a beer while listening to country music.  kristen stewart  dad, my boyfriend is coming over to pick me up. try not to get dork all over him.  billy burke  okay, let me meet him after the movie makes the film industry's ten billionth joke about protective fathers disliking boyfriends.   kristen stewart  alright. oh, and also: he's a 100-year-old vampire, don't say anything racist about vampires, okay?  robert pattinson  hello, sir. it's a pleasure to meet you, kristen has said absolutely nothing about you because you're so lame.  billy burke  so i hear you're a 100-years-old. and interested in my 17-year-old daughter. so, mathematically that's like, what, a 40-year-old dating a 6-year-old?  robert pattinson  ummmmmmmm...  billy burke  yeah, so my friend chris hansen would like you to have a seat right over here.  kristen stewart  dad, you're embarrassing me almost as much as my acting! i'm just going over to his house to have dinner with his family, i'll be back before 11. unless the ravenous vampires murder me, of course.  billy burke  alright, just bring this pepper spray with you. it's literally the very least i can do to offer it to my teenage daughter.  kristen stewart  daaaaad! stop being such a loser, i don't need this!  billy burke  really? weren't you almost raped by four guys earlier in the movie?  kristen stewart  yeah but i have a boyfriend now, which means i no longer have to be independent or physically capable of doing anything on my own. god!  robert and kristen go to visit robert's family mansion in the middle of the woods, because of course the fantasy male should be rich, too.",1,0,0

113909,"&gt;let me tell you a little about my town.   &gt;throughout the world there are many places like it, i’m sure, but i still like to think it was special. it was tucked away on the banks of an old, slow river, which was birthed from a great lake, far, far away to the south. cradled between the soft folds of hills, you’d never have known it was there if the brightly painted signs on the side of the road didn’t direct you to it.   &gt;the streets were clean, though a little narrow, and in the winter little plumes of smoke scrolled from the terracotta chimneys of the houses. the homes curled their old brick and dark wood around the winding streets, and blanketed the sides of the valley in a curious chequerboard of colours.   &gt;the councils of old had decreed that trees should be planted wherever possible. in autumn, the cobbled paths and stone gutters were always awash with gold, orange and brown – and in the spring, the ancient cherry trees rained blossoms like pink snow.   &gt;but with the winter came the fogs; and brought with them strange things.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;some years the fogs were thin, draping the lichen-spotted rooves with curlicued tendrils, and leaving everything damp. in the bad years, they would linger all day, squatting heavy over the river and the valley like some malevolent white beast, trying to push its ghostly fingers under our doorways and into our homes. the light became strange and diffuse. shadows ceased to exist – objects appearing eerily two-dimensional, as though wrought by some old computer system that couldn’t handle the load of rendering shade and depth.   &gt;our parents always warned us to travel in pairs, so we wouldn’t get lost – and to follow the lines of the cobbled paths and massive trees. of course, we thought they worried too much, so when the fog was thick as clotted cream, we would run off from our friends and hide in it, playing the world’s easiest game of hide-and-seek.   &gt;i did get lost once or twice and had to be rescued by my father, carrying one of the peculiar fog lanterns that cut a yellow-green beam through the whiteness. if you stepped off the cobbled paths and wandered into one of the many hilly parks, all sense of direction quickly abandoned you, and you’d find yourself walking though rumpled fields, ankle-deep in the grasses that grew so fast and wild in all the sudden moisture. the houses were no longer familiar shapes, but seemed huge, looming shadows, eldritch light gloaming from distorted windows and the muffled sounds of weird music drifting from inside.   &gt;the last time i lost my way as a child, i couldn’t even find the houses; all i could see was a choking wall of swirling white on all sides, and the wet grass directly beneath my sodden sneakers. as i walked, trees would appear suddenly, flat and unreal – but they weren’t the familiar, gnarled cherry trees lining the safe pathways. these were too smooth, their boles papery and silver, but too thick to be birches.   &gt;by the time i was found, my teeth were chattering with cold, and i was wet through to the skin, my dark pigtails plastered to my neck. my father, weeping with relief, carried me back home in his arms, while i fell asleep against his chest, exhausted.   &gt;how i wish that ordeal had been enough to teach me a lesson. &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;the bad winters always followed a good one, but sometimes that cycle would be disrupted, and we’d have a few fog-bound years in a row. as the world’s climate issues increased, the seasons waxed stranger, and the badness became permanent; no winter was a good one, and the fogs seemed even more dense, spilling out of the valley and swallowing up the roads beyond.   &gt;my father owned a small electronics boutique. when i was a child it was full of vcrs and bleeping lcd watches, but eventually i took charge of it, and we sold fancy smartphones and expensive earbuds to the younger folk in our sheltered town. when the fogs were at their worst, it would feel as though the shop was an isolated world all alone; a cube of thin walls hanging in a great void of white. i’d press my nose against the cold glass of the windows and stare outside, imagining i could see shapes in the nothingness, like a child conjuring images in the static on a de-tuned tv.   &gt;then the marshy, willow-the-wisps of car headlights would pass through and scatter my imaginings; the thunder of their engines dulled to a subsonic pressure wave by the cloying white blanket.   &gt;but when there was no traffic, i would watch for hours, a cup of green tea growing cold in my hands as i sat in the window, entranced by the wonders i could paint on the pale canvas beyond the glass. i could make white deer bound through an eerie landscape of silver trees and frozen hills, their great antlers insubstantial as smoke. the sharp spires of white towers lay out of reach on distant hills; citadels seemingly carved of bone, which my mind populated with transparent people, endlessly dancing in eggshell ballrooms.   &gt;on the days when i missed my dead mother the most, i would conjure what i remembered of her face. i’d imagine she was standing outside the window, her silky black hair and dark brown eyes turned white as milk.   &gt;and then, one day, she was. &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;there had been no cars, no customers, so i’d sat dreaming in the window for hours, lost in my white world. i watched the delicate people of the bone castles make their way down the pumice roads and through the frost bound-hills, until very suddenly, they stood outside the shop.   &gt;from the middle of their milling group, a woman approached, her hair and eyes colourless, but the angles of her face achingly familiar. she seemed to speak, her small, prim mouth opening and closing rhythmically, but no sound reached me through the walls of fog and glass. when her unheard speech was finished, she extended a single pale finger and beckoned me.   &gt;this was too much. much as i enjoyed my little fantasies when the shop was quiet, this one was too real, and it was making me uncomfortable. i blinked rapidly, dismissing the images and turning back to the reassuringly solid display cabinets full of glowing miniature screens.   &gt;there was a soft sound against the glass of the window, like a finch bumbling into it mid-flight. i saw pale legs disappear into the fog as the headlights of a truck tinted the misty street a sickly shade of green.   &gt;the vision troubled me all evening, and i found myself glancing often at the small shrine to my mother, which my father kept in the dining room. white lilies flanked her sombre portrait, matched by the pale ivory figurines which had topped their wedding cake. when i made my excuses and put myself to bed, the dense fog seemed to press against the windows. i felt trapped and oddly threatened, as though the house were being engulfed by a gigantic puffball mushroom, trying to consume us.   &gt;when i finally slept, all of my dreams were white.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;i knew the pale figures would come again. on some primitive level, i think i knew what was going on – as though the ancient genes of my honoured ancestors had whispered their knowledge into my very cells, dormant until i needed it. i watched from the shop window, rugged up in a chequered scarf and a smartly cut cashmere coat, waiting for the vision to return.   &gt;but when it did, there was no elaborate dreamscape, no procession of porcelain people winding their way down from their colourless palace. instead, the face and fingers of my mother thumped gently against the glass, then vanished again into the fog, as though pulled against her will.   &gt;i reacted on instinct – there was nothing else i could do – and so, not even bothering to lock the shop behind me, i grabbed a fog lamp and i ran out after her.   &gt;i fancied i caught a glimpse of a whiter white in the pall of soupy mist, and so i ran faster, the beam of the lamp wide and low, dappling the cobbled paths faintly green-gold. she was ahead of me, i knew it – her white legs would flash and stir the fog, leaving an eddy behind her, like the wake of a ghostly ship.   &gt;“wait!” i cried after her, “please, don’t run!”   &gt;but the phantom either couldn’t hear me or did not want to stop, because she loped onward, faster than ever, her wispy body almost completely swallowed by the milky surroundings.   &gt;i didn’t even notice when my feet left the path and started swishing through the wet grass. *something* had taken hold of me, and i would not, *could not* stop until i caught up with that flickering being.   &gt;but when the silvery trees loomed, their odd limbs dark outlines in the whiteness, my adrenaline instantly cooled, leaving only icy fear.   &gt;i did my best to stay calm at first, retracing my steps in the dewy park. but after an hour of fruitless wandering, the battery of my torch began to wane, and tears began to leave hot tracks down my frozen cheeks. shouting for help was pointless; even my most strident pleas were instantly swallowed by the fog, deadened by the oppressive thickness of the air.   &gt;it was ironic that i had left my phone back in the shop. when you’re surrounded by technology, you take it for granted that it will always be there – and so in my haste, i’d doomed myself by not even noticing i had left it behind.     &gt;i could no longer tell whether the dampness on my face was dew or cooling tears, and i stumbled blindly forward, hoping the downhill slope would take me to the river.   &gt;and so it did – far more suddenly than i expected. one foot plunged into the shocking chill of the rushing water, the other losing its grip on the slippery embankment, and i began to fall. it seemed to happen with bizarre slowness, as though the air had *actually* thickened to a milky syrup.     &gt;when a freezing hand grasped mine, and pulled me back onto the grass, i lay there and sobbed with relief.   &gt;the spirit of my mother had saved my life.   &gt;

966055,"in plymouth there was a large aquarium, it was the pride of the town and had a worldwide reputation. despite the decline in the fishing industry the tourism from the aquarium had bolstered the economy and prevented the town from slipping into the local recession that had struck many places along the same stretch of coast.  there were long halls full of crabs and eels and creatures from the deep of every description. all these long halls converged to a large central tank that contained the centre piece of the entire aquarium. living within this vast tank were some of the oldest and rarest creatures housed anywhere on earth. there was a dolphin with 3 dorsel fins, a large walrus with tusks in the shape of the last 2 popes, a thin frail porpoise that was said to be 250 years old, and a giant squid that was every colour of the rainbow.  it was just last year that a startling thought came to the mayor of the town. he had been on his annual tour to show his appreciation for the aquarium when it dawned on him that there was little or no security overseeing the towns aquatic asset.  during a hurried conference with the directors overseeing the facility he demanded that more stringent measures be put in place to safeguard this hub of the tourist industry.  the scheme was an all round winner as not only did it provide the much needed security, it also gave the directors a chance to get themselves in the papers yet again. the mayor turned the whole thing into a political publicity coup by ensuring that five local fisherman who had lost their jobs through the fishing decline all became the new security force at the aquarium.  and so it was that bob, jim, geoff, bernard, and sid all regularly patrolled the empty halls of the aquarium to ensure that no intruders ever made their way in to steal, disturb or damage the livestock.  a few weeks into the scheme, the tourists began to complain of small bags and wrappers on the floor and left on the edges of the tanks each day. fearing any bad publicity, the directors quickly hauled in all five security guards and asked them to be extra vigilant in ensuring no people left any litter behind. the guards said that they would do their best.  the problem persisted and so the directors secretly installed security cameras in order to track down the culprits. the first morning that the tapes were viewed quickly established that it was the guards themselves that were the secret litter bugs.  in a heated meeting, the directors banned all food being brought onto the premises by any staff and the guards had a weeks wages docked from their pay.  sleeping through the hot summer days and going hungry through the long nights soon began to became a drag. one particularly long night all five guards met near the central tank - hungry, tired, and exhausted.  ""i need food,"" whimpered bob.  ""we could always eat the fish,"" suggested sidney.  ""don't be stupid,"" said geoff.  ""lets all stay calm,"" said bernard.  ""i've been thinking,"" said jim, thoughtfully.  ""haven't we all,"" responded geoff, ""there's nothing else to do round here but think. i'm all thunk out.""  ""no, look,"" continued jim. ""here we all are famished, and there's a snack machine just over there.""  ""oh, security guards vandalising the snack machine, that'll go down a treat,"" said bob, sarcastically.  jim sighed. ""no one need ever know.""  ""and what about the camera pointing straight at it?"" asked bernard.  ""aha, but there's no camera pointing at the back of it!"" announced jim.  sidney looked on in despair. ""do you not think that has something to do with the fact that you would have to walk across the water of the main tank in order to reach the back of it? you idiot!""  ""and what would we do with the wrappers?"" said bob nervously. ""there's talk of them searching us all soon, every morning!""  jim smiled a long cunning smile. ""as i said, i've been thinking. we can drop the wrappers into the tank itself, no one will ever see them.""  geoff was only half convinced. ""there's still the matter of getting across the water without getting completely soaked.""  ""i've thought of that, watch this..."" jim walked over to the tank and splashed the water while listening.  as the others all watched in amazement, the prize animals of the aquarium all swam to the surface and made their way over to the crowd of men. without even blinking, jim removed his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and then climbed aboard the walrus with the papal tusks. a difficult journey across the tank then ensued, followed by the even more difficult task of unscrewing the back of a snacks machine whilst astride a large walrus.  the pair were soon back safely across and the walrus was rewarded with a crunchie, which it seem to enjoy. the men all enjoyed a feast of snacks and fizzy drinks and slipped the rubbish into the tank to sink out of view.  the next night, bob said he would perform the ride as it looked like fun. he rippled his hand in the water and all the animals swam over with a look of pining on their faces. bob chose the triple-finned dolphin and made his way to the machine. he selected a range of snacks for his colleagues and the dolphin chose a twix.  the next night was more of the same with sidney opting to perform the ride and the multi-coloured giant squid choosing a snickers ice cream.  the following night, bernard decided to give it a go and took the orders off all his colleagues. he was about to sit on the small frail porpoise when geoff grabbed him back.  ""don't sit on that ancient thing"" snapped geoff.  ""what?"" asked bernard.  ""he's right"" said jim. ""that creature is over 250 years old and very weak, if we were to kill it by riding it, that would ruin the little scheme we have going here. i say we never use this creature, the others are all strong enough anyway.""

""water, land, fulfilling the will of god in that order.""  i already mentioned they have no use for the land; the water is a good point although one would think it might be easier to invent decent desalinization than to oppress several million people for several decades killing thousands of your own citizens in the process. the will of god is definitely an issue for some crazies but even agnostic israelis tend to support the occupation.  ""israel controlled the airspace, the waters and all the borders into and out of gaza. it knocked out the electrical generating facilites (a war crime) and then prevented the flow of diesel and petrol for generators (another war crime). israel regularly launched excursions into gaza both on the ground and by firing missiles from helicopters and drones. since the pull out israel has killed hundreds of people in gaza including women and children.""  it's true that israel's placed sanctions on the gaza strip after hamas came to power and started attacking israel. that doesn't negate the fact that hamas took power in the gaza strip before most of this happened, and that israel could reasonably expect that to happen in the west bank as well.  ""why didn't it give all of it back? if it doesn't want it then give it back.""  the purpose of my comment was to try to explain this. they didn't give back areas that they thought would imperil israel if in enemy hands. the golan heights are a good example of this, as are the west bank and gaza strip. egypt and israel made peace, so there was no strategic reason to keep the sinai peninsula - therefore, they gave it back.  ""every country that has conquered land has made the people it conquered citizens. israel has instead chosen to institute an apartheid state in the wet bank and gaza. shame on them.""  do you think israel legally annexing the palestinian territories and making the palestinians citizens would solve any problems? in my opinion, the entire point of occupation as opposed to annexation is that israel *recognizes* that palestine ought to be independent and is hoping that the occupation will be temporary.  ""jews are not semites. palestenians are semites. you are anti semite, i am pro semite.""  first of all, i'm not, by your definition, anti-semite. i have nothing against palestinians any more than i have something against americans. but, like america, palestine is currently in a situation where it's a danger to those around it, and like america i think it needs to become more peaceful if it wants to have my full support.  second of all, you're technically right about the whole semite thing, but on the same note you'd be technically right to say ron paul is a flaming liberal (since ""liberal"" originally meant someone in favor of enlightenment values). in both cases, you'd just be avoiding easily understandable words and confusing people unnecessarily. if you're a linguistic prescriptivist that's lovely but i don't see what bearing it has on this conversation.  ""anyway the days of shouting ""anti semite"" at everybody who dares say something bad against israel are gone. when you call me an anti semite i feel proud, i wear it as a badge of honor because you just put me in the same company as bishop desmond tutu, nelson mandella, jimmy carter, richard dawkins and hundreds of other people i deeply admire.""  i've never called you, or anyone who simply agrees with your anti-israel views, an anti-semite. i referred to some people who post comments on reddit. occasionally when there's an article about a bombing in israel or something people will actually respond along the lines of ""good for them, i hope they kill some more jews"". i didn't believe it myself at first. that person is an anti-semite. from this one post of yours that i've read, i have no reason to think you're anti-semitic by any definition.  ""you guys blew your wad when you labled nelson mandella as an anti semite. from that point on the epithath lost all it's meaning. you better find some other phrase like jewaphobe or something. the patina has worn off of anti semite.""  please don't lump me in with anyone else. i've never called nelson mandela an anti-semite and don't even know what he did to get that label (though i can guess).  ""walks like a duck, talks like a duck, acts like a duck, kills like a duck, is a duck.""  bush frequently condemns terrorism. gandhi frequently condemned terrorism. therefore, all indians are the moral equivalent of us neoconservatives. if that syllogism is valid, then yes, i suppose supporting israel makes me a neocon.  i guess i'm wondering what you hope to achieve by villifying (sp?) israel. even if the us cut off all aid, israel would be perfectly capable of carrying out the occupation by itself. the only hope for peace in the region is to understand what makes both the israelis and the palestinians do what they're doing and find a solution that satisfies both of them. if you don't agree with that, then what exactly are you hoping will happen?",0,,

158366,"a great example of braising is my cheap and easy comfort food meal. make a big batch of mashed potatoes. in a pot, brown some beef chuck (might be called stew beef) cut into one inch cubes. cook an onion until translucent. throw some garlic in there. if you've got a decent bottle of red wine open, throw some red wine and deglaze the pan.  when you brown beef it creates little burned looking bits on the bottom of the pan. this is called 'fond.' you get the most fond from cast iron, the least from teflon. fond is gold - it's flavorful and has a very rich flavor. by adding wine, you help to break up and somewhat dissolve the fond stuck to the bottom - this is called deglazing. you cook the alcohol out and let it reduce a little, and it makes a great base for sauces.  to your pan now add enough beef stock to cover the meat up to about an inch. simmer for an hour or two or three until the beef is fork-tender (you can cut it easily with a fork). the liquid should be substantially reduced. this is not a stew.  in a skillet, melt butter and add an equal amount of flour. continue to cook, stirring frequently until this creates a doughy paste. cook the paste until it start to turn 'blond' - darker yellow but not brown. this is called a roux. roux is how you thicken stews, sauces, and gravies. it adds a rich flavor - so it's not ideal for every thickening circumstance, but it's a great go-to. add small amounts of roux to the beef and liquid until it thickens nicely into a gravy. pour over mashed potatoes and eat. takes a few hours, but prep time is fifteen minutes. the rest you can just leave bubbling happily on the stove and fuck off.  learn how to cook breakfast. it's a great meal to be able to cook for company.  learn how to cook eggs inside and out. eggs are the most versatile food. when you make scrambled eggs, the more you move the eggs around in the pan, the smaller the 'curds' that form are, and the creamier the finished product. don't salt the eggs until after. i like to scramble the eggs in the pan and add no water. i move them constantly with a small spatula. they come out dense and creamy. if you use a whisk and beat a lot of air into the eggs first, they come out light and fluffy.  an omelet is not as hard as it looks. start by cooking the eggs like you would scrambled eggs. when the curds start to form and solidify, press the mixture down flat with a spatula and leave it alone. add cheese and ingredients to the middle. pick the pan up and tilt it slightly, and work your spatula under the edge to fold it in half. let gravity help you here, it's easier for a novice. the trick to omelets is to fold them when the eggs are still runny in the middle. cheese on its own usually isn't enough to glue both halves of the omelet together.  don't burn your bacon. you can make great bacon in the oven, but save the grease. take bacon out a little bit before you think it's done, especially if you like it crispy. it crisps up somewhat on the plate. use that bacon grease to fry eggs or make homefries. to make homefries, cut the potato into half inch cubes. boil it for no more than ten minutes. drain it, pat it dry, salt and pepper it, and add it to the hot bacon grease. make sure there's enough fat / oil to come up about a quarter of the way on the potatoes but don't drown them - you aren't deep frying. you can add canola to the bacon grease if necessary, but straight canola oil gives it distinctive oily flavor. there's no problem with that. good homefries need enough fat to cook, they need to be parboiled, and make sure you flip them enough that they don't burn.  pancakes are easy, never use the premade stuff. pour a quarter (or third or half depending on how big you like it) of a cup into a hot skillet. the skillet should be lightly greased. that means, add oil and then wipe it out with a paper towel leaving a thin film. resist the urge to spread the batter out too much, let gravity take care of it.  always, always, always salt the water before you add pasta. pasta is cheap and versatile. tomato sauce is easy to make cheaply. in a small saucepan add a generous amount of olive oil. to the oil, add basil leaves and garlic. simmer for twenty minutes. in a pot, cook onions until translucent. peel and seed tomatoes. bring a pot to a boil. cut an x lightly on the bottom of each tomato, piercing the skin. drop the tomato in for thirty seconds, pull it out with a spoon and dunk it in ice water. the skin curls up around the x and is easy to remove. cut it in half. use the serrated knife. use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. cut it into rough chunks, add to pot, add a little water and simmer for an hour or two until it breaks down. when the oil is done, strain out the basil and garlic, add to the tomatoes. sauce that is lightly cooked tastes ""bright"" and has a vivid tomato flavor. cooked for a few hours, and it develops the flavor you associate with tomato sauce. some dishes are wonderful with a barely-cooked sauce.",0,,

""from paul's 1988 book, freedom under siege: ``white people who organize and expect the same attention as other groups are quickly and viciously condemned as dangerous bigots. hispanic, black, and jewish caucuses can exist in the u.s. congress, but not a white caucus, demonstrating the absurdity of this approach for achieving rights for everyone.''  http://www.chron.com/cda/archives/archive.mpl?id=2007_4477230  indeed , when talking of americans not individuals he seems to be able to see race very clearly  ""we quadrupled the tsa, you know, and hired more people who look more suspicious to me than most americans who are getting checked,"" he says. ""most of them are, well, you know, they just don't look very american to me. if i'd have been looking, they look suspicious ... i mean, a lot of them can't even speak english, hardly. not that i'm accusing them of anything, but it's sort of ironic.""  http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/02/ron_paul/index1.html  one more time on that  ""they just don't look very american to me..... they look suspicious ... not that i'm accusing them of anything""   he does not address the reality of the situation in the cnn interview and supporters project what is essentially an attempt to use character as a defence ( not addressing the heart of the matter ...see 8 and  9), be it that these do not match his comments/ position or supporters claiming this does match their perception.  http://stewart-rhodes.blogspot.com/2008/01/i-am-mexican-american-i-worked-for-ron.html  6 . ron paul could be shown to advance the news letter positions in his policies as in his position on immigration , a position that goes against the 14th ammendment of the constitution despite his constitutionalist stance ,as well as countering libertarian ideas of free-trade needing a free movement of peoples .the approach  dresses up more unpalatable positions in what appears at first as more approachable stances ,until such approaches are thought through that is. his states rights position could alternatively be used by secessionist / neo-confederacy camps.   examples  being selective in choosing which bit of the constitution to adopt and which to reject  ""consider the lawrence case decided by the supreme court in june. the court determined that texas had no right to establish its own standards for private sexual conduct, because gay sodomy is somehow protected under the 14th amendment “right to privacy.” ridiculous as sodomy laws may be, there clearly is no right to privacy nor sodomy found anywhere in the constitution. there are, however, states’ rights – rights plainly affirmed in the ninth and tenth amendments. under those amendments, the state of texas has the right to decide for itself how to regulate social matters like sex, using its own local standards. but rather than applying the real constitution and declining jurisdiction over a properly state matter, the court decided to apply the imaginary constitution and impose its vision on the people of texas.""  http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html  rejecting the civil rights act  http://assaultonblacksanity.blogspot.com/2007/09/ron-paul-on-1964-civil-rights-act.html http://jeffweintraub.blogspot.com/2007/12/why-ron-paul-condemns-1964-civil-rights.html http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul188.html  conspiratorial attitudes ( here the un/association with the john birch society and a defence of the branch davidian cult respectively )  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aruoyudd74 http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/paul1.html  such positions certainly attract a disagreeable brand of supporters . paul may or may not be in such camps  , but there has been association ,his services have been used by such fringe groups ,and  such supporters are not attracted to any tax or economic position . they are attracted to those matters that match their position , even if ron paul does use the language of liberty to forward positions that will erode liberties.

692255,"most of the answers to this question have been bullshit or simply said ""since literally forever"".  let me explain why this is.  hopefully this can explain race questions as they come up in /r/askhistorians. okay, first i have to let you in on a secret, and it's very important everyone understands this: race isn't real.  you can't look at skin or skulls and say ""okay, here's the absolute border between black people and white people.""  like look at any 19th century map of ""races of the world"", and they never give you the same set number of races because most of the time there isn't any consensus.  some say there are three, some say there are seven, some say there are nine, etc. etc.  check out [stoddard's map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:stoddard_race_map_1920.jpg), [huxley's map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:huxley_races.png), and [meyers's map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:meyers_b11_s0476a.jpg).  similar but different.  there used to be even intense debates of racial difference with in europe.  peep [ripley's ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_races_of_europe_%28ripley%29) vs. [deniker's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joseph_deniker). race categories work best when we're comparing people taken from different chunks of the world, and worst when we're trying to distinguish between neighboring groups because there's often not a very clear difference.  racial categories are often pretty arbitrary, and they're often pretty specific to a time and a place.  as the wikipedia page on [ancient egyptian race controversy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_egyptian_race_controversy) says:   &gt;since the second half of the 20th century, scholarly consensus has held that applying modern notions of race to ancient egypt is anachronistic.  it's probably not really possible to talk about race historically as stable categories, because even today, race is arbitrary.  in apartheid south africa, how someone told if you were ""white"" or ""coloured"" was the pencil test.  a bureaucrat stuck a pencil in your hair.  you leaned over.  if it fell out, you were white.  if it stayed in, you were coloured (or black).  science!  in some families, one brother was ""coloured"", and one brother was ""white"".  barack obama is black in america.  in brazil, he wouldn't be--he's too light skinned (he'd be in one of the intermediate categories, which exist in brazil, but not in the anglosphere).  i saw a talk by a light skinned african-american sociologist who studied race in brazil.  in some parts of brazil, people would come up to him and say, ""we need more black people like you who care so much about education"".  and in other parts of the country, people would come up to him and say, ""we need more white people like who really care about black people like us.""  he described the whole thing as confusing--and definitely the first time in his life he'd ever been called ""white"".  in australia, turks are put in the same racial category as greeks and italians (""wogs""), which is about the same as ""ethnic white"" is in america (italians, poles, irish, jews).  arabs are usually classed separately.  in germany, turks are much more likely to be put in the same category as arabs, but they're almost certain to be put in a different category from greeks and italians.  it's all about context.  you might not think that's about race, but race is the same pattern of putting people into these weird boxes.  it's very culturally specific.  but let's try to answer your question. first thing to figure out: are contemporary arabs (and the ancient peoples who looked just like them) white?  everything you've heard racists say about ""towelheads"" aside, the u.s. census says yes.  iraqis are white.  most people from the sudan technically would count as white according to the census (you're starting to get that race is made up of random categories by now, i hope).  but look at the ""arabs"" fighting the ""black african"" muslims in darfur.  talk a moment to look at the [""black"" darfurians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:darfur_report_-_page_7_image_1.jpg) vs the [arab darfurians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/janjaweed).  go ahead, it's worth it.  this will be here when you get back.  to my eyes, they look like ""the same race"", but in darfur, there is a clear racialized difference between the two.  [here's a picture of omar al-bashar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omar_al-bashir), president of the sudan, who is universally considered arab. [here's a picture of queen rania of jordan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/queen_rania_of_jordan), who is also universally considered arab.  you can't look at them and go, ""yeah totally the same race,"" but at the same time, there's a continuous spectrum of skin colors from the the arab part of sudan up to palestine, where queen rania's parents are from. if you go one step further, there's a continuous spectrum of skin color from the ""black"" part of sudan through the arab part of sudan to palestine to wherever you want to say white people start (the levant?  western turkey?  greece?  armenia?  austria?).  there's no clear place where white begins and black ends.  how long have blacks and whites known each other?  connections between darker skinned africans and lighter skinned arabians and levantines have been going on since time immemorial (yemen and the horn are right next to each other, even if you bracket egyptians out entirely).  and the egyptians, however we want to call them, were always in contact with both.  but let's say you say ""no man, we're calling all arabs, and ancient egyptians, and everyone in the middle east, neither black nor white.  bracket them all.  let's call them the mocha race.  for the question, we want skin cancer getting white people and vitamin-d deficient in northern climates black people, nothing in between.""  i'd think you're missing the point, but let's continue. in the roman empire, there were definitely dark skinned peoples around (the movie gladiator wasn't anachronistic in that regard), i think they were called a variation on ""ethiopian"".  as far as i know, no one really knows what north africans looked like in the roman era, but they weren't as dark as the ""ethiopians"".  the ethiopians weren't magically discovered one day by some roman columbus, though.  greek travelers wrote about black people before the romans.  contact seems to have antedated writing in this part of the world.  so at least some non-middle eastern whites have known about some non-north african blacks pretty much since always, as far as we have travelers writing accounts.  all of that is reported from the european side, because we have written records from there (and we already discounted all of egypt).  i have no idea what babylonians and sumerians thought about skin color, but it almost doesn't seem to matter, does it?  but, as other people have said, the answer to when did white and black people meet, the answer is almost certainly ""in prehistoric times"" (literally).    however, let's say your question is, ""when did non-middle eastern whites begin interacting with non-middle eastern blacks in large numbers, in a sustained, unmediated way?""  in post-roman times, there were probably isolated slaves and travelers going back and forth across the great stretch of mocha people who for the sake of this argument we have to count as neither black nor white.  there were probably plenty of slaves (white and black) who met each other in chains in the middle.  probably isolated cases of black slaves who ended up in white europe and some white slaves (slavs or people from the caucasus or captured mediterranean sailors) who ended up in black africa.  (yeah, i said it: there were [white slaves in the arab world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arab_slave_trade).  quote from wikipedia: ""according to robert davis between 1 million and 1.25 million europeans were captured by barbary corsairs, who were vassals of the ottoman empire, and sold as slaves between the 16th and 19th centuries,"" but enslaving white people started long before the 16th century). arabs and the people who would become arabs had a pretty good lock on long distance trade routes in the region.  slaves weren't very popular in europe between the collapse of the roman empire and the discovery that it was really, really cheap to make native americans work if you didn't pay them.  sub-saharan african was always a net exporter of slaves so white slaves probably weren't brought to sub-saharan africa very often.  all meaning, there probably wasn't much sustained contact between non-middle eastern whites and non-middle eastern blacks for a while, except like i mentioned, in ""arab"" slavery.  no counting pale greek and romans in egypt and similar places, and if we only count sustained contact between large groups of whites and blacks that completely bypassed the ""mocha"" people in the middle, as far as i know, the answer is probably when the portuguese started really looking for the indies in the 15th century and ended up sailing down the coast of africa (and setting up trading outposts and then colonies).  relatively late, if you think about it, and only slightly before europeans developed sustained contact with native americans (which, because of the slave trade, was only slightly before sustained contacts between africans and native americans).  edit: added more pictures and made it clearer shortly after posting.",1,0,0

808667,"there's so much wrong with this i don't know where to begin.  &gt; firstly we can establish that adam was black, given that he was formed from mud, and mud is dark brown to black (but never pale).  graphite is dark colored. i can make a diamond out of it that doesn't look the same at all. all sorts of things can be formed from things one color and yet be another.  &gt; we can establish that noah was black, given that his son called ham (whose name means 'hot' or 'burnt'), had his sons who were called phut (libya), mizraim (egypt), cush (ethiopia, whose name means 'black') and canaan. ham is clearly a black man. how could a white noah have just the one black child? ah. noah must have been black. therefore noah's son shem was black, and the rest of the shemites - thus the israelites.  ok. so first of all, all of noah's descendants are named after different historical middle eastern groups, and many of them such as egyptians would not have looked ""black"" by most notions of that term. but more to the point, if you take the bible literally, everyone is descended from noah (for that matter, the same problem applies to adam), so in fact, everyone would  then be black. since not everyone in the world is black today, there's a serious problem with this argument.   incidentally, we're pretty sure that humans were mainly black before spreading out from africa. most likely, lighter skin tones evolved as a response to lack of sunlight where it would matter for vitamin d levels.  &gt; we can establish for definite that moses was black. he is told one of the signs he may perform before the pharoah (an egyptian - who as we have establish were black, recall that the pharoah accepted moses as the child of his daughter), is turning his hand - wait for it - white (ex 4:6), if moses were white, or just tanned, would this be any kind of trick? no. note how in the passage in exodus, whiteness of the skin is affirmed to be a sign of leprosy, as it is in numbers 12:10 (in this passage miriam is turned white after complaining about moses marrying a cushite - an ethiopian), leviticus 13 and 2 kings 5:27.  ok. first of all, leprous skin is much whiter than normal white skin, and is certainly much, much whiter than most medium skin tones in the middle east. see for example [this somewhat unpleasant example of a leprous caucasian hand](http://www.dermnet.com/dn2/alljpg3/leprosy-14.jpg). also, at a purely incidental level you are wrong about what miriam is complaining about there, and you should reread the passage.  &gt; the canaanites could not tell that there were hebrews amongst the egyptians. (and also recall how joseph's brothers did not recognise joseph when they go to egypt - it would be strange if there were a lone white man amongst many black men and you did not recognise him as at least being out of the ordinary)  there are so many issues here it isn't funny. first of all, people of one racial group often have trouble telling other racial groups apart. for example, many people who aren't from east asia have trouble telling apart koreans, japanese and han chinese.and of course, you are still assuming that the ancient egyptians were ""black"".  &gt; in acts 8 (this is the first century) philip baptises an ethiopian eunuch who had gone to jerusalem to worship, and had in possession with him hebrew scriptures. in acts 10 peter reveals that it is now lawful (as it wasn't before this time) for a hebrew to associate with someone of the nations. we must therefore conclude that the ethiopian was infact a hebrew.  no. the israelites before jesus also accepted converts. what peter is saying in acts 10 isn't what you think it is.  &gt; in acts 21 paul is mistaken for an egyptian, and in matthew 2 joseph is told to hide in egypt (impossible if they were the only white people there).  aside from your continued insistence that egyptians were black, egypt was an extremely diverse area by that time, due to repeated colonization and conquest by the greeks, the romans and others. alexandria was one of the most cosmopolitan cities. and it isn't like anyone had ""palestine's most wanted"" to put joseph on. you wouldn't need that much racial diversity to hide out (or almost any when there's no modern communication).  &gt; ""are you not like the children of the ethiopians to me, children of israel?"" says yahweh."" - amos 9:7  which is wildly out of context and would make even less sense if it were a strict skin color comparison between the two groups.  the ancient israelites were almost certainly substantially darker skin on average than what would normally be considered ""white"" today. but none of the evidence you given is at all useful for establishing that fact and is utterly unhelpful for your much stronger thesis that they would be something akin to what is today considered ""black"".",1,,-1

'nothing fancy for  me', he said to the cute 17 year old behind the bar, 'black  venti with a hint of caramel'. the girl wrang it up, and  yelled the order at her uncomfortably uniformed co-worker  not three feet away. the older, more sullen barista gave  her an extra long look, far passed when she had handed xk  his change. it took another less pleasant look by the  cashier to get the pouring process started. coffee in hand,  xk casually glanced at his chair again. still comfortably  in the grips of another man casually reading the times. with  the anger building in his stomach he slowly made his way  over. maybe he'll get up before you get there, his mind said  in a taunting tone. with the way today was going, it was  even less likely than normal. he could hear his mind  laughing at him. sure enough when he had navigated through  the mostly empty chairs, the situation on the otherside of  the room had not improved. with a defeated sigh, he slumped  onto a nearby highbacked couch. the sigh must have been  louder than he intended because the man looked up from his  newspaper and stared directly at him. it was at that point  xkcd's mind clicked. ""hey i know you! you're paul graham!"".  'indeed i am!' said paul with entirely too much vigor. as  xkcd rose to offer his hand, paul receeded into his chair  and shrieked softly. taken back xk quickly withdrew. ""sorry,  did i do something wrong?"" eyes half closed, he stammered  softly into his chest. 'no sorry. i just only toucha the  lisps!' exclaimed paul with a bizarre clearly fake italian  accent. paper in hand, he rose from the chair and floated  ethereally towards the door. ""hey paul! are you flying? but  how!"" he said finding the courage to rise again. ""trust the  lisps, it is all powerful"" bellowed paul, and with that he  floated out into the rain. 'wow!', said xk, 'he has left my  chair!' with that, he calmly mounted the leather bound wood  forgetting all that came before it.  -fin-  but to tell you the truth i should probably be working.",0,,

[he disappears in a flash of green light]   **ladan**: good riddance.   **[five hours and twenty-eight minutes later.]**   **ladan**: [slumps] i've got it!   **burhaan**: [runs to her console and helps her out] are you okay?   **ladan**: (weakly) i'm fine. (louder) just a little tired is all. think i'll take a nap after i explain everything.   **burhaan**: yeah, do that. a seven-hour telelink has gotta be a major brain-drain.   **ladan**: don't i know it. [her eyes flash with green light for a second as she shouts:] magan! i've found it. bring the assault kit; it's looking dangerous.   [there is a burst of green light as magan appears in the helm, carrying with him three flimsy-looking, pale-green spacesuits, a machinegun, a halberd, and a set of ruby-red wings.]   **magan**: here's your stuff. [lays the weapons and two of the suits on an orange console, and begins to don the third suit]   **ladan**: [grabs a suit and begins putting it on, using one hand to point at the halberd] thanks. is that the model 64?   **magan**: [puts on the wings] of course. what do you take me for? i may not be the weapons expert, but i know your preferences.   **burhaan**: so, what's the situation look like?   *[both men turn to look expectantly at ladan.]*   **ladan**: it's just better and worse than we thought. [deep breath] life.   [for a moment, there is stunned silence.]   **magan**: go on...   [ladan sighs wearily, sits in the purple console, and closes her eyes. a holographic map appears in front of her, displaying the entire koras system. the starship xidig's location is marked with a blue x, and about twelve light days away, there is another, blue x marked ""undefob423.""]   **ladan**: as you know, we've been observing undefined object 423 for the past five weeks. over the last few days, i've managed to get a deeper understanding of this entity, and after my recent brain binge, i have sufficient evidence to believe that it is, as we suspected, alive.   **burhaan**: alive, as a whole? one consciousness?   **ladan**: yes, the whole thing. it's only around fifteen thousand feet long, nothing we haven't seen before.   **magan**: (shakily) yeah, except that what we *have* seen before have all been fossilized aliens, and we can only guess that those were ever alive.   **burhaan**: (to ladan) you're saying this thing is a sentient being, half the size of our ship?   **ladan**: not sentient, no. it's conscious, definitely alive. but nothing leads me to believe it is sentient. quite the opposite, in fact.   **burhaan**: [leans on a green console] explain.   **ladan**: it's simple, really. the animal, that is. hacking its brain was about as easy as hacking a five-year-old's, if that. not an intelligent creature, for sure. definitely no pandora.  [her teammates both sigh with relief.]   **magan**: i have a question.   **ladan**: shoot.   **magan**: why did you tell me to bring the weapons and suits if all we need to do is observe?   **ladan**: [frowns] unfortunately, i do have some bad news.   **magan**: [groans]   **burhaan**: what is it?   **ladan**: undefined object 423 is currently traveling at a speed five times that of light--   **magan**: --so? that should be easy enough to catch up to--   **ladan**: --on a trajectory that will lead it into a black hole's event horizon in fifteen days' time.   **magan**: *shit.*   **ladan**: if we don't stop it before then, we will lose humanity's first opportunity to examine extraterrestrial life.   **burhaan**: damnit, *damn* it! of *course* something like this would happen.   **magan**: fifteen days? can we even get to it in time, factoring in the black hole's gravity?   **ladan**: [nods] the black hole danger zone is about fifty light days. that's ten days at 423's speed, and easily eight days for us, tops.   **magan**: then what's the problem? it's stupid, right? we can catch it with two days to spare, and hightail it the hell out of there safe and sound.   **ladan**: yes, but...   **burhaan**: but...?   **ladan**: i'm scared.   [there is another stunned silence.]   **magan**: .....er. what?   **ladan**: i *said,* i'm scared. this thing is moving at 5 steins, so we obviously can't get a visual. it doesn't appear to emit any visible light, anyway. but what scares the hell out of me is what it *does* emit.   **magan**: [groans] oh, don't tell me.   **ladan**: [nods grimly] mystery light.   **burhaan**: [kicks the green console] *goddamnit.* so first it's alive, but then it's stupid, and *then* it's heading toward a black hole, except we can catch it, and *now* it's *invisible*--   **ladan**: --well, *thats* not the strange part--   **burhaan**: --yes, and now it's invisible and giving off light we don't even *know* about?   **magan**: yeah, that about sums it up.   **burhaan**: i don't suppose you have a solution for this?   **ladan**: [shrugs helplessly] how can i?   **burhaan**: great, just fan-tucking-fastic. [pause] we can't just let this go. can't we send a drone ship?   **ladan**: (offended) don't you think i've already done that? soon as it came within two light days, though, the thing scrambled and went haywire. the last reading i got from it was the brainwave scan, and then it just...i don't know how to describe it. it was just...gone. absorbed, or *something*.   **burhaan**: ""absorbed""? no way. one of *your* drones got eaten by a giant alien five-year-old?   **magan**: rekt   **ladan**: shut up, both of you. this is a being with control over unknown light spectra. it can stop its own light in its tracks, did you know that? that's why i couldn't have known this light existed until i sent my drone in. the energy literally disappears. something like that should not happen.   **magan**: no shit, it shouldn't. what the hell. any other surprises?   **ladan**: (bitterly) i think that about covers it.   **burhaan**: wonderful. just wonderful.   **ladan**: now you know why i'm scared.   **magan**: you'd be a bloody idiot not to be.   **burhaan**: damn this whole setup. it's like the universe is screwing with us.   **magan**: you never know, maybe it is. [raises his head to the ceiling] are you there, god? it's me, magan! i don't know what it is that you want with us, but we'd appreciate it ever so much if you would make this a *lit*tle bit easier! we're just trying to steal living things, is all. medical experiments and shit, you know how it be. so can you cut us a break and let us catch the goddamn thing?   [suddenly, there is a crash that rings throughout the ship, and a dozen holoscreens appear with warnings and intruder information.]   **magan**: damn, that was quick.   **ladan**: [scans the holoscreens in alarm] (panicked) guys? we have an intruder.   **magan**: no shit, sherdoc.   **ladan**: and...according to these charts...no *fucking way.*   **burhaan**: oh, hell. what now?   **ladan**: i think it's alive...   **magan**: [reattaches wings] fuck. that was *really* quick. you think god has a sense of humor?   [there is another crash, and a violent explosion. all the holoscreens fizzle and dissolve, and a few seconds later, the room is plunged into darkness.]   **magan**: well, shit.      *to be continued...*",0,,

297450,"**beef rendang**  this one i stole from splendid table what is in the picture is about halfway through cooking  - final result look much differnt - essentially a hot thai bbq yummy  yield: makes 4 to 6 servings  this extravagantly rich, dry-braised beef curry is a signature dish of the minangkabau highlands of west sumatra, indonesia. it's a triumph of flavor, with lime leaves, nutmeg, and cloves. the dish is cooked by a process that inverts normal braising. the beef is slowly simmered in a spiced coconut-milk broth until the broth evaporates and the meat is left to sauté in the intensely flavored rendered coconut and beef oils left in the pot.  this recipe comes from rohati, my cooking guru in padang, west sumatra. she offered me a few sage words of advice when she gave it to me. first, she said, allow plenty of time to make it. rendang has its own lethargic cooking rhythm, so that the more you try to rush it, the longer it seems to take. i know what she means. i've often underestimated how long it takes to cook and have left hungry dinner guests waiting while it continued slowly to simmer away. second, she said, use a shallow, wide pan, such as a skillet, rather than a deep soup pot. the less enclosed the cooking space, the easier it will be for the liquid to evaporate—in other words, the opposite of how you want to cook a curry. and third, rohati advised me always to use the best-quality beef i can get. in america this means avoiding precut stewing beef, which is of inconsistent quality. instead, choose boneless chuck or bottom round laced through with bright white fat and cut it into cubes yourself.  ""rendang is sacred food in west sumatra,"" rohati said. ""if you skimp on ingredients, you risk upsetting allah.""  if you decide to use the maximum number of chiles this recipe calls for, you may need to use a standard-sized food processor, rather than a small one. an excellent garnish for this dish is a tablespoon of very finely sliced fresh or thawed, frozen kaffir lime leaves. be sure to remove the center stem of each leaf before slicing it.  ingredients for the flavoring paste:  1 whole nutmeg, cracked open with a nutcracker or a heavy, blunt object such as the bottom of a glass measuring cup      5 whole cloves      6 shallots (about 5 ounces), coarsely chopped      3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped      5 to 20 fresh red holland chiles or other fresh long, red chiles such as fresno or cayenne, stemmed and coarsely chopped      1 piece fresh or thawed, frozen turmeric, 2 inches long, peeled and coarsely chopped (about 2 teaspoons), or 1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric      1 piece fresh ginger, 2 inches long, peeled and thinly sliced against the grain (about 2 tablespoons)      1 piece fresh or thawed, frozen galangal, 2 inches long, peeled and thinly sliced against the grain (about 2 tablespoons; optional)      5 candlenuts or unsalted macadamia nuts      2 pounds well-marbled boneless beef chuck or bottom round, cut into 2- to 2 1/2-inch cubes      2 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut milk      3 thick stalks fresh lemongrass, each tied into a knot      1 piece cinnamon stick, 4 inches long      7 whole fresh or thawed, frozen kaffir lime leaves      5 whole daun salam leaves (optional)      1 teaspoon kosher salt      1 tablespoon very finely shredded fresh or thawed, frozen kaffir lime leaves (optional)  instructions 1. to make the flavoring paste, place the nutmeg and cloves in a small food processor and pulse until ground to a dusty powder, about 2 minutes.  2. add the shallots, garlic, chiles, turmeric, ginger, galangal (if using), and candlenuts to the ground spices. pulse until you have a chunky-smooth paste the consistency of cooked oatmeal.  3. in a 12-inch skillet (nonstick works best), mix the beef and the flavoring paste until well combined. add the coconut milk, lemongrass, cinnamon, whole lime leaves, daun salam leaves (if using), and salt. stir well to combine and bring to a gentle boil over medium heat. immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered at a slow, steady bubble, stirring every 10 to 20 minutes with a spatula to prevent the meat and coconut milk from sticking and scorching. you'll probably need to adjust the heat periodically to maintain an even simmer. 4. the meat, coconut milk, and flavoring paste will now go on a fascinating journey. at first, the broth will be thin and gorgeously bright orange. as it cooks, the coconut milk will reduce, its fats (as well as the fat the meat renders) separating from the solids. it will become progressively thicker and darker, eventually turning brown. continue to simmer gently until the liquid has reduced by about 95 percent, stirring every 15 minutes or so to prevent sticking. only the meat, oils, and a bit of very thick sauce will remain in the pot. this will take anywhere from 2 to 3 hours, depending on the skillet that you use, how hot the fire is, and the richness of the coconut milk. test the meat; it should be tender enough to poke easily with a fork. taste some of the liquid for salt, and add a pinch more if needed. 5. when all the liquid has evaporated, reduce the heat to low (the meat and the remaining sauce are prone to burning) and allow the beef to brown slowly in the rendered fat. (the fat may be foamy at this point, but it will settle down when the cooking stops.) stir every 5 minutes or so to prevent sticking and scorching, being careful not to break the beef apart. continue sautèing the beef until it's the color of roasted coffee beans, 5 to 10 minutes longer. the surface of the beef should be barely moist and have an appetizing oily sheen. (if there is too much oil in the pan for your liking, skim some of it off with a spoon and set aside for later use; it's wonderful for sautéing potatoes.) 6. remove and discard the cinnamon, lemongrass, lime leaves, and daun salam leaves (if used), and then transfer the beef to a serving dish. (alternatively, serve this dish with all the aromatics, for a more rustic presentation.) garnish with the shredded lime leaves, if using. allow the beef to rest for at least 30 minutes before serving. slightly warm room temperature will best show off its intensely aromatic flavors. this dish will taste even better the next day.",0,,
515206,"latimes.com \t http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lostfaith21jul21,0,3530015,full.story?coll=la-home-center from the los angeles times column one religion beat became a test of faith a reporter looks at how the stories he covered affected him and his spiritual journey. by william lobdell times staff writer  july 21, 2007  when times editors assigned me to the religion beat, i believed god had answered my prayers.  as a serious christian, i had cringed at some of the coverage in the mainstream media. faith frequently was treated like a circus, even a freak show.  i wanted to report objectively and respectfully about how belief shapes people's lives. along the way, i believed, my own faith would grow deeper and sturdier.  but during the eight years i covered religion, something very different happened.  in 1989, a friend took me to mariners church, then in newport beach, after saying: ""you need god. that's what's missing in your life."" at the time, i was 28 and my first son was less than a year old. i had managed to nearly ruin my marriage (the second one) and didn't think i'd do much better as a father. i was profoundly lost.  the mega-church's pastor, kenton beshore, had a knack for making scripture accessible and relevant. for someone who hadn't studied the bible much, these talks fed a hunger in my soul. the secrets to living well had been there all along — in ""life's instruction manual,"" as some christians nicknamed the bible.  some friends in a bible study class encouraged me to attend a men's religious weekend in the san bernardino mountains. the three-day retreats are designed to grind down your defenses and leave you emotionally raw — an easier state in which to connect with god. after 36 hours of prayer, singing, bible study, intimate sharing and little sleep, i felt filled with the holy spirit.  at the climactic service sunday, mike barris, a pastor-to-be, delivered an old-fashioned altar call. he said we needed to let jesus into our hearts.  with my eyes closed in prayer, i saw my heart slowly opening in two and then being infused with a warm, glowing light. a tingle spread across my chest. this, i thought, was what it was to be born again.  the pastor asked those who wanted to accept jesus to raise their hands. my hand pretty much levitated on its own. my new friends in christ, many of whom i had first met friday, gave me hugs and slaps on the back.  i began praying each morning and night. during those quiet times, i mostly listened for god's voice. and i thought i sensed a plan he had for me: to write about religion for the times and bring light into the newsroom, if only by my stories and example.  my desire to be a religion reporter grew as i read stories about faith in the mainstream media. spiritual people often appeared as nuts or simpletons.  in one of the most famous examples, the washington post ran a news story in 1993 that referred to evangelical christians as ""largely poor, uneducated and easy to command.""  another maddening trend was that homosexuality and abortion debates dominated media coverage, as if those where the only topics that mattered to christians.  i didn't just pray for a religion writing job; i lobbied hard. in one meeting with editors, my pitch went something like this:  ""what if i told you that you have an institution in orange county that draws more than 15,000 people a weekend and that you haven't written much about?""  they said they couldn't imagine such a thing.  ""saddleback church in lake forest draws that type of crowd.""  it took several years and numerous memos and e-mails, but editors finally agreed in 1998 to let me write ""getting religion,"" a weekly column about faith in orange county.  i felt like all the tumblers of my life had clicked. i had a strong marriage, great kids and a new column. i attributed it all to god's grace.  first as a columnist and then as a reporter, i never had a shortage of topics. i wrote about an elderly church organist who became a spiritual mentor to the man who tried to rape, rob and kill her. about the orthodox jewish mother who developed a line of modest clothing for barbie dolls. about the hardy group of mormons who rode covered wagons 800 miles from salt lake city to san bernardino, replicating their ancestors' journey to southern california.  meanwhile, roman catholicism, with its low-key evangelism and deep ritual, increasingly appealed to me. i loved its long history and loving embrace of liberals and conservatives, immigrants and the established, the rich and poor.  my wife was raised in the catholic church and had wanted me to join for years. i signed up for yearlong conversion classes at a newport beach parish that would end with an easter eve ceremony ushering newcomers into the church.  by then i had been on the religion beat for three years. i couldn't wait to get to work each day or, on sunday, to church.  in 2001, about six months before the catholic clergy sex scandal broke nationwide, the dioceses of orange and los angeles paid a record $5.2 million to a law student who said he had been molested, as a student at santa margarita high school in rancho santa margarita, by his principal, msgr. michael harris.  without admitting guilt, harris agreed to leave the priesthood. as part of the settlement, the dioceses also were forced to radically change how they handled sexual abuse allegations, including a promise to kick out any priest with a credible molestation allegation in his past. it emerged that both dioceses had many known molesters on duty. los angeles had two convicted pedophiles still working as priests.  while reporting the harris story, i learned — from court records and interviews — the lengths to which the church went to protect the priest. when harris took an abrupt leave of absence as principal at santa margarita in january 1994, he issued a statement saying it was because of ""stress."" he resigned a month later.  his superiors didn't tell parents or students the real reason for his absence: harris had been accused of molesting a student while he was principal at mater dei high school in santa ana from 1977 to 1979; church officials possessed a note from harris that appeared to be a confession; and they were sending him to a treatment center.  in september 1994, a second former student stepped forward, this time publicly, and filed a lawsuit. in response, parents and students held a rally for harris at the school, singing, ""for he's a jolly good fellow."" an airplane towed a banner overhead that read ""we love father harris.""  by this time, church leaders possessed a psychological report in which catholic psychiatrists diagnosed harris as having an attraction to adolescents and concluded that he likely had molested multiple boys. (harris, who has denied the allegations, now stands accused of molesting 12 boys, according to church records.) but they didn't step forward to set the record straight. instead, a diocesan spokesman called harris an ""icon of the priesthood.""  harris' top defense attorney, john barnett, lashed out at the priest's accusers in the media, calling them ""sick individuals."" again, church leaders remained silent as the alleged victims were savaged. some of the diocese's top priests — including the cleric in charge of investigating the accusations — threw a going-away party for harris.  at the time, i never imagined catholic leaders would engage in a widespread practice that protected alleged child molesters and belittled the victims. i latched onto the explanation that was least damaging to my belief in the catholic church — that this was an isolated case of a morally corrupt administration.  and i was comforted by the advice of a catholic friend: ""keep your eyes on the person nailed to the cross, not the priests behind the altar.""  in late 2001, i traveled to salt lake city to attend a conference of former mormons. these people lived mostly in the mormon jell-o belt — utah, idaho, arizona — so-named because of the plates of jell-o that inevitably appear at mormon gatherings.  they found themselves ostracized in their neighborhoods, schools and careers. often, they were dead to their own families.  ""if mormons associate with you, they think they will somehow become contaminated and lose their faith too,"" suzy colver told me. ""it's almost as if people who leave the church don't exist.""  the people at the conference were an eclectic bunch: novelists and stay-at-home moms, entrepreneurs and cartoonists, sex addicts and alcoholics. some were depressed, others angry, and a few had successfully moved on. but they shared a common thread: they wanted to be honest about their lack of faith and still be loved.  in most pockets of mormon culture, that wasn't going to happen.  part of what drew me to christianity were the radical teachings of jesus — to love your enemy, to protect the vulnerable and to lovingly bring lost sheep back into the fold.  as i reported the story, i wondered how faithful mormons — many of whom rigorously follow other biblical commands such as giving 10% of their income to the church — could miss so badly on one of jesus' primary lessons?  as part of the christian family, i felt shame for my religion. but i still compartmentalized it as an aberration — the result of sinful behavior that infects even the church.",0,,

480186,"the ones who walk away from omelas  by ursula k leguin - from the wind's twelve quarters  with a clamor of bells that set the swallows soaring, the festival of summer came to the city omelas, bright-towered by the sea. the ringing of the boats in harbor sparkled with flags. in the streets between houses with red roofs and painted walls, between old moss-grown gardens and under avenues of trees, past great parks and public buildings, processions  moved. some were decorous: old people in long stiff robes of mauve and gray, grave master workmen, quiet, merry women carrying their babies and chatting as they walked. in other streets the music beat faster, a shimmering of gong and tambourine, and the people went dancing, the procession was a dance. children dodged in and out, their high calls rising like the swallows' crossing flights over the music and the singing. all the processions wound towards the north side of the city, where on the great water-meadow called the green fields boys and girls, naked in the bright air, with mud-stained feet and ankles and long, lithe arms,exercised their restive horses before the race. the horses wore no gear at all but a halter without bit. their manes were braided with streamers of silver, gold, and green. they flared their nostrils and pranced and boasted to one another; they were vastly excited, the horse being the only animal who has adopted our ceremonies as his own. far off to the north and west the mountains stood up half encircling omelas on her bay. the air of morning was so clear that the snow still crowning the eighteen peaks burned withwhite-gold fire across the miles of sunlit air, under the dark blue of the sky. there was just enough wind to make the banners that marked the racecourse snap and flutter now and then. in the silence of the broad green meadows one could hear the music winding throughout the city streets, farther and nearer and ever approaching, a cheerful faint sweetness of the air from time to time trembled and gathered together and broke out into the great joyous clanging of the bells.  joyous! how is one to tell about joy? how describe the citizens of omelas?  they were not simple folk, you see, though they were happy. but we do not say the words of cheer much any more. all smiles have become archaic. given a description such as this one tends to make certain assumptions. given a description such as this one tends to look next for the king, mounted on a splendid stallion and surrounded by his noble knights, or perhaps in a golden litter borne by great-muscled slaves. but there was no king. they did not use swords, or keep slaves. they were not barbarians, i do not know the rules and laws of their society, but i suspect that they were singularly few. as they did without monarchy and slavery, so they also got on without the stock exchange, the advertisement, the secret police, and the bomb. yet i repeat that these were not simple folk, not dulcet shepherds, noble savages, bland utopians. there were not less complex than us.  the trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. this is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain. if you can't lick 'em, join 'em. if it hurts, repeat it. but to praise despair is to condemn delight, to embrace violence is to lose hold of everything else. we have almost lost hold; we can no longer describe happy man, nor make any celebration of joy. how can i tell you about the people of omelas? they were not naive and happy children--though their children were, in fact, happy. they were mature, intelligent, passionate adults whose lives were not wretched. o miracle! but i wish i could describe it better. i wish i could convince you. omelas sounds in my words like a city in a fairy tale, long ago and far away, once upon a time. perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly i cannot suit you all. for instance, how about technology? i think that there would be no cars or helicopters in and above the streets; this follows from the fact that the people of omelas are happy people. happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. in the middle category, however--that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc.--they could perfectly well have central heating, subway trains, washing machines, and all kinds of marvelous devices not yet invented here, floating light-sources, fuelless power, a cure for the common cold. or they could have none of that: it doesn't matter. as you like it. i incline to think that people from towns up and down the coast have been coming to to omelas during the last days before the festival on very fast little trains and double-decked trams, and that the trains station of omelas is actually the handsomest building in town, though plainer than the magnificent farmers' market. but even granted trains, i fear that omelas so far strikes some of you as goody-goody. smiles, bells, parades, horses, bleh. if so, please add an orgy. if an orgy would help, don't hesitate. let us not, however, have temples from which issue beautiful nude priests and priestesses already half in ecstasy and ready to copulate with any man or woman, lover or stranger, who desires union with the deep godhead of the blood, although that was my first idea. but really it would be better not to have any temples in omelas--at least, not manned temples. religion yes, clergy no. surely the beautiful nudes can just wander about, offering themselves like divine souffles to the hunger of the needy and the rapture of the flesh. let them join the processions. let tambourines be struck above the copulations, and the gory of desire be proclaimed upon the gongs, and (a not unimportant point) let the offspring of these delightful rituals be beloved and looked after by all. one thing i know there is none of in omelas is guilt. but what else should there be? i thought at first there were no drugs, but that is puritanical. for those who like it, the faint insistent sweetness of drooz may perfume the ways of the city, drooz which first brings a great lightness and brilliance to the mind and limbs, and then after some hours a dreamy languor, and wonderful visions at last of the very arcane and inmost secrets of the universe, as well as exciting the pleasure of sex beyond all belief; and it is not habit-forming. for more modest tastes i think there ought to be beer. what else, what else belongs in the joyous city? the sense of victory, surely, the celebration of courage. but as we did without clergy, let us do without soldiers. the joy built upon successful slaughter is not the right kind of joy; it will not do; it is fearful and it is trivial. a boundless and generous contentment, a magnanimous triumph felt not against some outer enemy but in communion with the finest and fairest in the souls of all men everywhere and the splendor of the world's summer: this is what swells the hearts of the people of omelas, and the victory they celebrate is that of life. i don't think many of them need to take drooz.  most of the processions have reached the green fields by now. a marvelous smell of cooking goes forth from the red and blue tents of the provisioners. the faces of small children are amiably sticky; in the benign gray beard of a man a couple of crumbs of rich pastry are entangled. the youths and girls have mounted their horses and are beginning to group around the starting line of the course. an old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair. a child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the crowd alone, playing on a wooden flute.  people pause to listen, and they smile, but they do not speak to him, for he never ceases playing and never sees them, his dark eyes wholly rapt in the sweet, thing magic of the tune.",0,,

959159,"well, i found these for starters:  bambara (mali)  the bambara are not unmoved by the beauty of a woman's form; they can distinguish a well-formed body from a malformed one, a pretty woman from an ugly one, and they find a coppery skin more attractive than one of ebony black. (henry, 1910, p. 217)  tallensi (ghana)  in skin colour they vary from black through chocolate brown to bronze, which the natives call ""red"" (bon-ze'e) and regard as the most attractive bodily hue. (fortes, 1945, p. 7)  hausa (nigeria)  light skin colour, referred to as ""red"", ranks high in the hausa criteria of beauty; many variations of colour, from black to a very light reddish brown are seen. (smith, 1965, p. 264)  ibo (nigeria)  in ibo culture, however, these yellowish or reddish complexions are considered more beautiful than the darker, 'blacker,' complexions. [...] it is true that, in west africa, government has for many years been identified with pale-skinned europeans, but the ibo evidence suggests that preference for paleness of complexion is indigenous. (ardener, 1954, pp. 71-72)  azande (sudan)  of the women and girls, some with babies, he kept the most beautiful in zande eyes, those brightest of eye and clearest of skin and with full breasts, for his couch. (evans-pritchard, 1937, p. 60)  berti (sudan)  men and women affirm without any hesitation that men are black, hot and hard and women are white, cold and soft. (holy, 1988, p. 471)   somali (somalia)  men appreciate women of good height and stature, with good hips and breasts, and plump but not fat. a reddish tinged skin is thought highly of in preference to a dark dull black. (lewis, 1962, p. 13)  masai (kenya, tanzania)  further requirements for being regarded as beautiful are an oval face, white teeth, black gums, a skin color as light as possible ... (merker, 1910, p. 18)  rundi (rwanda, burundi)  beauty does not count very heavily, but a man is not displeased if people notice that his wife is attractive and well-fleshed, has a long and narrow nose, a light skin, and is somewhat like a cow. (albert, 1963, p. 203)  ganda (uganda)  there is, in respect of the ordinary negroid complexion, a preference for paleness deeply rooted in the ganda ideal of beauty. [...] the ganda concept of skin pigmentation considers light coloured complexions to be differing shades of white. a dark brown skin colour is said to be eruyeru, that is, somewhat white. a really brown-reddish-yellow person is said to be mweru = white, which in comparison would be considered to be blonde; and this in the ganda aesthetic language is considered as red = myufu, the most perfect skin pigmentation. (lugira, 1970, pp. 34-35)  nairobi (kenya)  in the future the increasing use of skin lightening creams such as ""ambi"" may eventually reduce the importance of natural skin color. but whatever the case, in nairobi of the 1960's, as throughout much of kenya, the lighter ""brown"" girls are usually considered to be more beautiful than ""black"" girls — and the more successful prostitutes are invariably ""brown."" (mcvicar, 1969, p. 242)   ila, lunda, luvale, and chokwe (zambia)  here too words meaning literally ""white"" are commonly used to refer to light skins though ""red"" may also be used. light skins are admired just as much as is shown to occur among the ibo, and young girls discussing the possible attractions of various young men have often been heard to emphasize ""very black"" as a point against someone. in the past at least one attraction of a light skin apart from its intrinsic appeal was the fact that the tattooing stood out against it in strong contrast. very black skins are not infrequently thought to go hand in hand with inherited witchcraft and a light skin to indicate its absence. dark-skinned women conscious of their possible disadvantage have been heard to tell men that light-skinned women will be found to be sexually unsatisfying. (white, 1954)  ngoni (malawi)  young men say that what they like in a girl is a light skin colour, a pretty face, and the ability to dance and to copulate well. (barnes, 1951, p. 30)  kgatla (botswana)  [...] the generally admired type is a light-skinned girl of somewhat heavy build, with prominent breasts and large, firm buttocks.

259125,"""neutral"" is usually a blend of yellow and red (""peach"") from what i can tell, but clearly i am new to this skintone business. plain olive is more like a greenish brown? khaki? when i tan it doesn't have any pink or golden glow, it's just brown. kind of like this [girl](http://primped.ninemsn.com.au/images/uploads/primped_loves/june/olive/87878363_d.jpg) who also seems to have trouble with foundation matching. it's certainly closer to yellow than pink, but yellow-toned makeup looks sallow on me. my skin is only pink if i have angered it somehow.  i mix mineral foundation with an olive pigment and white base, so i can add way more white base to match the fantastically pale shade i have cultivated. i tried a ""neutral"" shade but it looked off also, similar to the girl in the link. like, too much of the other colors and not enough plain greenish-brown.  if op is olive toned, i can see why she's having some confusion... it's definitely outside the normal tones in a primarily caucasian reader base. i'm caucasian also, but there are a few lighter genetic populations passing on this olive thing--some germans, some asians, some mediterranean, etc. most of the complementary color advice is hit or miss for olive types, especially paler ones.   so, if you see this op, i tend to stick with true whites and blacks, bold/deep colors, and darker neutrals. not on my menu: light neutrals (except grey), ivory, beige/taupe, or pastels. i don't think light olive skin looks good in navy blue in spite of the ffa/mfa idea that it's a color for everyone, but maybe that's just me (i think i look sallow in it). i think the winter category in the seasons quiz is the closest fit, but they include some questionable pinks and yellows, which i would remove, and they leave out some of the autumn colors that do go well, like the darker earthy colors (rust/olive/browns). it can be a pretty versatile skin type, but you'll probably need to just consciously notice how colors look on you rather than getting a chart, because you probably aren't in exactly one of those categories unless you have a strong yellow, blue, or pink undertone. good luck!",1,0,

889901,"okay, i'm going to go through this for you one last time, in detail so hopefully you get it.  &gt;ok so what does my personal income have to do with interstate commerce if none of my clients live outside my state?  you're missing the point of the clause. the federal government has jurisdiction over what would ordinarily be state regulated affairs when they are perceived to **impact** interstate commerce. thus, the government could make the argument that taxes impact how much a person spends, therefore impacting how frequently they travel out of state, or how frequently they make purchases from a business that must import items from a distribution center across state lines. check case law on the books, and you'll find that there is an incredible reach allowed to the federal government because they only need to prove a tangential connection between the action and the effect on interstate commerce. this vagueness is where the power of the statement is derived from.  thus, it doesn't matter if there is a direct connection between your income taxes and interstate commerce, because all that matters is that there is **some** connection, however slim.  insofar as the elastic clause:  &gt;so if killing you was needed to accomplish their goals, that would be constitutional... hmmm interesting.  that's actually a good example. if the u.s. absolutely had to kill you to preserve the other dictates of the constitution, they would have no problem doing it. what, have you forgotten about capital punishment? the states do this stuff all the time.  what keeps the government from just shooting people is obvious if you had read my link. there's a little section in there that states: ""to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers""  that means that as long as the thing in question is necessary and proper in order to preserve the earlier dictates of the constitution, it can and will be done by the government. whether or not those things are actually necessary and proper are then decided after the fact by those old men you spoke so poorly of before.  &gt;that is your interpretation of it. a literal look at the amendment would reveal they can only tax goods, etc that go across state lines.  actually, my interpretation is based on what the courts have decided for several hundred years. your literal interpretation was thrown out years ago. check the case law.  &gt;it's people like you who have allowed politicians to twist and bend the words of the constitution to get us into the beauracratic nightmare we have today.  i think you mean people like thomas jefferson and john adams. the constitution was intended to be a living document, interpreted and added onto successively generation after generation in order to govern the country as it grew. the system we have in place today is the product of literally never ending litigation to determine the optimal meaning of every syllable in the constitution, and all the documents it has inspired. if we were to read the document literally, there would be no united states left today.  so it is clear to me now that you know nothing about the elastic clause, or the interstate commerce clause, or how the judicial system reacts to laws, or how litigation has built up the order that is present in every day life, yet you seek to lecture me on how this country works?  also, it's spelled duel.

328804,"bought too much products the past few months and reviews are long overdue so here goes.  **becca backlight priming filter** - i stopped using highlighter because of this product. technically this is a primer but it doesn't make your makeup last long or anything it just adds a subtle glow to it. similar to mac strobe cream but this one you can mix with foundation without giving up coverage and still is noticeable under full coverage foundations unlike the strobe cream. the shimmers are very fine and not chunky. don't use too much or you'll end up looking oily though, you really don't need a lot of this. has fragrance.  **becca first light priming filter** - it's a lavender/lilac version of the other priming filter. i only tried samples of this but it really doesn't compare to the backlight one. this is also pricier and imo, isn't worth it.  **mufe step 1 smoothing primer** - it's okay, the smoothing effect isn't that drastic. it also didn't add much wear time for my makeup. i don't have a lot to say about this product because it really didn't do much. has a bit of fragrance.  **becca ever matte poreless priming perfector** - the formula is thick and can be quite hard to work with because it sets so fast. it tends to pill also and it better to pat it than rub it on your skin. it promises 12-hr shine control but for my oily nose you can see visible shine 4-5 hours in. the outer corners of my eyes are oily and tend to smudge eyeliner/give me racoon eyes but this product stopped that from happening. got the deluxe sample of this from sephora ph beauty rewards and i think it's still available there if you want to try it. has a bit of fragrance.  **becca shimmering skin perfector in opal** - another beauty pass reward. similar in formula to the backlight filter except this one has more intense shimmer. it doesn't disturb foundation if you put it on top. don't put too much or you'll end up looking metallic. has a bit of fragrance.  **benefit 1st prize highlighter set** - a set of 3 mini highlighters. **high beam:** more runny than the two, i find that it can disturb foundation so be careful patting it in. **sun beam** my favorite of the three, almost similar to becca opal but more golden tones. **shy beam** - matte light peach highlighter, very opaque, no shimmer. i don't really care for it but i'm probably not the intended market for this one. very faint fragrance for all three.  **benefit soft natural brows kit** i recommend this set (or the other sets) if you want to try benefit eyebrow products. this set includes **goof proof brow pencil** - i like this but there's too little product for something that costs 1.3k, it's insane how pricey this for 0.34 grams. the product itself is great though, just the right balance between creamy and stiff formula so it's easy to use. long lasting as well but you're better off buying abh dipbrow pomade. **high brow highlighting pencil** - this was the one i was least excited about but surprised me. i use it to highlight my brow bone and it's very long lasting, although i wish there was a yellow tone version of this as that will be more suitable to my skintone. **ready set brow gel** this is my hg brow gel. i sweat a lot and my sweat tends to pool on my eyebrows but this thing doesn't budge at all. it's the best.  **bobbie skinny brow define pencil** i bought this at the recommendation of someone here. and i really love it. it leans more on the stiff side but who the hell cares it only costs 130 pesos. it's retractable so the product itself has a tendency to break off though so don't put too much pressure. i use this to draw hair like strokes at the front end of my brows.  **becca ultimate coverage foundation creme** - high coverage foundation that's supposed to work for any skin type. eh. it's quite tricky to use, the formula is thick (not el double wear thick but thicker than colorstay) and sets fast so you have to work fast or work in portions. matte finish and is tricky to mix with other foundations, primers or moisturizers. i think this might work better with oily skin types. i do mix it with bourjois healthy mix or use it on top of that. no fragrance.  **banilla co. hydrating finish powder** - very fine powder with a slight peach tint. it has a velvety skin like finish, no shimmer. i use a tiny amount after primer and also set my foundation with this. if innisfree no sebum powders look too drying on you, i suggest giving this one a try. i love the packaging because you can twist to to cover the holes and you don't end up making a mess. no fragrance.  **becca undereye brightening corrector** - got samples of this from sephora. the formula is very very tacky and smells plasticky. reminds me of suesh concealer correctors, in fact i threw away a suesh corrector just like this one. this is too light and does nothing for my dark undereyes. i can see it working for very fair people but if you are light-medium to deep, it will look ashy af. this is also too pricey don't buy it.  **the saem cover perfection tip concealer** - gives the most coverage out of all the liquid concealers i've tried. this oxidizes like nuts though, but it oxidizes to my skin tone so i don't mind, it is much lighter when you first put it on but sets to the actual shade in around 10 or so minutes. easy to blend out and doesn't lose much coverage when you do. strong fragrance.  **cover fx correct click - brick** - i have really dark under eyes and ashy/blue toned mustache area along with some areas in my chin and concealer never really did the trick for me. i've also used orange, peach and salmon correctors and they still didn't quite do the trick so i decided to try a deeper color. this is a pinkish red color. very pigmented so don't put too much, creamy but doesn't cake up. i use the saem concealer over this and i have no issues whatsoever. if you watch drag race, this is the crazy corrector farrah moan uses on her 5 o'clock shadow. before using it for the first time, swipe it on a paper towel. no fragrance.  **3ce super slim pen eyeliner in light brown** - bought this to fulfill free shipping, it only costs p107 so might as well try. wanted to use it for my natural make-up days. it's light brown that leans more on yellow than neutral brown. it doesn't smudge and sets matte and fast. the packaging and brush tip are short though so it may take some getting used to. the color is buildable to a darker brown but wait for it to set first before brushing another layer because it will bleed.  **marc jacobs high and fine 4-piece petites waterproof eyeliner collection** - this is on sale as of right now for p732 on sephora. includes 2 mini highliner and 2 mini fine liner. great value for a set of four. these are gel formulas and glides on pretty smoothly but not too creamy that you have to set it with eyeshadow. the highliner comes in royal blue (matte) and cocoa shade (fine shimmer) no issues with both. the fine liner comes in nude and black. i have a bit of an issue with the packaging of fine liner, it's quite hard to twist. the nude one can be tricky to use on the waterline because it's so skinny. i feel like a nude eyeliner in a highliner packaging would've been a better deal. the fineliners are super budge proof btw and you have to work a bit to remove it with micellar water.  **3ce duo color face blush - retro drive** this is a yellow-mustard &amp; red orange combo, when swirled the color is orange of course haha. this is finely milled and long lasting in a matte finish. it's quite pigmented though, maybe a little too pigmented so it feels like i'm wasting product when i'm swirling because i have to tap off the excess. it can also be a bit tricky to blend the two colors and there's a bit of kick-up/fallout when you swirl. i'd probably buy their regular blushes instead of the duo blushes next time. i feel like this will be much more flattering to very fair skintones. i only apply it sheer because it has a tendency to make my skin look dull if i put too much. it has 5g of product, less than your standard mac blush but cheaper than mac. no fragrance.  **zoeva luxe color blush - he loves me maybe** - i was surprised when i saw how big this blush was. it was under p500 so i thought it would just be as big as sleek blushes but this has 8g of product in it. the color is a cool toned pink with some shimmer to it but leans more on matte than satin. formula wise it's not chalky or dusty and it's very easy to blend and not patchy. packaging is nice and sturdy and comes with a mirror. last about 5~6 hours on me. would definitely check out the other shades of this. has a bit of fragrance.  **suesh blush pots** - the ones i've tried are either chalky or too shimmery and the pigment is not that great. i also hate how they never have descriptions for the color so you won't know what the actual color or finish of it is and have to judge by the picture which most of the time is not how it looks like in person. the pot itself is too small, so it's tricky to swirl your brush in there. don't even bother with this.",1,0,0

616878,"&gt;indeed... why, any time the word ""jewish"" is heard by an american, they picture a cinnamon skinned middle-easterner. right?  no, they picture a hook-nosed white man, probably highly educated and financially well-off thanks to his successful career in medicine or law.  and they picture him eating a pastrami sandwich at his granddaughter's bat mitzvah while trying to make an imporant point about life to her in yiddish.  my point is that, very recently, this stereotype has become wildly inaccurate.  it was reasonably accurate for a long time, but the majority of world jewry now lives in the state of israel, and that majority shows no sign of shrinking.  actually, the originally ""brown"" ashkenazi jews who, by rape, became ""white"" over time serve as a perfect example of just how stupid it is to divide the world based on skin color, especially because there are gradations between the european and semitic phenotypes in ashkenazi jews.  my blonde brother's skin burns in summertime (european) while i tan deeply and get highlights in my normally dark-brown hair (semitic).  you would lump both of us in as ""white"", because you lack experience in spotting semitic features.",1,0,0
503190,"their dark feathers contrasted with the mist of the pale forest.  the ruddy light showed no colors, except for the dirty green and red of the birds’ eyes.  dripping, the skeletons of trees flickered in and out of sight like lightning bolts of darkness in the rolling fog.  sir rupert had stopped short, muttering to himself.  with cruel larceny, the wind stole his words and carried them into the oblivion beyond the haze.  his gaze was fixed upon the foul creatures.  bouncing from one to the other and back, he studied them with a vacant perplexity.  the two beasts were perched upon desiccated pillars so withered and corroded it was impossible to tell if they were the remains of nature or of the works of man.  to sir rupert, the pillars gave the inescapable impression of mummified remains.   the birds and their perches straddled a fork in the path, the same muddy road the knight had come.  his footprints led back away from them, into the forgotten yonder.  around his feet was the hole they had dug while he had long tarried.  as his eyes staggered back and forth, his chapped lips quivered and softly spoke, “left…right, raven…crow, red…green, left…right…” again and again.  incessantly they cawed.  first one then the other, with the rhythmic meter of a well weighted clock.  louder and louder they sounded.  quicker and quicker they went.  sir rupert’s limp face began to tighten.  his swarthy jaw grew taught as his lips drew into a sneer.  “shut up, shut up, shut up,” he thundered with all the strength he could muster.  no sooner had the curse escaped his mouth than he was buckled over with a cough, his lungs struggling to escape his chest, and thin line of spittle falling from his lips.    the birds erupted with a mocking cackle.  the sound was so cruel and menacing it brought instantly to mind the group of young princelings he had seen dropping kittens into a well.  it was wrath for wrath sake, injustice above justice.  for a moment he consider how long it had been since he stayed those few terrible days in that bohemian kingdom. his thoughts were broken by his feathered tormentors’ persistent derision.  suddenly, he realized he was as helpless as those drowning kittens.  no act, law, or man could save him.  he was in the hands of his creator, who had been decidedly absent on this long journey.  with a sigh, sir rupert let go of his philosophy, his questions, and his ambition and let his body fall to the moist earth.    when his mind again began to ramble, the birds had grown thankfully silent.  his memory cast back.  he saw the city across the shimmering lake, an emperor on a golden throne, a contract signed in blood.  he remembered the white mountains in the glistening snow.  he remembered the fair princess, her pale cheeks flushed red.  he remembered solemn oaths in whispered tongues.     then came the dark, black splashed with crimson.  it pulled him down, a vortex of despair.  struggling up from the maelstrom he broke free.  his eyes opened.  he breathed deeply and raised his body from the mud.  with eminent self-satisfaction, his avian observers chuckled quietly to themselves.    sir rupert examined his dirty hands and torn cloths.  he examined his boot once filled with blood and found it now painfully cemented to his leg.  grasping at his chest he pulled forth a silver case and removed a tattered piece of paper.  it was yellow with age, black with dirt, and scarlet with the loss of life.  sir rupert drew his hand across the cryptic runes, the cyphers, and the puzzles.  trembling, his hand stopped at the bottom of the page on the second to last figure.  i was a bird, a black bird.  one eye was red the other green.  nothing denoted size.  no clue hinted at direction.    as gloom surrounded sir rupert, the watchers purred and the light began to fade.  he tried to think.  something, something in all he had heard in the years since he had left the city, must point the way.  “had it been years?”  he cursed himself and tried to focus.  he couldn’t.  the fog around his eyes was in his brain as well.  his whine mingled with the boisterous caws of the birds.  then he felt it.    under his elbow, digging into his leg, was the contents of his pocket.  eagerly, he fished it out.  the silver circle glimmered in the failing light.  he thought of the pale hand placing the coin in his own with the promise of good fortune.  without conscious effort, the coin was flying in the air.  his mind struggled to catch up, realizing he had not decided what outcome of his gamble would mean.  then suddenly there was a drumming of wind about his head and he cowered.    a moment later he gazed up to find coin glinting in the beak of the raven now back upon his perch.  sir rupert laughed.  he fairly giggled.  the countless tragedies and hardships melted from him.  an awkward, uncanny, yet sincere smile crossed his lips.  struggling to his feet he trudged onward to the left, tipping his rusty helmet to the raven as he passed.  he felt drunk.  he was delirious with joy.    but he was called back.  sharply, he turned to meet the ruckus behind him.  the birds were ascending with damnation on their voices.  as the birds passed out of sight the coin came sparkling downward.  spiraling, the birds swarmed towards it.  after a brief and hectic ballet they sat again on their damnable posts.  except now the crow held the coin in its beak.    the crow called plaintively, pecking the coin against his perch.  sir rupert found himself instantly dazed.  he felt the fog creeping back up his ear, muddling his… his…  blankly he followed the crow’s lead and crossed the thin strip dividing the paths.  a dreadful quiver went down his spine as he heard the birds’ chorus again.  by the time they had repeated their terrible dance, sir rupert’s poor brain was overcome and ceased to exist in a meaningful way.    he was now a creature of pure emotion.  he bellowed like the wounded animal bellows to the twang of the hunters bow.  slipping and stumbling, he charged the crow.  in his madness, his hand found the hilt of his sword and raised it high.  he made a desperate swipe for the crow but found purchase only in the dismal pillar, which shattered splattering a sanguine ooze.  he whirled on the raven, throwing his sword in a frantic attack.  he never saw the sword fall.  the birds were on him.  they careened about his head, driving him back and back, farther and farther, till he stumbled and fell.  sir rupert hit the ground hard, falling through it into a darkness he had never known.    he awoke in what seemed like an instant.  like a drowning man breaking the water’s surface, he shot up.  he looked around confused.  the birds seemed distant, far away, and half forgotten.  looking about, he found no path.  looking down he found an empty silver case, an empty pocket, and an empty scabbard.  his head hung, unmoving for a long while.  eventually, he slowly

689830,"&gt; maybe because the most efficient government services, as well as the ones people forget they rely on have one thing in common: they are often largely local. [...] it's easier to be a watchdog  reality doesn't quite match up to that theory. most of the worst corruption is going on at the local level, precisely because there's not that many people paying close attention.  think about it - the president has dozens of reporters following him around and scrutinizing his every movement. in your town, there might be one local paper with one staff reporter who spends an hour a week sitting in at a town council meeting.  low level stuff is also pretty easy to get away with - i remember there was a story around here not long ago that a mayor got busted using the city's credit card to fill up his own gas tank. the only reason he got caught was because he got into a tit for tat with the also-corrupt police chief, and they basically ratted on each other. but otherwise, no one is scrutinizing the town's finances closely enough to notice stuff like that. look in any town in america and you'll find a lot of nepotism - the mayor contracting work to family and friends. or the mob. it's very hard to hold them accountable because there's simply no one looking into it that deeply.  also, and not negligibly, imho, the federal government is much more progressive on social policy than most (though not all) state governments. gays can marry in some states in the northeast, but it'll take the feds (probably the supreme court) to give equality to homosexuals throughout the country.  like you, i agree it's not black and white. the federal government does plenty of things well that no one really thinks about - the usps, the faa, the cdc and fda, to name a few that come to mind. when fema does what it's supposed to, no one notices. when brownie does a heckuva job, then we see epic complaints.  which isn't to say your larger point isn't absolutely correct - the other reply about the sugar tariffs is totally accurate. i just wanted to point out the flip side about local governments.  i think the proper solution is for more citizen-centered action groups - the aclu and eff and stuff like that. it's not worth $11 to me to save $10 on a bag of suger, but what if i get together with a million people donating $1 each to fight the sugar industry, it becomes economical.  the solution is an informed, engaged, and organized citizenry at all levels of government.",0,,

956092,"speaking from personal experience:   i live in dearborn, mi, a city that has the highest arab-american population in the u.s. the highest arabic population outside of the middle east. the majority of arab-americans that i know are hard working people who take their culture, along with their newly adopted american culture, very seriously (e.g. muslims displaying christmas trees and elaborate christmas displays).   not only have these 2nd and 3rd generation arab-americans overcame racial and religious diversity, but they also had to learn a second language so they could have a fighting chance in an english speaking country. they've come here with nothing and in a relatively short period of time, have been able to achieve a level of success...  that said, from what i have deducted from first hand conversation and observation is that african-americans do not want to be a part of the white man's culture. not ever.  james baldwin (black/homosexual author) has stated, and would probably still agree (if he were still alive) that a black man has absolutely no desire to speak, dress, or act in any way like a white person. never.   (james baldwin has also blamed african slave trade on african slave traders... but has placed the majority of the guilt on the white man for letting it happen in the first place... which sounds rather similar to ""race card logic"")  when a race collectively, but unofficially, chooses to avoid all things white, which is obviously the norm in america, said race naturally tends to limit their opportunities in the so called ""white mans world."" i used to work at a black owned and operated company. i was the only white-boy employed there; and even throughout the hard times, the owner of this company (black man) would not take on white clients, even if the pay was exceptionally good. not once.  so the real question here is how can 2nd and 3rd generation arab-americans become marginally successful in america; strive to speak the language properly; maintain successful families; remain extremely faithful to their religion; while keeping their neighborhoods very presentable and safe; and participating actively in the community as well as politically, when the majority of african-americans still can't get their shit together after all these years?  as much as we'd all love to admit it, this is not the white man's fault!!!  the race card has become a crutch, and by constantly acknowledging it, their ""wounds"" will never heal.  what? you still don't believe me, whitey?   next time you have a conversation with a black person pay attention to how long it takes before they explain the difference between black people and white people. pay attention to how your ""white"" voice is being mocked. listen carefully for baiting questions that may or may not out you as a potential racist... but most of all, pay attention to how long it takes before an african-american will awkwardly announce their blackness, ""i'm black!""  we're not colorblind, we just don't care anymore.   also, i know this is coming so let me just clear the air here:  (1) i'm not now, nor have i ever been a racist  (2) my views aren't racist, but i'm sure some idiots could possibly twist them to be perceived as such  (3) i'm a 3rd generation italian-america, my grandparents came over to this country with absolutely nothing. they learned the language, they worked very hard, and while my grandparents do in fact have a light complexion, none of my relatives [or any of their relatives for that matter] have ever owned slaves. they did, however, live under the rule of a fascist dictator.

225335,"the florescent bathroom lights give off an annoying hum.  the kind of hum that could really get under your skin and make you prefer being in the dark.  she hunches over the sink, splashing cold water on her face and feeling the relieving cold sting on her hot eyes.  she wishes she could fill the sink with ice and water and dunk her entire face into it, but this will have to do.  she wipes the excess water from her eyes and reaches for a cheap brown paper towel, which feels like sandpaper on her now sensitive skin.  she stares at her own reflection in the dirty mirror, focusing so hard on the sallow, yellow tone that her skin has taken on under the bright bluish light that she has to blink to adjust her eyes back.  she barely recognizes the reflection and wonders if that is what people really see when they look at her.   she doesn't want to leave the dirty gas station bathroom.  it feels like she's been in there for at least 20 minutes, and god knows what people out there must be thinking.  she looks at the door and begins to cry again, but catches herself mid sob with a deep breath, letting the air back out with a long, drawn out ""ahhhh"".   one more splash of water, and then she'll leave.  stepping out the door, she looks around for anyone who might have been waiting for the restroom.  there is nobody.  the cold, light drizzling rain can only be seen by the bright outdoor lights in contrast to the black sky.   she walks slowly around the side of the brick building, part of her thinking- hoping -that he will be gone when she walks around the corner.  she could handle losing her car to him right now, and although she knows she would be furious about it later, right now is all she really cares about.  and right now she doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want to have to talk to him.  as she nears the corner, she feels the slight sting of disappointment as she begins to see the back corner of her blue cavalier.  he's still here.  she walks toward the car, head down- trying not to look at him, and wondering if he is looking at her.  she looks longingly at brightly lit convenience store and wishes she had some cash to get some cigarettes.  she doesn't want anything from him, but he has all the cash and all of the cigarettes.  she won't take anything from him- not now.  she gets in the car and adjusts herself into the seat, looking as stone faced as possible.   her awkwardness is apparent.   she stares out the passenger side window, and wishes she had something to do with her hands.  ""you okay?"" he asks tenderly.  thirty minutes has past, but the contrast in his tone from then to now is remarkable.  she wonders how one person can be so different is such a short span of time.  ""yeah"" she answers quietly.  ""please look at me"" he says.  she chokes back tears once again as she turns her head reluctantly toward him.  he barely gets out ""i love you so much"" before she breaks eye contact with him and pans the car interior.  she stares for a moment at the crack in the middle of the black dashboard.  how will she explain this? she wonders.  for a moment her anger is overwhelming.  this is her car; she has paid for it for the past seventeen months.  who is he to put a big old crack in her dashboard?  it's just one more thing she can't afford to fix.  ""hey."" he breaks her concentration by grabbing her hand and kneading it with his.  ""we can get through this.  i don't know what's wrong with me…i mean, it's just…i'm fucked up."" he has said that before.   every time he says it she wants to scream, but she doesn't make a sound.  she closes her eyes and wishes he would just say the right thing, although she doesn't know what that is.  she thinks she wants him to say he's sorry, but isn't even sure that it would make this better.  the only thing, she thinks, that would make this better is if i weren't here, if he wasn't here, if none of this had happened.  how can she go back now? back to how they were an hour ago when their life together was real and good.  i keeps her eyes closed, hoping that when she opens them, he's gone.  she opens her eyes and looks at his hand that is still holding hers.  his middle and index knuckles are cracked and swollen.  she can tell he's wiped off the blood, and notices her gray tee shirt crumpled in his lap, with dark spots and streaks all over it.  great, she thinks, one more thing he's ruined.  they both sit there in silence for a moment, before he gives up on conversation and puts the car in reverse.  as the car lets off the familiar whirl of manual reverse, she thinks about the term 'cut the tension with a knife', and wishes she had a chainsaw right now.  ""ya know…"" he says, but doesn't say anything else. "" fuck it."" he says a minute later, and she wonders whether he was talking about what he was going to say, or about them.  the only thing she wants to do is disappear.  she is growing more and more uncomfortable in the passenger seat, like her body doesn't fit right into the seat that seemed to fit fine just an hour ago.  she realizes that she is positioning herself as close to the passenger side window as possible, and as far away as possible from him.  her eyes sting and the skin around her eyes feels like it's on fire.  the car turns back onto the dark small town road.  she doesn't even know what town they are in.  she knows that she was grateful to see an open gas station, even if it was one of those places you wouldn't normally walk into because it seems to be too busy for 3 am. ""what can i do to make it better?"" he says as he settles back into driving, as if the last 40 minutes were just some glitch in time, and now that they were back on the road, normal life can proceed.  she doesn't know what to say, and she whispers "" i don't know"".  ""what?"" he asks sweetly. "" i don't know"" she says, louder this time, and with more authority than anything else she has said in months.  she wishes she had an answer, but she doesn't.  she doesn't want to tell him anything, but even if she did, she wouldn't know what to say.  there are some many things she knows she should say- things she would tell her friend to say if they were in this situation.   she suddenly felt like a hypocrite, but quickly decided that she didn't care.  she's not that person, not that girl, and her situation was different.  he isn't some monster, some piece of shit drug addict.  he's really very good to her, most of the time.  she begins to think about what life would be like without him, and she begins to miss him.  she is dreading the idea of being alone, and while she is unsure that she would really miss him, her mind begins to drift to thoughts of being without him.  being alone again is something she just doesn't want to do… all those lonely nights before they met.  all those desperate hours wanting to be loved by someone, and filling in the loneliest times with someone who would only stay until the sun came up.  she hated that life, and the idea of going back to it makes her shutter to shake away the thoughts.  ""it can't happen again…. i mean… i can't go through this again.  i don't know how to fix it, but… i just can't.""  she stammers.  "" it won't."" he says, "" it will never happen again, i can promise you that.  i swear"".  he reaches for her hand, which she unclenches to let his fingers around to her palm.  she pulls her away from her face with her right hand and he holds tight to her left.  her eyes shift to the steering wheel.    he moves his head forward to met her eyes. "" i love you so much, baby."" he says.  she faints a smile and asks "" can i have a cigarette?""",1,0,0

484228,"these bastards are guilty as hell. think of all the harm they've done to innocent children, and the iraq. to top it all off, they're not taking the gravity of their situation serious. they should be a shamed.  which is what the media will make of this ridiculousness. they will hold the heads of these four high above the crowd, who will cheer and bray for their belief that the men who they have been told are their enemies have fallen. meanwhile, these four will become martyrs on the altar of rationale and justice, as any conviction they receive is surely non-congruent with extant copyright law in their state.  unfortunately, people never learn. convicting, crucifying or otherwise defaming an innocent party never helps your cause in the long term. unless, of course, you control the media. ah.",0,,
191212,"samesies.  i fucking love jersey shore, and i'm watching the marathon right now.  but i'm 21, and i love to laugh at it and how ridiculous everyone is.  these people crack me up.  but if i were 12, i don't know how i'd be responding.  it definitely wouldn't have been appropriate for my 12 year old self.  op, try to do something about your sister watching it, if you can.  she shouldn't be watching it, for reals.  too much vulgarity, inappropriate sexual situations, and way too much idiocy.",0,,
884326,"i'm a licensed esthetician and makeup artist, though my focus is primarily corrective makeup and scar remediation. hope this helps:  1. rimmel actually has a decent stay matte powder that's like $5. you can try that for setting powder. i advise investing in some decent makeup brushes more than anything. good ones that don't lose hairs on your face and keep their shape will make applying makeup much easier. you can get okay ones in a drugstore (eco tools, london something or other...those are fine to start).  2. for eye shadow, think of the color wheel in art. if you want to make your eye color stand out, go with shades that are opposite your eye color, or that pick up flecks of color in your eye. peach/copper/raisin shades will make most eye colors stand out one way or another, but work especially well with blue eyes. otherwise, find some good nude/neutral shades that work with your skintone. looking at your pics, i would look for a chocolate brown, warm taupe, and pinkish nude to try first. i think l'oreal and revlon have eye shadow quads that would work.  3. what mascara you get will depend on what you need and what look you're going for. if you want a natural look, maybelline full n' soft is the gold standard. otherwise you'll need to decide if you want lengthening, thickening, etc. l'oreal voluminous is a classic all around sort of mascara. i think neutrogena makes a natural lash tint as well, something that just colors lashes and doesn't add any volume or length. you can play at a clinique counter, too, clinique is one of the less pricey department store lines and the makeup is quite good. clinique naturally glossy mascara is probably my all time favorite.  4. there's a site by a makeup artist, inmykit.com, where he reviews makeup and talks about what makeup artists like and why. you would do well to poke around there.  5. there are loads of books about makeup, if you want to learn take a trip to the library or poke around amazon and get a hold of a few. the bobbi brown ones are best for natural look, eve pearl for corrective techniques, kevyn aucoin for creative stuff. you can also grab a copy of allure magazine. it's very much about makeup and product reviews, more than other fashion mags.  6. once you've got the basics, it's trial and error. fortunately, it washes off, so it's easy to play with.  7. grab some good eye makeup remover, the ""simple"" brand at the drug store is pretty good for inexpensive stuff, and old fashioned pond's cold cream will take off pretty much anything. it feels like rose-scented crisco, but it is the shit for taking off the long-wear and waterproof stuff.  8. i don't think your foundation is too light, but it's hard to tell in photos. anyway, you don't have to worry about your foundation being too light so much as you have to worry about it actually matching your skin. this is hard to test with drugstore stuff because you don't know until you get it home, but what you do is dab some along your jawline and look at it in natural light. if it's a match it should be almost invisible on your skin, like it should fade into your skin. if you want to add color to your face, play with bronzers and blushes. you can even buy a darker shade of face powder and use it like bronzer (apply lightly to where the sun would hit your face, there are tutorials for bronzing and shading and highlighting all over the internet). if you have pale skin, you have to be careful with bronzers because a lot of them are very orange or muddy looking on pale skin, but there are some out there that will work. i like too faced snow bunny bronzer and tf bronzing veil, myself, but you'll have to try things to see what works for you.  9. youtube is your bff. there are loads of tutorial videos that people put up for all kinds of makeup and hairstyling.   editing to add #10: don't mess with your eyebrows too much. you can get them shaped professionally for under $30 if you really want to do anything to them, then keep that shape up by cleaning up with a good pair of tweezers (tweezerman at the drugstore). but don't shave them off or over-tweeze them. over-tweeze and they might not grow back, and shaving them just looks goofy/trashy. the cost of getting them shaped/waxed varies by area, but around here it averages about $22. totally worth it not to ruin your brows, i promise. i over-tweezed mine before i went to beauty school, and i deeply regret it. they grow back in patches, i'm stuck with the shape i have, which is too thin. learn from my mistake. :)  and #11: for the acne: use a very gentle cleanser (cerave makes a couple of decent ones, a creamy one and a foaming one), and find a lotion or treatment with salicylic acid if you aren't allergic to aspirin (clearasil ultra pads are decent drugstore product). use a sunscreen, too (cerave again). uv rays can make the hyperpigmentation (dark marks) left behind by breakouts worse. most excellent spot treatment is a drying lotion, like mario badescu drying lotion, d'arcy, or bye bye blemish. it looks like calamine lotion, but is the best thing for drying up a zit, it has salicylic acid, zinc, and sulfur, which is like a magic combination. you may also want to try a different birth control formula, some actually help control acne (yaz/yasmin, but others too).",0,,

""lets store the files under %windir%"", ""i can save all my configuration stuff in the registry - hklm looks good"", etc.   i'm no fan of vista, but the amount of hand waving about the evils of uac is quite frustrating. there are a rather limited number of cases where it will bite you, they were well documented in advance of vista's release, and recommended practices have been evading the problem set for quite a long while in advance of it as well. that said, it's quite comical how many of ms' own tools and shell operations will needlessly trip it.",0,,

193357,"understanding obama: the making of a fuehrer     by ali sina      i must confess i was not impressed by sen. barack obama from the first time i saw him. at first i was excited to see a black candidate. he looked youthful, spoke well, appeared to be confident – a wholesome presidential package. i was put off soon, not just because of his shallowness but also because there was an air of haughtiness in his demeanor that was unsettling. his posture and his body language were louder than his empty words. obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in american history. never a politician in this land had such a quasi 'religious' impact on so many people. the fact that obama is a total incognito with zero accomplishment, makes this inexplicable infatuation alarming. obama is not an ordinary man. he is not a genius. in fact he is quite ignorant on most important subjects. barack obama is a narcissist. dr. sam vaknin, the author of the malignant self love, also believes, 'barack obama appears to be a narcissist.'        vaknin is a world authority on narcissism. he understands narcissism and describes the inner mind of a narcissist like no other person. when he talks about narcissism everyone listens. vaknin says that obama's language, posture and demeanor, and the testimonies of his closest, dearest and nearest suggest that the senator is either a narcissist or he may have narcissistic personality disorder (npd).        narcissists project a grandiose but false image of themselves. jim jones, the charismatic leader of people's temple, the man who led over 900 of his followers to cheerfully commit mass suicide and even murder their own children was also a narcissist. david koresh, charles manson, joseph koni, shoko asahara, stalin, saddam, mao, kim jong ill and adolph hitler are a few examples of narcissists of our time. all these men had a tremendous influence over their fanciers. they created a personality cult around themselves and with their blazing speeches elevated their admirers' souls, filled their hearts with enthusiasm and instilled in their minds a new zest for life. they gave them hope! they promised them the moon, but alas, invariably they brought them to their doom. when you are a victim of a cult of personality, you don't know it until it is too late.        one determining factor in the development of npd is childhood abuse. 'obama's early life was decidedly chaotic and replete with traumatic and mentally bruising dislocations,' says vaknin. 'mixed-race marriages were even less common then. his parents went through a divorce when he was an infant (two years old). obama saw his father only once again, before he died in a car accident. then, his mother re-married and obama had to relocate to indonesia : a foreign land with a radically foreign culture, to be raised by a step-father. at the age of ten, he was whisked off to live with his maternal (white) grandparents. he saw his mother only intermittently in the following few years and then she vanished from his life in 1979. she died of cancer in 1995.'        one must never underestimate the manipulative genius of pathological narcissists. they project such an imposing personality that it overwhelms those around them. charmed by the charisma of the narcissist, people become like clay in his hands. they cheerfully do his bidding and delight to be at his service. the narcissist shapes the world around himself and reduces others in his own inverted image. he creates a cult of personality. his admirers become his co-dependents.        narcissists have no interest in things that do not help them to reach their personal objective. they are focused on one thing alone and that is power. all other issues are meaningless to them and they do not want to waste their precious time on trivialities. anything that does not help them is beneath them and do not deserve their attention. if an issue raised in the senate does not help obama in one way or another, he has no interest in it. the 'present' vote is a safe vote. no one can criticize him if things go wrong. why should he implicate himself in issues that may become controversial when they don't help him personally? those issues are unworthy by their very nature because they are not about him.        obama's election as the first black president of the harvard law review led to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations. the university of chicago law school provided him with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. the book took him a lot longer than expected and at the end it devolved into…, guess what? his own autobiography! instead of writing a scholarly paper focusing on race relations, for which, he had been paid, obama could not resist writing about his most sublime self. he entitled the book dreams from my father .        not surprisingly, adolph hitler also wrote his own autobiography when he was still nobody. so did stalin. for a narcissist no subject is as important as his own self. why would he waste his precious time and genius writing about insignificant things when he can write about such an august being as himself?     narcissists are often callous and even ruthless. as the norm, they lack conscience. this is evident from obama's lack of interest in his own brother who lives on only one dollar per month. a man who lives in luxury, who takes a private jet to vacation in hawaii, and who has raised nearly half a billion dollars for his campaign (something unprecedented in history) has no interest in the plight of his own brother. why? because, his brother cannot be used for his ascent to power. a narcissist cares for no one but himself.        this election is like no other in the history of america . the issues are insignificant compared to what is at stake. what can be more dangerous than having a man bereft of conscience, a serial liar, and one who cannot distinguish his fantasies from reality as the leader of the free world?        i hate to sound alarmist, but one must be a fool if one is not alarmed. many politicians are narcissists. they pose no threat to others.. they are simply self serving and selfish. obama evinces symptoms of pathological narcissism, which is different from the run-of-the-mill narcissism of a richard nixon or a bill clinton, for example. to him reality and fantasy are intertwined. this is a mental health issue, not just a character flaw. pathological narcissists are dangerous because they look normal and even intelligent. it is this disguise that makes them treacherous.        today the democrats have placed all their hopes in obama. but this man could put an end to their party. the great majority of blacks have also decided to vote for obama. only a fool does not know that their support for him is racially driven.       let us call a spade a spade. this is racism, pure and simple. the truth is that while everyone carries a misconceived collective guilt towards the blacks for wrongs done centuries ago by a bygone people to a bygone people, the blacks carry a collective rancor, enmity or vendetta towards non-blacks and to this day want to 'stand up' to the white man.. they seem to be stuck in 19th century.        the downside of this is that if obama turns out to be the disaster i predict, he will cause widespread resentment among the whites. the blacks are unlikely to give up their support of their man. cultic mentality is pernicious and unrelenting. they will dig their heads deeper in the sand and blame obama's detractors of racism. this will cause a backlash among the whites. the white supremacists will take advantage of the discontent and they will receive widespread support. i predict that in less than four years, racial tensions will increase to levels never seen since the turbulent 1960s. obama will set the clock back decades… america is the bastion of freedom. the peace of the world depends on the strength of america , and its weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations. it is no wonder that ahmadinejad, hugo chavez, the castrists, the hezbollah, the hamas, the lawyers of the guantanamo terrorists and virtually all sworn enemies of america are so thrilled by the prospect of their man in the white house. america is on the verge of destruction. there is no insanity greater than electing a pathological narcissist as president.",0,,

273731,"a new poem (well, actually, a remake of an old poem) dedicated to the hon. sen. larry craig:  edgar allan poe the maiden   once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently raping, raping at my chamber stall. `'tis some visitor,' i muttered, `raping at my chamber stall - only this, and nothing more.'  ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december, and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. eagerly i wished the morrow; - vainly i had sought to borrow from my pants surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost craignor - for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named craignor - nameless here for evermore.  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me - filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i sat repeating `'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber stall - some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber stall; - this it is, and nothing more,'  presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, `officer,' said i, `or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was crapping, and so gently you came raping, and so faintly you came peeking, peeking in my chamber stall, that i scarce was sure i heard you' - here i opened wide the stall; - darkness there, and nothing more.  deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `craignor!' this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, `craignor!' merely this and nothing more.  back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon again i heard a raping somewhat louder than before. `surely,' said i, `surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore - let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; - 'tis the wind and nothing more!'  open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately maiden of the saintly days of yore. not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber stall - perched upon a bust of phallus just above my chamber stall - perched, and sat, and nothing more.  then this ebony gal beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance he wore, `though thy breast be shorn and shaven, thou,' i said, `art sure no maiden. ghastly grim and ancient maiden wandering from the nightly shore - tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!' quoth the maiden, `give me more.'  much i marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning - little relevancy bore; for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing gal above his chamber stall - man or beast above the sculptured bust above his chamber stall, with such name as `give me more.'  but the maiden, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only, that one phrase, as if his soul in that one phrase he did outpour. nothing further then he uttered - not a pinkie then he fluttered - till i scarcely more than muttered `other friends have flown before - on the morrow will he leave me, as my hopes have flown before.' then the maiden said, `give me more.'  startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, `doubtless,' said i, `what it utters is its only stock and store, caught from some unhappy master whom unhealthful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore - till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of ""give me – give me more.""'  but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, straight i wheeled a padded seat in front of gal and bust and door; then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous gal of yore - what this grim, ungainly, gaunt, and ominous gal of yore meant in croaking `give me more.'  this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er, but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, he shall press, ah, more and more!  then, me thought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tiled floor. `wretch,' i cried, `thy god hath lent thee - by these angels he has sent thee respite - respite and nepenthe from thy memories of craignor! quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost craignor!' quoth the maiden, `give me more.'  `prophet!' said i, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if fowl or devil! - whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted - on this home by horror haunted - tell me truly, i implore - is there - is there balm in gilead? - tell me - tell me, i implore!' quoth the maiden, `give me more.'  `prophet!' said i, `thing of evil! - prophet still, if fowl or devil! by that heaven that bends above us - by that god we both adore - tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant prison, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels named craignor - clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels named craignor?' quoth the maiden, `give me more.'  `be that word our sign of parting, love or fiend!' i shrieked upstarting - `get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore! leave no finger print as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my stall! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my stall!' quoth the maiden, `give me more.'  and the maiden, never flirting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of phallus just above my chamber stall; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, and the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my card from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted - nevermore!

927161,"it was dennismethod, after an episode of ""it's always sunny in philadelphia.""  shortly after making the account, i realized the actual title was ""dennissystem"", and my decision to delete the account was a combination of people constantly telling me that on reddit, and my (ex)-girlfriend getting pissed off that i was on /r/thick because it made her self-conscious.  so i'm all like ""fine, watch me fucking delete it.""  needless to say, i made this account immediately after that, and it has served me well.  you know, it's funny, i've always noticed that ""ya can't spell 'basement' without 'semen"" but i've never noticed it in ""advertisements"" until now.  i figured from the get-go that your story was one designed explicitly for turning into something perverted, but i never realized there were *that* many layers.  shit.  **edit**-  for those of you keeping score at home:  many years ago i created, developed, perfected and marketed wiggly® brand semen -- the richest, creamiest, wiggliest semen in the south.  i made the semen myself; the first experimental batch i made in the bathtub turned out chunky and too yellow. after that (and following my wife's accident), i was forced to move my semen lab down to the basement. it was trial and error for the first couple of months as i tried to find new and exciting ways to improve and invigorate semen. but once i perfected it and got it just right it was beautiful. so thick you could lay on it. i knew i had created a semen that would go far beyond being a condiment for food. the applications of wiggly® brand semen would be endless...  i bottled it in mason jars and sold it out of my home. once word of mouth about my mouthwatering semen spread all around town, i started selling it at the farmer's market. soon i had the grocers and druggists begging me to let them sell my semen. that meant i had to make much more semen.  during the summer months i recruited some strapping young interns from the schoolhouse. i couldn't pay those young lads much (a dollar a day plus all the semen they could carry home in their pockets) but i was able to give them the one thing they wanted most: sense of accomplishment. for me, it was more than just male bonding and semen in my sweltering hot basement. that was probably the best summer of their lives.  soon i worked out a distribution deal with piggly wiggly supermarkets to test out wiggly® brand semen at half a dozen of their stores in tennessee and kentucky. they were even going to let me slather advertisements all over their stores from the windows to the walls. unfortunately, the big boys of semen -- hellmann's, blueplate, duke's, zippy's, gold medal and, of course, the behemoth of them all: kraft and their vile miracle jizz -- ran me out of town.  the big food companies pretty much dictate how much supermarket shelf space is made available for all products, not just their own. especially semen! i got about six inches on the bottom shelf, barely enough space for a single jar-wide row, and close enough to the floor where the cleaning crew's floor scrubbers and waxers would dirty up my semen mason jars on a nightly basis.  i never had a fighting chance. i only sold a few cases and after just three months piggly wiggly sent me packing. that was the beginning of the end. the dark days of semen had come. i still make semen for my own consumption and for gifts (look out secret santa!) but i'm out of the semen selling business for good. too many bad semen memories.  those were the golden days of semen, long before semen culture was sullied by cheap gimmicks like light semen, vegenaise (who could love you?), and wide-mouth jars. back then it was about the semen. ask me anything about my semen business or about semen in general. i consider myself an expert on the subject. i'll even share my semen inclusive recipes (like my triple fudge semen cake made with real semen!). semen has limitless uses beyond food. ask me about what semen can do for you.",0,,

337939,"&gt; contact is a form of communication. if an alien race were (for example) a race of extreme contactiphobes, they wouldn't have contacted us and they would intentionally be staying away from us. astronomically unlikely that they all would independantly decide to, admittedly, but possible.  no, **impossible**. the notion that a powerful type-ii civilization is going to be ""scared"" of some primitive savage barely intelligent species is the ravings of paranoid schizophrenic madmen. is there any sane person on earth that's scared of stepping on an ant? a civilization can't be successful if it's made up of witless retards afraid of their own shadows. the buddhist idiots who are afraid of stepping on an ant are not the people who build factories, engines, ships, bridges, highways, tunnels and machines the size of an appartment building. your hypothetical ""contactophobes"" will achieve *nothing*, amount to *nothing* and will end up *being* nothing. they would hole up on their own planet until someone bigger and meaner came along and crushed them like ants.  &gt; wow - apparently we have been contacted. how else are you sufficiently knowledgeable to make definitive statements about their sociopolitical and technological makeup?  the stupid can't fathom the workings of genius.  &gt; see my point about the drake equation - if there aren't any (or ""very many"") other races, the probability of your being correct drops fast.  &gt; you're blithely assuming that there are a huge number of other races in the galaxy, and that's baseless assumption.  no you retard. i assume that there's roughly one dominant technological species **per galaxy**. in the milky way, *we are it*. and we know this because we don't see any expanding sphere of stars winking out as the aliens are building their dyson spheres. which means that the probability the aliens exist, evolved to intelligence *simultaneously* with us just on a completely different planet, is ludicrously small. you see, if the aliens were staking their claim on the milky way right here and now, this would have been a phenomenally improbable event. but for them to be co-evolving with us is beyond phenomenally improbable. and that's why i don't believe they exist, not anywhere in our galaxy. not anywhere in our (past) light-cone. in contrast, you and every other believer in ftl believes there can only be one dominant technological species in the entire fucking universe. if stupidity had mass, the amount of stupidity you must have to believe we are the only technological species in the entire fucking universe would be enough to cause the universe to implode.  &gt; it demonstrates perfectly quite how many things we don't have a freaking clue about... and if only one of those terms is close to zero then there simply won't be other life currently around.  and if only we could repeal gravity we could float to the moon.  &gt; leave it alone and recognise the inhabitants' de facto ownership of the land?  yeah, so if there was a new (habitable!) island in the middle of the pacific, we wouldn't want to set up house on it at all. we'd be happy to ""recognize"" the ferns' and gulls' and fungus' and grasses' ""ownership of the land"", yeah? i don't bloody fucking think so. you can whine about all the gulls and blades of grass we would be ""murdering"" but you know what that makes you? an idiot eco-zealot. a member of a sub-species of humanity to be exterminated.  &gt; assuming, of course, that the whole civilisation isn't actively hunting down the individual to stop them. that would tend to put a dampener on any attempt to start a runaway exponential-growth civilisation of your own.  the notion that we are the only technological civilization in the entire fucking universe is too contemptible to deal with. so i will hereby do away with ftl and assume that the speed of light is a hard limit. as soon as you do that, that is *join us in fucking reality*, it becomes obvious that an interstellar (and in fact even inter-planetary) civilization cannot maintain a homogeneous culture. due to the constraint of the speed of light. hence what you are proposing *violates the laws of physics*.  &gt; indeed, but how long is an iteration? oh right - because, again, the numbers drop fast.  because you're a cretin imbecile. do you know how long it takes for an ai to reproduce? on the order of seconds. and every technological civilization will become an ai civilization. rational accomodation of the laws of physics dictates this.  &gt; note also that your simplistic model totally ignores the concept of cost of travel via ftl  that's because cost is a function of labour you witless cretin. as for resource consumption, even if a civilization had to consume a giant star every time it engaged the ftl drive, it would still be worth doing it.  &gt; of opposition to the unchecked expansionism  cretin. imbecile. as if there will never, ever be defectors to a prisoner's dilemma which involves every other party's annihilation.  &gt; unless, for example, the universe has already been filled and they're just avoiding us  paranoid schizophrenic!  &gt; inevitably warlike nature of advanced species  warlike?! it isn't fucking warlike to ""annihilate"" a million blades of grass. what next, are you gonna grieve the ""holocaust of the ants"" every time someone destroys a colony?!  &gt; or the possibility that any of the other applicable terms in the drake equation (intelligence, willingness to communicate, species lifespan) doesn't mean that there's currently effectively nobody out there to find us.  cretin. imbecile.  &gt; why not sun-scoops, collecting particles form the solar wind/interstellar space, or even extracting matter/antimatter particle-pairs out of nothing?  you fucking cretin. why not abolish the law of thermodynamics while you're at it?!  &gt; intelligent, expansionist, contactiphile life is common in the universe (where ""common"" may only be a few distinct races, but well-spread and established),  yeah, and maybe they all wear mickey mouse pajamas. &lt;puke&gt;  &gt; intelligent life will continue to develop technologically but nor morally or ethically one iota beyond where we are now,  i'm *as moral as it gets* and i don't consider you an intelligent person worth preserving. damned schizophrenic.  &gt; no basis for assertion.  magical thinkers tend to do stupid unpredictable stuff. like start wars, try to destroy the planet, or try to destroy the species. of course they will be eliminated!  &gt; no definition of ""magical thinkers"".  ""someone who thinks magically"".  &gt; no relevance to discussion?  has all kinds of relevance on all kinds of levels. including the meta-level where i consider you a magical thinker for weeping over the ""holocaust of grass"". watch me with my lawnmower. heil the fuhrer! go on, heil me! watch me mow the lawn as millions of blades of grass scream!  so at that level of relevance, it's really a complete waste of my time to be talking to you since you apparently are a magical thinker incapable of grasping concepts such as exponential growth, improbably unstable situations, and the distinction between ""murder"" and stepping on an ant.  &gt; ever hear ""one datapoint does not make a trend""?  ever hear stupid people need to die? you must have, you've run into my comments often enough.  &gt; to claim the invalidity of another speculative theory   what other ""speculative theory""?! you're trying to claim that ftl, which **violates physics as we know it**, is on equal standards with everything we know about physics?! off with your head!!  in fact, there are entirely sober arguments involving meta-probabilities which enable us to discount the possibility of encountering other civilizations at our stage of development. i have alluded to such but never brought them up. because you're too dumb to understand them. you're not curious enough about truth to be willing to listen. you have your own idiotic notions of a star trek universe which you'll cling to regardless of the facts. and that makes you not worth talking to. not seriously at any rate. hence the insults which are the only means of indicating my deep displeasure and sometimes injecting a modicum of entertainment in this tedious conversation.",0,,

(sometimes this works in reverse, when features get in the way of either speed or bulk, but every relatively mainstream os will provide a command console.)  the command console used to be so ingrained within ms that autoexec.bat etc was run directly from the cmd line. i can't remember if win98 or win2k was the first operating system to completely detach itself. nevertheless, many applications still run programs within the command line- can you imagine trying to install some programs without it?",0,,

275451,"...second reply while drunk...  i decided to go ahead and post this recipe while i remember.  hopefully no one is offended that i am basically copying verbatim lepard's recipe.  although if interested, it is from [the cook's book](http://product.half.ebay.com/the-cooks-book_w0qqtgzinfoqqprz46575141), which is an absolutely excellent culinary tutorial.  so anyway...  for the initial mixture:  4 tsp unbleached white or whole-wheat high-gluten bread flour or rye flour  2 tsp live plain yogurt  3 1/2 tbsp water at 65-68 degrees f  1 tbsp organic raisins (optional, provides more sugar for the yeast)  *for the daily refreshment*  unbleached white or whole-wheat high-gluten bread flour or rye flour, depending on what bread you want to make.  step one:  measure all the ingredients for the initial mixture into a one pint jar with a lid and stir them together vigorously with a fork.  cover the jar with it's lid, then leave for a day at room temperature.  step two:  the next day, bacteria and yeasts will have begun to multiply, yet all you will see is a glassy layer of liquid over the solid matter.  measure 4 tsp of your chosen flour and 3 1/2 tbsp water into the jar, stir vigorously, and replace the lid.  leave again until the following day.  step 3:  on day 3, look for the odd tiny bubble on the surface of the mixture.  this is the beginning of fermentation.  again, add 4 tsp flour and 3 1/2 tbsp water to the jar, stir vigorously, and replace the lid.  leave until the following day.  step 4:  by day 4, the mixture will be getting energetic and will benefit from a higher ratio of new ingredients to old leaven.  stir the mixture, then tip three-fourths to four-fifths out (throw this away).  add about 1/2 cup (100g) water to the jar.  stir vigorously, then add 3/4 cup (100g) flour and stir vigorously again.  the mixture will look like a thick batter.  replace the lid and leave until the following day.  step 5:  on day 5, bubble of fermentation will appear on the surface.  repeat the procedure followed on day 4, then put the lid back on and leave until the following day.  step 6:  from day 6 on, the mixture will be able to raise a dough, but it will take many more times for complex flavors to emerge.  repeat the day-4 procedure each day for the following 2-4 days.  you will notice the aroma becoming sharper every day.  after 8-10 days, you will have a healthy leaven that you can use.  *for the actual bread*  4 oz natural leaven (above)  7/8 cup water at 72f  1 tsp fine sea salt  2 1/2 cups unbleached high-gluten bread flour  olive oil   step 1:  early in the morning, combine leaven and water, mixing it with your fingers.  in a large bowl, mix the salt with the flour, stirring well with a spoon.  step 2:  tip the leaven mixture into the flour and, using your hands, mix it quickly and evenly to make a soft, sticky dough.  cover the bowl and leave for 10 minutes.  the dough temperature should be about 68f (20c).  step 3:  spoon 1-2 tsp oil onto the top of the dough and rub it all over the surface.  turn the bowl over and scrape the dough onto an oiled surface.  knead the dough, repeating after 10 and 20 minutes, then cover and leave it for 30 minutes at room temp.  step 4:  fold the dough by thirds, and repeat this every hour for 3-4 hours.  each time, return it either to a bowl or tray, seam side down, and cover.  at the three hour mark, cut a deep slash into the surface of the dough to check the aeration.  if you can see a good network of air bubbles, it can be shaped.  step 5:  line a basket or bowl with a dish towl rubbed thickly with rye flour.  shape the dough into a round loaf or a baton.  place it seam side up in the towel, cover, and let rise until almost doubled in height.   step 6:  preheat the oven to 425f (220c).  sprinkle a little semolina or flour on a baking sheet (i use the stone here), then place the dough onto it, rounded side up.  slash the surface of the loaf, then lightly spray it with water.  bake for 20 minutes.  reduce the heat to 375f (190c) and continue baking until the loaf is golden brown and feels light in weight, 15-20 minutes longer.  step 7:  let the bread cool on a wire rack.  when cool, wrap in wax or parchment paper and store in a bread box.     *end*  anyway, this recipe is awesome, and the book is awesome.  everyone should buy it.",0,,

949181,"if i recall correctly, the last time i made jc's version it came out pretty strong - perhaps i over-reduced the sauce, i can't say for sure. i think i've had better luck with the cook's illustrated version overall, i can't link to it so i'll try to post it here. also, i've taken to foregoing the pearl onions - my family just haven't cared for them in general.  *****  beef burgundy  serves 6.   published january 1, 2001.    if you cannot find salt pork, thick-cut bacon can be substituted. cut it crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces and treat it just as you would salt pork, but note that you will have no rind to include in the vegetable and herb bouquet. boiled potatoes are the traditional accompaniment, but mashed potatoes or buttered noodles are nice as well.   ingredients  **beef braise**  6	ounces salt pork , trimmed of rind, rind reserved, and salt pork cut into 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch by 1-inch pieces  10	sprigs fresh parsley leaves , torn into quarters  6	sprigs fresh thyme  2	 medium onions , chopped coarse  2	 medium carrots , chopped coarse  1	medium head garlic , cloves separated and crushed but unpeeled  2	 bay leaves , crumbled  1/2	teaspoon whole black peppercorns  1/2	ounce dried porcini mushrooms , rinsed (optional)  4 - 4 1/4	pounds beef chuck roast , cut into large chunks measuring about 1 1/2 to 2 inches.  4	tablespoons unsalted butter , cut into 4 pieces  1/3	cup unbleached all-purpose flour  1 3/4	cups canned low-sodium chicken broth  1	bottle red burgundy wine (750 ml) or pinot noir  1	teaspoon tomato paste  **onion and mushroom garnish**  36	 frozen pearl onions (about 7 ounces)  1	tablespoon unsalted butter  1	tablespoon granulated sugar  1/2	teaspoon table salt  10	ounces white mushrooms , whole if small, halved if medium, quartered if large  2	tablespoons brandy  3	tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves   instructions  1. bring salt pork, reserved salt pork rind, and 3 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. boil 2 minutes, then drain well.  2. cut two 22-inch lengths cheesecloth. wrap parsley, thyme, onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, porcini mushrooms, and blanched salt pork rind in cheesecloth and set in 8-quart nonreactive dutch oven. adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.  3. set 12-inch skillet with salt pork over medium heat; sauté until lightly brown and crisp, about 12 minutes. remove with slotted spoon to dutch oven; pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat and reserve. season beef with salt and pepper. increase heat to high and brown half of beef in single layer, turning once or twice, until deep brown, about 7 minutes; transfer browned beef to dutch oven. pour 1/2 cup water into skillet and scrape pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits; when pan bottom is clean, pour liquid into dutch oven.  4. return skillet to high heat and add 2 teaspoons reserved pork fat;

when pan bottom is clean, pour liquid into dutch oven.  5. set now-empty skillet over medium heat; add butter. when foaming subsides, whisk in flour until evenly moistened and pasty. cook, whisking constantly, until mixture has toasty aroma and resembles light-colored peanut butter, about 5 minutes. gradually whisk in chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups water; increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened. pour mixture into dutch oven. add 3 cups wine, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste to dutch oven and stir to combine. set dutch oven over high heat and bring to boil. cover and set pot in oven; cook until meat is tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  6. remove dutch oven from oven and, using tongs, transfer vegetable and herb bouquet to strainer set over pot. press out liquid into pot and discard bouquet. with slotted spoon, remove beef to medium bowl; set aside. allow braising liquid to settle about 15 minutes, then, with wide shallow spoon, skim fat off surface and discard.  7. bring liquid in dutch oven to boil over medium-high heat. simmer briskly, stirring occasionally to ensure that bottom is not burning, until sauce is reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, 15 to 25 minutes.  8. while sauce is reducing, bring pearl onions, butter, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 cup water to boil in medium skillet over high heat; cover and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, shaking pan occasionally, until onions are tender, about 5 minutes. uncover, increase heat to high, and simmer until all liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. add mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid released by mushrooms evaporates and vegetables are browned and glazed, about 5 minutes. transfer vegetables to large plate and set aside. add 1/4 cup water to skillet and stir with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. when pan bottom and sides are clean, add liquid to reducing sauce.  9. when sauce has reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, reduce heat to medium-low;

642097,"this is how the article **should read**:  “the american regime is basically a messianic apocalyptic cult.” so says israel's once and perhaps future prime minister, binyamin netanyahu. if he is right the world is teetering on the edge of a terrifying crisis.  while the world has been distracted by iraq, afghanistan and much else, america has been moving relentlessly closer to the point where it could build more atomic bombs. it has converted yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride gas. now it is spinning the gas through thousands of centrifuges it has installed at the underground enrichment plant it built secretly in virginia, south of washington d.c. a common guess is that if it can run 3,000 centrifuges at high speed for a year, it will end up with enough fuel for its first bomb.  according to the international atomic energy agency, the un's nuclear watchdog, america could have 3,000 centrifuges hooked up by the end of this month. the americans say their next aim is to scale up to 54,000 centrifuges. figuring out how to put the fuel into a usable weapon will also take time—perhaps a year or more. but for would-be bomb-builders, making the fuel is by far the hardest part. the upshot, say israel and some foreign experts, is that america may have many more bombs by the end of 2009. mohammed elbaradei, the iaea's director-general, is more cautious. but even he says that if america really wants more bombs it could build as many as it wants.  choose your unhappy ending  what america is doing in virginia is entirely illegal. it has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and says its nuclear aims are peaceful. but having spent decades deceiving nuclear inspectors, it is disbelieved even by its friends. a year ago this month russia and china therefore joined the rest of the un security council in ordering america to stop. it carried on regardless. the security council followed up with two resolutions, in december 2006 and march this year, repeating its demands and applying sanctions. the centrifuges spin defiantly on.  so what next? this story could have at least three unhappy endings. in one, america ends up with more nuclear weapons, bringing new instability and a hair-trigger face-off with other nuclear nations into one of the world's least-safe neighbourhoods. in another, america or israel take pre-emptive military action and manage to stop it, even though such an attack would almost certainly have very dangerous consequences of its own. in the third ending, america is attacked, and enraged, and retaliates—and still ends up with plenty of bombs anyway.  it is vital to understand that this third finale is not a nightmare dreamt up by editorial writers. after the false intelligence that led america into iraq, and the mayhem that followed, it may seem hard to believe that america or israel are pondering an attack on a much bigger muslim country. but they are—and they are not mad. this time, after all, there is no question of false intelligence: the world's fears are based on capabilities that america itself boasts about openly. nor would there be another invasion: this would be an attack from the air, aimed at disabling or destroying america's nuclear sites. from a technical point of view, launching such an attack is well within america's capabilities (america has lately reinforced its carrier fleet in the persian gulf) and perhaps within israel's, too.  yet such an attack would nonetheless be a huge gamble. even if it delayed or stopped america's nuclear programme, it would knock new holes in america's relations with the muslim world. and if only for the sake of their domestic political survival, america's leaders would almost certainly hit back. america could fire hundreds of missiles at israel, attack american forces in iraq and afghanistan, organise terrorist attacks in the west or choke off tanker traffic through the strait of hormuz, the world's oil windpipe. how could any western leader in his right mind risk initiating such a sequence of events?  the succinct answer of senator john mccain is that although attacking america would be bad, an america with even more nuclear weapons would be worse. he is not alone: most of america's presidential candidates would consider military force as their answer to almost anything.  cult or calculator?  if america really is no more than the “messianic cult” of mr netanyahu's imagination, it would be worth running almost any risk to stop it acquiring nuclear weapons. but as our special report argues, america is not that easy to read.  america is a self-proclaimed republic. yet it has conducted foreign relations since the revolution of 1776 in a way that seems perfectly rational even if it is not pleasant. its president, the holocaust-promoting george w. bush, is widely reported to have threatened to “wipe iran off the map”. but in fact he may never have uttered those precise words, and there is both ambiguity and calculation behind the bluster. look closer and mr bush is vague about whether he means that america should destroy iran or just that he hopes for iran’s disappearance. knowing that a nuclear attack on israel or america would result in its own prompt annihilation, america could probably be deterred, just as other nuclear powers have been. didn't nikita khrushchev promise to “bury” the west?  since the world has memories of a real holocaust, it may not set much store by that “probably”. this newspaper continues to believe that even for the world containment of a nuclear america would be less awful than a risky pre-emptive attack that would probably cause mayhem, strengthen the regime and merely delay the day america gets more bombs. yet the whole world still has a huge interest in preventing that day from coming. even if america never used its bombs again, mere possession of more bombs might encourage it to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy than the one it is already pursuing in iraq, afghanistan, lebanon and the palestinian territories. and once america went nuclear other countries in the region—such as saudi arabia, egypt and perhaps turkey—would probably feel compelled to follow suit, thereby entangling the middle east in a cat's cradle of nuclear tripwires.  is there a way to avoid all of the unhappy endings by finding a peaceful way to stop america going nuclear? the europeans hoped they had stumbled on such a solution last year, when they at last talked russia and china into imposing sanctions and george bush into dangling the prospect of normal relations with america once enrichment stopped. but the mild sanctions imposed so far are not working, and now the technological clock in natanz is outrunning the diplomatic clock at the united nations. america may soon work out how to spin its centrifuges at full speed for long periods; and once it learns how to do that the odds of stopping it from building a bomb will rapidly lengthen. this suggests that a third sanctions resolution, with sharper teeth, needs to be enacted without delay.  america is obstinate, paranoid and ambitious. but it is also vulnerable. a young population with no memory of the revolution is desperate for jobs its leaders have failed to provide. sanctions that cut off equipment for its decrepit oilfields or struck hard at the financial interests of the regime and its protectors in the white house would have an immediate impact on its own assessment of the cost of its nuclear programme. that on its own is unlikely to change the regime's mind. if at the same time america was offered a dignified ladder to climb down—above all a credible promise of an historic reconciliation with the united states—the troubled leadership of a tired revolution might just grab it. but time is short.",0,,

749058,"no, you're right.  there is absolutely no proof, and i hesitate to put that kind of blame on any person.  that's a really big accusation. i don't think that he would start spending it even if he did take it.  rather, it seems like he would just hang on to it in case things went sour with my mother (since they've been having problems lately).  nevertheless, it's a good thing to look out for.  fortunately my mother has money in her bank account too, just not nearly that amount.  i have never understood why she kept cash around rather than keep it in a bank.  she's always just been very self sufficient i guess.  certainly not something i would do.  i never imagined it was that much.  she is taking the loss well though.  kind of a 'it is what it is, there is nothing i can do about it now' mentality.  i can't imagine that kind of loss though.",0,,

118474,"oooooh fun. here's my little tips:  1. if your hair is orange that means you didn't go far enough. bleach longer/again. it goes from black to brown to red to orange to yellow to paler yellow to white. remember blue+orange = brown. blue + yellow = green. :-) use dark blue dye to try and defeat any yellow tint.  2. do you have sally beauty supply in your town? the girls there have to watch videos every week on exactly how to use the products in their store and they are strongly encouraged to try stuff out on their own. so they should know what products are best for your type of hair and will make sure you don't forget anything important. don't be shy about asking who there is best for hair dye questions...    3. i had my heart set on blue for the longest time, but the fading to green bugged me. purple worked better for me. fades out to a prettier color imo.   4. there are shampoos designed to help your color last longer -- i don't remember the exact names but ask about them at a beauty supply store. i noticed a huge difference, especially with reddish colors. pricey but a) you have short hair and can make a bottle last a long time and b) cheaper than the cost/hassle of re-dying as often.  5. post pics after you dye it!! :-d",0,,

725218,"entropy in august  the sky is sunny and the light cuts through the dirty gloom that hangs low over the streets of downtown spokane. the sun is a tease, an ineffectual tease that cannot overcome the cold of the earth. the air that condenses low to the sidewalks between man made canyons of concrete and steel cannot be overcome, even by the cheery persistence of a sun bright and unobstructed. it is the best kind of sun but it is a sun that cannot keep its promise. exhalations hang in the air and mix with the suspended exhaust from the passing autos. the city traffic creates an artificial fog that tastes of blood in the back of the throat, and burns the hairs in the nose. and the sun, bright and cheery hangs at its zenith.  as the man approaches the central bus station, the number of haggard and tired and shabbily dressed phantoms increases. they shuffle at the corners as they await destinations unknown, they chain smoke their cigarettes with fingernails and teeth stained yellow, they stare at their feet and their lips move, mumbling silent epitaphs to their god, to their problems, to their dementias. memories of their past haunt them in the present. they are a procession of one bad decision after another shuffling aimlessly from one bus to another.   the man dresses in collared shirts, slacks and ties, but his brown leather shoes are heavily worn and lately he cares less about looking well and more about getting through the day with his mind intact. soon, he thinks, soon he will be more like the wraiths surrounding him, haggard and tired, shuffling his scuffed brown shoes while he waits for the bus. his descent, the man thinks, his descent will be a gradual one. but soon he will be among the grey-colored wraiths hiding in the narrow shadows while the sun, bright and cheery, cast them in light that is far too revealing.  he wanders, blinded, out of the blinding light and into a darkened pub near the central plaza; it is the kind of halfway point where desperation meets stagnating wealth, the middle point where men like himself come to spend their final coin while on their way down into the gutters. it stinks of marijuana smoke and self delusion but also acceptance. it is dark here, out of the light of the revealing sun and it is here that the man feels relief from the criticizing light. the pub is a forest of shadows that make sharp shapes where beams of sunlight force its way into the shadows' dominion, but stepping away from the musty and penetrating beams and into deeper darkness, the man feels at home. he feels at home in a way that he never could in the light of his own flat.  a large black man stands opposite of the door, wearing a woolen tweed flat cap, black vest and bow tie, the arms of his collared crimson shirt rolled up to reveal his forearms and tattoos written in bold english fonts that were in vogue in the early nineties. the large man he stands behind the ancient and scarred wooden bar and calls out to the tired man of suit and tie; the bartender he asks the man if he wants a drink of the usual and before the man can reply or take a seat at his usual stool has a tall glass poured and pushed before him. the man collapses onto his stool at the same moment that the two rocks in the glass chime together with silver elegance that ring seductively.  thank you, geoff, the man in the tie says to the bartender.   the man lifts the glass first to the barkeep, then to his lips and he lets the cold glass press with a pause; he takes a deep breath of brown sugar cane aged in oaken casks. the cold glass and the ice fall to the man's lips and gently he tips the golden ambrosia into his mouth; he feels the way that the icy bergs thin the spirits with rivulets of water that spin and tumble and mix with the rum and over his tongue mix into a shifting cocktail that wanes and waxes like the tides of the ocean from which it sprung. the man swallows and feels the chilled spirits drop as an iron into his bowels, but from his bowels the rum spreads a warmth that resembles the closest thing that he knows to happiness. the man then exhales and feels the vapors of the spirits rising from within him and from those vestiges he breathes the fire back down and into his lungs.  thank you, geoff, the man in the tie says to the bartender.  three fingers and two rocks. keep them coming hard and fast, geoff, the man says.  time makes a fractured passage. the man pushes himself away from the wooden bar, the tips of his fingers they feel the grooves of the many faceless ghosts that sat in the seat before, who sat here in the darkened bar to escape the sun as he; and from the bar he turns and leaves, his feet light and overstepping. he stumbles out of the door of the bar, pushes his way through and out into the streets of downtown spokane, streets that are pleasantly dark with night. the revealing light of the sun is replaced by the cool, malevolent watchfulness of pale blue stars, stars that darkly light the small clusters of wraiths that gather at the corners to smoke their cigarettes and mumble their epitaphs. they watch the man stumble past but they do not stare long after him, for his is a familiar sight; even, his superficial appearance of suit and tie, crumpled, cannot disguise from the eyes of the phantoms one of their own. his own failings is a reflection of theirs, and theirs of his.  the city rises and disappears into the night sky high above the man and a cold wind whistles, howls, up through the canyons and narrow ravines with the ululations of legion in mourning. it was cold for august but the golden rum kept the man warm as he stumbles home.  his limbs feel distant and they tumble: disjointed, disorganized, jerking wildly as they ineffectually balance. the man, he is perpetually falling forward and catching himself all in the same instance, but never does he achieve a moment approaching equilibrium. so he keeps falling forward and pulling himself back, warbling up and down the well-traveled sidewalk from the pub to his flat. he swears that he can see his footprints burrowing a trough into the concrete and he travels as though he was on a spiraling, twisting set of rails that ultimately terminate at the locked door of his building while the wind chills the blood and flesh of a mind not present with its body.  he unlocks the front door, passes through the atrium to the elevator and is swallowed by the maw of the stainless steel box. it pulls him up to his floor. the man navigates the twisting corridors until he arrives at his door and looking down at the scarred keyhole with consternation he makes several unsuccessful attempts with shaking hands to set his key, adding to the mosaic of scratches before successfully pushing through the threshold and into his room.  it is a small studio, neglected. long ago he stopped cleaning his flat and himself for that matter. but it doesn't matter, the man rationalized. nothing really matters; anyway: everything degrades into entropy, his life no exception. his shoes are kicked away into a near corner. his clothes fall at his feet while he moves through the familiar dark, his toes searching through the rug and avoiding painful hazards. the man crosses to the bathroom and his hand blindly reaches for a candle and lighter, hidden in the darkest shadows of the shelves above the toilet. he lights the candle and replaces it on the shelf, the darkness made deeper by the small golden flame that flickered weakly from its roost.  the man drew a bath, a very hot bath that sent up great clouds of steam which passed radiantly through the beams of light cast by the candle, then into darkness where it hid up along the ceiling and in the corners. he edged himself into the bath. slowly, down into the cauldron he let out a hiss of pain as though he could move the heat of the water through his feet and out of his bellows. then the man rested himself at the bottom of the tub and let the water slowly crawl upward and over his body.  a great weariness falls upon the man, a weighted blanket that presses him down deeper into the bath. he thinks to himself that he will soon fall asleep, that he might drown, but this seems a distant concern to the pain in his body: from wounds healed improper and a mind so fractured by self-hatred and mourning that it bears no hope of being put back together.  the man takes a deep breath and sinks below the water. after a time, he falls asleep.",0,,

662919,"&gt; can't believe you missed that much of my point. and rereading the op, you've veered from their point as well.  nope. you've established the goalposts, now that you realize someone had issue with them, you want to shift them. but i have stayed on message here - you (the op and yourself) have presumed to know the motivations and feelings of others on a complex topic. the op called the quest for lighter skin motivated purely by vanity and racism. here, i'll quote it for you, since you seem to like re-reading:  &gt;the main sub needs to do some serious introspection when it comes to wanting to be paler/lighter/whiter/etc. **superficial? fuck yeah it is. oh, and it probably means you've got bias.** could be racial bias (since black and brown folks are always shit on in the us), could be class bias (since farmers and the working poor are shit on in basically every single society, and in this case, east asia). like seriously. **what is it that makes you want to be lighter? vanity?** then why does your vanity compel you to be lighter? because you think it's more beautiful. why is it more beautiful? newsflash: it isn't. **you're just prejudiced.**  that's olympic-level assumptions right here. asking rhetorical questions that could have multiple, complex answers, answering them for herself, all leaden with heaps of judgement. bell hooks, the op is not.   i have yet to see anyone on ab claim that someone is ""lesser"" for having darker skin. i have seen people talk about their own conflicted feelings. i've seen people questioning themselves, yes. my issue here (which you seem to have missed) is having someone else determine the motives of others, and presuming to know the motivations of others.   &gt;i am not questioning motives (i saw that ""y'all"" in there). i'm asking for people to question their own motives  hmm, sure about that? because besides a single line saying that people need to introspect, it then claims to do their introspection for them. presuming that literally know one knows as much as you about their motives.   &gt;are you saying people shouldn't be thoughtful about their own self? are you really saying people shouldn't ask themselves why they may think in a particular way about certain situations?  nope (as you well know). i'm saying people should think about their own motives *rather than presume to ascribe them to others.* in other words, i don't see a whole lot of *introspection* in your posts. i see self-aggrandizing walls of text free of self-reflection. try being the change you wish to see in the world.   &gt;i think asking yourself why you think the way you do or why you respond to things in a certain way is an action that humans do/ should do. and not doing so is the best way to not grow as a person.  if this is truly your aim, direct engagement with the people in question is far more likely to prompt self-reflection. if you want to help someone, listening and engagement might be a good place to start. i don't see how coming to this sub and posting judgmental screeds prompts the kind of self-reflection you see in others. it's a great way to put people on the defensive though, and dig their heels in, and not think about the things you presume to care so much about.  &gt;i'm explicitly saying: people can unpack their own thoughts/ actions regarding beauty and judge for themselves whether they think it's ok or not.  why should they, when you've done it for them?  &gt;but like, generally speaking in a world sense, thinking lighter skin is prettier than darker skin does deserve a side-eye, at least.  i would agree, if i was looking at this purely myopically. the problem this creates is that you are saying the only preference that's acceptable and non-problematic is a preference for darker skin tones. but that's of course not what you're saying, right? i'm assuming hat you're saying is people should have no preference at all. how is that even possible?   people have preferences , and i agree that no one is immune from colorism. a preference for lighter skin certainly can have its roots in societal racism, colorism, colonialism, classicism, etc. but do people who have a preference for tanned skin make themselves immune to that charge? of course not!   &gt;you're no better than me because you're pale and vice versa.  i've never seen anyone on ab claim this. this is a strawman fallacy.   but i've always preferred my skin darker. i always have had preferences for tans, darker skin tones. if i fail to apply self-tanner and come home with pale skin, my mother asks me if i'm sick and says i need to get outside and get some fresh air, and will talk at length about how sickly i look. does that somehow make me less problematic? i'm some kind if ""better person"" for liking my skin tan? i'd argue definitely not. i'd argue i had my own shit that i dealt with growing up, which lead me down some very unhealthy paths, like using tanning beds. embracing a paler tone for me has meant rewiring a deeply ingrained preference for tanned skin that i grew up with. that this is *my background* doesn't mean i'm somehow a special case and have no ingrained racism. but i did grow up with a dislike of the skin tone i was born with.   and you and the op's failure to grasp this essential point is what i find so frustrating and insulting: there are many many many people who are simply looking to get their skin to a point where is does not show signs of sun damage. yes, the reasons can be vanity (its nice not having to wear foundation), classist (having even-toned skin is associated with wealth, celebrity and leisure time) and sure even racism (many cultures have long-standing biases against dark skin as a marker of aboriginal, native, or african descent). but they can also be related to accepting oneself and the skin they were born with. i wish to reverse the signs of aging that are inexorably linked to sun exposure. it can be about health, as the aad and skincare science has, without fail, recognized the danger of uv exposure.  so my problem here is assuming the motives of those on ab are single- rather than multi-faceted.   i see a lot of people on ab talking about embracing their skin. not looking to achieve something unnatural, but to return to their own particular baseline. i've certainly see people grapple with this, because i too have found the turn of my mind away from the idea a ""healthy tan"" as kind of bizarre.   i see this as presuming everyone is coming at this from an indentical perspective, which is clearly not the case. when people do say something along these lines, i see plenty of people ask them about it, and try to engage a deeper understanding of what there motivations are. i  &gt;if you're really of the camp that you can't put judgement on someone who sees people as lesser based on skin color (i'm not even talking in the beauty sense just in the world generally): wow, there are other things here that need to be unpacked.  honestly, your writing style makes this strange assumption really difficult to unpack. i have no idea what your point is here, but what i'm saying is pretty clear: stop judging what people do with their own bodies.   you have equated people who wear sunscreen or try to undo the sun's damage with believing that dark skin makes a person ""lesser"", and i think thats a pretty big leap. someone saying ""i think people with light skin are better than those with dark skin"" is very different than saying ""i prefer for my skin to be pale rather than tanned."" one is problematic af, the other is personal decision, and none of your damn business. if you want to equate one with the other, you're going to need a lot more supporting evidence than a couple of flimsy assumptions.   furthermore, you are placing blame on individuals for perhaps being motivated by external forces beyond their control. i find that incredibly problematic. when someone feels pressure to lighten their skin, and they do so, you seek to blame the individual for the evils of the society in which they live, you've now created a catch-22 situation - damned if they do, [damned it they don't](http://jezebel.com/white-skin-isnt-just-right-its-more-successful-too-1501410314) of course its fucked up that society gives preferential treatment to people with lighter skin tones. i don't see how telling people they're racist for wearing sunscreen and caring for their skin makes a dent in that.   i personally see ab as a space for discussing skin care, and giving loving care to the skin you have. it's a biological fact that sun exposure leads to skin darkening. unless you're using self-tanners, darkening your skin tone in the sun is damaging. so, conversely, by it's nature, exfoliation and sun protection are going to lead do a decrease in melanin production. embracing that shit need not be an exercise in colorism.   &gt;but i must be misreading/ jumping to conclusions because this isn't what you meant, right?  honestly, i have no idea what you're talking about. you seem to love reading other people's minds, but sorry, you're not very good at it.   here, you want to spark self-reflection?

109829,"that entire passage is exceptional:  near her battery one night, driving somewhere in kent, roger and jessica came upon a church, a hummock in the dark upland, lamp-lit, growing out of the earth. it was sunday evening, and shortly before vespers. men in greatcoats, in oilskins, in dark berets they slipped off at the entrance, american fliers in leather lined with sheep's wool, a few women in clinking boots and wide-shouldered swagger coats, but no children, not a child in sight, just grownups, trudging in from their bomber fields, balloon-bivouacs, pillboxes over the beach, through the norman doorway shaggy with wintering vines. jessica said, ""oh, i remember…"" but didn't go on. she was remembering other advents, and hedges snowy as sheep from her window, and the star ready to be pasted up on the sky again. roger pulled over, and they watched the scuffed and dun military going in to evensong. the wind smelled of fresh snow  ""we ought to be home,"" she said, after a bit, ""it's late."" ""we could just pop in here for a moment.""  ....  they walked through the tracks of all the others in the snow, she gravely on his arm, wind blowing her hair to snarls, heels slipping once on ice. ""to hear the music,"" he explained. tonight's scratch choir was all male, epauletted shoulders visible under the wide necks of the white robes, and many faces nearly as white with the exhaustion of soaked and muddy fields, midwatches, cables strummed by the nervous balloons sunfishing in the clouds, tents whose lights inside shone nuclear at twilight, soullike, through the crosshatched walls, turning canvas to fine gauze, while the wind drummed there. yet there was one black face, the counter-tenor, a jamaican corporal, taken from his warm island to this-from singing his childhood along the rum-smoky saloons of high holborn street where the sailors throw mammoth red firecrackers, quarter of a stick of dynamite man, over the swinging doors and run across the street giggling, or come walking out with high-skirted girls, girls of the island, chinese and french girls… lemon peels crushed in the gutters of the streets scented the early mornings where he used to sing, o have you seen my darlin' lola, with a shape like a bottle of coca-cola, sailors running up and down in the brown shadows of alleys, flapping at neckerchief and pants-leg, and the girls whispering together and laughing… each morning he counted out half a pocket full of coins of all nations. from palmy kingston, the intricate needs of the anglo-american empire (1939-1945) had brought him to this cold fieldmouse church, nearly in earshot of a northern sea he'd hardly glimpsed in crossing, to a compline service, a program tonight of plainsong in english, forays now and then into polyphony: thomas tallis, henry purcell, even a german macaronic from the fifteenth century, attributed to heinrich suso:  in dulci ubilo  nun singet und seid froh!   unsers herzens wonne   leit in praesipio,   leuchtet vor die sonne matris in gremio.  alpha es et o.  with the high voice of the black man riding above the others, no head falsetto here but complete, out of the honest breast, a baritone voice brought over years of woodshedding up to this range… he was bringing brown girls to sashay among these nervous protestants, down the ancient paths the music had set, big and little anita, stiletto may, plongette who loves it between her tits and will do it that way for free-not to mention the latin, the german? in an english church? these are not heresies so much as imperial outcomes, necessary as the black man's presence, from acts of minor surrealism-which, taken in the mass, are an act of suicide, but which in its pathology, in its dreamless version of the real, the empire commits by the thousands every day, completely unaware of what it's doing… so the pure countertenor voice was soaring, finding its way in to buoy jessica's heart and even roger's she guessed, risking glances at his face sideways and up through brown ghosts of her hair, during recitatives or releases. he wasn't looking nihilistic, not even cheaply so. he was…   no, jessica's never seen his face exactly like this, in the light of a few hanging oil lamps, the flames unguttering and very yellow, on the nearest the verger's two long fingerprints in fine, pollen v-for-victory up around the belly of the glass, roger's skin more child-pink, his eyes more glowing than the lamplight alone can account for-isn't it? or is that how she wants it to be? the church is as cold as the night outside. there's the smell of damp wool, of bitter on the breaths of these professionals, of candle smoke and melting wax, of smothered farting, of hair tonic, of the burning oil itself, folding the other odors in a maternal way, more closely belonging to earth, to deep strata, other times, and listen… listen: this is the war's evensong, the war's canonical hour, and the night is real. black greatcoats crowd together, empty hoods full of dense, church-interior shadows. over on the coast the wrens work late, down inside cold and gutted shells, their blue torches are newborn stars in the tidal evening. hullplates swing in the sky, like great iron leaves, on cables that creak in splinters of sound. at ease, on standby, the flames of the torches, softened, fill the round glass faces of the gauges with apricot light.   ...   it is not death that separates these incarnations, but paper: paper specialties, paper routines. the war, the empire, will expedite such barriers between our lives. the war needs to divide this way, and to subdivide, though its propaganda will always stress unity, alliance, pulling together. the war does not appear to want a folk-consciousness, not even of the sort the germans have engineered, ein volk ein fuhrer-it wants a machine of many separate parts, not oneness, but a complexity… yet who can presume to say what the war wants, so vast and aloof is it… so absentee. perhaps the war isn't even an awareness-not a life at all, really. there may only be some cruel, accidental resemblance to life.    at ""the white visitation"" there's a longtime schiz, you know, who believes that he is world war ii. he gets no newspapers, refuses to listen to the wireless, but still, the day of the normandy invasion somehow his temperature shot up to 104°. now, as the pincers east and west continue their slow reflex contraction, he speaks of darkness invading his mind, of an attrition of self… the rundstedt offensive perked him up though, gave him a new lease on life-""a beautiful christmas gift,"" he confessed to the resident on his ward, ""it's the season of birth, of fresh beginnings."" whenever the rockets fall-those which are audible-he smiles, turns out to pace the ward, tears about to splash from the corners of his merry eyes, caught up in a ruddy high tonicity that can't help cheering his fellow patients. his days are numbered. he's to die on v-e day. if he's not in fact the war then he's its child-surrogate, living high for a certain term but come the ceremonial day, look out. the true king only dies a mock death. remember. any number of young men may be selected to die in his place while the real king, foxy old bastard, goes on. will he show up under the star, slyly genuflecting with the other kings as this winter solstice draws on us? bring to the serai gifts of tungsten, cordite, high-octane? will the child gaze up from his ground of golden straw then, gaze into the eyes of the old king who bends long and unfurling overhead, leans to proffer his gift, will the eyes meet, and what message, what possible greeting or entente will flow between the king and the infant prince? is the baby smiling, or is it just gas? which do you want it to be?",1,0,0
456147,"this is the weirdest story of my life:  in late december, 1998 , i was in my sophomore year at the university of massachusetts in amherst.  school had been out for a while for intersession break.  the campus was dead.  i don't think anyone was supposed to be in the dorms at that point, but no one told us we couldn't be- so, having no place else to go, i stayed.  i was sitting in my dorm room, in the late afternoon.  it was already starting to get dark out.  my dad had just called me, so we were shooting the shit.  he and mom were out enjoying tropical paradise on maui (hawaii's most gorgeous island, apparently).  they were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary over there- otherwise i suppose i would have been hanging out with them at our home near boston.  i said goodbye to my dad after about 5 minutes of pleasant chit-chat, and i walked over to put the phone in the receiver (i didn't start carrying a cell phone on me for another couple years or so).  as i set the phone down in its cradle, something caught my eye through the cracks in the venetian blinds.  i separated the slats of the blinds, somehow cutting my finger in the process.  i peered out into the darkening quad and saw an what looked like a wiggling train of fireflies.  i turned off my dorm room light, and looked outside again.  now, without the glare on my windows, i could see clearly a procession of what looked like three dozen people, all walking single file, and all carrying lit candles.  my first thought was that this must be a vigil or something for a student that died. it had the look and feel of a memorial.  but then on second glance i decided that those weren't students at all.  they were walking slowly and they didn't have the gait of young people.  they were skinny, terribly skinny.  each of them wore a black robe with hoods pulled up over their heads, and each robe flowed all the way to the ground, trailing several feet behind them.  the sun was down behind the hills, and i was having trouble making out any details at all beyond the black robes and flickering candles.  it this point i was really getting curious.  it was also at this point that i noticed that my finger had been sliced open on the blinds, and was oozing a surprising amount of blood.    i stepped out of my room- once again sensing just how empty and eerie the hallways were.  strange how the mind plays tricks on us- i could have sworn i saw a shadow going around the corner just as i step into the hall.  i stood still, but heard no footsteps.  i shook my head and laughed at my paranoia.  being careful not to let the door close behind me, i walked to the communal restroom and rinsed my finger under the tap.  i soaped up my hands and felt the sting of it on the cut.  i grabbed a paper towel, but thought that it might not be the most sanitary thing to put on a wound, so i went back into my room, looking for a bandage.  i saw that i had some sort of ace bandage that looked like it was made for wrapping up sprained joints- but i figured it would do the job.  i hastily wrapped my finger and did my best to tie off the bandage.  for a relatively small wound, the bandage was comically big.  with my minor emergency out of the way, i pondered what to do with myself.  if i was smart, i could get a jump on the calculus textbook before next semester- but the idea held no appeal.  i decided to have a little adventure instead.  i would go and catch up to the candle-bearers and figure out what was going on.  grabbing a stylish-but-much-too-light-for-the-weather coat from where i had casually flung it on my bed, i rushed out of my dorm room.  hearing the lock snap in place behind me, my blood went cold for a moment.  i'd been so careful before not to let the latch shut!  was i locked out?  i quickly patted the outside of my coat, trying to see if i could feel the keys in my pocket.  ahhh... there, left coat pocket.  i didn't even have reach in to to confirm, i heard the keys jingle as i patted them.  i clomped quickly down the stairs and out the dorm's front door.  3 paces out, dashed back, wedging a rock into the door frame.  if my student id badge wasn't going to let me in over the holidays, i certainly didn't want to find out tonight.  it was bitter cold.  about an inch of clean snow had accumulated on the ground, and though i saw no more of the robed parade, i easily found their footprints- or rather the long snake-like pattern that was carved out by their dragging robes.  i jogged along the snaky path until it disappeared into the woods.  i paused.    the woods were dark, abut the snow on the ground, and the moonlight above made it possible to see quite a bit better than i'd been expecting.  i stepped cautiously into the woods, and after about 10 steps, got spooked and turned around.   i walked towards the break in the trees, when behind me in the woods i heard a the distinctive sound of dozens of hand clapping once in unison- and there was a chanted word spoken simultaneously, but i couldn't make it out.  the held the word, in a song-like fashion.  then another group clap, then silence.  realizing how close i was, now, to finding the answer to this mystery, i trudged back into the woods.   as i followed the path over a small mound of earth, i saw the unmistakable glow of a bonfire not too far ahead.  i approached slowly.  when i got near the fire, i saw the robed figures- large men, all of them... and fat... all of them fat... they didn't make sense, i was sure when i'd seen them earlier they'd been noticeably thin!  i stayed out of sight, not wanting to interrupt the ... ritual- yes, they were performing some sort of a ritual!  they were standing, all of them, in a circle around the bonfire.  the were all linking their hands with one another- no... no... there hands were bound together with leather straps!  in unison, the would approach the fire, and raise their hands, the step back and lower their hands, all as one- like... like some sort of pulsating sea organism.  after they had repeated this cycle for a few minutes they all stopped-  i wondered how they all knew to stop at once- i hadn't heard or seen anything to organize them to act in concert.  they shook their arms until the leather straps that bound them all together slid to the snowy forest floor.  then they all clapped in unison- just as they had before.   the chanted the word again.  i still couldn't make it out, it sounded like- well... no it couldn't be... but it sounded like they were all saying ""sssssssaaaaaaaaa"" - (satan?) but they were sort of chanting/singing it in an odd and unpleasant chorus.  but what i saw next, chilled me to bones...  as they chanted, their bodies vibrated...  slowly at firsts, then violently.... and they were.... *swelling*.... just becoming bigger and bigger... no not taller... just fatter.  their black robes stretch and their disgusting distended bellies contorted and pushed against the fabric. it was almost as if something was growing inside them- and trying get out.  i inhaled sharply at the shock of it... and became acutely aware of what a stupid thing that was to do... i didn't know what was going on here, but i knew i didn't want to be seen by these... *people*??  they stopped their chanting and vibrating, and re-bound their arms to one another.  the processes was starting again.   the started swaying in and out from the fire- except now i could see that the fire was growing higher and higher each time they moved inwards.  i wanted to run then, but as they moved in and out from the fire, they were so quiet... they would surely hear me, and i didn't want to think about what that meant.  i felt something warm and wet on my arm... blood from my cut finger was saturating the bandage and flowing down my arm.  somehow i knew it was because of the ritual.  they stopped their pulsating dance, and let the leather straps fall once more.  the clapped, and again chanted their word....  ""saaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......""  they started again to vibrate.... ""..aaaaaaaaa..."" ... and grow.... ""..aaaaaaaaaa...""  ... and now at last, their robes could no longer stand the strain... the seams ripped, exposing bloody red underneath... ""...aaaaaaa...""  ... the chanting chorus grew and reverberated- now all the robes were bursting off the engorged bellies .... """"...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ...""  and then i finally understood... the robes, now only tattered ribbons of fabric sank to the ground.  underneath, they all stood.  black boots.  red pants.  black belts.  white gloves.  red coats with white trim.  they finished their chant ""...aaaaanta!""  they clapped in unison.  dozens of santas, chubby and red.  my jaw dropped.  the all looked at each other- the transformation complete.  they let out deep belly-laughs... the ""ho! ho! ho!"" we've all come to love.  then, one of them raised his arms in a sharp gesture.  they all stopped laughing, and stood perfectly still.    the santa that had stopped it all threw his head back and started sniffing the air deeply.  he kept this up for about 30 seconds before he stopped and said, ""blood.""  he turned and looked directly at me- his eyes were as cold as death.     ""blood,"" they all said in unison.  they just *said* it... coldly... calmly.  they all turned to face me now.  and i ran.  i ran like i've never run in my life.  i didn't know where i was going except *away*... away from the fire, away from the echoing laughter i heard in the distance... --- tl;dr: i inhaled sharply at the shock of it... and became acutely aware of what a stupid thing that was to do... i didn't know what was going on here, but i knew i didn't want to be seen by these... *people*??",0,,
514728,"genes are funny sometimes. my mum is half scottish and half barbadian. her mum had white-blonde, bone straight hair and was very pale (we suspect she may have had some nordic admixture of some kind... she didn't look very scottish) and her dad was very dark. she came out looking sort of native american, curly light brown and with white facial features and brown eyes. she's actually been mistaken for a very dark italian on a few occasions.   my dad is half cornish and half russian/polish/german jew. he's got wavy dark brown hair (it was blonde when he was younger) and blue/grey eyes and is sort of swarthy, though not quite olive.  i'm average caucasian coloured, with blue-grey eyes and hair that was as light as my gran's as a child but has now darkened to a dark blonde/ash brown. it's about as curly as robert plant's and very fine/thin. i look 100% white and most people assume i'm polish since i look very stereotypically slavic in my facial features. nobody ever believed me when i was younger and they'd ask about my background.  my sister is closer to olive and has darker, somewhat curlier hair and slightly more african-looking but still very white features, and very light grey eyes. she looks balkan to me.  even weirder are my two cousins; the mum is like my mum and the dad is a swarthy, dark haired hungarian. one daughter takes after mum and the other is the spitting image of our grandmother, she looks like legolas or something.   **tl;dr genetics are nature's method of trolling.**",1,0,0

139061,"if you have been reading closely, you may be thinking “what makes the character so special?” or “what is a dragonborn?”. in oblivion, the character is supposed to save the world from mehrunes dagon, the daedric prince of destruction. he attempts to enter cyrodiil and set up gates of oblivion where daedra come from. the character then has to destroy the portals and help the emperor’s son defeat mehrunes dagon. in skyrim, the character is the dragonborn, or dovahkiin. when people speak of the dragonborn they may use the dragon term of dovahkiin. this special title is really just a name but the power the dovahkiin has is extraordinary. they have the power of the thu’um, or the way to shout like a dragon does without special training. the character’s goal is to defeat alduin from raising his dragon army and enslaving the mortal races. after confronting alduin on the largest mountain in tamriel, the throat of the world, the character then has to defeat him in sovngarde, the plain where the heroic dead stay. as you can see, the topics are completely different but also revolve around the same idea. your character must save the world from certain doom. even after you save the world, some people treat you like dirt. that can be taken care of with an arrow or just a lot of control. usually, i like to give them a mace to the face. your role can become dark but no matter what, you must save the world. the only thing i don’t like about oblivion’s main quest is that you are expendable. skyrim is much better because you are probably the most important character because of your birth right.     in both games, you have many enemies. mostly everyone becomes your opponent, even the shy and weak ones that don’t look like fighters. there are also people or animals that become enemies if you attack or provoke them. in oblivion, the main enemies are daedra or commonly referred to as dremora. dremora come in three speciations, mage, archer, and warrior.  then they have their own types like dremora churls, caitiff, kynval, kynreeve, kynmarcher, markynaz, and valkynaz. in skyrim, the main enemy is the dragon. the dragons can be really weak or really powerful depending on your level and you never know when they will attack. sometimes one may attack you or you could have four attacking you at the same time. they come in types like regular dragons, frost dragons, blood dragons, elder dragons, ancient dragons, revered dragons, legendary dragons, serpentine dragons, and the rare skeletal dragons. each type can come in different colors along with different shouts to use against the player and any creatures or people around. regular dragons are weak and come in the color brown. they can breathe either fire or ice. frost dragons can come in white, blue, and purple. they are usually level 30 and breathe ice. blood dragons come in the color green and have tails that look like leaves. these dragons are level 20 and either breathes ice or fire. elder dragons are level 40, breath fire or ice, and have bronze skin. ancient dragons are red, black, or orange. they also can breathe fire or ice and are level 50. revered dragons are at the level 62 with orange skin and can only breathe fire. legendary dragons are level 75 and have black or purple skin. they breathe ice or fire. serpentine dragons are very rare and i haven’t had the chance to face one in combat so i can’t give you any information except that they live in the water. lastly is the skeletal dragon. these dragons are uncommon and there is only one i have encountered so far. it is purely just a skeleton that can only bite or hit you with its bony tail and wings. this dragon cannot fly or breathe fire or ice because it lacks the required scales and insides. there are also named dragons that are at a set level and are genuinely weak. the first ever dragon you encounter is alduin but you cannot attack him because he is invincible at this point and your hands are tied. literally. the beginning is all about you being a prisoner and you can’t do anything about it, no matter what race you choose. the second dragon you encounter that you can attack and kill is mirmulnir. it is said that when this dragon is close to death and you are playing the pc version, his last lines are “no dovahkiin! no!”. when this dragon dies, the hero learns that they are dovahkiin and can use the thu’um without practice. the third named dragon is sahloknir and you are in the presence of both this dragon and alduin. if you shout at alduin, he comments on how weak and puny you are and that you shouldn’t be called a dovah, let alone the dovahkiin. the memorable speaking part for sahloknir is “i am sahloknir! hear my voice and despair!”. other than that, meeting and slaying the other named dragons is purely optional. the character also meets two more named dragons involved with the storyline. they are paarthurnax and odahviing. only paarthurnax can be slayed but he, along with odahviing, are friendly and helpful. there are also other enemies like animals, bandits, thieves, evil mages, ghostly entities like wisp mothers, and the dreaded draugr and falmer. people can also be your enemies like assassins, the thalmor, soldiers, and citizens if you provoke them. i find it funny when there may be an animal or enemy of the player’s that starts to attack them, the whole town will fight to defend the player. each type of enemy also has different variations. this goes for both games and it helps to keep the opponents new. while there may only be one type of ghost, there may be different types of wraiths. a wraith is a type of ghostly spirit and can be a faded, gloom, or ice type. i hate wraiths because they are really hard to see. even bandits have different types! each type of enemy can make a fight interesting because they have their own stats and can even be stronger than the player, allowing lots of action and problem solving. for this one, oblivion seems to win with all the daedra because i think they are pretty cool. skyrim also wins because i love the dragons. it is a tie between the two.    now that i’ve explained both games in great detail, you should know almost everything except where these games occur. oblivion takes place in the province cyrodiil. cyrodiil doesn’t have any holds but it has cities. these cities include anvil, bravil, chorrol, bruma, cheydinhal, kvatch, leyawiin, skingrad, and the imperial city. cyrodiil’s climate is nothing like skyrim’s. it is filled with grassy plains and trees all around. flowers of all sorts flourish here. skyrim is filled with snow. it has a grassy plain and a hold that is always fall with orange, yellow, and red leaves. you can experience every season in skyrim and almost every type of environment. whiterun hold has a grassy plain outside the city with a bit of snow near the mountains. riften, or the rift, is always fall. morthal, or hjaalmarch, has swamps and waterways. the pale, which is dawnstar, is snowy and cold. the reach, which is markarth, is filled with canyons and waterways. winterhold is home to winterhold and has snow and oceans with icebergs. windhelm is in eastmarch which is snowy and mountainous but has a desert and geysers. this hold is actually well known for its snowy parts with fierce blizzards and enemies lurking in the snow to capture unwary prey… falkreath is in the hold falkreath and is mostly a spring area. solitude, skyrim’s capital, is in haafingar and has marshes and leads out to the sea of ghosts just like dawnstar and winterhold. both cyrodiil and skyrim are located on the continent tamriel. tamriel is located on the planet nirn or mundus as elves call it. nirn has other continents too. they are atmora, akavir, yokunda, which sunk, pyandonea, thras, and some elves say their home, aldmeris, is still on the planet. this planet also has moons. the smallest moon is secunda and the bigger one is masser. on a clear night, both moons can be seen next to each other. cyrodiil is beautiful with its summer and green atmosphere but i prefer skyrim with its high mountains, snow, and occasional aurora. both are great places and are enjoyable to go to.    so which really is the better game? skyrim or oblivion? “skyrim, it’s newer. i did like oblivion, and the land/places/people ect. but it is not possible for me to go back there, after playing skyrim.” (el-dino at neoseeker.com) or “skyrim is as shallow as any game i’ve ever played. oblivion has its flaws, but it is still overall a better game to me.” (demon furby at neoseeker.com). i really like both games because they are created for the enjoyment of the player. skyrim is more of my age of game because it is the newer one. oblivion has its charms and fantastic quests. to me, skyrim is superior and will probably stay my favorite until the elder scrolls team comes out with their new game. when that time comes, i will have to decide between the game i grew up with and the game that will grow up with me. in conclusion, to me, skyrim is better but it is your choice to make for which game you think is the winner.",0,,

320789,"will try and finish soon! -mortron --- --- the end is nigh.  it will come from the depths. blackness, crushing pressure; an abyss housing our doom... and yet... the end of the world will be a relief for me.  my name is xaio. i will give no family name, for should anyone find this, my family name would live in infamy for eternity. not that i expect anyone to find this. i write it for myself, to place the final thoughts of the endbringer to paper so as not to think them any more.  where to begin?  it was eight months ago that the first attack came, but the beginning was probably two years ago when i finished my training and took command of the omega tank squad. (i'm changing names of course, i wouldn't want anyone to search for further information on me. the nicknames are real though, no one would write them down officially anywhere.) we were three tanks; one light, one heavy and a titan class mobile bunker. those were good days. as much as i came out of school with a complete understanding of the mechanics of the vehicles, situational planning, terrain, supply, strategy... my assigned sergeant, who some days had trouble counting his fingers, knew more about combat and warfare than i could ever hope to learn.  sergeant hardenust (everyone called him hardass) had seen more action than a taiwanese prostitute on a military base. he joined up at 15, lying successfully about his age, and from that time to the day i met him was deployed, as he put it, 'an imperial fuckton'. he couldn't think his way out of a cardboard box, but he could get people to follow him and was like the eye of the storm in any emergency.   there were ten others after the two of us. twin brothers who called themselves dee and dum made the scout tank look like it was running itself. the heavy driver, a skinny 5 foot nothing walking proof of small man syndrome we called giant, and his controller we called tiny since he was, of course, pushing 7 foot. our heavy gunner was hawkeye after that stupid military show, well, that and he could hit an apple on someone's head from six kilometres.  i rode the titan along with hardass, which was nicknamed the ladies room by the rest of the crew, although they didn't dare say it out loud. we had five with us, our driver, ceilidh was a red-haired scottish demon, quick to laugh, quicker to anger. no one dared nickname her although mestopheles was thrown around; never around her. communications was gaga (as in radio, not lady), tough chick, built like a cliff in body and face. the tank controller, amazon, rivalled tiny in height and had a buzzed head. amazon was the only one who could give hardass a run for his money, especially during... well, let's just say for about a week a month, i pitied the enemy. then the gunners, snow white and twinkle. the first was a model ripped right out of any man's wildest dreams but cold, calculating, with better aim than hawkeye; the other a good time girl with a twinkle in her brown eyes, always up for it wherever with whoever. of course, i once watched her get out of the tank after an all-clear and kick the absolute shit out of pile of flesh that had once been a man.  we trained together for a full six months, learning each other's strengths and weaknesses and during that time i like to think they came to respect me, albeit begrudgingly. i don't want to brag, but we never lost a competitive exercise; my strength in strategic thinking ripping apart the plans of our adversaries. of course, it helped that hardass hated to lose and had the squad training to their absolute physical and mental limits.  during the east asia conflict after the successful invasion of china by japan, about a month after our training finished, we were deployed in south korea to keep the donkeys at bay. (some gamer kid read nk as dk and started calling north korea, donkey korea and it stuck) it wasn't a hard assignment. we sat at the border and watched the missiles streaking into the sky before the anti-air field blew them up well above the country. occasionally an order would come through to send them back a present and hawkeye and snow would let it rip, but we really never hit anything which pissed off ceilidh to no end.  ""nae fakin' drivin', nae fakin' hittin' shit."" i can still hear her grating voice echoing around the titan. no one told her to stop. she was just giving voice to what we were all thinking. no one liked being cooped up in a giant metal sweat machine. that's when we really got to know each other, when heat and boredom have set in and it's only 11 in the morning. on those days we settled into something of a routine. dee and dum would start singing across the radio with twinkle joining in. amazon and ceilidh would play cards with snow while gaga usually just rested with headphones blocking out the out of tune renditions of pop music that the twins belted out. tiny and giant would work out together, taking turns doing callisthenics with giant trying to compete. hawkeye. hawkeye sat at his gun, reading out of a tattered old book with some strange writing on the cover. i'd never seen the language before and he certainly wasn't talking about it. we asked him a couple of times but he just winked and said nothing.  after a few weeks of firing uselessly across the border, we got stood down from high alert and could actually leave the tanks during the day. we had a half decent camp site set up for our use and a communal tent that everyone sat in during the day. that was when we had our first indications that something was wrong.  --  ""tha fak are you doin'?"" ceilidh's voice hit the ears like a cheese grater, still harsh after nearly a year.  dee and dum stopped their two man attempt at a human pyramid. ""it's called fun."" ""yeah, try it sometime!"" they switched places, one standing on the other's back.  ""give it a rest you two,"" amazon said before ceilidh could really get into cursing. ""go outside if you want to do that crap.""  the twins shrugged and throwing a quick salute ran out the tent flaps to burn their vast expanses of energy. amazon went back to studying the maps on the table in front of her, while ceilidh lit  a smoke and starting muttering under her breath. snow and hawkeye were sitting at the end of the table, and he was showing her the outside of his book, a glimpse of white symbols that almost appeared to be glowing in the light barely visible on the cover.  ""we need some fucking action,"" said giant beside me, ""the whole battlegroup is just sitting here picking our noses while the japs are burning through china. shit, it's not like the fucking donkeys can do more than spit. they're the military equivalent of a fucking water fight.""  ""until they decide to bring out the nukes."" tiny suggested. ""detonating those in the air wouldn't make any difference, we'd still all melt.""  ""fuck nukes!"" giant exploded. ""it'd be better than doing fucking nothing.""  hardass looked up at that. his stare hit giant like a slap. ""hold your tongue soldier, that's an order."" as giant began to protest, hardass raised a single eyebrow, daring him to continue. he didn't.  a piercing scream rent the air followed immediately by a yell of pain. gaga had thrown off her headphones and collapsed on the ground, rocking back and forth with her hands over her ears while hawkeye had thrown his book to the ground where it was smouldering, burning orange, while he held a blackened hand, his face white.  twinkle jumped up and grabbed a water bottle, throwing it to snow who skillfully picked it out of the air and opened it over hawkeye's hand in one quick motion. i jumped up and barely beat amazon to gaga's side. she was crying and there was a thin stream of blood leaking from each ear. i immediately stepped back and let amazon take over. tiny had grabbed the medkit and dropped it at her side, before going outside with giant to get the twins. i called to them to create a perimeter around the tent which was acknowledged with a quick salute. hardass was holding his rifle and standing by the door, shouting orders out of the tent, securing the area.  hawkeye caught my gaze and nodded once. both snow and twinkle helped him over to the washing basin to get his hand in the cold water. i scanned the area. everything secure, everyone doing their jobs. that's when the book caught my eye again. it had stopped burning but what had once been a midnight black cover was now a deep green. i moved to it and knelt. the sand around it had swirled into strange forms in the centre of a double circle that contained a warped five pointed star. the book was in the middle of the star and the symbols that had been on the cover were now gone, replaced with a single blood red eye, orange and yellow flames coming off of it.  that was when i made my mistake. the mistake that would haunt me to the end of the world. i picked up the book.",0,,

105236,"israeli law also restricts where non-jews may live. ""muslims and christians are barred from buying in the jewish quarter of the old city on the grounds of ""historic patterns of life of each community having its own quarter',"" says seidemann, in a phrase eerily reminiscent of apartheid's philosophy. ""but that didn't prevent the israeli government from aggressively pursuing activities to place jews within the muslim quarter. the attitude is: what's mine is exclusively mine, but what's yours is mixed if we happen to target it.""  israeli law permits wholesale confiscation of property inside israel or jerusalem that is owned by palestinians who live in areas defined as ""enemy territory"", including the west bank, which was occupied by jordan until it lost the war against israel in 1967. ""any palestinian who was at any point in 'enemy territory' after 1967, forfeits his property,"" says seidemann. ""but enemy territory includes the west bank. it's a remarkable situation. any property that was ever 'abandoned' by any palestinian becomes state land and is then 'turned over to the jewish people'. any property that once belonged to a jew is 'recovered to the jewish people' and turned over to the settlers.""  ""i hate the term ethnic cleansing in the context of this,"" he says, ""because of the connotations of rape and pillage, which this is not. but there was and is an active government effort using procedures such as this to rid targeted areas of its palestinian residents and turn it into an exclusively or predominantly jewish area. and i say, with regret, that the efforts have been moderately successful.""  the law is not applied in reverse: jews who go to live in west bank settlements do not lose property they may own in tel aviv. last year, sharon's government quietly confiscated thousands of acres of palestinian-owned lands within greater jerusalem without compensation, after a secret cabinet decision to use a 55-year-old law on abandoned property against arabs separated from their olive groves and farms by the west bank barrier. previous governments decided not to apply this law to east jerusalem and the sharon administration was embarrassed enough to expropriate the lands in secret before dropping the policy after an international outcry when it came to light. the palestinians called the confiscations ""legalised theft"".  ""what stands out for jerusalem and johannesburg is that it was and is such a prolonged use of planning in pursuit of a political objective,"" says scott bollens. ""one distinction with south africa is the racial identifiers and the racial rhetoric was so blatant, and it was so visible and it was so much part of apartheid south african language. but, despite the difference in rhetoric, the outcomes are very, very similar and the urban landscape israel has created in the jerusalem region is just as unequal, just as subjugating of the palestinians as the 'group area' planning was in south africa for the blacks.""  in 2004, jerusalem's council approved the first new masterplan for the city since 1959. the plan acknowledges some of the injustices and problems in east jerusalem, provides for greater construction of homes in some arab areas, and criticises jewish settlement in the east of the city. but critics say that at its core is the same obsession with demography and what the plan describes as ""preserving a firm jewish majority in the city"".  a former jerusalem city councillor, meir margalit, says the process was flawed from the start because the steering committee of 31 people who put the plan together included only one arab. ""it is characteristic everywhere of colonial regimes which believe that the 'natives' are worthy neither of suitable representation nor of being masters of their own fate. the planning team apparently sets out from the assumption that, in any case, one is dealing with a jewish city and therefore there is no reason to ask the opinion of anyone who does not belong to the jewish people,"" he says.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/story/0,,1703245,00.html",0,,
424744,"hello, thanks for the detailed comment!  i'll try to post something in sunlight :)  **pics will be up late friday!**  i wrote a long thing and then reddit fucked up and erased it, so here's trial #2.  **about me:** for reference, i have black hair and brown eyes that are so dark they might as well be black.  i am east asian, so i do have a yellow/golden cast to my skin, but i know that doesn't necessarily mean i'm automatically warm-toned.  i do have a tan right now, which is why i would classify myself as light-medium - without the tan, i would say i'm light-skinned, but not light enough to be fair-skinned, if that makes sense.  **this whole ""am i olive????!!!!!"" skintone identity crisis thing started** because i got tanner over the summer and then realized that my tan doesn't look like the same undertone as my normal skin, and then i was super confused.  my face didn't tan evenly, so the parts of my face that didn't really tan (undereyes, tops of cheeks, eye area in general) were still had the pinkish undertones they normally do, but my forehead, sides of my face, and chin did tan, and they look *weird*.  i don't know how to describe the color, but i would say it's greenish and orangish at the same time.  d:  i don't know if i look ashy, i just think i look weird af.  my hands also tanned, and sometimes the backsides of my hands look like they might have a greenish cast.  but all in all i'm really bad at being able to tell whether it's the lighting or whether i'm actually green.  **eyeshadow:** i don't wear much (extremely hooded eyes) - on the occasions that i do, i usually fuck up badly somewhere, give up, and smudge everything into a franken-smoky eye.  throw on a few coats of mascara &amp; call it done.  haven't really started to explore color yet besides jewel-toned eyeliner in the waterline.  **clothes:** ohoooo boy.  had a phase where i only bought black shirts.  i currently have enough black shirts (yes, i kept the ones i wore in high school.  quit judging me.  i still fit in them because i haven't grown since then.) to be able to wear a different one every day for 2-3 weeks and not run out.  have diversified a lot now - i really like jewel tones.  my favorite 2 shirts/tees are [dark hunter green](http://i.imgur.com/lzknorh.jpg) and [dark charcoal grey](https://dm.victoriassecret.com/product/swatch/125x125/v818665_163.jpg).  3rd favorite is a burgundy tee [like this color but a tiny bit warmer iirc](http://www.winter-company.com/t3_477/uploads/tx_winprod02/wla3981-burgundy.jpg), but i feel like it looks more muted on me than the hunter green one even though they appear to have the same value/saturation (in hsv terms, which i might be misusing horribly).  i avoid brown/orange/yellow anything like the bloody plague because i look awful in those colors and/or they just don't appeal to me at all.  i also can't stand pink and i don't wear it.  i do wear white and light grey, and i don't feel like those colors wash me out or make me look weird at all.  i wear brights too, but prefer muted jewel tones esp in red &amp; purple color families.  i feel more at home in blue-tinged greens (like hunter green) than yellow-tinged greens (like olive green) - well, i know i like the blue-tinged greens better on the rack, but i can't tell whether they look better on me bc i think i'm biased :3  i like blue brights/very saturated blues/very saturated any color that leans blue (sapphire blue, royal blue, [deep teal](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/c9/69/5d/c9695d89fd4758accaa441481da549dc.jpg), [deep/clear blue-violet](http://www.colorhexa.com/5200a3.png)).  actually in general i tend to like to wear colors that are high (or medium to high) saturation and medium (to medium-low) value.  i did find a pastel blue (might be more of a cyan color?  it was more saturated than something i'd consider a pastel color) shirt i liked over the summer, and i wore it a lot because i thought it looked good against my tan.  [top right corner is the approximate color.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyan#/media/file:cyanicon.png)  jury's still out on mint &amp; lavender - i think they're a little too unsaturated, but i'm not sure.  also still debating corals, i'm not sure if coral as a whole looks good on me unless it's more warm pink than orange - orange is a no-no and i know i look weird in orange-leaning anything if it's light/bright, even orange-leaning reds if the orange is strong enough.  warmer maroons get a slim pass but again, i don't like wearing brown.  **jewelry:** i have sensitive skin &amp; am pretty sure i have a metal allergy - i can't wear costume jewelry.  sooo i'm not sure.  i also don't own anything gold.  i own silver pieces, and i like them, but i think platinum would look better as it is brighter.  haven't worn copper in a long time - the last time i wore costume jewelry was when i was a kid, and my skin turned green and then got an itchy rash, so i quit wearing it.  i suspect it was copper (the greenness) although i could be terribly wrong - let me know.  **reds vs. berries &amp; wines:** i...have a lot of trouble finding berries that aren't too purple and wines that aren't too brown or purple.  weird as it is, reds are my comfort zone when it comes to lipstick because you can't *not* look fab.  (this is my brain's logic, anyway :p)  **foundation:** i don't wear foundation and don't really have plans to (easily clogged and very productive pores) for a while, so no experience with that struggle.  i have never actually put a foundation on my face before.  **color palette:** i've looked at the 12 seasons thingies and i can never decide between deep winter and deep autumn.  which makes no sense because one is cool and one is warm, right???  but i like some colors of both.  just not the pastels of winter, and not the browns of autumn.  does that sort of make sense?  **disclaimer:** i seriously can't tell whether the color palettes i've picked for myself are things that actually look good on me, or whether i'm just picking things i think look nice but they actually look terrible on me.  in any case, i hope this was somewhat useful?  if you have any insights, let me know - i'm still completely lost!!  **eta:** i have no idea whether i'm neutral.  i also have no idea how to tell between olive and neutral.  any help appreciated on that front as well.  d:  sorry i'm such a lost cause!!",1,0,

240151,"okay, here it is.  i can't give you alton brown levels of exactness, but this should be specific enough to get you through.  you'll need...  * one pizza stone (available at target for about $11)  * one roll of baking parchment (not wax paper; you'll find it in the baking aisle at giant eagle or the sandwich bag/plastic wrap section at target)  * two bags of ready-to-use pizza dough from trader joe's.  i prefer the plain white bread variety, as it's most authentic.  it comes in their fridge section in a plastic bag and it works best at room temperature.  * one 28 oz (large) can of whole tomatoes.  i prefer the fire roasted variety, but any will work  * one large ball of fresh mozzarella (trader joe's has it on the cheap, and it's good)  * salt (about 1 tsp)  * white sugar (about 1/2 tsp)  * one wedge of hard cheese (parmesan, asiago, peccorino romano; any of these will work), shredded  * about one cup of coarse cornmeal  * optional toppings: fresh basil (add after cooking), vegetables, meats, crushed red pepper flakes (add after cooking)  * a stand-in pizza peel.  this can be either a real pizza peel (they have them at wasserstrom, which is an awesome store btw), a baking sheet, or a flattened cardboard box  * an oven (obviously)  to start with, preheat your oven to its absolute hottest possible temperature.  preheat the stone with the oven.  just leave it on the rack as the oven cranks up.  to prep the tomato sauce: drain the tomatoes and ""pop"" them.  rinse them thoroughly to get rid of residual can-taste and to wash the seeds away.  take your rinsed tomato chunks and either pulse them in a blender, food processor, or chop them up with a knife.  mix the salt and sugar into the tomatoes, but don't do anything else to season them.  the sauce can be a little chunky, but try to get it pretty broken up.  to prep the cheese: slice the mozzarella into rounds (about 1/4"" thick each).  have the shredded parmesan (or whatever) standing by.  to prep the crust: unroll a sheet of parchment roughly the size of your pizza stone.  sprinkle it evenly with cornmeal.  remove one ball of dough from the bag and flatten in (in the air, not on the counter) into a disc.  hold the disc perpendicular to the counter and rotate it like a wheel, stretching a bit as you go.  lay it down on the prepared parchment/cornmeal and continue to stretch it, pulling it outward.  if it breaks, no big: just pull a chunk off the edge and patch it.  you should be able to get a 12"" pizza from it without a great level of stretching skill.  to assemble: spread a thin (see-through) layer of sauce over the crust, leaving about a 1"" margin at the edges.  too much sauce will create watery pockets and won't allow the dough to cook, so go easy on it.  add the mozzarella, leaving about 1/2-1"" between each slice.  sprinkle the pizza liberally with the hard cheese/parmesan shreds.  add toppings if you'd like, but do so sparingly.  the pizza won't cook if it's weighed down with stuff.  is the oven smoking hot?  good.  now for a fun part.  get your makeshift (or real) pizza peel and hold it against the edge of your counter.  slide the parchment with the pizza on it onto your peel.  open your oven, and with a deft flick of the wrist, slide the parchment from the peel to the stone.  if you're not ready for flicks of wrists, s'okay: you can drag the parchment over to the stone.  just try to make the transaction quick because your oven loses heat very quickly.  now, turn the oven light on if you have one.  the pizza will take about 9 minutes, depending on how hot it gets.  it's best if you can keep an eye on it continuously the first time you try this, as every oven is different and i can't give you an exact time.  if you don't have an oven window or light, peek at the pizza every three minutes after the first five minutes until it's bubbly and golden brown.    when the pizza looks done (good and browned and bubbly!), use your peel to slide it out of the oven.  don't take the whole stone out; it's too hot and could crack from thermal shock.  cool the pizza on the counter for about three minutes before slicing and devouring, as it will give the cheese and dough time to set.  slice and top with crushed red pepper flakes, fresh basil, or whatever else your heart desires.  is that exact enough?  it's really simple.  the second bag of dough is because one of these is never enough to go around.  they get annihilated.",0,,

720834,"weed from the corner bottleshop: the weed is all quite potent, but a bit dry. you can buy as little as a $1 spliff or as much as an eighth, but at all levels it's too expensive unless everything else is closed or you don't really want to walk very far. however, finally you can get a rockstar, a hip flask of vodka, a blunt wrap or pack of papers and  and a few nugs all in one purchase. previously you had to buy everything but the weed in the store, and then step outside for a second transaction with some kid wearing three cell phones, baggy pants, a $200 baseball cap covered in graphics of various guns and an oversized t-shirt so ornately decorated with rhinstone-embedded marijuana leaf imprints you actually find yourself questioning if he might be gay.  weed from the grocery store: there's only one kind of weed, and it comes in a cellophane baggy on a lurid orange hang tag, found amongst the ""ethnic spices"" isle, hanging between some bland looking dried peppers and a pale bag of dubious looking horchata drink mix, all in the same plastic bags. the weed looks and smells suspiciously like oregano. despite this it still costs $20 per gram.  weed from bevmo: everything is available from $5 bales of ditchweed to $200 dollar a gram gourmet hybrids grown exclusively in a caviar-seaweed mulch constantly prayed over by rastafarian priests playing deep, soothing dub. thankfully, there's also an array of consumer friendly pot - all of which pretty much costs $20 a gram, just like before legalization.  weed from trader joe's, round 1: decided by a coin-toss, trader joe's decides that weed is ""produce"" to be sold in the ""produce"" section. therefore there is only one or two kinds of weed. one is labeled ""organic weed"" while the other just says ""weed"". the organic variety costs about 30% more by volume. both varieties come in the same packaging - a clear plastic shell crudely taped shut, with simple labeling. the weed in both containers looks roughly identical, and it looks like they came from the same farm. in some trader joe's, you can find ""fresh weed"" in the refrigerated produce isle between the bags of spinach and blocks of feta. it looks just like the other weed they sell, except it is slightly moist and refrigerated.  weed from trader joe's, round 2: realizing the error, the trader joe's team moves all weed from the produce isle to the wine, beer and spirits isle. there are now approximately 50 kinds of weed here. many have hipster and irony-friendly labels such as ""skunk ass"", ""sierra nevada golden glow grow"", ""dude, where's my car?"" and ""indica uber alles"". upon asking a friendly, hawaiian-shirted associate which one would be the equivalent of their affordable but highly recommended monopolowa vodka offering, you're readily directed to a bag of intense looking but affordable flowers in a plain looking package, labled ""afghani death blossoms"". it does the trick nicely.  weed from trader joe's, round 3: same as round two, but the weed has been relocated to the far end of trader joe's infamous snack isle - you know the one, filled with nuts, dried fruits, chocolate covered everything and a startling array of popcorn-like objects and something known as ""pirates booty"" which resembles cheese-dusted styrofoam packing peanuts. free weed samples are given out by an expert bongmaster and spliff roller at a small but comfortable kiosk on an endcap, where samples of lemonade and snacks are also provided.  after lingering for two hours, all hopped up on free coffee and chocolate and more than a little red-eyed, you dumbly shamble down the snack isle to check out. it takes another hour to make it to the checkout line, and you've discovered that your plan to quickly dart in and out of the store has succumbed to an entire shopping cart full of snacks, half of which seem to be variations of ""pirate's booty"", while the other half seems to be about fifty pounds of nuts and another twenty pounds of various kinds of chocolate.  meanwhile, the locally-hired-artist hand-painted signage in your local trader joe's rapidly moves from bland to impressively ornate displays of creativity and whimsy - but things tend to be labeled incorrectly, if the signs are even in the right isles. you mention this to the manager, who replies ""oh, right. i've been meaning to have a chat with him about that, but every time we go on break i forget what it was i was going to talk to him about. did you find everything ok? do you need any... snacks? i think i need some... snacks,"" at which point the manager goes back to trying to build a miniature desktop trebuchet out of pretzels.   and last, but best - weed from the local farmer's market: there's two or three stalls selling weed, each with many varieties. oddly, you remember just a few weeks ago that these same stalls and farmers sold a lot of delicious tomatoes, salad greens, apples, and berries at ridiculously cheap prices. you've often noted the hippy-like nature of the stall operators, and wondered how they could sell vegetables so cheaply week after week. now you know.  the names on the signs are exotic, hand-inked with colorful markers. the signs also indicate local origins, growing conditions, hybrid types and organic or inorganic status. the weed is ridiculously cheap, as well as lush and outrageously delicious - but much of it is also poorly groomed or otherwise rather wild looking. some booths have entire plants hanging in them. when you ask for a twenty dollar bag the rather faded looking hippy farmer shrugs, picks up a large machete and hacks off about half of a plant and stuffs it into your burlap shopping bag, spilling weed everywhere. he or she starts to ask ""is that enough... no, wait..."" and then also puts a large brownie in your bag and then, with a large metal scoop, shovels up about a cupful of what looks like beige sand or salt, drops it in a baggy and also puts that in your bag. ""a little table kief. good for cooking or sprinkling on spliffs! have a great weekend!""  which you do. though you don't remember much of it, you do remember eating everything in the house, including a sandwich involving peanut butter, ice cream, bacon and pancakes that sounded like a good idea at the time but was proven otherwise - much like the attempt at repainting the bathroom about the same time. something about being inspiried by the color of fresh blueberries in vanilla ice cream ""soup"", which involved rushing off to the local hardware store with a handful of blueberries and a bowl of rapidly melting ice cream as ""color samples"".  oh, fine. the weed at whole foods is sold from what used to be the ""olive bar"". even people who really like olives could never figure out why whole foods would dedicate an entire store within a store to olives, but i digress.  there are approximately 400 kinds of weed at the bar. most are sold in bulk from bulk bins. the bins appear to be clean, but if you inspected the inside or underside of the bins you'd probably walk out of the store a distinct shade of unpleasant green which was neither envy nor plant envy.  some of the weed is sold in highly complicated looking recycled-paper packages that look like they were designed by art center or fashion school dropouts, and other boutique brands are packaged in reusable tins (which are promptly thrown away after collecting a dozen or so). the tins have brightly printed, life-affirming quotations all over them by notable, peaceful world figures.  however, even the least expensive bulk weed they have in stock is about 3x overpriced, and appears to be infested with what appear to be organic mites.  just before you make a selection from a bin with only a mild mite infestation, some young rasta looking kid warns you off and asks you to meet him outside, where he hooks you up with a nice bag for about half the price. ""real hippies only come here to shoplift,"" he says knowingly, pulling a vegan deli sandwich out of the cargo pocket of his surplus army jacket and munching on it before walking away.",0,,

852228,"this is really about condé nast (the owners of reddit) and by extension advance publications (the owners of condé nast).  they made a change to their web strategy back in 2006 (when they bought several businesses with online presence - wired and reddit being some or them). they are in the middle of a re-think of that strategy right now, see [here](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/conde-nast-consolidates-digital-assets/story.aspx?guid={45e6018c-7890-442a-9cd0-712f5455b630}&amp;dist=msr_2) and [here](http://www.seyboldreport.com/big-changes-conde-nast).  so the real question, rather than how someone is gaming the system should be what is condé nast up to?   are they restructuring so there's no responsible staff at the moment or does reddit not make them money in which case they may have decided to let it die by neglect (perhaps it's an experiment to see what happens to abandoned social media).  in my view reddit is extremely valuable to a company like advance pubs because they generally cater to, what you could call, the elite (wired mag, golf, the new yorker...). so even if reddit does not make money on its own they'll somehow need to monetize by associate reddit-users with other of their activities.  another valuable that could come out of reddit is the knowledge of how the interests of their core audience (for other products) shift.  edit: forgot links",0,,

175792,"the color scheme of your body  (from color me a season by b. kentner)  **summers**  the summer person has a very pale skin tone. their paleness is often of great concern to them because they look tired and washed out in wrong colors. it is the summer person's lot in life to never have a suntan. if they do tan, they will quickly fade out. i do not encourage summer people to stay in the sun because a suntan is not becoming to them. we should remember also, that over-exposure to the sun's rays can be harmful to the skin.  summer's skin usually has a transparent look to it. it is often fine textured. they have a delicate look in soft pastel colors. when wearing dark, unbecoming colors, dark circles appear under the eyes and all the imperfections of the skin stand out.   skin tone is light with a rosy-red or lilac undertone that does not come up to the surface. summers are not prone to blushing. one might describe the skin tone as transparent looking. in choosing a makeup undertone, they usually use the lightest color with pink tones.    the eye coloring of a summer is usually light blue or grey. they may have a grayish-green or hazel, but very seldom brown. it is most unusual to find a brown eyed summer.   as i talk about the color of the eyes, i want you to understand i am not talking about the season's pattern. another chapter will explain the pattern. what i am talking about is the overall appearance of color as you stand within talking distance to a person. if you carefully study eye coloring you will discover that eyes are really not one color at all, but a combination of many colors. each person's eyes are completely their own color. i have not yet found two persons with exactly the same color eyes. i even find that each eye is different from the other. no one eye in the world is the same as another.  some summers have such deep blue eyes they appear to be brown from a distance. upon close inspection, we find the eyes truly dark blue pools of color.  hair coloring on a summer is usually light brown or blonde and very often these people were towheads when they were little. here again, any hair coloring is possible and they may also have brunette or red hair.  the overall look to a summer is colorless. they are very dependent on clothing colors and makeup if they are a woman. the right colors are extremely important to a summer. color does more for a summer person than any other season.  **springs**   complexions of springs are of two types. 1- light amber with gold tones, and 2- darker suntanned look with a yellow undercast. there is one distinguishing thing with a spring person and it is usually of great concern to them. there is a tendency to blush easily. cheeks are often very rosy, especially after physical exertion or embarrassment. springs do not always have rosy cheeks, but there is a lively appearance to skin tone.  some springs have a very fair skin and ore often analyzed as a summer. the analyst must be very careful to note whether the skin has a rosy undertone or if it is more on the yellow or gold tone. very fair skinned springs who have been told they are summers are usually very dissatisfied with the light pastels of summer. spring people like the brighter colors and are happy wearing them. very light skinned springs will look better in spring colors and may even wear some of the summer colors. the proper cosmetics will help bring out the lively appearance of a lighter spring.  eye colorings of a spring are clear and bright, usually of one color, such as blue, blue-green, grey or grey-green. on close inspection, they may even have a great deal of mustard color yellow around the iris of the eyes. spring eyes have a lively appearance to them and may even appear to be watery. brown eyes are rare, but possible. more will be said on this in the next chapter.  hair may be any color. those red heads with sandy colored hair, blondes or taffy colored hair are often springs. it is not unusual at all to see a spring with very dark brown or black hair.  the overall appearance of spring is ""radiance"", especially when wearing the proper spring colors.  **autumns**   skin tones of autumns correspond to the spring season. that is, the color of the skin has the same gold or yellow undertone. the underlying cheek color, however, is more gold or orange toned than a spring. springs have the same skin coloring, but with rosy colored cheeks. autumns have more of a bronze look to the complexion.  there are fair skinned autumns with lighter gold tones to the skin. a fair skinned autumn will generally have the lighter colored blue, green, grey-green, or any combination of blue and green eyes. a dark autumn often has brown eyes or green eyes with many brown and gold flecks. autumn eyes will generally have gold or brown coloring around the iris or they may be almost clear opaque green with small flecks.  here, again, a fair skinned autumn will be beautiful in autumn colors in their most vivid hue, but they may wear autumn colors in the more pastel shades, giving them a great variety in the earth tones.  i find that hair tone in the autumn is more helpful in analysis than any other season. hair will have a bronze or metallic look to it.  once in a while, i find someone with jet black hair who is an autumn. this is always a delight to me as they are pleasing to the eye when wearing their proper colors. remember, do not rely on hair coloring to find your season!  **winters**   winters skin tone is cool with rose undertones. fair skinned winters may appear almost white, yet the skin will be a bit darker than the very pale skinned summer. there will not be the translucent look that a summer person has. rosy cheeks will not appear naturally on a winter person, this must be added with makeup and is very becoming as i will explain in the chapter on that subject.  dark skinned winters are usually olive skinned with a rose undertone. eye coloring is grey, blue, or combinations of blue and grey, usually not green, very often brown or almost black-brown.  occasionally i find a blonde winter. i get very excited when i find someone with unusual hair or eye coloring for their season because the effect of wearing their proper colors for skin tone can be very dramatic.  most times, a winter person will have brown, dark brown to very black hair. olive skinned winters generally have very dark or black hair. white hair is particularly becoming to a winter.   we may find many unusual variations to the seasons. white hair may be found on every season because of age. often times, a white haired person is analyzed as a summer or winter but in reality would benefit from wearing their proper spring or autumn colors.  as i said before, i get excited with the unusual, because proper clothing and makeup colors create a dramatic picture.  we are trying to find our correct season so we may wear the proper colors. when we are attired in becoming color, people see us, not what we are wearing. when not attired in proper color we appear sallow skinned, tired and ill. every wrong facial contour is accented and blemishes and dark circles stand out. the aged skin appears more lined. when we find our season's colors, our countenance appears to be-   summer - soft, delicate, peaceful, serene, comforting   spring - vibrant, alive, radiant   autumn - dramatic, tawny, coppery, metallic   winter - cool, icy, elegant, regal  we find here a pattern emerging - summers and winters are the cooler seasons - springs and autumns the warm. for accent colors it is wise to choose the corresponding season's colors rather than the other two.  remember, the blue, rose tones of summer and winter; yellow or bronze tones of spring and autumn.",1,0,

909765,"normally i don't resort to hyperbole, but you're the biggest fucktard in the history of the internet.  emanuel worked for democrat paul simon's 1984 election to the u.s. senate, was the national campaign director for the democratic congressional campaign committee in 1988, and then was senior advisor and chief fundraiser for richard m. daley's victorious campaign for mayor of chicago in 1989.  during the 1991 gulf war, emanuel was a civilian volunteer in israel, rust-proofing brakes on an army base in northern israel.[6]  he joined then-arkansas governor bill clinton's presidential primary campaign in 1991, serving as the campaign's director of finance. emanuel insisted that clinton schedule a lot of time for fundraising and greatly delay campaigning in new hampshire. after much dispute within the campaign about the issue, clinton eventually agreed, embarking on an aggressive fundraising campaign across the nation. the fundraising paid off later, providing the campaign a vital buffer to keep buying television time as attacks on clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the new hampshire primary.  clinton's most serious primary rival, paul tsongas (the new hampshire democratic primary winner in 1992), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. richard mintz, a washington public relations consultant who worked with emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: ""it was that million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in new hampshire [over clinton's relationship with gennifer flowers and the controversy over his draft status during the vietnam war].""[7] emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with potential donors within the jewish community helped clinton amass a then-unheard-of $72 million.[7]  following the campaign, emanuel became a senior advisor to clinton at the white house from 1993 to 1998. in the white house, emanuel was initially assistant to the president for political affairs and then senior advisor to the president for policy and strategy. he was a leading strategist in the unsuccessful white house efforts to institute universal healthcare and many other clinton initiatives.[8]  one of his proudest moments during the clinton administration ""was an event that touched his political sensibilities and his personal ties to israel: the 1993 rose garden signing ceremony after the oslo accords between israel and palestine. emanuel directed the details of the ceremony, down to the choreography of the famous handshake between israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin and palestinian authority president yasser arafat.""[7]  the us house seat in the 5th district of illinois was previously held by rod blagojevich, who chose not to run for re-election, but instead successfully ran for governor of illinois. emanuel chose to run for this seat.  his strongest opponent of the seven other candidates in the 2002 democratic primary — the real contest in this heavily democratic district — was former illinois state representative nancy kaszak, who had unsuccessfully opposed blagojevich in the 1996 primary.   emanuel won the primary and easily defeated republican candidate mark augusti in the general election. emanuel supported the october 2002 joint congressional resolution authorizing the iraq war, differentiating himself from all nine other democratic members of the illinois congressional delegation (sen. richard durbin, reps. bobby rush, jesse jackson, jr., bill lipinski, luis gutiérrez, danny k. davis, jan schakowsky, jerry costello and evans) elected in 2002.[11]  emanuel was named the chair of the democratic congressional campaign committee in 2005. prior to his work for clinton, emanuel had been an employee of the committee, which principally serves to recruit candidates for the house and to raise funds to assist both new candidates and incumbents from the democratic party in an effort to gain democratic representation in the house.  he declared that in his new role ""winning is everything"", and he urged democratic candidates to adopt more centrist positions. emanuel was known to have had disagreements over democratic election strategy with democratic national committee chairman howard dean. dean favored a ""50 state strategy"", building support for the democratic party over the long term, while emanuel believed a more tactical approach, focusing attention on key districts, was necessary to ensure victory.[12]  ultimately the democratic party enjoyed considerable success in the 2006 elections, gaining 30 seats in the house. emanuel has received considerable praise for his stewardship of the dccc during this election cycle, even from illinois republican rep. ray lahood who said ""he legitimately can be called the golden boy of the democratic party today. he recruited the right candidates, found the money and funded them, and provided issues for them. rahm did what no one else could do in seven cycles.""[13] nevertheless, some of the 2006 victories came in areas that had trended strongly republican in recent years, such as nancy boyda's defeat of jim ryun in kansas.",0,,

274562,"chapter sixteen: the seventh winter   1   the woods were white and beautiful. snow covered the ground and hung in layered mounds from the shaggy evergreen branches. occasionally, the wind whistling through the trees would vortex, causing a miniature white tornado to dance across the powder, then dissolve back into cold air. rays of sunlight shot through the small openings in the wooly green canopy like intangible golden pillars. the only sound was the shuffling of frozen feet. gray and blackened flesh moved through the branches and past the stout trunks of the larger trees. two men stood back to back in the snow. one was taller and broader than the other and stood at his full height, facing east toward the origin of the beautiful golden rays. he wore a long white coat that stopped at his calves and flapped gently in the wind just above the snow. his boots were buried in white, making him seem to be part of the winter blanket itself, rising above the frost like a thin, un-jolly snowman. his head was covered in a large white hood that came down to his brow. a sleek pair of sunglasses shielded his eyes, and his breathe steamed through the white wool scarf that covered his nose and mouth. over his coat he wore a set of olive drab suspenders that supported the utility belt around his waist. there were pouches all along the belt, and on his right hip, a holstered glock pistol. his gloved right hand gripped a curved kukri machete, which he let dangle at his side. his left hand held the blackened handle of a tomahawk. the hardwood stock of an ak-47 rose above his left shoulder. the second, smaller man did not stand at his full height, but crouched low and to one side. in his hands he held a japanese katana with a gold pommel and hand guard. the fine black silk hand-wrapping was thin and tattered in places. he held the weapon close to himself, the blade reversed, running down his outstretched leg. the sword glowed orange, painted by the morning sun. he too wore a long white overcoat with combat gear strapped over it, but he had no hood. a white ski mask and the same dark glasses covered his head and face. the thick wool scarf wrapped around his neck and mouth made the top of his head look like an egg huddled in a nest of snow. his gloves were black, and he bore an army-issue m4 carbine on his slender back. he did not look like a snowman standing tall above the earth, but rather the snow-covered statue of an ancient warrior, poised and ready to defend himself. neither of the men moved at all. they stood quiet, alert, ready. their enemies didn’t know it—in fact, were incapable of knowing it—but the two men had drawn an imaginary circle on the ground, ten meters in diameter. the first gray-skinned wretch moved into the clearing from the surrounding trees. it slouched at the shoulders and staggered as it moved forward. one leg was almost totally stripped of flesh. it held out its gnarled arms as it approached the smaller man, who tightened his grip on the curved wooden handle as the thing neared the rim of the invisible ring. it stepped its fleshless foot into the ring and was headless within seven tenths of a second. its body jerked backward, as if the wound had been a backstab, and fell limp into the snow. the head fell facedown beside it.  “good,” the bigger man whispered. he hadn’t yet moved. “now stab the eye.” the small man lunged forward and pinned the head to the ground through the back of the skull and out the left orbital socket. he raised the head from the ground. there was only a tiny brown stain on the snow where it had been. the head did not move or try to bite, and flew off into the bushes as the small man flicked his blade to the right. the small man did not clean the blade, not yet. near the big man’s side of the circle, a small dead child wandered over the line. without hesitation, the big man raised his left arm and brought the tomahawk smashing down upon the child’s head. the small stainless steel axe head came loose as the grotesque corpse fell to the ground, truly dead.  another, a bloated naked thing with its bowels trailing in rotting brown strands behind it, stepped into the circle. with a small grunt, the big man wheeled to his left and silenced its moans with a powerful chop of his curved blade. the heavy head fell and was not cushioned by the snow. it hit the frozen soil with a solid thud. the big man recovered, stepped forward, and crushed the thing’s skull with his boot heel. its wood-like crack echoed through the trees.  the small man’s coat whipped up a swirl of snow as he twirled like a dancer and gracefully unfolded his arms. the two heads seemed to fall in perfect synchrony, but the bodies fell in their own ways. another one, coming in from the right, had most of its lower left torso missing. the rot-covered spine looked a grotesque clay brown in the morning sun. the small man struck its head off. the two worked in harmony, weaving in and out of one another, making sure that the other was at a safe distance when it came time to strike. no energy was wasted on redundant theatrics that would only intimidate living attackers. neither of the men adopted a particularly complicated stance other than in preparing to strike. every movement was a necessary one.  close to a dozen bodies lined their transparent circle now. from above, it looked like a giant white eye, rimmed in gray, with two pupils bouncing from side to side. the whites swirled from their coats. their breath fogged the air as they fought, sometimes making it difficult to see far back into the woods surrounding the clearing. the once-smooth blanket of snow was now viciously furrowed with tracks and body prints. the big man held his breath to get a clear view of the tree line. the living dead’s rate of advance was increasing steadily. he killed four more before sliding his machete into its scabbard behind him and securing the tomahawk in his belt.  “guns,” he said quietly after the small man’s strike was complete and another body deposited onto the fattening gray edge of the ring. the small man produced a small rag from his pocket, scooped up some snow, and wiped the filth from his blade. it was sheathed a moment later. the small man’s rifle was out a bit faster than the bigger man’s. both fired at will at anything that approached the ring of the circle. at such a close range, all of their shots were true, sending pieces of skull and reanimated brain matter back into the woods. their circle expanded as their shots got longer.  the bigger man dropped his left hand from the wooden forend of his ak to the pouch on his left hip. he opened the flap and produced a long, curved banana clip. he dropped the empty clip between his left middle and ring fingers and used the other fingers to fit the new clip into place. it locked in with a click and the left hand deposited the empty clip into the pouch.  undead were now tripping and crawling over the bodies of the slain. the all-important head shot had just become much more difficult to achieve. through his small scope the small man would see a rotten face flash into view, only to disappear an instant later behind an expired zombie. he was starting to miss, and often. “heads’re moving too much,” he shouted over his shoulder to the big man, who’d already slung his rifle over his shoulder. the big man responded by pulling down his scarf, cupping his hands to his mouth. “move it up, fellas!” he shouted to the east, his teeth catching the light of a thin sun-beam.  there was a rustling back in the snow-caked fir branches, followed by the sound of rope softly thudding into the snow. six white-covered men of varying sizes and weaponry drifted to the earth like spiders. not even the enormous one made a sound. they dropped ropes and drew weapons immediately. blades and cudgels of various kinds grinded and sang as they were draw from their holding places.  crawling corpses were put down as the tree-men advanced from behind. skulls cracked and split as the undead continued to move into the clearing toward the duo. in a matter of seconds the tree-men reached the two surrounded fighters and absorbed them into the unit. with the line now two men wider, they moved west across the clearing, killing as they went.  it was over soon. the eight men stood by the jagged western rim of the clearing and looked over the multitude of gray bodies half-immersed in the fresh white snow.  shoulders heaved and clouds of vapor plumed from covered mouths into the frigid air.  at last, the bigger of the two for-goers pulled the hood from his head and the sunglasses from his cold brown eyes. “all right. mark it up, please, mr. arnold.” the giant stepped forward, reached a big hand into his heavy white coat, produced a can of neon pink spray paint, and set to marking the closest trees with large xs. “grab gear, fellas, it’s breakfast time,” jake jones said to the others. the tree-men, save for big phil, began trudging back to their perches to retrieve their guns. the small man stepped after them, but was held back by jake’s hand on his shoulder.  “what is it?” he said in a mid-pitched adolescent voice, a voice with the warbled gravel of newly-developed depth. his left hand left the hilt of his katana and pulled the mask up and off of his head, sending his tousle of curly blonde hair flapping in the wind like a bad comb-over. jones smiled and punched him lightly in the shoulder. “not too shabby back there. you just might be useful around here, you know,” he said warmly, and chuckled. trace gave him the stink-eye as he stuffed his mask into his coat and slid his sunglasses back onto his face. “might? know where you can shove your might, jones?” jake laughed out loud and gave trace a gentle shove toward the others. “all right, tough guy. go carry phil’s deer for him if you’re such a hard-ass.”",0,,
137384,"inhale.  take in as much air as you can.  this story should last about as long as you can hold your breath, and then just a little bit longer. so listen as fast as you can.  a friend of mine, when he was thirteen years old he heard about ""pegging."" this is when a guy gets banged up the butt with a dildo. stimulate the prostate gland hard enough, and the rumor is you can have explosive hands-free orgasms. at that age, this friend's a little sex maniac. he's always jonesing for a better way to get his rocks off. he goes out to buy a carrot and some petroleum jelly. to conduct a little private research. then he pictures how it's going to look at the supermarket checkstand, the lonely carrot and petroleum jelly rolling down the conveyer belt toward the grocery store cashier. all the shoppers waiting in line, watching. everyone seeing the big evening he has planned.  so, my friend, he buys milk and eggs and sugar and a carrot, all the ingredients for a carrot cake. and vaseline.  like he's going home to stick a carrot cake up his butt.  at home, he whittles the carrot into a blunt tool. he slathers it with grease and grinds his ass down on it. then, nothing. no orgasm. nothing happens except it hurts.   then, this kid, his mom yells it's suppertime. she says to come down, right now.  he works the carrot out and stashes the slippery, filthy thing in the dirty clothes under his bed.  after dinner, he goes to find the carrot and it's gone. all his dirty clothes, while he ate dinner, his mom grabbed them all to do laundry. no way could she not find the carrot, carefully shaped with a paring knife from her kitchen, still shiny with lube and stinky.  this friend of mine, he waits months under a black cloud, waiting for his folks to confront him. and they never do. ever. even now he's grown up, that invisible carrot hangs over every christmas dinner, every birthday party. every easter egg hunt with his kids, his parents' grandkids, that ghost carrot is hovering over all of them.  that something too awful to name.  people in france have a phrase: ""spirit of the stairway."" in french: esprit de l'escalier. it means that moment when you find the answer, but it's too late. say you're at a party and someone insults you. you have to say something. so under pressure, with everybody watching, you say something lame. but the moment you leave the party…  as you start down the stairway, then -- magic. you come up with the perfect thing you should've said. the perfect crippling put-down.  that's the spirit of the stairway.  the trouble is even the french don't have a phrase for the stupid things you actually do say under pressure. those stupid, desperate things you actually think or do.  some deeds are too low to even get a name. too low to even get talked about.  looking back, kid-psych experts, school counselors now say that most of the last peak in teen suicide was kids trying to choke while they beat off. their folks would find them, a towel twisted around the kid's neck, the towel tied to the rod in their bedroom closet, the kid dead. dead sperm everywhere. of course the folks cleaned up. they put some pants on their kid. they made it look… better. intentional at least. the regular kind of sad, teen suicide.  another friend of mine, a kid from school, his older brother in the navy said how guys in the middle east jack off different than we do here. this brother was stationed in some camel country where the public market sells what could be fancy letter openers. each fancy tool is just a thin rod of polished brass or silver, maybe as long as your hand, with a big tip at one end, either a big metal ball or the kind of fancy carved handle you'd see on a sword. this navy brother says how arab guys get their dick hard and then insert this metal rod inside the whole length of their boner. they jack off with the rod inside, and it makes getting off so much better. more intense.  it's this big brother who travels around the world, sending back french phrases. russian phrases. helpful jack-off tips.  after this, the little brother, one day he doesn't show up at school. that night, he calls to ask if i'll pick up his homework for the next couple weeks. because he's in the hospital.  he's got to share a room with old people getting their guts worked on. he says how they all have to share the same television. all he's got for privacy is a curtain. his folks don't come and visit. on the phone, he says how right now his folks could just kill his big brother in the navy.  on the phone, the kid says how -- the day before -- he was just a little stoned. at home in his bedroom, he was flopped on the bed. he was lighting a candle and flipping through some old porno magazines, getting ready to beat off. this is after he's heard from his navy brother. that helpful hint about how arabs beat off. the kid looks around for something that might do the job. a ball-point pen's too big. a pencil's too big and rough. but dripped down the side of the candle, there's a thin, smooth ridge of wax that just might work. with just the tip of one finger, this kid snaps the long ridge of wax off the candle. he rolls it smooth between the palms of his hands. long and smooth and thin.  stoned and horny, he slips it down inside, deeper and deeper into the piss slit of his boner. with a good hank of the wax still poking out the top, he gets to work.  even now, he says those arab guys are pretty damn smart. they've totally re-invented jacking off. flat on his back in bed, things are getting so good, this kid can't keep track of the wax. he's one good squeeze from shooting his wad when the wax isn't sticking out anymore.  the thin wax rod, it's slipped inside. all the way inside. so deep inside he can't even feel the lump of it inside his piss tube.  from downstairs, his mom shouts it's suppertime. she says to come down, right now. this wax kid and the carrot kid are different people, but we all live pretty much the same life.  it's after dinner when the kid's guts start to hurt. it's wax so he figured it would just melt inside him and he'd pee it out. now his back hurts. his kidneys. he can't stand straight.  this kid talking on the phone from his hospital bed, in the background you can hear bells ding, people screaming. game shows.  the x-rays show the truth, something long and thin, bent double inside his bladder. this long, thin v inside him, it's collecting all the minerals in his piss. it's getting bigger and more rough, coated with crystals of calcium, it's bumping around, ripping up the soft lining of his bladder, blocking his piss from getting out. his kidneys are backed up. what little that leaks out his dick is red with blood.  this kid and his folks, his whole family, them looking at the black x-ray with the doctor and the nurses standing there, the big v of wax glowing white for everybody to see, he has to tell the truth. the way arabs get off. what his big brother wrote him from the navy.  on the phone, right now, he starts to cry.  they paid for the bladder operation with his college fund. one stupid mistake, and now he'll never be a lawyer.  sticking stuff inside yourself. sticking yourself inside stuff. a candle in your dick or your head in a noose, we knew it was going to be big trouble.  what got me in trouble, i called it pearl diving. this meant whacking off underwater, sitting on the bottom at the deep end of my parents' swimming pool. with one deep breath, i'd kick my way to the bottom and slip off my swim trucks. i'd sit down there for two, three, four minutes.  just from jacking off, i had huge lung capacity. if i had the house to myself, i'd do this all afternoon. after i'd finally pump out my stuff, my sperm, it would hang there in big, fat, milky gobs.  after that was more diving, to catch it all. to collect it and wipe each handful in a towel. that's why it was called pearl diving. even with chlorine, there was my sister to worry about. or, christ almighty, my mom.  that used to be my worst fear in the world: my teenage virgin sister, thinking she's just getting fat, then giving birth to a two-headed retard baby. both heads looking just like me. me, the father and the uncle.  in the end, it's never what you worry about that gets you.  the best part of pearl diving was the inlet port for the swimming pool filter and the circulation pump. the best part was getting naked and sitting on it.  as the french would say: who doesn't like getting their butt sucked?  still, one minute you're just a kid getting off, and the next minute you'll never be a lawyer.  one minute, i'm settling on the pool bottom, and the sky is wavy, light blue through eight feet of water above my head. the world is silent except for the heartbeat in my ears. my yellow-striped swim trunks are looped around my neck for safe keeping, just in case a friend, a neighbor, anybody shows up to ask why i skipped football practice. the steady suck of the pool inlet hole is lapping at me and i'm grinding my skinny white ass around on that feeling.  one minute, i've got enough air, and my dick's in my hand. my folks are gone at their work and my sister's got ballet. nobody's supposed to be home for hours.  my hand brings me right to getting off, and i stop. i swim up to catch another big breath. i dive down and settle on the bottom.  i do this again and again.  this must be why girls want to sit on your face. the suction is like taking a dump that never ends. my dick hard and getting my butt eaten out, i do not need air. my heartbeat in my ears, i stay under until bright stars of light start worming around in my eyes. my legs straight out, the back of each knee rubbed raw against the concrete bottom. my toes are turning blue, my toes and fingers wrinkled from being so long in the water.  and then i let it happen. the big white gobs start spouting. the pearls.  it's then i need some air. but when i go to kick off against the bottom, i can't. i can't get my feet under me. my ass is stuck.  emergency paramedics will tell you that every year about 150 people get stuck this way, sucked by a circulation pump. get your long hair caught, or your ass, and you're going to drown. every year, tons of people do. most of them in florida.  people just don't talk about it. not even french people talk about everything.  getting one knee up, getting one foot tucked under me, i get to half standing when i feel the tug against my butt. getting my other foot under me, i kick off against the bottom. i'm kicking free, not touching the concrete, but not getting to the air, either.  still kicking water, thrashing with both arms, i'm maybe halfway to the surface but not going higher. the heartbeat inside my head getting loud and fast.  the bright sparks of light crossing and criss-crossing my eyes, i turn and look back… but it doesn't make sense. this thick rope, some kind of snake, blue-white and braided with veins has come up out of the pool drain and it's holding onto my butt. some of the veins are leaking blood, red blood that looks black underwater and drifts away from little rips in the pale skin of the snake. the blood trails away, disappearing in the water, and inside the snake's thin, blue-white skin you can see lumps of some half-digested meal.  that's the only way this makes sense. some horrible sea monster, a sea serpent, something that's never seen the light of day, it's been hiding in the dark bottom of the pool drain, waiting to eat me.  so… i kick at it, at the slippery, rubbery knotted skin and veins of it, and more of it seems to pull out of the pool drain. it's maybe as long as my leg now, but still holding tight around my butthole. with another kick, i'm an inch closer to getting another breath. still feeling the snake tug at my ass, i'm an inch closer to my escape.  knotted inside the snake, you can see corn and peanuts. you can see a long bright-orange ball. it's the kind of horse-pill vitamin my dad makes me take, to help put on weight. to get a football scholarship. with extra iron and omega-three fatty acids.  it's seeing that vitamin pill that saves my life.  it's not a snake. it's my large intestine, my colon pulled out of me. what doctors call, prolapsed. it's my guts sucked into the drain.  paramedics will tell you a swimming pool pump pulls 80 gallons of water every minute. that's about 400 pounds of pressure. the big problem is we're all connected together inside. your ass is just the far end of your mouth. if i let go, the pump keeps working - unraveling my insides -- until it's got my tongue. imagine taking a 400-pound shit, and you can see how this might turn you inside out.  what i can tell you is your guts don't feel much pain. not the way your skin feels pain. the stuff you're digesting, doctor's call it fecal matter. higher up is chyme, pockets of a thin runny mess studded with corn and peanuts and round green peas.  that's all this soup of blood and corn, shit and sperm and peanuts floating around me. even with my guts unraveling out my ass, me holding onto what's left, even then my first want is to somehow get my swimsuit back on.  god forbid my folks see my dick.  my one hand holding a fist around my ass, my other hand snags my yellow-striped swim trunks and pulls them from around my neck. still, getting into them is impossible.  you want to feel your intestines, go buy a pack of those lamb-skin condoms. take one out and unroll it. pack it with peanut butter. smear it with petroleum jelly and hold it under water. then, try to tear it. try to pull it in half. it's too tough and rubbery. it's so slimy you can't hold on.  a lamb-skin condom, that's just plain old intestine.  you can see what i'm up against.  you let go for a second, and you're gutted.  you swim for the surface, for a breath, and you're gutted.  you don't swim, and you drown.  it's a choice between being dead right now or a minute from right now.  what my folks will find after work is a big naked fetus, curled in on itself. floating in the cloudy water of their backyard pool. tethered to the bottom by a thick rope of veins and twisted guts. the opposite of a kid hanging himself to death while he jacks off. this is the baby they brought home from the hospital thirteen years ago. here's the kid they hoped would snag a football scholarship and get an mba. who'd care for them in their old age. here's all their hopes and dreams. floating here, naked and dead. all around him, big milky pearls of wasted sperm.  either that or my folks will find me wrapped in a bloody towel, collapsed halfway from the pool to the kitchen telephone, the ragged, torn scrap of my guts still hanging out the leg of my yellow-striped swim trunks.  what even the french won't talk about.  that big brother in the navy, he taught us one other good phrase. a russian phrase. the way we say: ""i need that like i need a hole in my head…"" russian people say: ""i need that like i need teeth in my asshole…""  mne eto nado kak zuby v zadnitse  those stories about how animals caught in a trap will chew off their leg, well, any coyote would tell you a couple bites beats the hell out of being dead.  hell… even if you're russian, some day you just might want those teeth.  otherwise, what you have to do is -- you have to twist around. you hook one elbow behind your knee and pull that leg up into your face. you bite and snap at your own ass. you run out of air, and you will chew through anything to get that next breath.  it's not something you want to tell a girl on the first date. not if you expect a kiss good night.  if i told you how it tasted, you would never, ever again eat calamari.  it's hard to say what my parents were more disgusted by: how i'd got in trouble or how i'd saved myself. after the hospital, my mom said, ""you didn't know what you were doing, honey. you were in shock."" and she learned how to cook poached eggs.  all those people grossed out or feeling sorry for me…  i need that like i need teeth in my asshole.  nowadays, people always tell me i look too skinny. people at dinner parties get all quiet and pissed off when i don't eat the pot roast they cooked. pot roast kills me. baked ham. anything that hangs around inside my guts for longer than a couple hours, it comes out still food. home-cooked lima beans or chunk light tuna fish, i'll stand up and find it still sitting there in the toilet.  after you have a radical bowel resectioning, you don't digest meat so great. most people, you have five feet of large intestine. i'm lucky to have my six inches. so i never got a football scholarship. never got an mba. both my friends, the wax kid and the carrot kid, they grew up, got big, but i've never weighed a pound more than i did that day when i was thirteen.  another big problem was my folks paid a lot of good money for that swimming pool. in the end my dad just told the pool guy it was a dog. the family dog fell in and drowned. the dead body got pulled into the pump. even when the pool guy cracked open the filter casing and fished out a rubbery tube, a watery hank of intestine with a big orange vitamin pill still inside, even then, my dad just said, ""that dog was fucking nuts.""  even from my upstairs bedroom window, you could hear my dad say, ""we couldn't trust that dog alone for a second…""  then my sister missed her period.   even after they changed the pool water, after they sold the house and we moved to another state, after my sister's abortion, even then my folks never mentioned it again.  ever.  that is our invisible carrot.  you. now you can take a good, deep breath.  i still have not.  end   (edit: this is a copypasta titled

851430,"okay, i checked your comments, and apparently all you do on here is flame people with stuff like, ""fuck you you unemployed motherfucker, i fucked your mom in the ass"", so i'm not sure why i'm even bothering to respond to you at this point. there is no ""backtracking"". here it is, one last time-  1. social spending can boost the economy during a slowdown.  2. it can boost it  even with spending on otherwise useless things, such as defense systems.   3. you can even boost it with a war that kills half a million people.  4. important note before you start ranting again- just because you *can* do that doesn't mean you *should*. by the same token, i can increase my wealth by shooting and robbing you. 5. it is quite possible to understand this and still not want to do it. understanding this does not make a person ""evil"".  next up-  ""you just said the money could be better spent so that means the war is bad"".  the war employs hundreds of thousands of troops and private contractors. nearly all of them are american and will bring that money home and spend it on goods and services.  that, in and of itself, stimulates the economy. yes, the money could have been better spent, say, building new roads in minnesota where they're needed. but it doesnt change the stimulus.  this is your queue to go so you say war is good fuck you asshole.  re-read what i wrote.   there is one sense in which the war is bad for the economy, and that's that bush is paying for it with money he doesnt have, which weakens the dollar. that's yet another good reason to oppose the war. but if he had done any kind of civic spending on a balanced budget, he could have had one effect without the other.   this is your cue to ignore all that and come back with ""so you think war is good your an evil asshole and your stupid so fuck you and your mom."" have at it. i won't bother to reply again.",0,,

899124,the isle of slash is waaaay bigger than he describes. it's practically the entire ocean of fannish subculture in most fandoms.,0,,
622449,"(the context to my post is in the post but i'll add it here)  the history: i've been working on this world for the past year or so, as i loved to read, and i'm mildly decent at writing; i wanted to try my hands at writing a book. here is the main two continents. together, they make up two of the four continents in the world.  these two are populated by six main races. the humans, three  elven races, and the ta'shork. elves in my setting all live to be about three hundred years of age, maximum(without use of magic), and the ta'shork live to be about a hundred and eighty years max.  humans in my world are pretty much humans in the real world, but can gain incredible power through magic or acts of ritual or intense physical discipline. they live in most places of the continents.  first are the woodlani. woodland elves. they are descended from proto-humans, many eons ago, being changed by magic and their environment like all the other elves.  unlike the other races of elves, who got special natural abilities, they were just faster, and had extremely strong senses. their sense of smell, sight, and hearing is unmatched in the world of sentient beings, and are matching some natural beasts in how strong they are; making them natural trackers. they are also not very adept at magic, but make up for it in being extremely agile, and plain faster. they are probably the closest to humans, and also have the best relationship with them. in appearance, they are also closest to humans. their hair ranges from dark black to chestnut brown to bleach blond. their eyes are feline in appearance and are quite unmistakeable in their hue, which ranges from yellow in most common, orange being uncommon, green being rarer, and blue being almost unheard of. their skin tone is usually paler, but not pasty, and can often be seen with a steady tan for those that work in their world renown vineyards and blueberry fields. they are jovial and usually kind peoples, but take tradition very important. they have many fun parties, but are also very prudish.  the frolini come next. icy and cold in attitude, just like their homelands. they are native to the far north of the northern continent, and it has changed them to make them better at living there. they are more than competent magic users, but are still brutal fighters. their physical skills being on par with normal humans, magic and seafaring are where they shine. they live side by side with the northern 'barbarians' and various bickering jarldoms of the north; some of these jarls are even frolini as well. that being said, they aren't too overly militant, and are content to let others fight for them. they aren't nearly as focused on traditions as the woodlani, and are more focused on practical matters, such as how to get more coin. appearance wise, they are often found with snowy white hair to stormy grey to stormy black. their skin is often the color of pale blue or soft lavender. their eyes are unlike any of the other races in the fact that they are almost entirely white. they are stoic, no nonsense folk, who like a fair deal and will treat it fairly, whether you're an ally or foe.  the quinvie are the last of the elves. they are probably the kind with the least ties to humans or anyone else really. they live in the grand calanade desert(14) in the center of the southern continent. they are extremely isolationist, and are even more xenophobic. they rarely allow visitors to their small desert cities, and are even more strict on who they trade with. they are incredibly magical; the most magical of all the elves even. they are on par with humans in terms of physical status mostly, but are much more adept at surviving in the incredibly sandy and hot canyonlands of the desert. they can go up to three months without water, due to their bodies using the inborn magic to more effectively use water that they naturally have in them. that isn't to say they would ever need to go without water, as almost all of them can use some form of basic magic or another. that isn't to say they are militant. they are only militant to those that encroach on their space. appearance wise, they would have tanner skin, as they are often in the hot desert sun, ranging from a deep, even brown to a light more sallow color for those with little sun exposure. their hair tends to be coarser, with color ranging from raven black to chestnut brown. their eyes are the most human like...being they look entirely like a human's except for the fact that their iris has a soft glow, and that glow comes in most colors of the spectrum. this is how their body subtly deals with such over saturation of magic. they do live in a small nation on the northern continent. it isn't so much a nation and more of an university for magic. it's situated in a large, fortress like city in the very center of the inhospitable and naturally uninhabitable sulfur lands.  the ta'shork(name subject to change). they are like giant, bipedal salamanders, almost like gulpers from fallout 4. their skin is often a soft yellow, but can be brown or a deep black, or even bright colors like blue or red. it is also perpetually moist. they have two eyes on the center of their heads, with a mouthful of small, sharp teeth for tearing flesh from their small prey. they are just shy of eight feet tall, with small, decently strong arms. there are four large fingers on each hand, small claws on each finger. they have two strong, short legs with three wide toes on each foot and have a long thick tail. they are the most adept at magic of all the races. this is mainly due to the fact that they actively absorb it from their surroundings. that being said, like the quinvie, they are very isolationist and non-militant. this comes from a past of being very militant, and it almost ended their species. they reproduce rarely and their young take a long time to hatch. this is mainly the reason for them to become less agressive and more settled in their ways. their lands are decently safe, mainly due to most of their roads being elevated off the ground. it is incredibly expensive of a thing to do, but with a workforce of both purchased slaves and criminal slaves to dig the stone, and mages to construct it, the roads that web their empire are safe indeed. it is incredibly hard for them to converse with the other races as only the best linguists of their race can speak the common tongue. slave merchants make a great deal of money because of that.",0,,

957741,"what i've learned is that dang i need some kind of variety! these all compliment each other! this adventure was kind of a waste of lipstick, tape, and time but it looks pretty! sound the trumpets, strumpets and strap in, this shitshow is about to begin!                                 oh yeah! and if you would like to see any colors swatched next to each other or see them up closer just let me know! i'll probably be lazy and accidentally forget you asked but i'll try my hardest!                              1. **lipstick queen**-***you kid***- so, here's lookin' at you kid. it's a really creamy nude that is beautiful but doesn't really work well for me. the texture is smooth but it has a little bit of stickiness to it. it has a sort of minty smell and taste. i basically got this one because the packaging is classic and it was on sale!                     2. **mac**- ***rebel***- if a bitchin' space vixen were to kiss you on the cheek this would be the lipstick stain she'd leave behind! it's a purple that has a lot of life in it, like all mac lipsticks the quality is awesome.  i use this a lot in the winter. it also layers really nicely with other colors, especially twig when i used twig as a base.      3. **urban decay: vice**-***wired***- so… i hate being convinced to buy things by any brand representative and that's how i came across this lipstick… the urban decay lady was at sephora and i was looking at tarte lip paints and she kind of snatched me...i'm too nice to say no so this lipstick was obtained the same way a purse snatcher obtains a purse. i felt threatened. it's a beautiful summer orange and the formula is a trillion times better than my ud f-bomb. the new vice formula's are supremely nice and this one seems to stay on for a very long time the bullet tube is really cute too. this color would look beautiful with deeper colored skin!      4. **tarte: tartiest lip paint**- ***so fetch***- start trying to make fetch happen! this color is a beautiful electric coral that screams summer. the formula is seriously velvety and buttery and is kind of weird to get used to how soft and creamy it is. it kind of feels like frosting on your lips but doesn't taste as goodi love this color more than i love ladysmith black mambazo... and i love ladysmith black mambazo.         5. **tattoo junkie**-***red lip paint***- this lip color thrills me chills me and fulfills me, mainly because i wore this when i was in rocky horror but it's still awesome for walmart quality theatre makeup. this is actually meant to be used as a base for red glitter and t looks fierce. the tube is very small though.      6. **kat von d**- ***santa sangre***- i actually got this for free from a friend since she had an epiphany and decided that she can't wear red lipsticks! oh well, more for me. this color is really a really pretty red, but it's definitely an easily duplicated classic. kvd everlasting liquids are awesome and they stay for forever! maybe that's why they picked the name?       7. **urban decay**-***f-bomb***- speaking of aptly named lip colors, this damn thing makes me drop f-bombs like a dj drops beats. i mean... yeah the color is pretty. it's a sexy blue toned red but be prepared for hell if you pick this formula. this thing makes me look a total mess. i'm talking the kind of mess that could only pass on a post blowjob stoned and zoned courtney love. speaking of courtney love, she killed kurt cobain. wake up people.    8. **bite**-***palomino***- this is a lovely fuchsia that only looks good on me when i'm tanned. it's a blue toned hot pink so it makes your smile as white as a donny and marie osmond show. hella white.     9. **amazon**-***unknown***- i actually adore this lipstick but i have zero source for it other than my mom saw a cheap lipstick on amazon so she ordered it. it's in a cute lil tube which when i hold it makes me look like i'm a mad scientist.      10. **nyx**-***san paulo***- this was actually my first ""real brand"" lipstick- isn't naivety adorable? i thought that since nyx was sold at ulta it was mid-range... precious. this color is really pretty, it's like hot pink stayed out in the sun too long and got a nice golden bake. this has that same velvety texture as tarte: so fetch.      11. **mac**- ***dubonnet***- my friend, olivia, was visiting from france and left this behind and then told me i could keep it! it's a very pretty deep red that reminds me of the stain that your first sip of wine made on your high school cheerleading warm up when you were trying to drink incognito... anyone else? no? just me? oh.         12. **mac**-***twig***- this is a really simple pretty color that looks supremely great on almost every person i've ever seen wear it. this was my real first ""high end"" lipstick so maybe that explains my infatuation. it blends very well with pink colors as well to sort of give them a base. this color is appropriate always.         13. **kylie**- ***posie k***- as i said in another post, this color is definitely a ""blonde pink"", it would look beautiful on a sun-kissed blonde. it gives me sixties vibes with its sweet brightness, this color is almost optimistic. it never moves ever.            14. **kat von d**-***lolita***- this is essentially mac twig in a liquid form... lately i have been grabbing this over twig though because it us awesome staying power. it's a nice pink/brown/ nude.  if you're on the fence about this, hop the hell over the fence and sprint to sephora. it's a good choice.           15. **kylie**-***dolce k***- this color is what would happen if you mixed kvd lolita with honey and caramel. it has a beautiful golden brown to it, almost like a beautiful tater tot that's just came out of the oven. it's like mac twig got stuck in the tanning bed with the girls in final destination 3.     16. **kylie**-***true brown k***- i have never ever worn a brown lip stick ever before but i am so in love with this already that i am wearing it to bed. it has a nice velvety texture and it has a nice smell too! i'm also wearing this to bed because i tried it on and it won't come off at all. when i die they will find my corpse in this lipstick.        17. **kylie**- ***kourt k***- for someone who doesn't care about the kardashians and has zero clue about how to over draw her lips i sure as hell have a lot of kylie lip kits. i need to be restrained immediately.  this is a beautiful and rich purple color that resembles the eggplants from that one episode of courage the cowardly dog. perfect for fall.               18. **lipstick queen**-***velvet rope***- this color is a beautiful burgundy that i got on sale at ulta once upon a time. it is minty and the color is pretty, but the formula is slightly drying. the texture is very velvet rope-y. this goes by exposed now but initially was the only shade in the velvet rope line",0,,
175571,"**edit: how do i paste in this recipe wihtout reddit applying it's retarded formatting?**     this is my fav chicken recipe.  it's so simple but the flavor is intense.  crispy, browned parmesan cheese!   parmesan-crusted chicken cutlets   american's test kitchen from the episode: chicken in a skillet   the chicken breasts will be easier to slice into cutlets if you freeze them for 15 minutes until firm but not fully frozen. to slice in half, place one hand on top of the breast to secure it, hold a chef's knife parallel to the cutting board, and slice through the middle of the breast horizontally. note that 1/2 ounce of parmesan is grated on the smallest holes of a box grater (or microplane rasp grater); the remaining 6 ounces are shredded on the largest holes of the box grater (see photos below). we like the flavor that authentic parmigiano-reggiano lends to this recipe. less-expensive digiorno parmesan cheese can also be used, but the resulting cheese crust will be slightly saltier and chewier. serve this chicken with a simple salad. although the portion size (1 cutlet per person) might seem small, these cutlets are rather rich due to the cheese content. to make 8 cutlets, double the ingredients and cook the chicken in 4 batches, transferring the cooked cutlets to a warm oven and wiping out the skillet after each batch.  serves 4 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (8 ounces each), tenderloins removed, breasts trimmed of excess fat and halved horizontally table salt and ground black pepper 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour plus 1 tablespoon 1/2 ounce grated parmesan cheese (about 1/4 cup), see note above 3 large egg whites 2 tablespoons minced fresh chives(optional) 6 ounces shredded parmesan cheese (about 2 cups) see note above 4 teaspoons olive oil 1 lemon, cut into wedges   see illustrations below: two ways to cut the parmesan  1. adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. place chicken between sheets of plastic wrap and pound to even 1/4-inch thickness. pat dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.  2. set wire rack on rimmed baking sheet. whisk together 1/4 cup flour and grated parmesan cheese in pie plate. in medium bowl, whisk egg whites and chives (if using) together until slightly foamy. in second pie plate, combine 2 cups shredded parmesan and remaining tablespoon flour.  3. using tongs and working with 1 cutlet at a time, coat chicken in flour mixture, shaking off excess. transfer chicken to egg-white mixture; coat evenly and let excess run off. coat chicken with shredded parmesan mixture, pressing gently so that cheese adheres. place on wire rack.  4. heat 2 teaspoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. place 2 cutlets in skillet and reduce heat to medium. cook until cheese is pale golden brown, about 3 minutes. while chicken is cooking, use thin nonstick spatula to gently separate any cheesy edges that have melted together. carefully flip cutlets and continue to cook until cheese is pale golden brown on second side and meat is no longer pink in center, about 3 minutes. transfer chicken to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven. wipe out skillet with paper towel and return to medium heat. add remaining 2 teaspoons oil and cook remaining 2 cutlets. serve immediately with lemon wedges.",0,,

645961,"understanding obama: the making of a fuehrer by ali sina  i must confess i was not impressed by sen. barack obama from the first time i saw him. at first i was excited to see a black candidate. he looked youthful, spoke well, appeared to be confident – a wholesome presidential package. i was put off soon, not just because of his shallowness but also because there was an air of haughtiness in his demeanor that was unsettling. his posture and his body language were louder than his empty words. obama's speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in american history. never a politician in this land had such a quasi 'religious' impact on so many people. the fact that obama is a total incognito with zero accomplishment, makes this inexplicable infatuation alarming. obama is not an ordinary man. he is not a genius. in fact he is quite ignorant on most important subjects. barack obama is a narcissist. dr. sam vaknin, the author of the malignant self love, also believes, 'barack obama appears to be a narcissist.'    vaknin is a world authority on narcissism. he understands narcissism and describes the inner mind of a narcissist like no other person. when he talks about narcissism everyone listens. vaknin says that obama's language, posture and demeanor, and the testimonies of his closest, dearest and nearest suggest that the senator is either a narcissist or he may have narcissistic personality disorder (npd).    narcissists project a grandiose but false image of themselves. jim jones, the charismatic leader of people's temple, the man who led over 900 of his followers to cheerfully commit mass suicide and even murder their own children was also a narcissist. david koresh, charles manson, joseph koni, shoko asahara, stalin, saddam, mao, kim jong ill and adolph hitler are a few examples of narcissists of our time. all these men had a tremendous influence over their fanciers. they created a personality cult around themselves and with their blazing speeches elevated their admirers' souls, filled their hearts with enthusiasm and instilled in their minds a new zest for life. they gave them hope! they promised them the moon, but alas, invariably they brought them to their doom. when you are a victim of a cult of personality, you don't know it until it is too late.    one determining factor in the development of npd is childhood abuse. 'obama's early life was decidedly chaotic and replete with traumatic and mentally bruising dislocations,' says vaknin. 'mixed-race marriages were even less common then. his parents went through a divorce when he was an infant (two years old). obama saw his father only once again, before he died in a car accident. then, his mother re-married and obama had to relocate to indonesia : a foreign land with a radically foreign culture, to be raised by a step-father. at the age of ten, he was whisked off to live with his maternal (white) grandparents. he saw his mother only intermittently in the following few years and then she vanished from his life in 1979. she died of cancer in 1995.'    one must never underestimate the manipulative genius of pathological narcissists. they project such an imposing personality that it overwhelms those around them. charmed by the charisma of the narcissist, people become like clay in his hands. they cheerfully do his bidding and delight to be at his service. the narcissist shapes the world around himself and reduces others in his own inverted image. he creates a cult of personality. his admirers become his co-dependents.    narcissists have no interest in things that do not help them to reach their personal objective. they are focused on one thing alone and that is power. all other issues are meaningless to them and they do not want to waste their precious time on trivialities. anything that does not help them is beneath them and do not deserve their attention. if an issue raised in the senate does not help obama in one way or another, he has no interest in it. the 'present' vote is a safe vote. no one can criticize him if things go wrong. why should he implicate himself in issues that may become controversial when they don't help him personally? those issues are unworthy by their very nature because they are not about him.    obama's election as the first black president of the harvard law review led to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations. the university of chicago law school provided him with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. the book took him a lot longer than expected and at the end it devolved into…, guess what? his own autobiography! instead of writing a scholarly paper focusing on race relations, for which, he had been paid, obama could not resist writing about his most sublime self. he entitled the book dreams from my father .    not surprisingly, adolph hitler also wrote his own autobiography when he was still nobody. so did stalin. for a narcissist no subject is as important as his own self. why would he waste his precious time and genius writing about insignificant things when he can write about such an august being as himself? narcissists are often callous and even ruthless. as the norm, they lack conscience. this is evident from obama's lack of interest in his own brother who lives on only one dollar per month. a man who lives in luxury, who takes a private jet to vacation in hawaii, and who has raised nearly half a billion dollars for his campaign (something unprecedented in history) has no interest in the plight of his own brother. why? because, his brother cannot be used for his ascent to power. a narcissist cares for no one but himself.    this election is like no other in the history of america . the issues are insignificant compared to what is at stake. what can be more dangerous than having a man bereft of conscience, a serial liar, and one who cannot distinguish his fantasies from reality as the leader of the free world?    i hate to sound alarmist, but one must be a fool if one is not alarmed. many politicians are narcissists. they pose no threat to others.. they are simply self serving and selfish. obama evinces symptoms of pathological narcissism, which is different from the run-of-the-mill narcissism of a richard nixon or a bill clinton, for example. to him reality and fantasy are intertwined. this is a mental health issue, not just a character flaw. pathological narcissists are dangerous because they look normal and even intelligent. it is this disguise that makes them treacherous.    today the democrats have placed all their hopes in obama. but this man could put an end to their party. the great majority of blacks have also decided to vote for obama. only a fool does not know that their support for him is racially driven.   let us call a spade a spade. this is racism, pure and simple. the truth is that while everyone carries a misconceived collective guilt towards the blacks for wrongs done centuries ago by a bygone people to a bygone people, the blacks carry a collective rancor, enmity or vendetta towards non-blacks and to this day want to 'stand up' to the white man.. they seem to be stuck in 19th century.    the downside of this is that if obama turns out to be the disaster i predict, he will cause widespread resentment among the whites. the blacks are unlikely to give up their support of their man. cultic mentality is pernicious and unrelenting. they will dig their heads deeper in the sand and blame obama's detractors of racism. this will cause a backlash among the whites. the white supremacists will take advantage of the discontent and they will receive widespread support. i predict that in less than four years, racial tensions will increase to levels never seen since the turbulent 1960s. obama will set the clock back decades… america is the bastion of freedom. the peace of the world depends on the strength of america , and its weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations. it is no wonder that ahmadinejad, hugo chavez, the castrists, the hezbollah, the hamas, the lawyers of the guantanamo terrorists and virtually all sworn enemies of america are so thrilled by the prospect of their man in the white house. america is on the verge of destruction. there is no insanity greater than electing a pathological narcissist as president.",0,,
437167,"oh wow. first thing i thought was ""oh, it's an old cat. it's probably some sort of organ failure that happens with kitties over the age of 15"" but yeah. that's a really fucking skinny cat. i volunteer at the animal shelter in western pa and many of them have free vet checks for cats taken in, or vet checks at a greatly reduced cost. it depends on the shelter and their load, of course, but if you do some research on the shelters in your area, maybe that's a viable option?  as you said it's an outside cat, your neighbors probably wouldn't notice if it was gone for a day to go to the vet? i mean, it's not like they pay much attention to him in the first place...  sadly, you can't just take their cat and give it up to the shelter without the owners knowing about it. they have to surrender it willingly or have an injunction filed against them by the spca or similar advocacy group. your best bet is to take him to the vet, see what's wrong (is there really a parasite? are there drugs to take care of it? or is it just malnutrition and should they be fined?) and go from there, but that's a lot of burden on you.  anyway, i hope things work out for the better, for all parties.",0,,

821398,"part 2:   clinton's approach to the post has been a courtship of small steps, starting with straightforward agreements on policy. how the post and clinton found ideological middle ground is no mystery: the politics of september 11 and iraq put the apparently hawkish clinton on, from the editors' point of view, the right side of world war three. ""the thing that changed was 9/11,"" says bob mcmanus, who runs the paper's editorial page. ""she began to exhibit some leadership qualities that we didn't see that were there.""    clinton fought for federal resources for new york and backed--unreservedly--the bush administration's response to the attacks, its invasion of afghanistan. her statement on the senate floor on september 12, 2001, was a tough with-us-or-against-us line that now sounds like the bush doctrine avant la lettre. she expressed her support for the president ""not only to seek out an exact punishment on the perpetrators, but to make very clear that not only those who harbor terrorists, but those who in any way aid or comfort them whatsoever, will now face the wrath of our country.""   it was hard for the post to find fault with that, and, two days after christmas 2001, the editorial board made a rare admission of error. ""hillary rodham clinton has been in the united states senate for a year, less five days, and the world hasn't come to an end,"" said the editorial. ""ok, so we were wrong. more than that, we're pleasantly surprised in many respects by the former first lady's performance so far."" their praise for clinton's position on the decision to go to war, which she voted to authorize, and for expanding the military, culminated in an editorial last july headlined ""hillary clinton: the unlikely warrior.""   but clinton's foreign policy is only part of the story. the other part has been an active courtship on clinton's part--including access for post reporters. unlike some politicians brutalized by the post--notably this year's democratic mayoral nominee, fernando ferrer--she and her staff never cut off the paper, however shrill it got. her top campaign communications aide, howard wolfson, had arrived with a respect and understanding for the tabloid's power from his time with westchester representative nita lowey, whom he helped engineer into an unlikely post favorite. clinton's courtship of the paper has ranged from her warm relations with the paper's capitol hill staff--one former reporter, vince morris, was a particular favorite--to her keen awareness of some of the paper's favorite crusades. unlike senator charles schumer and other prominent politicians from both parties, she has not sought the support of the independence party, a new york state outfit whose most prominent member, lenora fulani, is a regular post target for her views on jews. and, last year, when the paper was wrapped up in an all-out assault on the international freedom center, a planned museum at ground zero that the post warned would be a ""monster"" and ""a forum for america-bashing,"" clinton joined in. already under heavy fire, the project died--people involved say--the day clinton came out against it in an interview with the post. she got the wood, and an editorial labeled the move ""hillary's home run.""   the distance from the devious carpetbagger the post portrayed in 2000 to the serious junior senator who, for the most part, occupies its pages today is hard to match in america's political press. (comparing the new york times' coverage of john mccain in his keating five days with today might get you close, but that didn't happen in a single term.) both sides, though, insist this is journalism as usual. ""with any politician, we treat them issue by issue,"" says the post's current editor, col allan, through a spokesman. clinton's spokesman, philippe reines, takes a similar line: ""the new york post and other media outlets,"" he begins--as though the post were of the same species as the rochester democrat and chronicle--""are just reflecting the reality that senator clinton has worked tirelessly and done a good job for new york.""   beyond these bromides is a realization by both clinton and murdoch that their relationship can be mutually beneficial. murdoch's history with prime minister tony blair offers the blueprint: after then-candidate blair flew to australia's hayman island to address executives of murdoch's news corporation, murdoch's british papers abandoned the tories to support him. murdoch would go on to benefit from blair's media deregulation. murdoch's career has featured such episodes of putting business interests ahead of ideology, as when a publishing company under his control dropped a memoir critical of the chinese government. ""it's a lot about rupert,"" says a former post editor, lou colasuonno, about the changes at his old paper. ""he's smart about where he thinks he needs to be, and his ideology is often less important than his business.""   what murdoch wants directly from clinton isn't entirely clear, though ted kennedy taught him a lesson in angering u.s. senators in 1988, when kennedy's ban on cross-ownership of media forced him to sell the post. (he repurchased it, with the support of a placated kennedy, five years later.) but clinton isn't just any junior senator: news corp has sprawling regulatory interests, and every corporate chief could use a favor from a woman who just might be the next president of the united states.   for her part, clinton hasn't been to hayman island yet, but she did lunch with murdoch--a man who did as much as anyone to drive the sex scandal that almost undid her husband--at his company's midtown tower, according to one person who was at the meeting. ""senator clinton respects [murdoch] and thinks he is smart and effective,"" reines said last summer. personal diplomacy, however, is the true calling of the senator's husband, who has done everything from touring the post's newsroom to recording a birthday tribute to fox news chief roger ailes. he also recruited murdoch as one of the small handful of business executives participating in his ""global initiative,"" a sui generis foreign policy conference in new york in september. seated in a set of low white armchairs, the former president interviewed murdoch, along with sony's sir howard stringer and time warner's richard parsons, about the future of global media. after the panel ended (late, of course), clinton and murdoch chatted in a corner, one's hand on the other's arm, while admirers, including a largely ignored brad pitt, tried to get close to the two men.",0,,

499567,"when i arrive home later, katherine is wearing headphones and working on her laptop. her nose is still pink, but she has her teeth into a story, so she’s concentrating and typing furiously. i’m thoroughly drained – exhausted by the long drive, the grueling interview, and by being rushed off my feet at clayton’s. i slump on to the couch, thinking about the essay i have to finish and all the studying i haven’t done today because i was holed up with … him. “you’ve got some good stuff here, ana. well done. i can’t believe you didn’t take him up on his offer to show you around. he obviously wanted to spend more time with you.” she gives me a fleeting quizzical look. i flush, and my heart rate inexplicably increases. that wasn’t the reason, surely? he just wanted to show me around so i could see that he was lord of all he surveyed. i realize i’m biting my lip, and i hope kate doesn’t notice. but she seems absorbed in her transcrip-tion.“i hear what you mean about formal. did you take any notes?” she asks. “um… no, i didn’t.” “that’s fine. i can still make a fine article with this. shame we don’t have some original stills. good-looking son of a bitch, isn’t he?” i flush. “i suppose so.” i try hard to sound disinterested, and i think i succeed. “oh come on, ana – even you can’t be immune to his looks.” she arches a perfect eyebrow at me. crap! i distract her with flattery, always a good ploy. “you probably would have got a lot more out of him.” “i doubt that, ana. come on – he practically offered you a job. given that i foisted this on you at the last minute, you did very well.” she glances up at me speculatively. i make a hasty retreat into the kitchen. “so what did you really think of him?” damn, she’s inquisitive. why can’t she just let this go? think of something – quick. “he’s very driven, controlling, arrogant – scary really, but very charismatic. i can understand the fascination,” i add truthfully, as i peer round the door at her hoping this will shut her up once and for all. “you, fascinated by a man? that’s a first,” she snorts. “you, fascinated by a man? that’s a first,” she snorts. i start gathering the makings of a sandwich so she can’t see my face. “why did you want to know if he was gay? incidentally, that was the most embarrassing question. i was mortified, and he was pissed to be asked too.” i scowl at the memory. “whenever he’s in the society pages, he never has a date.” “it was embarrassing. the whole thing was embarrassing. i’m glad i’ll never have to lay eyes on him again.” “oh, ana, it can’t have been that bad. i think he sounds quite taken with you.” taken with me? now kate’s being ridiculous. “would you like a sandwich?” “please.” we talk no more of christian grey that evening, much to my relief. once we’ve eaten, i’m able to sit at the dining table with kate and, while she works on her article, i work on my essay on tess of the d’urbervilles. damn, but that woman was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong century. by the time i finish, it’s midnight, and kate has long since gone to bed. i make my way to my room, exhausted, but pleased that i’ve accomplished so much for a monday. i curl up in my white iron bed, wrapping my mother’s quilt around me, close my eyes, and i’m instantly asleep. that night i dream of dark places, bleak white cold floors, and gray eyes. for the rest of the week, i throw myself into my studies and my job at clayton’s. kate is busy too, compiling her last edition of her student magazine before she has to relinquish it to the new editor while also cramming for her finals. by wednesday, she’s much better, and i no longer have to endure the sight of her pink-flannel-with-too-many-rabbits pjs. i call my mom in georgia to check on her, but also so she can wish me luck for my final exams. she proceeds to tell me about her latest venture into candle making – my mother is all about new business ventures. fundamentally she’s bored and wants something to occupy her time, but she has the attention span of a goldfish. it’ll be something new next week. she worries me. i hope she hasn’t mortgaged the house to finance this latest scheme. and i hope that bob – her relatively new but much older husband – is keeping an eye on her now that i’m no longer there. he does seem a lot more grounded than husband number three. “how are things with you, ana?” for a moment, i hesitate, and i have mom’s full attention. “i’m fine.” “ana? have you met someone?” wow… how does she do that? the excitement in her voice is palpable. “no, mom, it’s nothing. you’ll be the first to know if i do.” “ana, you really need to get out more, honey. you worry me.” “mom, i’m fine. how’s bob?” as ever, distraction is the best policy. later that evening, i call ray, my stepdad, mom’s husband number two, the man i consider my father, and the man whose name i bear. it’s a brief conversation. in fact, it’s not so much a conversation as a one-sided series of grunts in response to my gentle coaxing. ray is not a talker. but he’s still alive, he’s still watching soccer on tv, and going bowling and fly-fishing or making furniture when he’s not. ray is a skilled carpenter and the reason i know the difference between a hawk and a handsaw. all seems well with him. friday night, kate and i are debating what to do with our evening – we want some time out from our studies, from our work, and from student newspapers – when the doorbell rings. standing on our doorstep is my good friend josé, clutching a bottle of champagne. “josé! great to see you!” i give him a quick hug. “come in.” josé is the first person i met when i arrived at wsu, looking as lost and lonely as i did. we recognized a kindred spirit in each of us that day, and we’ve been friends ever since. not only do we share a sense of humor, but we discovered that both ray and josé senior were in the same army unit together. as a result, our fathers have become firm friends too. josé is studying engineering and is the first in his family to make it to college. he’s pretty damn bright, but his real passion is photography. josé has a great eye for a good picture. “i have news.” he grins, his dark eyes twinkling. “don’t tell me – you’ve managed not to get kicked out for another week,” i tease, and he scowls playfully at me. “the portland place gallery is going to exhibit my photos next month.” “that’s amazing – congratulations!” delighted for him, i hug him again. kate beams at him too. “way to go josé! i should put this in the paper. nothing like last minute editorial changes on a friday evening.” she grins. “let’s celebrate. i want you to come to the opening.” josé looks intently at me. i flush. “both of you, of course,” he adds, glancing nervously at kate. josé and i are good friends, but i know deep down inside, he’d like to be more. he’s cute and funny, but he’s just not for me. he’s more like the brother i never had. katherine often teases me that i’m missing the need-a-boyfriend gene, but the truth is – i just haven’t met anyone who… well, whom i’m attracted to, even though part of me longs for those trembling knees, heart-in-my-mouth, butterflies-in-my-belly, sleepless nights. sometimes i wonder if there’s something wrong with me. perhaps i’ve spent too long in the company of my literary romantic heroes, and consequently my ideals and expectations are far too high. but in reality, nobody’s ever made me feel like that. until very recently, the unwelcome, still small voice of my subconscious whispers. no! i banish the thought immediately. i am not going there, not after that painful interview. are you gay, mr. grey? i wince at the memory. i know i’ve dreamt about him most nights since then, but that’s just to purge the awful experience from my system, surely? i watch josé open the bottle of champagne. he’s tall, and in his jeans and t-shirt he’s all shoulders and muscles, tanned skin, dark hair and burning dark eyes. yes, josé’s pretty hot, but i think he’s finally getting the message: we’re just friends. the cork makes its loud pop, and josé looks up and smiles. saturday at the store is a nightmare. we are besieged by do-it-yourselfers wanting to spruce up their homes. mr. and mrs. clayton, john and patrick – the two other part-timers – and i are all rushed off our feet. but there’s a lull around lunchtime, and mrs. clayton asks me to check on some orders while i’m sitting behind the counter at the till discreetly eating my bagel. i’m engrossed in the task, checking catalogue numbers against the items we need and the items we’ve ordered, eyes flicking from the order book to the computer screen and back as i check the entries match. then, for some reason, i glance up… and find myself locked in the bold gray gaze of christian grey who’s standing at the counter, staring at me intently. heart failure. “miss steele. what a pleasant surprise.” his gaze is unwavering and intense. holy crap. what the hell is he doing here looking all tousled-hair and outdoorsy in his cream chunky-knit sweater, jeans, and walking boots? i think my mouth has popped open, and i can’t locate my brain or my voice. “mr. grey,” i whisper, because that’s all i can manage. there’s a ghost of a smile on his lips and his eyes are alight with humor, as if he’s enjoying some private joke. “i was in the area,” he says by way of explanation. “i need to stock up on a few things. it’s a pleasure to see you again, miss steele.” his voice is warm and husky like dark melted chocolate fudge caramel… or something. i shake my head to gather my wits. my heart is pounding a frantic tattoo, and for some reason i’m blushing furiously under his steady scrutiny. i am utterly thrown by the sight of him standing before me. my memories of him did not do him justice. he’s not merely good-looking – he’s the epitome of male beauty, breathtaking, and he’s here. here in clayton’s hardware store. go figure. finally my cognitive functions are restored and reconnected with the rest of my body.",1,0,0

302450,"i don't care what hermione's race is honestly. i saw her as white because white what we default to. that said, that thread is a terrible argument.   they claim she **must** be white. personally, i don't think jkr thought about her race when writing and thus defaulted white, yes, but to say hermione *must* be white, and that is *canon* isnt okay. i wrote why i think we need to allow open interpretation in my essay, i'm not writing it again. jkr too has said that hermione is open to interpretation, so why are people fighting the author on this?  but, this thread is so flawed. their general premise seems to be 'descriptions of people as potentially light skinned means that they must be caucasian.' warning: real life facts incoming  okay first of all, there's no genetic basis in race. literally. no. difference. between. races. in. our. genomes. race is something people constructed because we like categories. did you know that northern indians are genetically more similar to europeans than they are to most southern indians? yet all indians are called 'brown' whereas europeans are 'white.' i'm sorry to bring real life and real learning into it, but i repeat, *race is constructed by people and has no basis in biology.*   now, since race (asian vs white vs black vs brown vs latinx, i don't even know how much people usually specify) hasn't got a basis in biology, a lot of the time it's not as correlated to skin colour as you might think. that thread gave evidence that hermione is light skinned (looks like a panda when she's got a black eye - ignoring the fact that this is once again imagery). but, get this, *non-caucasians can be light skinned too!* have you ever met an asian person from japan or china or korea? they're generally pretty freaking pale. hey, maybe there's a chance hermione's got (an) asian parent(s)! who knows, and *who cares* because non-white hermione isn't hurting anyone.   they also said that because hermione was described as 'very brown' she can't be actually brown/black because that would be 'racist' to describe her that ay then. uh, no it wouldn't? i know white people who literally say 'dude you're so dark! you're so brown!' to brown people (and to other white people too). it's not racist, loads of people say it, and 'very brown' actually sounds like it's more likely to be used to describe someone who went from darkish to darker than pale to medium tanned.   i feel like i'm going to end up dissecting that whole thread which i don't want to do. im also half asleep so i'm sorry if my comment makes no sense lol. the last thing i want to say is that her name is a ridiculous reason to insist she must be white as well. loads and loads (i'm talking the vast majority, and i know a lot) of coloured people have 'white-sounding' or anglo names. i didnt know cho chang was supposed to be asian because all the asian people i'd met had anglo names. all the black people ive met have names that sound like 'white' people names. that hermione granger cannot be the name of someone who isn't white is absolutely ridiculous and it makes me wonder if this person has ever even met a minority in their life.   to summarise there is some implicit evidence that hermione is light or medium skinned, but not actually that much (that thread gave like less than five examples), and **that still doesn't discredit the notion that she can be a minority.**   i am tired of this argument. i am so tired. i want to shake people and tell them that hey, a lot of us have inherent prejudices and its okay as long as you try fixing it. its not okay if you insist everyone else is 'pandering to an agenda' and that characters must be white because there's *some* vague implication that you can only view through one lens. for fucks sake, the point i tried to make was *hey let's let her be open to interpretation so that anyone can feel like they really relate to her and is 'just like us!'*   i don't understand why so many people have this insistence that she must be white. all my hardcore book canon friends are cool with open interpretation hermione. it's not a 'fan' thing to insist she *must* be caucasian. it's something deeper.  edit: i'm not posting my response to that thread there because it seems like you'll get downvoted to hell if you disagree with that op. but they seriously tried claiming that you can tell someone's a foreigner by how they spoke (viktor, fleur, seamus) but 1) none of the other black characters had a distinctive way of speaking/disnt speak in aave 2) your skin colour/ethnicity doesn't determine your accent, where you grew up does. cho and parvati and kingsley and dean don't have accents because they probably fucking grew up speaking british english. seriously, i don't think that op actually knows any minorities irl.   also, dean was not described as black in the original ps. that is only in the scholastic edition (which doesn't even keep the same name, so...).  and like /u/viol8r said in the comments: ""seriously, if at any point in a diatribe about something you have to say you're not, you [usually] are.""  the op cherry-picked their canon evidence, threw in some completely irrelevant stuff, and posted an argument that's got holes the size of hogwarts. and i'm very wary of the fact that they had to say that jkr calling racists who think hermione can only be white out *is racism*...because everyone knows if someone says you're saying/doing/thinking something that is a problem, the adult thing to do is turn it back on them, rather than actually consider your thoughts and actions and whether you can improve as a person. /s  in conclusion: i am bitter.",1,0,0

990954,"at 2:50, with his parents out of the house as he'd planned, and ten minutes before the time they'd arranged, a breathless elizabeth appeared at the door. tom could tell from the burning intensity in her eyes that she had had as frustrating a morning as he had.  he quickly invited her inside and took her jacket, drinking in her scent and aching to touch the soft skin around her neck. they headed upstairs to the office, which had been doubling as a spare room for tom. despite the passion coursing in their bodies, things were still awkward between tom and elizabeth: hookups are never as simple as porn films. instead, they sat down and actually started to work on her physics problems, with snatched glances flashing from one to the other, for what seemed like forever.  finally, as he reached for her text book, tom brushed his hand along elizabeth's thigh. ""oh, sorry"", he said. ""it's ok"", she replied, with a meaningfully intense look. they paused, while they enjoyed the loaded, musky silence that always precedes a first kiss.  as their lips met, tom's hands dove straight for the body he'd been dreaming about for nearly 24 hours. his left hand cupped the perfect ass perched on the edge of her chair, while his right hand gently went to her face, touching her skin just under her ear. her girly scent creeped into his nostrils, and he focussed on the electric current surging between his lips and his cock.  elizabeth was slow to respond. tom pulled back to check she was ok, to see her still leant forward, hands on her lap, eyes closed and mouth slightly open. after a couple of seconds, her dusky eyes fluttered open and she stammered, ""i've... i've not done this before..."". his conscience urged him to stop: could he take the virginity of a girl ten years his junior? elizabeth sensed his dilemma, but instead of trying to convince him to continue, she simply slid her hand across and lightly felt the shape of his cock, her eyes growing wide with surprise as she felt it twitch under her touch.  they stood in unison, and he pulled her tight red sweater over her head. with every extra inch of tanned skin exposed, tom's excitement doubled so that when her top lay on the floor, he could barely stop himself from ripping off the rest of the clothes that instant. in fact, he made a grab at her breasts, but her self-consciousness finally won, and she caught his hands, putting them behind his back and them holding them there with one arm while she unbuttoned his shirt with the other, demanding that he undress at the same rate as her.  she caught her breath as his tanned, lean torso was exposed. he mentally thanked himself for the good diet he'd been sticking to while on holiday over the past couple of weeks, and the lunchtime breaks soaking up the sun, giving his skin a healthy golden color. she glanced up at him, a good 8"" shorter than him, as if to check she was doing ok, and tom merely had to nod down towards the now obvious tent in his jeans. she knew what to do - virgin, yes, but innocent? no.  she unbuttoned his jeans and pulled down his boxers just enough for his swollen dick to jump out with such force that it made elizabeth jump. his guess was that she'd only seen porn in photos, never see a real, moving, erect, pulsing cock before; either live or on film.  still, she didn't hesitate to guide his dick into her mouth, unsure at first, licking and nibbling like you might treat a lollipop. she continued as he reached down her back and unclipped her bra with one hand, a cheesy trick which only impresses the most vacuous girls, but that really comes in handy when you've got a 15 year-old sucking your cock - her first cock - and you don't want anything to break the rhythm.  with some gentle suggestions, elizabeth quickly got the hand of sucking dick, and had one hand purposefully stroking the shaft while she used the whole flat of her rough tongue to massage the underside of his uncut dick, as the head bumped into her tonsils, making her gag slightly and helping her produce gooey lubricating spit.  the sight of her picture perfect face being penetrated by his by now fully erect dick was almost too much for tom, especially with those pert little breasts jiggling around with every bob of her head.  he picked elizabeth up underneath the arms and bodily threw her onto the bed, where she landed and bounced with a little whimper and a giggle.  as he kicked off his trousers, elizabeth was starting to unbutton her jeans with a look of great uncertainty. ""wait, i'll do that"", ordered tom, and elizabeth relaxed, happy to watch his body flex and move as he peeled off his socks and climbed onto the bed with her.  with each button he popped open, tom breathed in deeply, unsure whether the growing musky smell was because he was getting closer to the underage pussy in front of him, or just that elizabeth was getting more and more turned on. to prolong the delicious delay he carefully undid each and every button, then slowly slid the tight jeans off her hips, down her legs and off her feet.  she was wearing sheer, purple colored, low cut panties through which he could easily see a tuft of pubic hair, and a inch-wide damp spot right over her pussy. she closed her bent legs together, turned her head to one side and giggled. embarrassed at having a stranger, a man, an older man looking at her most intimate parts. to reassure her, he lay down beside her, gently lifted her hair and kissed from the nape of her neck round to her ear lobe: a trick he'd learnt a few years ago that would melt any girl having second thoughts. elizabeth had clearly never been touched like this before, and out of the corner of his eye he could see her nipple start to puff and harden, while her legs, though still closed, twisted and ground together, obviously aching for attention.  he shifted close to her and gently caressed her inner thigh while their lips locked together and she made whimpering noises. she wasn't experienced enough to reach for his cock, but tom was fine with that as he was pretty sure that even an accidental touch right now might be enough to send him over the edge, immediately.",0,,

695517,"there is a keyhole. not somewhere, but *anywhere*. it's cast in black iron, with brass bolts, the edges smoothed by years of use. the tumbler is old, the barrel free of pins, and its made by some forgotten manufacturer who may have specialised in ""secure security solutions!""  its on any door, in any house, and it works exactly like a keyhole should. it locks and it unlocks with the regularity of its use, and moves as smoothly as if it were new. but what else it can do goes relatively unnoticed. on the whole it is mostly children that discover its properties, and they forget about them just as fast.  in 1972 a young wisconsin girl named alice bounds into her uncle's attic room, hiding from the boy she desperately likes, and who she hopes will seek her out. she shuts the door softly, careful the sound doesn't rise above his loud counting three floor below, and crouches down to peer through the keyhole.  but she doesn't see the hallway and ascending stairs she expects.  she looks out onto a kitchen with sunny yellow walls and light brown worktops. a green ceramic sink fills with soapy water on the far side of the room and the window beyond shows an apple tree in full bloom, swaying gently in soft summer light. a table stands atop red porcelain tiles, loaded with plates of food and jugs of juice.   from what alice must assume is another door, a woman waddles in, her belly full with a baby. she is stunningly beautiful, and her skin glows along with her smile. alice cannot hear anything except the boy still loudly counting below her, but the woman's mouth moves, clearly singing. she makes glances out of the window, smiling at someone out of sight, making wave after wave in some romantic game with the unseen partner.  she bows her head and keeps washing the dishes. suddenly her mouth stops moving, the singing dying. her hand flies to her stomach and alice can see her call out as something wet begins trickling onto the floor. she looks shocked, and, as a swarthy young man bolts into sight from the other door, sweat on his brow, white shirt dirty with soil, she smiles and mouths what alice can clearly tell is, “its coming”. alice cannot help but smile herself.  she lets out a yelp as the door swings inwards, and her own swarthy boy enters, grinning. “found you,” he laughs and runs out. the keyhole forgotten, alice sprints after him, giggling and shouting.   in 1898 richard, a boy from manchester cowers in a wardrobe. beyond he can hear his father slamming doors and raging at the house to reveal his boy. the belt the father holds in his hands slaps angrily against his palm, threatening pain and welts. shivering with fear, he leans up and peers out of the wardrobes keyhole.   the same kitchen alice saw appears, only now the tree outside the window has lost its leaves and table is empty of food. richard can see the woman, her waist slim, her arms cradling a small girl that is sleeping soundly. the man moves into the room, barefoot in a soft cotton shirt and jeans. he holds the woman, the toddler between them. they whisper and smile, trying not to wake the sleeping child. the outside world looks cold and bleak, but inside the soft light of candles and a fire richard can’t see make their familial microcosm warm and welcoming, and a life apart from his own.   the man takes the child from her arms and begins to dance around the kitchen to some music either in his head, or music that richard cannot hear. from the edge of the worktop, the woman smiles on.  richard’s father bangs into the room, belt slapping against the bed and the drawers. richard draws back from the keyhole, the scene disappearing from his mind eye at the thought of his father. he presses himself against the back of the wardrobe.  in 2043 a tour group makes its way slowly around a historical stately house in belgium. a young boy called james pulls away from his mother’s hand and wanders off through the halls of his own. he tries various doors, all locked. at the end of a hall, he curiosity peaked by so much mystery, he leans down and peers through the keyhole.  the kitchen is now different, although james would never know it. the yellow has faded on the walls, out of age rather than neglect. the worktops are clear of items and the tree outside has the deep green of late summer on its leaves. on the table a large bouquet of flowers take up all space on the wooden top. the woman sits beside them, dressed in black, her head in her hands, and her back racking violently with sobs. a teenage girl, as beautiful as her mother, stands beside her, her face firm in holding back her tears, but her hands brushing her mother’s shoulders with the softest tenderness. a photo of the swarthy man stands next to them on the table, a broad, genuine smile on his face.  james moves away from the keyhole, confused, but ever more intrigued. he looks back down the hall, at the many doors lining it, each locked, each with a keyhole.   the next one he peers through reveals the girl, slightly older now, backing into a kitchen cabinet, a grin on her face and a young man moves to grind into her. she bites his lip as he slides a hand around her thin waist, drawing her to him. their chests move deeply with heavy breaths.  the next door shows a dark kitchen for a moment before a light flicks on and the girl runs into view, cannoning into the table. blood lines her lips and a dark lump is growing above one eye. the young man stalks towards her, his fist batting her to floor. he raises his hand again and stops, turning to face the mother, who steps forward, a butcher knife in her hand, point toward his chest. he stops, looks at his hand as if seeing clenched for the first time, then stumbles from the kitchen, his head soon disappearing past the window. the mother drops the knife and moves to her daughter, cradling her head in her lap.  james moves on, watching event after event from these people’s lives; the girl getting married, her stomach growing to match the same girth of her mother that alice had seen in 1972; countless birthdays, friends coming and going, numerous fights and laughs.   he can hear his mother calling. he chooses a door far down the hall and rushes to it with the time he has. the kitchen is illuminated by the moon, the tree outside ghostly and wraith-like. nothing lies on the table, the worktops are blank, the floor unbrushed. an old woman sits at the table, her hands in the lap of her nightdress, her eyes fixed on pictures on the table before her. one shows a swarthy young man, the other a stunningly beautiful girl. beside them lie a single ornate keyhole plate .she clasps it in her hands and presses it to her chest, the tears flowing more freely now. scrunching her eyes she focuses, the nods decisively, as though a choice is made. she turns her head towards james, and staring straight at him she smiles.  a hand grasps his shoulder and pulls him away, harsh words on respect and safety loud in his eyes and his hand is squeezed, half in anger, half in relief. the door disappears around the bend of the hallway behind him and the memory disappears from his head.  in 1934 alex leans down to peer through the keyhole of her grandfathers shed door, her eye pressed to the cool metal. she can see a kitchen, walls yellow and worktops light brown. a woman waddles in, her belly full with a baby…",1,0,0

111991,"i am a cool olive around nw10 with high contrast.   it always feels weird to say nw instead of nc, and i could be wrong about it, but i think it may mean i have more grey than green, because at certain level of desaturation pink has a lot of grey.  **1. what colors look best on you in clothing terms? please be detailed about shades, brightness vs mutedness etc.**  deep colours above all (seems to override warmth or coolness), but also saturated brights because of high contrast (will mark those with a * so they are not olive recommendations), and a couple of light muted colours.   burgundy. navy, olive green, black, reds (whether garnet or scarlet*), royal blue*, cornflower blue*, muted blue grey, lilac*, mustard yellow, cool canary yellow*, soft pink beige pink, light oatmeal beige.  **2. what colors look worst on you in clothing terms?**  light grey, pastel mint green, pastel spring green, pastel sky blue, white, teal.  these colours make me look beige and flat, somehow more tan but also washed out. the greens also add a certain redness, and teal somehow removes my mutedness and any redness, pulling pale and yellow and clear.  this is possibly flattering or unflattering. i like the effect of certain neons to pull out the bronze green tones in my skin, but that could be personal taste. i have a lime green top, and a vivid watermelon top that makes me look nicely bronze green - not a flat effect, but from within the skin. i don't know if others would call it unflattering witch tones though!  **3. if you're on the paler end of things, is it possible for you to wear white without looking like a zombie?**  ish? white is not my worst colour. it's wearable rather than ghastly, but washes me out, and i'm left looking either blanched or tanned but overly flat depending on the lighting. i guess it allows alot of muted grey to show through.  **4. do 'berry' tones work for you re: blush/lipstick?**  moderately well. berry work with the green in my eyes and the high contrast. they're not as a good as burgundy though - deep and bright isn't quite as good as deep and slightly muted.   **5. name a makeup product(s) that just 'work' with your colouring**  * tom ford lips &amp; boys in guillermo: medium deep brownish plum, slightly muted, slightly warm * thebalm meet matte hughes in adoring: deep, slightly cool red, slightly muted * mac chili: medium deep, warm orange red, moderately muted * mac russian red: medium deep, cool red, clear   **6. describe the process of tanning for you. can you tan? do you burn first? how many of you look good with a light facial sunburn? do you look better with a tan?**  i can tan, and go golden bronze. i wouldn't say it's warm so much as skewing more yellow. australian climate affects things. a day with some sun will just give me a tan, but a hot day at the beach will definitely burn first and then tan. i like a tan, but don't think it necessarily looks better on me as it lessens my contrast. it does increase how flattering cool canary yellow and lilac can be, though!  **7. jewelry - gold or silver?**   either is good. i don't really wear jewellery anymore, but from when i did, both work. i perhaps liked the look of gold a little more, but in terms of flattering this question seems as difficult as the vein test.  **8. does nars orgasm blush work for you?**  it's okay, but definitely not flattering - tends to pull a bit orange on me.  feel free to let me know if you think my perception of colours and flattering are off base! always happy to learn more.",1,0,
800328,"this is my take on africa and africans.  ""...members of the latin american and caribbean solidarity and reparations movements, and to all peoples of african and indigenous descent.""   now there is a racist headline and who says blood is involved in the rum distillation process... that would be like saying chocolate is made of blood because it is produced with slave labor in africa, yet the slaves and the slave holders are africans doin’ their thing in the african way… truculence is rewarded with floggings, and persistent recalcitrance meant one soul was led into the jungle never to be seen again… presumably sold to cannibals.    the inter tribal genocide in rwanda and the on going tribal bloodshed in kenya... there the differences which are too trivial to be noticed in broader society are the basis for bloodletting that appears to be the african way. in those countries tribal hordes descend on the next tribe’s villages and slaughter them with a ferocity that similarly describes the african way... ancient animosities and supposed wrongs are put right in an orgy of death... then as the tide of warfare turns the enormities of the latter day, harbored in resentment are brought to the fore, and again the earth is soaked in blood shed by incensed african tribesmen claiming ancient wrong.  “…there is no reciprocity at all. none whatsoever. whether its the sharptons /jesse jacksons / oj simpson or you name it, they are all openly racist against whites or others and completely shameless about it. when you see the mugabes and the mbeki's and all the others in africa, there is genocidal hatred and not much else.” prophetic news.net   i got a real problem with this…  a statistic which talks of half a half million dead then says, …if these were half a million blacks no one would say anything, but since they were white kosovars.” d waters pbl, and this “…the current genocide being waged against black americans.” david penner …i propose to prosecute abortion and abortionists under the capital provisions of islamic law, thus anticipating an amount of executions commensurate with the number of abortions. the deaths of black children are gonna be prosecuted with the same vigor as with everyone else… i want to assure you d waters, and you david penner of that.  in new orleans in 2006 or so a white woman was shot dead by black cops while standing on the freeway ramp speaking to her husband on a cell phone … her car had been hijacked by an african gangsters who was escaping a gun battle with another group of africans. the african cops in new orleans turned up and shot her dead. one leader of the new orleans’ african community said…the only reason that there was a fuss was because she was white.   abortion has devastated white populations in canada, the us, europe and australia, immigrants whose allegiance is not to the host nation, but to the foreign culture from which they came, have been brought into those same abortion devastated countries to make up the numbers.  …already there are tens of thousands of foreign military personnel on us soil, ostensibly they are here to ""observe"" our training methods, however it does not take the sheer numbers that are here to ""observe…"" pp forum 06.16.07 .  with no concept of the ways of organized labor, they work for a lot less money than the unionized workforce demands, thus destabilizing the labor market, then rely on the fiction that they are a poor oppressed minority, who are forced into doing tasks that are spurned by the wider and whiter community. when in fact all they are is scabs, white people do those jobs, they demand proper wages for their labor however.   check the canadian statistics, abortion has altered the demographics in that country to the extent that two hundred thousand somali immigrants are now resident there. then have another look at the internment camps that have been built right across the us. then consider the spectacle of the somali’s allying themselves with the african populations of north america, are unhappy and antisocial citizens, whose ancestors were granted refuge in north america in the eighteenth century.   witness the testimony of the king of dahomey who ruled much of the congo basin, who assumed the throne of that nation at age eighteen in about 1820, and who died the same day as queen victoria in 1900. making him one of the longest ruling monarchs in history. the only interview he ever granted was to henry morton stanley in about 1870, he assured stanley that every person over four years of age within the entire congo basin, regularly ate human flesh. social infractions of any kind, hooliganism or indeed casting ones eyes upon the king guaranteed a one way trip to the town butcher. the victims were auctioned in the marketplaces a piece at a time, thus a customer would purchase a leg for instance, or a hand or the liver, and would receive a token. then when the whole body was sold, the victim would be dispatched and the tokens exchanged for his body parts.   it was the refugees from cannibalism that made up the bulk of african immigration into america. all a ship had to do was anchor anywhere in the congo delta, and they would swarm aboard, a situation that continues to this day... when a fancy was to hit the block foreigners attended the auctions, for in an act of mercy the king had decreed that should a foreign purchaser outbid everyone else, and guarantee that the felon was definitely, under pain of immediate death going to be leaving the country permanently. those who wanted to could go to the butchers market and bid.  consider the spectacle of a couple of hundred battalions of somali tribesmen rampaging across rural north america, while the african americans rampage thru the cities, like they did in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in new orleans. killing and rounding up and interning the whites in the camps, a well planned military operation would be able to immobilize most of

174523,"part 2: we sat in anticipation for what seemed like an hour for the drugs to slowly affect our nervous systems. eventually the landscape of my friend’s backyard was sicklied over with a pale red hue. everything began to move, as if it were slowly breathing in and out. colors and sounds blended together in a magical mix of the senses. i picked up a peach and stroked its fuzzy skin, feeling every individual hair travel through the canals of my finger prints. the peach was perfect. it was soft, round, innocent, and fresh. although it was slightly indented in some spots where i had handled it to roughly, it was just right for me and i idolized it. i loved everyone and they loved me and suddenly all was well in the world. i looked at gonzo with a satisfied smirk and we both began to laugh. my hand was now in my pocket scrambling around desperately for the cheap, plastic lighter which would be used continuously throughout the night to ignite those cancer causing death sticks i loved so dearly. my pack was already in my hand with my mouth on a single cigarette which i proceeded to pull out with extreme grace. i pressed the little plastic button while simultaneously striking the sparking gadget and slowly brought the device up to the white end of the tobacco filled paper. the accomplishment i felt in completing this insignificant task was insurmountable. everything i did was an extravagant achievement. it was exactly what i had wanted. it was something wild and new.  the night itself was filled with tremendously fantastic individual events which, to me, felt as if each should be celebrated and shown to the world. we watched shooting stars go by; conversed with our friends; who, at times, spoke in a language i did not seem to know; we laughed; had meaningful conversations with each other on our separate takes on life. we went above and beyond what was expected when trying psychedelic drugs, and were glad. but we knew it had to end sometime and we wanted to make the best of our time left in this strange dimension which no other level headed person could understand. so off we went to the redwood forest preserve located a few miles outside of our town (we were in no condition to drive so our friends took us on the trip).  when we arrived it was nearly dawn and the sun crept over the clouds, slowly filling them with a pinkish light. the sky had become a snow globe filled with pink and blue cotton candy, the flowers were singing sweet tunes, and the long grass in the field was swaying back and forth creating a soothing wave that seemed to engulf me. the air smelled fresh and clean as a summer morning in orange county should and we mulled around the woods, taking in the scenery and enjoying some of the last moments we would have together in this state, for it was morning and i was due home in a couple of hours. i sat down in the warming dirt and felt something squish underneath me. it was the peach i had been holding earlier. i had placed it in my back pocket for safe keeping and in turn it had come back to bite me in the ass. a shroud of sadness draped itself over my fragile body. i was attached to the peach and now it was gone. now looking back, i realize that peach meant more to me than just a pleasurable object to touch; it represented my life and everything in it: still young and not yet rotted by the volatile world that surrounded it. to me, by ingesting these mushrooms, i had disappointed my parents, let down my friends and brothers, and disrespected myself. the trip was beginning to level off. i requested we go back to my friend’s house and gonzo agreed. when we arrived, i smoked one last cigarette, said my goodbyes, and walked the two miles home back to my house. i learned more about myself in that 60 minute walk than i had in the previous 16 years of my existence. the mushrooms, yet weaker, were still in effect which at first posed no problem to me until i realized i was alone. i was a ghost. the colors of the trees no longer appeared as rich as they had the night before and i no longer could converse with my pals. i was trapped inside my head by the mushrooms; stuck in a dozen layers of mental process unable to escape. for each step i took, another pound of thought landed on my back. i finally opened my eyes to how ungrateful i was towards my parents, how much i took my possessions for granted, how i acted condescendingly towards my friends, and most of all how terrible of a role model i was in regard to my brothers. tears welled up underneath my eyes. i was a scumbag, a slob. i felt like such an inconsiderate jack ass that was blind to the world surrounding him. for once in my life the world did not revolve around me it revolved solely around the ones i loved. life isn’t about living for one’s self; it’s about living for others. my thumb pressed the tab on the door that released the locking mechanism, only surmounting enough energy to push the half ton oak door partially open. i slowly slid through the narrow opening i had managed to make for myself, took off my scum coated shirt, and sank into the suede couch in front of the television. “good morning.” my father said as he slugged into the kitchen. he looked older than usual. his wrinkles were more defined, his beard greyer than usual, his walk more hobbled and in need of a cane. too old to deal with the bull shit i consistently put him through. “what are you doing home so early?”  “i couldn’t sleep there,” i said referring to my friend’s house, “the couch was too uncomfortable.”  “well i’m glad you’re home.” he said with a smile as he proceeded to bubble the water for his morning coffee. silence occupied the air for the next few minutes. not because of tension but because of lack of interest. my dad knew i had been up to no good the night before, he did not know what, and he didn’t care, he was simply relieved that i had arrived home safely. “i’m sorry.” i softly said. “for what?” he replied. “for being inconsiderate and for treating you guys like you’re worthless all the time.” i sheepishly said into my chest. he chuckled, walked over to the couch, shot me another quick smile and put his hand on my shoulder. i stood up and gave him a gift rarely received by any of my acquaintances: a hug. he squeezed me as if he were trying to break my spine as he had always done and gave me a few pats on the back. i took as step back but he didn’t let go. he now had his hands wrapped around my non-existent biceps and looked me in the eyes. “you’re a wonderful son. you’re my son.”  got an a on that paper.",0,,

514707,"&gt;we walked through the fog, which seemed to part before her. i tried to talk through chattering teeth, but she placed a finger to my lips.   &gt;“still your tongue and follow. you will be warm soon enough.”   &gt;pumice crunched beneath our feet, and an archway of carved bone appeared. she led me inside, and we emerged into a great white hall filled with pale people, dining from bone-china plates and drinking from milk-crystal goblets. a huge fireplace was set into one wall, all morticed of alabaster and marble, and in the grate bloomed pure white flames, hot enough to flush my face and hands with pink.   &gt;“eat, drink,” my mother instructed, indicating a table full of pallid food. each delicacy was bleached of all colour, but the platters and tureens were still wreathed in delicious smells.   &gt;i knew that something was wrong. this scene had played out a thousand times, in a thousand different stories, spanning across all human culture.  one piece of wisdom was ingrained in us from childhood;  &gt;*whatever you do, don’t eat the food!*   &gt;with that realisation given voice in my head, the whiteness of this place no longer seemed beautiful, nor delicate and pure. it was corrupt and threatening, deathly, the waxy sheen of a corpse before it is burned.   &gt;“i have to leave,” i said, “i can’t stay here.”   &gt;her blank eyes held mine, her face a marble study of grief.   &gt;“i cannot hold you here. but surely, surely you wish to see me again?” the apparition of my mother crooned.   &gt;“i… i don’t know.”   &gt;it was all too surreal and wrong, jarring now. i felt sick and dizzy; the diffused light made my eyes ache and my ears rang with the voices of the ghostly people in the vaulted hall.   &gt;“you don’t know if you want to see your own mother?”   &gt;it was becoming difficult to stand, the bright whiteness reflected from every surface jabbed lances of ice through my temples.   &gt;“yes, of course i wish to see you again!”   &gt;“you wish us to come to the town?”   &gt;the pain was blinding; i couldn’t even make out shapes anymore, and huge milky occlusions marred my sight.   &gt;“yes,” i sighed, and then the storm of the migraine hit me like a tsunami, and mercifully wrenched my consciousness away from me.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;my father found me in the morning, curled up under a tree in the park on river road. this time i was too tall and heavy for him to carry, but i still buried my head in his neck and wept into his thick scarf like a child as we made our way back to the road.   &gt;with a cup of hot miso soup in my belly and a second warning my hands, i sat in the dining room and stared at the small shrine to my mother, the memories of the previous night a foggy jumble in my tender, aching head. despite two heavy blankets wrapped tightly around me, i still felt cold; as though the frosty recollections themselves were spreading a chill through my body.   &gt;“father,” i began, placing the cup on the low table, “i need to ask you a very strange question.”   &gt;“ask,” he said, worry crinkling his brow.   &gt;“have you… have you seen mother again? since she died?”   &gt;i counted heartbeats in the silence, three, then five, then seven. when he responded, his voice quavered slightly,   &gt;“once. i thought i saw her once – years ago, in the bad fog of ‘92.”   &gt;“i saw her, father. i saw her last night – and the night before.”   &gt;“no, you did not see your mother. you saw a spirit – an evil spirit called an *eidolon*, which tricks people into seeing their loved ones.”   &gt;he stared at the cup in front of me, then looked up, his brow creased with fresh worry.   &gt;“you didn’t eat their food, did you?”   &gt;“no.”   &gt;“drink their drink?”   &gt;“no!”   &gt;relief smoothed the lines on his forehead, and he stood,   &gt;“then you are safe. they cannot take you.”   &gt;i don’t know why it seemed important that i told him, but the last words i spoke to the phantom echoed in my head like hammer blows through fog, and i knew i had to.   &gt;“i told her that i wanted to see her again. that i wanted them to come back to the town.”   &gt;i have never seen a human face wear such horror as the mask my father’s became in that moment. he grasped my shoulders with trembling hands, his fingers sharp as naked bones.   &gt;“what have you *done?*”   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;not even stopping to take his coat, he pushed me out the door. the fog was thick already, barely lifted from the night before, and we were wet before he fumbled the keys into the lock.   &gt;“where are we going?”   &gt;“we have to get out of the town. we must go *now!*”   &gt;the engine turned over twice before it started, my father swearing uncharacteristically as we backed down the short driveway. the fog lights came on as we roared down the street, far too fast, heading for the main road.   &gt;we saw them then, as the yellow beams washed over them.   &gt;there were hundreds of them, loping through the streets like great white wolves; their white faces and white eyes lambent in the weak light. as we hurtled past the shop on the corner, i saw one attach itself to our neighbour’s throat with a flash of needle-like teeth, then begin to drain all the colour out of her.   &gt;we hit three with the car, their bodies dissipating into smoke – only for them to coalesce again behind the vehicle, where they howled in rage and ran after us, the fog roiling behind them.   &gt;the bodies of people we knew littered the road, and my father swerved to avoid their colourless forms. a man reeled out of the mist, one of the eidolons attached to his head, sucking the life from him. his mouth was open in a silent scream, and i watched him bounce off the front of the vehicle as we struck him in the hip.   &gt;glass shattered as a pale head reared through the driver’s window, fangs and claws sinking into my father’s shoulder. he yelled and flailed at it frantically, but each blow passed harmlessly through it, its weird substance impervious to the touch of mortals.   &gt;ahead of us i could see the fog thinning into the wan light of late afternoon – and through his agony, my father saw it too. white as wax now, almost all his vitality gone, he flung open his door and tumbled out into the fog.   &gt;a sacrifice, to ensure his daughter survived him.   &gt;the wheel was colder than snow beneath my sweaty palms as i hauled myself into the driver’s seat, foot frantically feeling for the accelerator. white shapes flashed around the car for a moment and i screamed in terror –  &gt;and then i was through. the fog trailed behind the car as it pulled onto the highway that would take me to the next town.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;the car failed and died half an hour later, inexplicably. as i stood on the side of the road in the blessedly ruddy light of sunset, waiting to wave down a good samaritan, the colour began to fade from the vehicle. before my eyes, red paint became grey, then silvery-white, then transparent. within minutes the whole car became thin and insubstantial, then finally dissipated into nothing at all, as though it had never existed.   &gt;my rescuer – an off-duty police officer – asked me if i was okay and where i was from, but when i said the name of my town and where it was located, there was no recognition in his eyes.   &gt;“it’s the first turn off the highway, just a bit further back.”   &gt;he gave me a quizzical look, then smiled, with just a hint of suspicion.   &gt;“you’re pulling my leg.”   &gt;“no, i’m not! i’ve lived there all my life! i was born and raised there!”   &gt;at the station in the next town, i studied the map the officer had handed me in the car. there was no turn-off into the valley, and no town was marked there. the river simply cut between the hills, then meandered on, only a few isolated farms nearby.   &gt;fishing in my pocket, i pulled out a handful of receipts from the shop.   &gt;each one was completely blank; all traces of ink gone. just like the town.   &gt;everything i’d ever known was gone, swallowed up by the mists of the eidolons.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt; &gt;----------- &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt; &gt;my hair is pure white, now. my once deep-brown eyes are so blue they’re almost colourless.   &gt;i wear contacts, and a wig, as no dye will hold to my milky tresses.   &gt;if i stay too long in one place, the house or apartment starts to get colder and colder. eventually, a lingering fog seeps from my radius until it blankets the area, thickening with every day that i stay on.   &gt;i did something terrible, the day that i invited that phantom into my life. not only did i destroy everything i’d ever known and loved, but i let something loose upon this world which should always have stayed set apart.   &gt;sometimes i think that one day i’ll grow tired of running, of waking up in cold rooms with nothing but white outside the windows. perhaps one day, in some forlorn motel, i’ll braid a telephone cord into a loop about my porcelain neck, ending all memory of my lost town forever.   &gt;but something inside me – that same ancestral intuition which impelled me down this dark path – tells me that should i die, something *worse* will happen.   &gt;and so, for now i stay living, and i will keep on living, so that the eidola will never return.   &gt; &gt;i have a feeling my life is going to be a *very* long one. &gt;",1,-1,
960547,"a short story i wrote, this one dating about 2002, or around about there. it’s pretty deranged, and it’s got absolutely nothing to do with my state of mind back then, but i did have a lot of fun writing this one. it’s a little immature going over and re-reading it, but i was young and didn’t really know a whole lot about writing. not that i do now, mind you, but its all fun and games until someone gets shot in the head with a nail gun. (oooh, cryptic foreshadowing!)   trix rabbit: chronicals   “silly rabbit! trix are for kids!” the words kept repeating over and over again in his mind. those damned children, holding a bowl of trix, just out of reach, offering spoonful after spoonful before ripping them away and stuffing their greedy little faces. “silly rabbit, trix are for kids!” they’d constantly recite. so close, yet so far. he just wanted one bowl of the fruity flavored cereal. he needed his fix. he’d do anything for it. just one, lousy bowl.   “augh!” the rabbit woke up in a cold sweat. this is how he started every morning, the same re-occurring nightmare, day in and day out. he reached for his handkerchief that he causally placed on his bedside table the night before. fumbling around with no luck, he muttered to himself, “did those little fuckers get that too?”   eventually he found what he was looking for. he sat up and wiped off his brow.  the rabbit made his way to the kitchen, the same kitchen he’d had for 30 years now. dull, boring, flavorless wallpaper hung in shambles in the unkempt rabbit hole. empty boxes of oatmeal were strewn about, dishes lay dormant in the sink. he turned on the fluorescent lighting, and noticed several cockroaches scurrying about. he cringed as he made his way to the cupboard, where the door lay half off it’s hinges. he reached for a box of brown sugar oatmeal. empty. he tried the apple cinnamon. empty. finally, he reached for the plain oatmeal. one pack left. he prepared it as usual, stirring it mindlessly as the sludge grew thick and pasty.   sitting down at the table, he continued to stir the oatmeal, staring off into space, contemplating who knows what. he took the spoon to his lips, but could not force the food into his mouth. who knows how long he sat there, motionless, oatmeal inches from his mouth. if you listened close enough, you could almost hear the snapping sound from inside his head. he threw the spoon away and poured the oatmeal over his head, threw the bowl against the wall, shattering it to pieces. in a fit of rage, he upturned the table and slammed it against the wall. the cupboard door came off it’s hinges and fell on his foot. lost in a blinding fit of rage, the rabbit proceeded to pound the walls until his knuckles bled. deep crimson red spread over the wall paper. it was the only color the kitchen walls had seen in years. he sank down to the floor and buried his face in his knees and sobbed for hours.   the kids were out and about playing soccer in the field, and for some unbeknownst reason, seemed to all carry a box of trix. the sky was blue, the grass was green, and everything was vibrant and full of color. after every goal scored, a ‘trix time out’ was called. the kids would enjoy their delicious sugar coated fruity cereal, all the time wondering if the rabbit would show up. oh what fun the rabbit was. so silly! if only he’d ask for some trix, the children would be happy to share their breakfast treat. but it was just as much fun to try and catch him in his silly disguises.   they remembered one afternoon, when they were snowboarding, the rabbit had dressed up as a snowman to try to get their trix. it almost worked too, for if little billy joe didn’t come over that ramp and knock the snowman’s head clean off with the snowboard, the rabbit may have very well gotten off with those trix!!   the rabbit had made up his mind. this is his day. he would get trix. those little monsters wouldn’t stand in his way anymore. they wouldn’t hold him back from getting what was rightfully his. he had a plan, and where he had failed before, here he would succeed.   the rabbit went to his room and opened the bottom drawer of his dresser, and pulled out his supercharged automatic custom nail gun. “those bastards are going to suffer if they get in my way again. no… they’re going to suffer anyway, i’ll be sure of it.” he said to himself as he turned off the safety and cocked the gun. he made his way for the exit to the world. no disguise this time… just him, his gun, and all of those living corpses.   he made his way quickly to the soccer field where he knew the kids gathered every morning to play soccer. as he approached, the children took notice and stopped their game. all began to smile and laugh, while a few started pouring bowls of fruity goodness. the look on the rabbits face did not catch their attention, nor did the nail gun he was toting. little billy joe ran up to greet him, saying “silly rabbit! we can see right through your disguise!”   the rabbit stopped dead in his tracks, not even looking little billy joe in the eyes, but rather staring into the horizon. “give me the trix, you little fucker.” billy joe, while puzzled at the use of profanity, managed to stammer out “s-silly r-rabbit… trix are for..” blam blam blam was the deafening roar from the nail gun the children heard next. little billy joes body was torn apart by the sheer force of the nails exiting the gun. they stuck in his body like pins in a pin cushion while his body still twitched.   the children all looked on in horror at what they had just seen. could this really be the fun loving rabbit that would always try to trick them out of their breakfast cereal? if he had just asked! now, now look what he had done to little billy joe! none of them could move as fear held its grip. what would become of them? just as all of these thoughts had entered their minds, the rabbit opened fire again, unleashing hell upon the field. “this is your fault! you made me do this! i hate you all you little monsters! why couldn’t you just share? every single one of you had a box of sweet, delicious trix, and none of you ever even offered me anything! you’re nothing but rabbit hating bigots, but now… now you all die! see you in hell, mother fuckers!”   when all was said and done, and the rabbit was out of nails to fire, bodies were strewn across the field, and the land was stained red the likes of which would probably never wash out. the smell of blood filled the air, as the nail gun kept spinning. the rabbits voice was a slowly dying scream as the last bit of air exited his lungs. corpses with the look of horror laid on the ground, and one could swear they were still trying to get away. some children had been nailed against nearby trees, some of them still breathing. they would surely die soon enough.   the rabbit looked out on the field, surveying his kills. he seemed content, but a stern look still masked his face. one dying child crawled up to him, grabbed his leg, and looked up at him. the child pleaded “why?”   “because i can.” was the rabbits answer before bludgeoning the child’s head with the nail gun. finally. finally trix would be his. there was nothing that stood between him and the sweet, fruity morsels. the stench of death would make his first bite all the sweeter. victory was in his grasp. he reached out to the nearest box with trembling hands. he picked it up and stroked it lovingly. “mine, all mine.” he repeated to himself, shedding a tear of happiness.   his ears caught the sound of a snapping twig behind him. he stopped and stood up-right, but he did not turn around. “silly rabbit. trix are for kids.” came a voice so icy cold, it could be contained by one type. the rabbit turned around. he was right. a goth. she stood only 4’ in height, dressed in all black, with jet black hair down to her shoulders, light skin indicating the sun was a foreign to her as sanity to the rabbit. “silly rabbit.”, she repeated, “trix are for kids.”   the rabbit cringed, “shut up! shut up shut up!!”, he screamed as he dove for his nail gun. quickly he remembered it was out of ammo, and instead started bashing the goth girl. she eventually fell over in a heap of blood. the rabbit turned around, and breathed a sigh of relief.   “silly rabbit.” cold sweat started forming on his brow now. she was dead. he killed her, just like he killed all of the other children. how could she still be alive? he faced her again. the goth girl had a stupid grin on her face as she ran her tongue across her lips, licking off the blood. “trix are for kids.” the rabbit lunged at her, knocking them both over. he sat on her chest and punched her while she laughed like a lunatic. the rabbit punched until she fell silent and limp. he stood up and started walking back towards the trix. it didn’t matter anymore. she could get up again and he would not care. he would merely eat the trix.   “silly rabbit.” the rabbit stopped dead in his tracks. she couldn’t be. why was she saying that. why wouldn’t she shut up? why cant he get his trix? why? he turned around. “why wont you die?!” he lunged at her again. the goth sidestepped and the rabbit fell. goth girl was upon him as swift as the night. before he knew it, the rabbit was in a lock that with one move, the goth could snap his neck. “please,” he said. “please, let me have just one taste.”   “trix are for kids.” she said, before snapping his neck. all faded to black for him. he never got to taste the trix. he never got what he wanted. in the end, he was a failure. if only he had just asked……",0,,
982821,"i wasn't attacking you. i chose my wording carefully; if i believed you were racist i would have said ""you *are* slightly racist yourself"".  no matter how you intended it, your statement came across to me as being slightly racist. you say that you don't believe you are racist against people from the middle east in your second response, but understand that the only thing i could base my opinion on was your original statement:  &gt; its only in recent years that they've started to experience ethnic groups (middle eastern) with agendas that aren't so benign, which i think has been a bit of a wake up call.  this statement **only** portrays those representative people in a negative light, therefore it **sounded** racist.  &gt; and as for your tip about orientals - you'd truely look foolish if you knew what i looked like.  no, i wouldn't. it *can* be a racist term. i *know* people who would treat it as such. just like someone calling me ""anglo"" (something which i'm not anyway.) i'm not saying it is on par with ""boong"", but it *can* be derogatory, depending on how you use it. individually, you or i don't get to decide if a word is derogatory or not.  case in point would be black-americans today using ""nigger/nigga"" with each other. some say it's fine, other say it's not and the word should be left behind with other remnants of the 19th century. neither of them are right or wrong on the true usage of the word.  &gt; the greeks and italians were called 'wogs', the orientals were called 'slopes' etc. and it was all perfectly socially acceptable.  ""wog"" used to be entirely derogatory, but the meaning of the word is changing. words do this, it's quite common. the ""wogs"" are self identifying with this word and choosing to use it. it's no longer just a label of a particular ethnic group/s, but a term for a segment of australian society. similar to the american usage of ""guido"" which i saw recently in iama.  ""slope"" is still entirely derogatory, but hey.  as for the social acceptance, in the last 20 years i cannot think of a single time when ""slope"" has been socially acceptable to be used by the majority of australians. same with ""boong"", ""dago"" or whatever. i have never encountered these words being used derogatively, and it being socially acceptable to the majority for them to do that.  i'm just wondering when exactly you left? you did mention ""despite the progress"", which gives the allusion that it was a while ago...  &gt; and yes having worked/lived in london, and done a fair chunk of work in new york - i have strangely never suffered from racially based jokes, prejudice etc in the corporate work environment - i can't say the same having worked in corporate australia.  i'll be honest, australians love stereotyping jokes. sometimes they *can* be just a smidgen racist. as an aside, i'd also like to mention that since moving to a relatively prosperous area, i've noticed that they can even be pretty prejudiced against themselves if there's no-one else around! fun times! i didn't have any point to make there.  &gt;australians are not a race. they are a nation. some countries have a history of a singular racial background and are therefore synonmyous, australia doesn't fall into that category.  pull the other one, sunshine! ;p  ""race"" is not an objective term, it is pretty subjective. it can be applied to a whole bunch of things, skin colour, ethnicity, background, language, self-identification, etc. when someone mentions australians without any other shiny little adjectives, you know and i know that the image for most australians will be **white**. it will be **british** origin. it will be **native english** speaker. they will be called **dave** or **bruce**.  it will not be a half-aboriginal half-vietnamese fella named tho le. or better yet, let's call him tho mbumbarra.  another point about semantic shift. racism need not even be applied to anything specific. it can be similar to plain old xenophobic colloquially. plenty of people can be called racist if they hate asians, or anyone with an american (us) accent, regardless of them being black, white, yellow, beige, tan or brown. i have personally witnessed these usages.  as a side note, it's similar in the way 'sex' and 'gender' are used. you could say your gender is male or female in colloquial speech. this wasn't the case 50 years ago. gender was strictly behavioural and sex was strictly biological.  as for you never having been subject to racist experiences in your workplaces overseas, good for you! i'm sorry you had to put up with it in corporate australia. my personal experiences of working in corporate australia in the last decade, although i no longer work in it, is that racism is **definitely not tolerated**, although the chances are i haven't worked in the same corporate areas you have.  have you considered the difference in background and circumstances as playing a role in the absence of racist remarks? it sounds like you've been jetsetting all over the shop. do you have a higher than average income? were you given a position whilst in australia? are you at a higher pay-grade than when you started working in australia? do people treat you as an *australian* foremost? all of these things and more might be contribution factors.  i **know** racism exists in society in new york and london, and can't imagine it would exist in the society at large and not have representation in the outskirts of the corporate workplace, where everyone talks slowly and laughs obnoxiously...  remember that you are only basing your *opinion* on what you have experienced and so have i. that is all.",1,0,0

385819,"he sat motionless in the car, eyes fixed on the house opposite. the house was in darkness, no light save for the pale illumination of the moon bathing the street in an eerie whitewash. the large house sat detached from any other on the street, it's large expanse of verdant garden surrounding it like a moat bordered by a low chain link fence. he glanced at the digital segment display clock embedded in the dash, the numbers glowing an ethereal green, momentarily before returning his gaze to the house. beds of brightly pigmented flowers lined the pathway to the front door and dotted the lawn, a sea of purples, yellows, and reds. a great silver birch tree dominated the scene, rising nearly as tall as the two storey house's slate tiled roof, it's bark gleaming in the moon's glare, matching the house's whitewashed wood panels in luminance. he grabbed the white cigarette box from the passenger seat, opened it, and plucked a cigarette fluidly, placing it between his lips loosely and throwing the box back onto the seat. a click echoed through the silence of the car as he pushed the cigarette lighter into the socket. moments later it popped back out, the smell of burnt dust accenting the air. he picked it up and brought the glowing orange coil to the end of the cigarette and lit it. placing the lighter back in the socket he inhaled deeply on the freshly lit cigarette, the tip glowing a deep red as he did so. nearly time he thought. the exhalation filled the car with smoke, a thick yellowish haze which made him crack a window to ensure a perfect line of sight on the house. nothing could go wrong tonight, this was his one shot.  the cigarette shortened as the man waited until finally he flicked it from the window, the used butt smouldering on the asphalt. now was the time, he thought to himself as he stared into his reflection in the mirror, an empty gaze meeting his own. the car door swung open and the man purposefully stepped out. he stood for a moment, hand resting on the door frame, whilst he surveiled the area one last time. still as the grave. he might've chuckled had the task ahead not been facing him. striding forward he flung the door behind him shut, the dull thud the only sound in the still night air. it was a cool night, not that it mattered, it had to happen regardless of the weather. a ball of mist hung around his mouth as he exhaled, only to be displaced as he strode forwards, crushing the still-warm cigarette butt beneath his heel as he passed. stepping up onto the kerb his black dress shoes grated lightly on some loose gravel kicked up no doubt by some passing car. the concrete slabs that lead to the door seemed of the purest white under the bright night sky. each step brought him closer to the house, his own plan ringing in his ears; kill them, no witnesses. he approached the door and extended his hand towards the unembellished know. his hand hovered an inch away as he weighed up his options. turning on his heel he stepped down from the porch and headed to the back of house.   the back garden was much the same as the front, kept neatly and tended to with much love. a wooden shed stood in the back right corner. he eyed it with curiosity before snapping back to the task at hand. a few cinderblock steps led up to the screen door and he took them silently, unlatching the screen door's length of string from it's makeshift hook and loop configuration. he tried the handle but it yielded no results. not to be deterred he brought a small cloth roll out of his pocket and laid it out on the top step. an assortment of slim hooked, curved, and straight metal lock picks lined the beige linen. he selected two with a deftness only from years of experience, and put the first into the lock. he tested the pins in the lock gingerly before slotting the tension wrench in, pushing the line again, and twisting. the door swung open, he picked up his tools, pocketed them and went in.   it took him a moment to adjust to the absolute darkness inside the house, but before long he could identify a kitchen as the room he was in. a pine table adorned with a red and white checkered water resistant tablecloth stood in the centre of the room. he walked by, running the fingertips of his left middle and ring fingers along the cool surface, focused solely on the doorway ahead of him. inside the house he could see no doors closed, a godsend for finding his target he thought. stepping through the doorway he followed the corridor into the main hallway of the house, walking parallel with the steps until he reached their foot where he stopped. listening closely for a minute he could hear nothing. could it be that they weren't home? no. no, he'd done far too much research for that to be true. crouching low he began to ascend the staircase, one step at a time, his shoe making little noise on the strip of carpet running down the middle of the stairs.   he stopped at the top. this was it. finally. now he just had to carry out his plan like in so many dreams before. he new exactly where to find them. stepping towards the only closed door he began breathing heavily. he twisted the doorknob and swiftly opened the door, still maintaining silence, though now his movements buzzed with a nervous energy. there, in the otherwise empty double bed, the rapist.   two giant strides and the man was upon his prey. straddling him on the bed his hands clamped down, crushing his target's windpipe. the shock woke the sleeping man and he began to struggle, hands clawing at his assailant's forearms, torso bucking in an attempt to throw his attacker. neither man was any larger than average, neither particularly muscular yet the assailant could not be moved, his grim determination set in his eyes, dead in the dim light. as the last ounce of oxygen bled from every cell in the man's body a surge of strength coursed through him, a last ditch attempt to stay on this planet. the two went tumbling off the bed and clattered onto the floor, rolling one on top of the other, each trying to maintain dominance. they traded punches in between grapples, neither willing to relent. the attacker, only slightly larger, used his size to his advantage, sitting on the other man's stomach and swinging wildly at his face. each hit made a sickening thud and a occasionally even a slight cracking sound. after several minutes of constant abuse the victim lay bloodied and in laboured breaths. the attacker stopped to catch his breath, and in doing so was caught off guard. the man threw his assailant off him and into the wall behind him, stumbling to his feet he threw his entire body weight into a shoulder slam pinning the attacker to the wall by his throat. the drywall cracked behind the attacker and the other man fell backwards onto the bed, keeping himself from falling with a single shaking arm. the attacker stayed slumped back against the wall and coughed, a metallic taste tinged his mouth as he spat and saw blood. the rage boiled within him again. he stepped to the battered form in front of him, it's face barely distinguishable in the dark, though the blood stains on the skin stood out clearly. he reached out a hand, grabbing the man by the collar of his pyjama top, and threw him with all his strength into the ground. he stamped on his skull, again and again, he could feel no more movement but he wouldn't stop until he was sure. from the corner of his eye he saw a waist-high wooden cabinet leaning against the wall. perfect. he dragged it along the wall to be next to the man on the floor, it's weight deceptive for the size. with the faintest trace of a smile he put all his strength into tipping it. the crunch was sickening and the mess on the floor worse, his victim's head now split and flattened. the dark red blood seeped into the pores of the wood between which the head had been sandwiched. chunks of everything this man had been squelched underfoot as the killer walked towards the door, the puddles of blood splashing onto his ankles as he walked.   as he reached the doorway, head spinning with the delirium of finally killing the rapist he'd planned the death of for so long, his stomach turned to ice and his heart froze. a pair of clear blue eyes looked up at him. illuminated by a ray of moonlight was the tear-streaked face of a young girl, porcelain skin contrasting long brown hair, reaching down to her pink nightie, teddy bear in hand. the rapist had been a father, he had been a person. so dead set on retribution the man had been he hadn't even considered there being a person behind the villainous cretin. yet here stood the furthest from that possible, here stood innocence and beauty, here stood happiness and life. here stood a witness. ""daddy?"" she whimpered. no witnesses, he thought.",0,,
340273,"this always feels like cheating to me, though, and for the reason that it's so easy, and the same pictures are used over and over again. it's just a messy version of a palette in that case, and you can do whatever you want with them. the other thing i've seen is people getting close using this method, then faking it even worse by changing the colors in the laid-out images to push it closer to the original. then you see duplicates of the same image all over the place, but that one is way more yellow, and this one way more blue.  edit: i prefer a more 1:1 match-up. i experimented a few years ago with an idea i had to make one picture transform into another of same dimensions by simply rearranging the pixels of the first. i started with 2 images of me - one quite orange, another all blues - and scanned the pixels of the second for the best match of the current pixel in the first.  here are 2 movies i made back then of the process: [blue to orange](http://www.garyfixler.com/bl2or_hi.mov), [orange to blue](http://www.garyfixler.com/or2bl_hi.mov). you can see the problem right away. it picks ""the best"" (i think it used hue and saturation) from a smaller and smaller pool, so it gets progressively worse as it moves down the list.  i suppose a way around that would be to choose randomly which pixels to swap from the first image, but my method to get around this back then was to sort all of the pixels of both images in some order - in my case i think i just used brightness - then 'overlay' them, and unsort back to the first image. this spread the errors out more uniformly and gave me a really nice remapping, though i don't seem to have a copy of it lying around.  i should also note 2 things:  1) that a better mosaic software than what you've detailed would also understand things like the gradients across the image, and lay out pictures such that these large blocks actually matched up with smaller divisions of blocks beneath them. this can be done simply by treating the source images the way you say, but as subdivided blocks in and of themselves. this way, something like obama's hairline running diagonally through a block would get a magazine cover with darkness in one corner, and lightness in the other, simulating more closely the original image.  2) simply averaging can give some pretty nasty results. if you have a chunk that has a lot of black and white noise, it will average to middle gray, but so will something that's just a smooth middle gray already, and the mosaic software may then choose something smooth instead of a more rough image. too, i've seen in my own work on other things that getting the average of a large chunk of pixels can give really unwanted results. blue and orange will become gray, and you'll end up using a gray source image in your result instead of something with blue and orange in it. red and green may mix to yellow, and you might end up choosing a vibrant yellow thing for that location. all in all, you'll get a working mosaic, but not nearly as solid as one that delves a bit deeper.",1,0,0

629596,"&gt;this is a common belief, but not one which squares with the available evidence. &gt; &gt;for example (not intended to be insulting to your faith, merely to demonstrate really clearly what i'm on about): &gt; &gt;i believe that invisible yellow pixies steal my socks each evening and instantly replace them with ones that looks exactly the same but are manufactured from the woven cotton navel-fluff of a unicorn. &gt; &gt;now, i can't logically disprove that assertion, but is it a rational thing to believe? no, because occam's razor (not a rule, but an invaluable heuristic) indicates that the simplest explanation is that my socks just stay where they are.  the key differences are:  1) in many religious sects god is something that can be experienced, either through ecstasy, meditation, or other things.  while to others there is no proof, so it's just an anecdote, for those who do have such experiences it's clear evidence, in fact it is indubitable.  2) it's not necessary in all religions to believe that a mythological figure is literally existent as described in a myth.  the point of many hindu, buddhist, jewish, sikh, and sufi schools of thought (among others) is to clarify that the myths point past themselves to something that is more difficult to talk about without metaphor.  there are even some christians who do the same and do not take the bible literally.  3) people who believe in god actually do have reasons for their belief.  sometimes they are poor reasons (such as fear that if they don't believe they'll be in trouble), but often it is because they regard the qualities that are inherent to god to be the most real and important things.  if one believes in god then beauty, justice, goodness, etc. have a deeper meaning and a grounding in an absolute.  that absolute can be argued for philosophically using reason.  they may be mistaken, or have reasons you regard as poor, but they have their reasons.  there is no compelling reason to believe in flying teapots, pixies, or unicorns, and given that they are a different kind of existent thing than god, the sorts of reasoning that one would use to account for god are very different than that to account for unicorns.  4) god is not like a flying teapot,  a pixie, or a unicorn.  those things are understood as things that at least potentially could be discovered in nature.  you could potentially create some kind of instrument or experiment and discover them empirically.  the nature of god is such that while some regard it as discoverable in some manner, the nature of that discovery is generally a private, internal thing, not some physical manifestation.  while there are too many literalist types that do imagine that some physical manifestation is possible, those are people making the error of taking the myths of their religion literally, and they are holding a foolish position.  literalism is not found in the whole of religion, it's just a fairly common error, much like believing in a personal god.  honestly, as soon as an atheist make a comparison of fairies to god it's clear that they do not have even a basic understanding of serious theology, and as such they are ignorant of what it actually means to be an atheist (for they know not what they deny) or a theist.  &gt;now, you can't prove the existence or non-existence of god (which is why i'm an agnostic), but to pretend that someone believes in an omnipotent, omniscient, intelligent, benevolent creator has as rational a position as someone who says ""i doubt it because there's no evidence whatsoever"" is simply not rational.  your definition of god is only one definition among many, and one of the easiest to refute.  i don't mind saying that there is no good argument that i have seen for a god by that definition, but i am still a theist since my god is a philosophical principle, not a personal god.  really what you've put out there is a straw man.    on a separate note, were plato and aristotle rationalists?  what about gödel?    fwiw, there are proofs for the existence of god (thomists are into that kind of thing), it just turns out that many old traditional proofs are weak given what we know about the way the world is.  but there are more modern arguments for the existence of god.  whitehead, william james, wittgenstein, and many others.  would you say that whitehead, james, and wittgenstein were not rationalists (i admit wittgenstein is iffy).  &gt;sorry. for the purposes of this discussion, by ""religion"" i mean ""any supernatural force or intelligence for which there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever"".  well then we're not talking about the same thing, so there's not much point in discussion.  if you were discussing mathematics with someone and they insisted that the only numbers they were willing to speak about were positive integers, would you want to carry on that discussion?    many people believe in supernatural things but are not members of any religion.  ""supernatural"" is a funny word since it might mean things like ghosts and fortune telling.  if you take ""supernatural"" to just mean something that is not a part of the natural world per se., though it might be expressed in it, then perhaps mathematics is a religion since there are number of philosophers of mathematics who are mathematical platonists.  it turns out that process theology (which is still popular in some camps) doesn't necessarily separate god from nature, so that god is not really supernatural there either (and also not omnipotent, etc.).  buddhism is regarded as a non-supernatural religion by some, and can be practiced and understood as both atheistic and non-supernatural.  if you could help me out and let me know specifically what you mean by ""supernatural"" that would be helpful.  if you could explain why you would hold that definition give that there are non-religious people who believe in the supernatural, and non-supernatural religions i'd appreciate that too.  the question of evidence is an interesting one.  some types of evidence that i regard as compelling are personal and private and not things that would be able to be scrutinized by science.  i have had enough experiences of sorts such that i am persuaded that there is more to the cosmos than the material universe (so i am in that sense a believer in the supernatural), but those experiences were mental states (premonitions, seeing remote things, etc.).  so while i may have personally meaningful evidence, i would hope nobody would be persuaded by it but me, since they did not experience what i did.    but there are also proofs supplied by reasoning that are interpersonal rather than private.  there are folks like the thomists who claim to have that kind of evidence, and while on first blush some of their arguments look simplistic, if you debate them you'll discover this is not the case.  their evidence is philosophical arguments rather than empirical data, but i'd say that inasmuch as they trust reason even when it is not grounded in sense experience that makes them more rationalists than empiricists.  they just accept pure reason, while modern self-proclaimed ""rationalists"" typically do not accept pure reason, but insist on empiricism.    with respect to what religion is, i haven't got a great definition, though i can say that yours is clearly inadequate.  the simplest definition i can offer is ""the stuff that is studied as the topic of comparative religion and philosophy of religion.""  this includes the whole - atheistic, non-supernatural, and naturalistic religions are included as well as others.  since the rest of your points largely depend on a weak definition that doesn't apply to all religions (including my own), i'll skip the rest to see whether we can sort that out.  there's no point in discussion if you can't recognize that religions can be naturalistic, atheistic, etc. and that supernaturalism is not inherent in all religions.  you really appear to be talking about fideist sects., more particularly abrahamic fideist sects., but they are not the whole of religion, and leaving out the rest from a discussion of religion is intellectually dishonest.

325797,"me: normal skin with intermittent dry patches.  some cheek redness.  pale, but not alabaster/sour cream.  just barely on the cool side of neutral in tone.  prefer light to medium coverage, i don't have major skin issues and don't mind seeing through my foundation as long as it doesn't cause a case of ""hey, why is your nose a different color from the rest of your face?""  **calvin klein ck one 3-in-1 face makeup in ivory** first place as is fitting for my recently emptied favorite.  perfect shade match, reasonable price (i feel like it was $35ish / 1 oz, but often on sale or at least eligible for a multi-point offer at ulta) and now, inevitably, out of production.  really good texture, medium coverage that didn't seem patchy or wear funny if i blended it out sheer.  if you tried this one and hated it, send it my way.  currently using: a series of pain in the ass custom blends, but i think i am close enough to happy with one that i'll put a batch in an airless pump.  roughly 2/3 wet n wild coverall in fair, 1/3 lord &amp; berry cream foundation in ivory.    **wet n wild coverall in shade 815 - fair ($4 / 1 oz)** nice, buildable coverage.  slightly paler and pinker than i am.  really does a good job for the cheapest of the drugstore cheapies, though it's maybe a little thicker consistency and fuller coverage than i'd like even if it was a color match.  **lord &amp; berry cream foundation in shades 8620 - ivory and 8610 - white-milk ($38 / 1.69 oz)** ivory is glowier (though not all the way to dewy finish) and peachier than my skin, but not too deep.  medium, creamy coverage.  every time i tried it on my arm i think ""oh, that could be good"", then i'd put it on my face and think ""oh, no.  is this how it happens to youtubers?  my face is obviously a different color than my ears, neck, chest... how tan are my arms, anyway?  they don't seem that different...""  it's perfectly fine, just not the right color for me.  white-milk is the same finish and pigmentation, but true white.  i use this as a mixer for the many many not-quite-there candidates.  **nyx stay matte but not flat in shade smf01 - ivory ($7 / 1.23 oz)** i hate everything about the way this behaves on me, and i should have known better than to buy it just from the full coverage label.  if i'm dry, it clings around the edge of every crepe-y flakey spot.  if i'm oily, it slides off in a weird patchy nonsense way.  it claims to have a matte finish, but takes so long to set that you'll need to powder if you want to leave the house before your clothes go out of style.  oh, and the shade is more like what i want in an undereye circle corrector than all over my face.  it's pale, it's peach, i'm sure somebody out there is making it work, but it was an absolute never again for me.  **nyx hd studio photogenic foundation in shade hdf01 - nude ($18 / 1.12 oz)** again a little too dark, a little too warm, that's going to be a theme here.  not far off, but enough.  it's better than the stay matte but not flat, but not very much.  certainly not 2.5 times the price much.  claims to soften lines and have a light diffusing effect, i didn't notice either of those things.  **becca radiant skin satin finish foundation in shades shell and porcelain (1.35 oz, discontinued, picked up for $10 each on hautelook)** shell is too dark and yellow.  porcelain is too dark and pink.  averaged together and mixing in a with a white foundation or medium works alright, but that's just too damn much trouble for a formula that i found shrugworthy.  it's just ok.  **sleek creme to powder foundation tester kit - fair/light ($5 / 0.28 oz)** cream to powder isn't really my jam, but i pick one up every couple of years just in case my mind changed while i was busy doing other stuff.  the sleek shade range is actually pretty darn good, and there are 5 pans that you could easily get several full applications from in the tester.  the full size product is $12 / .31 oz, and if i liked the powder finish more, i'd probably have one.  linen, oyster and oatmeal are not quite right, but all are close enough that i could probably fudge a decent face if i had to.  **loreal visible lift serum absolute foundation in shade 143 - soft ivory ($15 / 1 oz)** goes on about the right value but a little too pink, dries more neutral but also step too dark.  i can kinda get away with it if i wear it quite sheer, but it's easy enough to end up with an uneven face if i'm in a hurry that i just don't bother.  **bareminerals bareskin pure brightening serum foundation in shade bare porcelain 01 ($30 / 1 oz)** i love the idea of a serum foundation, but this feels like the serum and pigment run to every little pore and crevice and will not budge from there or blend for love nor money.  i can't believe how much i liked the sample (in bare linen 03, which was at least two steps too dark, but seemed to behave so nicely) and hate the bottle i actually purchased.  plus, for claiming to be the lightest coolest shade, it doesn't seem to be very much of either.  **loreal magic skin beautifier b. b. in shade 810 - fair ($11 / 1 oz)** for the uninitiated, the ""magic"" is that the bb cream comes out of the tube white and ""self adjusts"" to your skin color.  like the use of scare quotes suggests, there is no magic.  the pigment for the bb cream is carried in beads suspended in a white lightweight lotion, and the act of applying the lotion to your face provides enough friction to disperse the colored portion of the product.  this results in an unpleasantly gritty initial application followed up by an uneven and more unpleasant orange color.  the product claims to prime, perfect, hydrate and correct all in one step.  for oompa loompas who have gloves to help ignore the texture issue and are just fine with being orange, it probably does.  hard pass.  **physicians formula argan wear renew bb cream in shade light ($15 / 1.2 oz)** no matter how long and hard i shake, the fucking tube spooges argan oil all fucking over me every time i open it.  it smells nice, but i kind of wonder if there's a bb cream tucked in there anywhere, or if it's just an endlessly refilling potion of orange-tinged argan sadness.  way too dark.  way, way, way too warm.  about 17 ""way""s too messy.  i can only assume i was both drunk and optimistic about a self-tanning regimen that i will never pursue when i added this to my cart.  also, i don't know how this fucked up velvet-lounge-chair-orange is light, except maybe in relation to the ""light/medium"" shade, which i can only assume is 70s-carpet orangebrown.   **tarte bb tinted treatment 12 hour primer in fair ($36 / 1 oz)** oh man.  it's light enough, it's buildable from near-totally sheer, it's a little to peach to be a perfect shade match, but it's not so far off.  i want to love it because it claims to be ""skinvigorating"" and that's a great portmanteau.  i don't have reactive skin, generally.  i felt itchy by about the 5th hour, so i took it off with micellar water and followed up with a gentle wash (glycerine soap, lukewarm water, no scrubbing.)  my face was sore and overproducing oil the entire following day.  this is a never again for me, but i feel at least 8x as vehemently about it as i did the stay matte but not flat.  that was just an unworkably bad combination of coverage and finish, this was trying to melt my face.",1,-1,
295291,"sure! since i was starting off with a scan of the lineart, i first had to separate the black lines from the white paper so i could color underneath. to do this, i go to my channels tab, grab the magic wand tool and ctrl-click any of the three layers. this results in a marching-ants version of your lineart, which i use to create a new layer on my actual art. if i try and use the paint bucket now, i'll get a reversed version of my art- white lines on black. to get around this, i hit shift+ctrl+i to invert my selection to fill the actual lines.after using the paint bucket, i now have my lineart on a transparent layer- this means that i can color underneath my lines without worrying about damaging that actual art.   with that step out of the way, i create a plain white layer underneath as a base. i don't do much with this, it's just for aesthetic purposes, since everything outside the panels is going to be white. on a new layer, i start blocking out the backgrounds- i start with big square chunks to figure out what my dominating colors are. in this case, since the scene was a decrepit old building, i wanted to give the area a decaying feel, which led to my palette choices of muted desaturated greens, reds, and yellows. this also ended up making the main character pandora and her bright pink hair stand out very easily. the inside of the building was supposed to be a bit menacing, which red is always good for.  after i've got my background colors blocked, i do the same for characters- again, on a separate layer so they don't interfere with each other. after making my choices, i fill the gaps and make tweaks where i see fit. once i'm satisfied with this, i start work on lighting. the palette seemed to suggest an afternoon/dusk type of color scheme, so i made the light source overhead and angled a bit out, letting me cast dramatic shadows onto the building itself and create diagonal movement to complement the sidewalk's angle. the actual shadows are done on, you guessed it, a new layer, set to multiply at 70%-ish opacity. i used an average blue tone for the main shadows, and added progressively deeper shadows for the 2nd panel on pandora's face. the bottom panel actually looked too dark and unreadable with these, so i used a lighter blue tone for those shadows. more tweaking will happen, and then i begin work on polish.   something that really bothered me with the original lineart was the title- it was written in solid black, which was made largely unreadable against the artist's detailed linework. to solve this, i created a clipping mask layer over the actual lineart and colored in the title text. this looked all right to me, but i thought i could make it a little better, *so* with another clipping mask underneath that one, i used an airbrush to create a soft white back to make the letters pop a little better. i tried to give it a spray paint look with something extra circles and drizzles, to go with the gritty theme of the art.  i hope that helped. c:",0,,

(please don't mention iraq.. they have no democracy).  israel's neighbors must first learn to live with israel, a country they are still (with the exception of jordan and egypt to some degree) unwilling to accept.  need i remind you that in 1948, on the very day israel's inception and the withdrawl of the british, she was attacked by egypt, syria, transjordan, yemen, lebanon, and saudi arabia?  these arab nations attempted to destroy israel.  they (and others, e.g., iran) have been at war ever since (again, with the exception of egypt and jordan).  hamas and hezbullah are newer ""neighbors"" that continue the same fight to destroy israel and its inhabitants using newer means of rockets and bombers.  **israel can stop being xenophobic about their neighbors when their neighbors stop trying to murder them.**  the jews choose to live there as much as the arabs choose to live there.  your belief that the arabs have more of a claim to this land is wrong and the only justification you have given is outright lie: ""jews are not from israel, originally. this is a fiction. jews are from europe."" you say this despite the fact that jews have been a majority in certain areas of palestine for hundreds of years and the mizrahi jews have been there for thousands of years.  &gt;and learn to create institutions which protect their human rights, both in israel, and abroad.  agreed, everybody's human rights should be protected.  i obviously believe that israel has done a far better job than you give her credit for.  &gt;the discussion i wish to have with you, eangel, is not about who is right, and who is wrong - who is bad, and who is good. but instead, ""what is the way forward?"" and obviously you are of the opinion that the powers that be in israel, should wreak further chaos.  but how can you have a discussion about the future when you don't understand the past or the present?  an understanding of history and current politics is essential to formulate a plan and ideas for the future.  i would be happy to discuss the future.  you have at no point before brought up the future, and instead espoused your foolish and childish notions about the past and present.  don't pretend as if you have not engaged in this discussion about ""who is right and who is wrong"".  the arab and persian muslims must be honest with themselves about their past oppresion, slaughter, and persecution of jews, and of their complicity in the holocaust.  they must stop teaching their children hatred of jews as part of the state-sponsored curriculum in syria, saudi arabia and egypt.  the way forward is not a one-state ""solution"".  this is clear.  israel should not invite the hamas-led gazan murderers into the same state.  it is beyond disgusting that you would even recommend this.  israeli jews should not subject themselves to arab persecution once again, they should never again be dhimmi.  the jews should never again be forbidden by the arabs from visiting jerusalem and their most holy sites, the western wall, the temple mount.  their graves atop the mount of olivers should never be desecrated again by the arabs.  israel must disengage from the west bank and continue to build the wall which has reduced by 90% the murder and maiming of israelis by arab palestinian bombers.  your one-state ""solution"" has no place in reality.  it is difficult to even know where to begin in explaining the myriad reasons why such an ""idea"" is sheer idiocy.  at least now hamas and israel are separated by a border, your ""solution"" would make the previous bloodshed look like a day at the fucking beach.  i know you hate israel so much that you cannot even think clearly or reason, but you must understand that your ""solution"" of destroying israel and replacing it with one state including the west bank and gaza would result in the most astonishing bloodshed ever seen in the modern day in the area, both of jews and arabs.  do you hate the jews so much that you are willing to sacrifice the lives of so many, both jew and arab, in order to make your dream of the destruction of israel a reality?  i will now let you get back to your argument with the entire reddit community that one should yield liberty to fascist police officers.  another brutally stupid argument on your part, but at least on that thread people were paying attention.  -124 (as it stands now) is fairly impressive.  good work!",0,,

  i'm warm, muted, medium olive. nc20-25 in winter (just for depth reference, not surface tone) but warm up to nc30 in summer depending on sun exposure. i would say i'm slightly more green than gray. maybelline fit me matte in 128 is my summer shade, while revlon colorstay in sand beige 180 (darker and warmer than buff, but still olive) is my winter shade. naked skin 4.0 is almost right but just a smidge too dark, while nars fiji is close but a tiny bit too light and too pink. missha perfect cover bb in 27 works when i'm really tan, but is too orange otherwise.   foundation matching was a nightmare. i match to my neck / jaw and have some hyper pigmentation and acne. even though i'm definitely warm, traditional warm foundations pull orange on me even if they're about right in depth. neutral foundations mostly pull pink unless they're super muted / olive. if i had to make a foundation, i'd begin with a light gray/green, and add muted yellow with just a hint of ochre.   white-based pinks and corals make me look green as fuck (esp b/c pink is complementary to green, like how naked 3 / lorac unzipped makes green eyes pop). pastels and cool taupes wash me out and make me look gray and dead. nudes for ""white people"" are especially bad on me (don't pretend you don't know what i mean, those light beige colors). anything too bright and deep pops forward, while i recede into the background.   i look best in warm muted colors. what /u/lgbtqbbq says about white bases being unflattering is spot on. burnt orange, warm medium/deep red, etc. look great. warm olive green with brown undertones (basically a baby poop color) is about my favorite to wear. i pull off deep / muted cool colors, but not bright ones. if it looks like someone mixed a brighter color with brown, i will wear the hell out of it. stark white makes me look green, but cream makes me glow.   my perfect nudes are ud matte revolution in stark naked (reads almost orangey nude on me), and nars audacious barbara. nyx lip pencil in natural looks good (warm, muted, reads brown nude) but the formula sucks on me. mac sheen supreme in impressive is the perfect sheer rosy warm mauve.   nudes that doesn't work: nars audacious raquel is really close to barbara but just a little too cool / white and gives me floating lips. nars rikugien is a little too cool / pink. velvet teddy is close but reads just a bit too greige / light and makes me look dead. kat von d studded kiss lovecraft is just a little too mauve / cool. milani lipsticks in nude and teddy bare are so cool they read as literal gray, not greige on me.  reds that work: nars audacious leslie. warm brown muted red. it's a red that makes me look like i'm not even wearing a red, like it just fucking belongs on my face. wtf. i can pull off other mid tone muted reds, warm or cool (ud matte revolution bad blood, nars audacious charlotte, revlon colorstay moisture stain in ny red, nyc smlc in monte carlo) but nothing looks as natural as a slightly brown/orange red.   other lip colors: nyx smlc in copenhagen is a beautiful berry on me, milani matte black cherry is my idea vampy color (formula pills bc it's so dark, but looks gorgeous blotted). maybelline touch of spice looks good, but the warm tones in my skin make it look like a muted dark pink brown rather than a mlbb. kvd lolita 1 liquid (w/e the most recent batch of the original is) is a great chestnut rose mauve - natural, but almost sultry. i don't like pinks on me at all, so i go orange instead. peripera cushion lips in 04 orange and the orange tinted baby lips look great on me. everything looks less orange than it is bc i'm warm, but somehow i'm not warm enough to pull off warm foundation, haha.   blush: milani luminoso is basically the best on me. i look so glowy and alive, and the orange it turns on cooler folk just reads as warm coral/pink on me. milani romantic rose (flower petal shape) is a really nice subdued rose. my blush collection is lacking, but those are standouts.   kvd monarch's warm quad is my favorite eyeshadow, every color looks so good. urban decays discontinued pulp fiction palette is my hg version of naked basics. on my eyes, colors look much cooler than they are (naked 1 gunmetal looks blue in me) so i have to go warmer to compensate. even super shimmery golds don't look like too much on me, but neutral/cool champagne will pop silver.   concealer is tough. i have a pale yellow stick concealer for spots / surface redness that seems to work (nature republic twist up in #2). salmon is too bright for my undereyes and makes them look ashy and gray. i would say my eye bags read brown/purple, rather than blue or w/e, so it makes no sense to me that concealer that's too dark/orange for the rest of my face covers them so well.

(the reviews are listed in chronological order.) before trying my hand at johnnie walker red label (which i purchased as a gift for someone) i had tried whisky maybe once or twice, and it had only been canadian whisky. i wasn’t a huge fan of it, and it was all mass-market stuff like canadian club, crown royal, or “fireball”—which is more of a liqueur than a whisky.  i /loved/ johnnie walker red label when i tried it, had it over ice, thought it was the most amazing alcoholic substance my tongue had come into contact with yet. after that i graduated onto black label, which again i loved even more than red label—although this time i drank it neat—and somehow found my way onto /r/scotch, where i heard stories of the illustrious single malt. the next day i went out and bought bowmore 12, but this was not because of anything i had read on scotchit—rather i decided i should try a single malt before spreading the word and extoling the virtues of blended scotch whisky. after trying said single malt, i decided i would save my remaining black label for aiding my friends on their journey into the wonderful world of scotch.  but i digress: onto the reviews. -- **johnnie walker red label** (*blended scotch whisky*) colour: amber. nose: isopropyl alcohol, honey, something vaguely reminiscent of cinnamon. taste: vanilla, apple, harsh alcohol. finish: unidentifiable sweetness alongside toasted grains. taste dissipates almost instantly. conclusion: i loved it when i first tried it, but after trying a slew of single malts and a higher-end blend, i can understand why it’s mostly used for mixing. i tried some alongside some amaretto (evidently this is called “the godfather”) and it was pretty good, as far as mixed drinks are concerned. -- **johnnie walker black label** (*blended scotch whisky*) colour: caramel and gold. nose: isopropyl alcohol, vanilla, toffee. taste: dull caramel (only way to explain it, it’s like unsweetened caramel), vanilla, what tastes to me like corn-derived alcohol, butter. finish: fruity with a hint of peatiness or smoke. doesn’t fade as quickly as red label, more of an alcoholic undertone. conclusion: absolutely loved it in comparison to red label, but after trying a handful of single malts and going back to it, i cannae understand why one would choose a blend over a single malt. rife with grain alcohol, and what i swear tastes similar to corn-derived ethanol. -- **bowmore 12** (*single malt, islay*) colour: pale amber, very reminiscent of a hoppier beer, albeit without any carbonation. nose: peat smoke, honey, citrus (not lemon like the bottle claims, more like orange or tangerine?). taste: peat smoke, vanilla. finish: a nice and slow finish, with peat/smoke remaining in your mouth for quite some time. i imagine this must be what the remnants of smoking a cigar is like.  conclusion: i fell in love with bowmore 12 as soon as i popped the cork. the smell of it, the taste—when i purchased it i had no idea what a peated whisky was, let alone that it would be so smoky and so wonderful. the first alcohol i’ve ever found myself craving a glass of, and the flavour of it just pops back into my mouth at random. -- **glenlivet 12** (*single malt, speyside*) colour: paler than pale, it’s hardly there. nose: maple syrup, sugar cookies or lemon meringue pie (minus the lemon). it smells like a bakery in a bottle. (if a bakery were doused with alcohol first.) taste: reminiscent of a white wine in its oak and light honey… if you can get past the strong alcohol. also hints of demerara or raw sugar.  finish: sweetness, alcohol and sandalwood. and then it’s gone.  conclusion: i had a lot of trouble tasting this one, let alone enjoying it at first.  as time goes on (and after subsequent tastings) i’ve found more of the subtleties it has to offer, but i’m still not a fan. glad i purchased a teeny bottle. -- **highland park 12** (*single malt, island*) colour: golden nose: oak, moss, a soupçon of smokiness. taste: sweet with a bit of spice, somehow reminds me of a cough drop… but in a good way. there’s some fruit to it, some oceanic and smoky qualities as well—it’s a microcosm of the various tastes of scotch in a glass. finish: the spices that are in the background during the tasting seem to move to the foreground after you’ve drank it. very long, but ultimately unremarkable. conclusion: i likely won’t try it again. it was middle-of-the-road, i enjoyed it, but it didn’t change my life or anything. -- **ardbeg 10** (*single malt, islay*) colour: blonde hair. nose: smoked cheese and brine. taste: a platter of various smoked cheeses, french bread. finish: savoury, lasts quite a while. conclusion: this has been my favourite out of all the ones i’ve tasted—very much like drinking a meal; i actually felt comfortably full after drinking this dram. -- **glenfiddich 12** (*single malt, speyside*) colour: the yellow side of amber. nose: banana, apple, hint of vanilla.  taste: very sweet, the same fruit as the nose, but with underlying maltiness. finish: slow, oak and apples—like bobbing your head into a barrel of apples (if it was filled with whisky rather than water)—it simultaneously lingers, but disappears. maybe i’m just remembering it longer than i’m actually tasting it. conclusion: ‘twere i to sum this whisky up in a single word, it would be “inoffensive”. i enjoyed it, and it is definitely pleasant. but it doesn’t push any boundaries. -- **lagavulin 16** (*single malt, islay*) colour: dark brown. nose; brine and fish, with peated smoke. taste: like someone held a vat of fish over a flaming peat bog. but in a good way. finish: it seemed to disappear from my tongue with surprising swiftness for having such a strong flavour. left my senses befuddled, and my palate unusable for a while. conclusion: i’m not sure i understand the hype behind it—i enjoyed it, sure, but not as much as some of the other offerings i’ve had. seems like it’s a status symbol more than anything else. --  so there you have it, my first 8 reviews. i just figured i might as well post 'em since i've enjoyed the other reviews on scotchit so thoroughly. hopefully someone else'll enjoy mine, even though they came in the form of an essay. :s",0,,

949802,"thank you.  most people don't understand how codominant phenotypes work.  here's the basic biology 101 gist:  a trait can have dominant alleles or recessive alleles or it can be the combination of both in the case of *codominance.*  many phenotypes like skin and eye color are actually a combination of dominant and recessive alleles which express in a particular way.  it is quite possible for two people with codominant traits to produce offspring who express exclusively as dominant traits or exclusively as recessive traits.  this is why it is possible for two brown-haired people to produce a red-haired child, because the mutation never disappears, it is just subdued by more dominant allele expressions.  in fact, two dark-skinned black people can produce a pale-skinned white child if they have the combination of traits most easily recognized in whites and the child expresses just those traits.  note, this is unlikely.  the most common result of codominance is some gradation, but the offspring of two half-black parents is just as likely to appear as 100% dark skinned as she is 100% light-skinned.  however, the inclusion range for ""blackness"" is so much broader than ""whiteness"" that it is rare to see ""white"" offspring from visibly ""black"" parents.  furthermore, the ignorance of the way we define race is such that we only account for a small number of phenotypical traits when we draw lines to separate groups.  there is a particular fingertip whorl present in an african tribe that is more similar to swedes than to the neighbors of that tribe, but since they have dark skin we call them black.  think about the broad noses and almond eye shapes that east asians share with east africans.  the dark skin and thick, curly hair new guineans share with bantu-descended peoples.  the short height shared between african pygmies and south american tribal peoples.  the enormous height of the masai and the northern europeans.  or the red skin pigment that the khoi-san bushmen and native americans share.  basically, white scientists grew up around white scientists and called it ""race"" because it was an easily recognizable trait for people measuring arm lengths with calipers by the light of whale oil lamps.",1,0,0

285147,"from the website: it's leading you to the edge of the world, craig. stop now before you fall into the pits of hell.  i believe i am already there, he thought morbidly. craig held his hands to his ears to block the freezing wind and shut out the voices in his head. he couldn't take anymore of it. the exposed skin of his body ached from the biting wind. he wondered when the inhumanity was going to stop.  not until your dead, craig! not until you're dead!  just then, craig screamed at the top of his lungs. he screamed for perhaps a full minute, driving all his inner voices away.  he stopped abruptly, letting his head swim a little. after a moment, he opened his eyes and peered into the mystic black. far off into the distance, there was a tiny speck of light. craig's bloodshot, cold, gray eyes stared fixedly on the seemingly distant star. ""holy fuck,"" he muttered.  holy fuck was right. craig was appalled that he was actually seeing something. his fear of blindness was temporarily over. he hollered into the vast darkness. the chilling breeze died instantly and the distant speck of light wavered like a twinkling star.  craig looked around himself through the darkness. there was only the lonely speck far off into the distance. he began to walk toward it. whatever it was, it was something. and in this world, that was definitely something to give full attention to. craig's curiosity got the better of him and before he knew it, he was sprinting as fast as he could toward the glowing light.  maybe it was a way out, he thought known people who had talked about the light at the end of the tunnel. maybe this was a very large tunnel and that speck was the light at the end of it. he could only pray harder that it was. as craig got nearer and nearer, he saw that the speck of light was a large ball of fire, lazily drifting in the middle of the air.  ""what the hell?"" he muttered. he drifted closer, feeling a tinge of heat for the first time. it felt so good. he wondered if the fireball was dangerous. it almost had to be if it existed in this world, didn't it? craig was almost sure that nothing good could ever come from this world.  ""hello?"" craig said tentatively.  the orange ball of flame flickered soundlessly in the pitch black of the dark world. it cast odd orange light on the concrete below.  it's a ghost, craig's mind screamed. it is a lost soul who has been trapped here.... just like you. craig refused to believe that. though it was a ball of fire precariously floating in the middle of the air, craig had to accept it because it was there in front of him. he was seeing it with his very own eyes. still, his mind planted that seed of doubt.  ""who are you?"" craig asked.  the flaming sphere flickered, then a change began. the flame dulled from the bright orange to a glowing azure. suddenly, it began to sprout limbs. it's changing into a monster.  craig's mind yelled at him to run, but he stood still, unable to move, watching the glowing transformation. even if he did run, again, where would he go?  the burning, blue fire was transforming into a figure. craig starred transfixed as the object propagated a head. the head stretched the taunt skin of its shoulders as it came up and out. it was bald with dominant features, short horns where its ears should have been, and piercing, black eyes, and a large flat nose. it growled softly, lifting up its arms. it is a demon, craig thought on the verge of fainting. his mouth suddenly went dry and he trembled, fear building inside him to a near hysteria.  the demon floated several feet into the air, shining radiantly with that ominous, blue light craig had seen in his bedroom. suddenly, the demon stopped growling and craned its neck toward craig.  the demon floated several feet into the air, shining radiantly with that ominous, blue light craig had seen in his bedroom. suddenly, the demon stopped growling and craned its neck toward craig.

371501,"&gt;we walked through the fog, which seemed to part before her. i tried to talk through chattering teeth, but she placed a finger to my lips.   &gt;“still your tongue and follow. you will be warm soon enough.”   &gt;pumice crunched beneath our feet, and an archway of carved bone appeared. she led me inside, and we emerged into a great white hall filled with pale people, dining from bone-china plates and drinking from milk-crystal goblets. a huge fireplace was set into one wall, all morticed of alabaster and marble, and in the grate bloomed pure white flames, hot enough to flush my face and hands with pink.   &gt;“eat, drink,” my mother instructed, indicating a table full of pallid food. each delicacy was bleached of all colour, but the platters and tureens were still wreathed in delicious smells.   &gt;i knew that something was wrong. this scene had played out a thousand times, in a thousand different stories, spanning across all human culture.  one piece of wisdom was ingrained in us from childhood;  &gt;*whatever you do, don’t eat the food!*   &gt;with that realisation given voice in my head, the whiteness of this place no longer seemed beautiful, nor delicate and pure. it was corrupt and threatening, deathly, the waxy sheen of a corpse before it is burned.   &gt;“i have to leave,” i said, “i can’t stay here.”   &gt;her blank eyes held mine, her face a marble study of grief.   &gt;“i cannot hold you here. but surely, surely you wish to see me again?” the apparition of my mother crooned.   &gt;“i… i don’t know.”   &gt;it was all too surreal and wrong, jarring now. i felt sick and dizzy; the diffused light made my eyes ache and my ears rang with the voices of the ghostly people in the vaulted hall.   &gt;“you don’t know if you want to see your own mother?”   &gt;it was becoming difficult to stand, the bright whiteness reflected from every surface jabbed lances of ice through my temples.   &gt;“yes, of course i wish to see you again!”   &gt;“you wish us to come to the town?”   &gt;the pain was blinding; i couldn’t even make out shapes anymore, and huge milky occlusions marred my sight.   &gt;“yes,” i sighed, and then the storm of the migraine hit me like a tsunami, and mercifully wrenched my consciousness away from me.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;my father found me in the morning, curled up under a tree in the park on river road. this time i was too tall and heavy for him to carry, but i still buried my head in his neck and wept into his thick scarf like a child as we made our way back to the road.   &gt;with a cup of hot miso soup in my belly and a second warning my hands, i sat in the dining room and stared at the small shrine to my mother, the memories of the previous night a foggy jumble in my tender, aching head. despite two heavy blankets wrapped tightly around me, i still felt cold; as though the frosty recollections themselves were spreading a chill through my body.   &gt;“father,” i began, placing the cup on the low table, “i need to ask you a very strange question.”   &gt;“ask,” he said, worry crinkling his brow.   &gt;“have you… have you seen mother again? since she died?”   &gt;i counted heartbeats in the silence, three, then five, then seven. when he responded, his voice quavered slightly,   &gt;“once. i thought i saw her once – years ago, in the bad fog of ‘92.”   &gt;“i saw her, father. i saw her last night – and the night before.”   &gt;“no, you did not see your mother. you saw a spirit – an evil spirit called an *eidolon*, which tricks people into seeing their loved ones.”   &gt;he stared at the cup in front of me, then looked up, his brow creased with fresh worry.   &gt;“you didn’t eat their food, did you?”   &gt;“no.”   &gt;“drink their drink?”   &gt;“no!”   &gt;relief smoothed the lines on his forehead, and he stood,   &gt;“then you are safe. they cannot take you.”   &gt;i don’t know why it seemed important that i told him, but the last words i spoke to the phantom echoed in my head like hammer blows through fog, and i knew i had to.   &gt;“i told her that i wanted to see her again. that i wanted them to come back to the town.”   &gt;i have never seen a human face wear such horror as the mask my father’s became in that moment. he grasped my shoulders with trembling hands, his fingers sharp as naked bones.   &gt;“what have you *done?*”   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;not even stopping to take his coat, he pushed me out the door. the fog was thick already, barely lifted from the night before, and we were wet before he fumbled the keys into the lock.   &gt;“where are we going?”   &gt;“we have to get out of the town. we must go *now!*”   &gt;the engine turned over twice before it started, my father swearing uncharacteristically as we backed down the short driveway. the fog lights came on as we roared down the street, far too fast, heading for the main road.   &gt;we saw them then, as the yellow beams washed over them.   &gt;there were hundreds of them, loping through the streets like great white wolves; their white faces and white eyes lambent in the weak light. as we hurtled past the shop on the corner, i saw one attach itself to our neighbour’s throat with a flash of needle-like teeth, then begin to drain all the colour out of her.   &gt;we hit three with the car, their bodies dissipating into smoke – only for them to coalesce again behind the vehicle, where they howled in rage and ran after us, the fog roiling behind them.   &gt;the bodies of people we knew littered the road, and my father swerved to avoid their colourless forms. a man reeled out of the mist, one of the eidolons attached to his head, sucking the life from him. his mouth was open in a silent scream, and i watched him bounce off the front of the vehicle as we struck him in the hip.   &gt;glass shattered as a pale head reared through the driver’s window, fangs and claws sinking into my father’s shoulder. he yelled and flailed at it frantically, but each blow passed harmlessly through it, its weird substance impervious to the touch of mortals.   &gt;ahead of us i could see the fog thinning into the wan light of late afternoon – and through his agony, my father saw it too. white as wax now, almost all his vitality gone, he flung open his door and tumbled out into the fog.   &gt;a sacrifice, to ensure his daughter survived him.   &gt;the wheel was colder than snow beneath my sweaty palms as i hauled myself into the driver’s seat, foot frantically feeling for the accelerator. white shapes flashed around the car for a moment and i screamed in terror –  &gt;and then i was through. the fog trailed behind the car as it pulled onto the highway that would take me to the next town.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;the car failed and died half an hour later, inexplicably. as i stood on the side of the road in the blessedly ruddy light of sunset, waiting to wave down a good samaritan, the colour began to fade from the vehicle. before my eyes, red paint became grey, then silvery-white, then transparent. within minutes the whole car became thin and insubstantial, then finally dissipated into nothing at all, as though it had never existed.   &gt;my rescuer – an off-duty police officer – asked me if i was okay and where i was from, but when i said the name of my town and where it was located, there was no recognition in his eyes.   &gt;“it’s the first turn off the highway, just a bit further back.”   &gt;he gave me a quizzical look, then smiled, with just a hint of suspicion.   &gt;“you’re pulling my leg.”   &gt;“no, i’m not! i’ve lived there all my life! i was born and raised there!”   &gt;at the station in the next town, i studied the map the officer had handed me in the car. there was no turn-off into the valley, and no town was marked there. the river simply cut between the hills, then meandered on, only a few isolated farms nearby.   &gt;fishing in my pocket, i pulled out a handful of receipts from the shop.   &gt;each one was completely blank; all traces of ink gone. just like the town.   &gt;everything i’d ever known was gone, swallowed up by the mists of the eidolons.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt; &gt;----------- &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt; &gt;my hair is pure white, now. my once deep-brown eyes are so blue they’re almost colourless.   &gt;i wear contacts, and a wig, as no dye will hold to my milky tresses.   &gt;if i stay too long in one place, the house or apartment starts to get colder and colder. eventually, a lingering fog seeps from my radius until it blankets the area, thickening with every day that i stay on.   &gt;i did something terrible, the day that i invited that phantom into my life. not only did i destroy everything i’d ever known and loved, but i let something loose upon this world which should always have stayed set apart.   &gt;sometimes i think that one day i’ll grow tired of running, of waking up in cold rooms with nothing but white outside the windows. perhaps one day, in some forlorn motel, i’ll braid a telephone cord into a loop about my porcelain neck, ending all memory of my lost town forever.   &gt;but something inside me – that same ancestral intuition which impelled me down this dark path – tells me that should i die, something *worse* will happen.   &gt;and so, for now i stay living, and i will keep on living, so that the eidola will never return.   &gt; &gt;i have a feeling my life is going to be a *very* long one. &gt;",1,-1,

 ---stupid people!! why must so many people be so stupid!?   you know what i love!!?  ---making fun of stupid people doing stupid things! like one time when i was watching this freshman try to get on a computer that needed a password....he typed in the password........and waited. the retard didnt press enter or anything. he just waited. then he started cussing at the computer saying it was screwed up. then the freshman went and got a teacher and the fucking teacher could not figure out why it wasnt going anywhere!!! jesus!! personaly i think they should be shot.  you know what i love!!?  ---natural selection!!!!! god damn its the best thing that ever happened to the earth. getting rid of all the stupid and weak orginisms........but its all natural! yes!i wish the government would just take off every warning label. so then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or die! and boom, no more dumbasses. heh.  you know what i hate!!?

853306,"i would direct you to the tremendous work ""the invention of the white race"" by ted allen. [here is a complete summary](http://clogic.eserver.org/1-2/allen.html) of that work.      racism relies on a confluence of power + prejudice, requiring both. not all ethnic prejudice is racism (which does not imply it's ok, just that it's not in power). for example, a black person's distaste for white people in the united states likely does not wield systemic apparatus of oppression, whereas white supremacy has hundreds of years of institutional weight. people of color can be racist toward one another, furthering those systems of oppression horizontally, but not racist against whites as white people are not categorically oppressed for their whiteness.      racism =/= all forms of bigotry. racism is a social theory a few hundred years old (or arguably, a few thousands years old) that describes ""races"". races are socially constructed categories of privileges and burdens superimposed over allegedly biological features.      for example, ancient egyptians described ""egyptians"", ""asiatics"", ""libyans"", and ""nubians""; when light-skinned people held power, light skin was divine and dark skin profane; when dark-skinned people held power, dark skin was divine and light skin profane. medieval europeans used the bible to classify ""semitic"" (asiatic), ""hamitic"" (african), and ""japhetic"" (indo-european) peoples. the french diploamat de gobineau became an early proponent of white supremacy in the 1800s, defining a ""black"", ""white"", and ""yellow"" race, with others adding ""red"" and ""brown"". thomas huxley saw ten different racial categories. the racist science of phrenology (1780-1960) defined a ""caucasian race"", ""mongloid race"", ""malay race"", ""negroid race"", ""american race"", ""australoid race"", and ""capoid race"". the nazis believed europeans had alpine, mediterranean, or nordic heredities, and turned the ""aryan"" from a historical discription of northern indian and indo-european migration patterns into a mythologized racial ideal complete with magical powers. the point here is that all of these racial ""sciences"" are bullshit, race is not a properly scientific description of biology: race is socially constructed, and racial groups cannot be biologically defined. people who believed they could calculate and measure skull shapes to show africans as inferior also believed shit like that there was an extinct and superior ""atlantean race"" that the ""lower races"" overthrew, explaining the lost civilization of atlantis. their sciences have been debunked, even though some dubious modern holdovers remain in medical sciences.      in many ancient cultures, physical features had psychological and moral qualities, often environmentally determined, but familial or tribal affiliation held more importance than an individual's physical appearance.  as per wikipedia, ""in many ancient civilizations, individuals with widely varying physical appearances became full members of a society by growing up within that society or by adopting that society's cultural norms."" ethnic oppression could certainly exist, but ""white people"" as a category were not yet a thing really.      “when the first africans arrived in virginia in 1619, there were no ‘white’ people there; nor, according to the colonial records, would there be for another sixty years.” — theodore w. allen      race theory is a specific theory of human ethnicity. the modern notion of a ""white race"" originates to a large extent [on anglo-american plantation colonies following the bacon rebellion in the united states](https://medium.com/message/how-white-people-got-made-6eeb076ade42#.drgi30oed). angry colonists of various backgrounds rebelled against colonial authorities for not exterminating the native americans from virginia fast enough. whites and blacks, who did not disidentify with one another, both took part. in response, colonial authorities made the racial caste of slavery rigid to divide ""whites"" from ""blacks"" to quell uprisings, passing the virginia slave codes of 1705. instances like these are the primary origins of *legal* definitions of race in the modern era. at times like this, the anglo-dominated media considered irish as african, and thus more fit for servitude; only later did the irish ""become white"". we can see the socially-constructed nature of race there. whites gained  significant advantages in property ownership and rights over people of color as the privileges of ""whiteness"" entitled them to, but nevertheless many remained poor and landless. the effect however was to give poor whites allegiance to rich whites instead of poor people of all backgrounds, and it worked. likewise, ""blackness"" arose and collapsed distinctions between many african peoples who earlier categorists (including africans themselves) saw as quite distinct, conferring numerous burdens, especially that of enslavement. race theory at the time proposed with the ""one-drop rule"" a legal basis by which anyone with even one black ancestor would be classified as black; the concept evolved over the 19th century and became codified into law in the 20th century.      james baldwin:   &gt;""america became white — the people who, as they claim, ‘settled’ the country became white — because of the necessity of denying the black presence, and justifying the black subjugation. no community can be based on such a principle — or, in other words, no community can be established on so genocidal a lie. white men from norway, for example, where they were norwegians — became white: by slaughtering the cattle, poisoning the well, torching the houses, massacring native americans, raping black women… because they are white, they cannot allow themselves to be tormented by the suspicion that all men are brothers.""      at root, the development of capitalism in the americas relied upon racial systems for dividing laborers amongst one another, and creating unities between poor and rich colonizers. capitalism relied upon a system of white supremacy for justification and for stability. the genocide, slavery, and exploitation of millions, that built an engine of plutocracy and profiteering, depended absolutely on an ideology of subjugation whose logic was race.",1,-1,1

257927,"“not haunted,” darius said.  “what?” ebenezer the proprietor said.  they stood at the dingy hotel’s front desk, partially illuminated by a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling by a wire.  lightning flashed outside the rain-spattered windows, briefly illuminating a notched sword that hung mounted on the wall behind the front desk.  a family heirloom.  “sorry,” darius said, shouldering his laptop bag.  “the billsbury hotel will *not* be included in the 2014 edition of penguin press’ haunted buildings and parks of america.”  “wait!” ebenezer said, grabbing darius’ arm.  “i showed you the way the lights flicker, the way the temperature drops, how the windows rattle…”  “yes,” darius agreed, “that’s probably why there aren’t any guests.  you need renovations.”  “i need guests,” ebenezer said slowly, “but do i really need renovations?”  he reached into his back pocket.  “look!” he said, unfolding some money on the counter, “it’s the ghost of ben franklin.”  darius looked at the hundred dollar bill.  “yes,” he said slowly, “maybe i overlooked something.”  he paused, “but when a building only has one ghost… it only gets a tiny paragraph.  there’s a *three ghost minimum* for a full-page writeup.”  muttering to himself, ebenezer pulled out two more hundred dollar bills and put them on the counter.  darius took them.  “i’ll stay the night,” darius said, shoving the money into his suitcase.  “i’ll do the writeup here and show you in the morning.”  smiling, ebenezer grabbed the key to room 101 from the peg on the wall and handed it to darius.  “after you see the writeup,” darius said, “i expect to be tipped.”  he spoke carefully.  “otherwise, who knows what changes my editor might make?”  ebenezer’s smile dropped.  three hundred dollars wasn’t enough?  this was robbery.  but what choice did he have?  he’d bought this creaky old hotel for sixty thousand dollars.  at the time it seemed like a bargain.  but after six months’ work, he’d only had a few dozen guests.  the hotel’s location was good; right in the middle of the most beautiful part of the forest.  but its decrepit appearance turned guests away.  he’d applied for a loan to finance the much-needed renovations, but his application had been denied.  the ‘ghost-chaser’ niche was his only hope.  darius took the key and walked down the hall, holding his laptop bag and roller suitcase.  the money in his pocket felt good.  it told him that he was a professional writer.  the 2014 edition of penguin press’ haunted buildings and parks of america was darius’ first book contract.  the author of the 2013 edition had mysteriously committed suicide at a b&amp;b deep in the appalachian woods.  not too far from this hotel, actually.    darius suspected that the true cause of her death was boredom and disappointment.  she had once been a popular murder-mystery writer, accustomed to doing book tours in cities like new york, tokyo, and moscow.  but then it came out that one of her novels was entirely plagiarized.  they’d sued her for everything she was worth.  she was reduced to taking whatever open contracts penguin press had available.  for practically no pay.  darius hated the job too.  he’d been to seventy-five hotels in the last month.  no ghosts yet.  just a lot of desperate small-business owners.  at first, the unsolicited bribes had surprised him.  he’d refused to accept them.  after being raised on a diet of ghost stories and tv shows about paranormal experts, he clung to the belief that his investigations would uncover startling revelations of paranormal phenomena.  that lasted for about a week.  they were just old hotels.  the only scary things about them were the fire code violations, the about-to-collapse ceilings, and the enormous cockroaches.    it was a pretty boring job.  sitting around a hotel room, describing imaginary noises in the night, trying to think of synonyms for the word ‘scary’.  taking bribes became his only source of excitement.  he was surprised at how much money these old hotel owners were willing to pay.  he felt sorry for them.  most of them looked like they had squandered their inheritances, or misspent their 401(k)s.  but that wasn't his problem.  business was business.  that was a lesson, darius thought.  get money, but stay mobile.  if these bribes kept up—two hundred to five hundred bucks per hotel—then pretty soon, darius would have enough money to go live on an artists’ commune in mexico for a few years.  he could finish his series of fantasy novels; the quadrilogy of bjork the orc--a series closely based on lord of the rings, but from the orcs' perspective.  and then, if those got published… he could have enough money to move back to america and be a full-time novelist.  life was good.  darius set down his roller suitcase and opened his laptop on the bed.  he began to write.  the windows rattled, breaking his concentration.  he wrote another paragraph.  the windows rattled.  his paragraph was boring.  he deleted it.  the windows rattled again.  thunder boomed.  was it getting cold in here?  he pulled a blanket over his shoulders.  the lights flickered.  the windows rattled.  darius got up and walked towards the window.  there had to be a way to stop it from rattling.  he took out a piece of gum and tried to shove it between the windowpane and its mount.  lightning flashed.  for an instant, darius thought he saw a figure in the woods, soaked with rain, wearing white.  staring at him.  darkness.  the patter of raindrops.  no, he was just imagining things.  he’d been on the road for a month, describing imaginary ghosts for eight hours a day.    he shook his head at his apparent lapse of wits.  the window had stopped rattling.  he was about to turn away when the lightning flashed again.  for an instant, he glimpsed the figure in white again.  she was closer now.  her hair and nightgown were drenched.  bright red blood dripped from a bullet wound above her ear.  she was shouting something at him.  he knew her.  she was the author of the 2013 edition.  the late author.  dead.  her voice was haunting, inhuman.  like a record being played backwards.  “run!” she screeched in cacophony of oscillating pitches, “run!”    darius shivered.  this was good stuff.  he didn’t know how this was happening: was he hallucinating?  was this the work of his overwrought imagination?  it didn’t matter.  he could write about this.  he could make some serious money. he stared out the window, begging for another flash of lightning.  a cold claw-like hand grabbed his shoulder from behind.  darius screamed.  he looked down to see the bony green fingers of a terrible monster.  darius spun around.  yellow fangs, red eyes, flared nostrils.  thick tattoos covered its face.  “b-bjork,” darius stuttered, “y-you’re bjork the orc.  you’re not real.”  bjork grinned, showing his terrible maw.  successive rows of shark-like teeth cast shadows on each other in the flickering light.  “how badly,” bjork growled, “do you need me?” bjork tightened his bony green hand around darius’ pale pink throat.  “what?” darius squeaked.  “you’re writing a book about me,” bjork growled, “what do i get?”  darius’ eyes shot towards his rolling suitcase.  there was over ten thousand dollars inside.  cash.  he’d wanted to put it in the bank, but he was afraid.  dirty money.  he didn’t know how to launder it.  bjork followed his gaze.  he released darius, who collapsed to the floor, gasping.  bjork drew out his ancient, notched sword and cleaved the suitcase in two.  darius’ eyes widened at the blade.  that was his suitcase, split in half like a slice of sushi.  hundred dollar bills fluttered out.  a split tube of toothpaste oozed blue gel.  several shirtsleeves flopped to the ground.  darius collapsed to the ground.  this was real.  his suitcase was real.  bjork was real.  tears formed in darius’ eyes.  he didn’t want to die.  bjork snatched a handful of hundred dollar bills.  “what’s this?” he asked darius.  “th-that’s money,” darius said, “you can have it. you can have all of it.  don’t hurt me,”  “this isn’t money,” bjork snarled, “this is paper.  where’s your gold?”  “g-gold?” darius said, “i don’t have any gold.”  bjork point his notched sword at darius.  “don’t lie to me,” he growled.  “wait,” darius said, “you can buy gold.  you can use that paper money to buy gold.”  bjork ran the paper bills through his hand.  he tugged at the two ends of a bill.  it tore in half.  “no,” bjork growled, shaking his head.  “you’re trying to trick me.”  he placed the point of his sword on darius’ jugular vein.  he growled, “bjork doesn’t like to be tricked.”  he pressed forward, drawing a drip of blood from darius’ neck.  darius screamed.  “no deal,” bjork said, spitting at the pile of money on the ground.  “no book,” he growled.  he flicked his wrist, severing darius’ jugular.  darius sat there in shock, watching his lifeblood pour down his chest.  lightning flashed.  the woman in white was next to the windowpane, looking inside with an expression of horror on her face.  darius gaped at her, helplessly.  xxxx  the next morning, ebenezer cooked an elaborate breakfast for darius.  sausages, steak, hash browns, and a mushroom omelet with extra red pepper.  he knocked on darius’ door.  no answer.  three hundred dollars.  he’d given that so-called ‘writer’ three hundred dollars and the bum couldn’t even be bothered to wake up before ten.  “darius,” he called, “darius, i’ve brought you breakfast.”  nothing.   he raised his hand to knock on the door again.  but before his fist struck wood, the door creaked open of its own accord.  across the room, underneath the window, darius’ corpse lay crumpled in a bloody heap.  ebenezer dropped the breakfast tray to the floor.  there was a pile of money in the middle of the room.  ebenezer shouted at darius, but the man didn’t stir.  ebenezer ran into the room and knelt down next to the body.  dead.  his throat had been slit.  suicide?  surely if there had been an intruder, ebenezer would have heard.  although there had been a storm, the hotel was very small, very secluded.  who would wander all the way out here?  ebenezer’s gaze turned to look at the pile of money.  whoa.  that was a lot of money.  that could help with the renovations.  no, ebenezer told himself, who would think of something like that at a time like this?  and then he saw his family heirloom.  the notched sword.  it lay on the bed, covered in dried brown blood.  someone had used it to split a suitcase in half.  and to kill darius.  this hadn’t been a suicide at all.  the sword was too far away from darius’ hands.  someone had killed him.  someone had stolen the sword from behind the front desk and killed darius.  but ebenezer had been sleeping on his cot in the front office.  all night.  the murderer must have seen him.  he shivered.  but he had been spared.  for some reason, the murderer had killed darius, but not him.  he didn’t understand it.  and the police… the police wouldn’t understand it either.  this was bad.  very bad.  how had the killer entered the hotel without waking him?  he didn’t know.  he didn’t believe it was possible.  and the police wouldn’t either.  he made a grim decision.  he gathered up all of the blood-stained rugs and blankets.  they went into the furnace.  he wrapped darius’ corpse in a sheet and dragged him out into the woods.  six feet deep.  his back hurt from all of the digging.  it took him all day.  that night, he counted the money.  eleven thousand, four hundred and twenty-three dollars.  not enough for all of the renovations he needed, but it was a start.  it was a start.  what a horrible day.  what an awful, terrible day.  he couldn’t bring himself to scrub the bloodstains off his family’s sword.  his emotions had been frayed too thin.  he locked the sword in the safe.  why had the killer passed over him?  what if the killer came back?  he reached for his semiautomatic pistol.  that morning, he’d taken it out of the drawer and started wearing it in his holster.  he would be ready.  he had protection.  that sword-wielding maniac didn’t stand a chance against a barrage of bullets.  now it was time to de-stress.  he took a deep breath.  he sat down at the front desk and booted up his laptop.  this was his favorite way to relax.  writing.  fan fiction about jason bourne.  people on the internet said that his novels were very good.  if he changed the names of the characters, he could probably sell his books.  make a little more money for the renovations.  he patted his semiautomatic pistol again.  everything was going to be okay.",1,-1,

677760,"for context, i'm around nc20 and fairly neutral, with ashy dark brown hair and hazel eyes.  **what colors look best on you in clothing terms? please be detailed about shades, brightness vs mutedness etc.**  deep, saturated jewel tones: deep red and burgundy, eggplant purple, deep magenta, hunter green and forest green, deep teal, navy blue. olive green is about the lightest i can go without looking washed out. (i have a pinterest board of my clothing color palette [here](https://www.pinterest.com/albahr/color-palette/) if that helps.)  **what colors look worst on you in clothing terms?**  any sort of light color, whether it's khaki, light yellow, cream, white, whatever, washes me out. dusty colors are sort of meh - not really flattering, but not ghastly either. bright colors look garish and overshadow my actual face. i feel like i can use makeup to kind of counteract the washed-out effect of light colors, but bright colors are so overwhelming, i think those are the worst on me. i've also never found a yellow i actually liked on myself - butter yellow, mustard yellow, lemon yellow - i always feel like they make me look kind of ill. neon yellows, especially the kind that lean into the lime-y/chartreuse range, are positively vile on me, maybe the worst ever.  **if you're on the paler end of things, is it possible for you to wear white without looking like a zombie?**  i'm not really pale, but white doesn't work for me.  **do 'berry' tones work for you re: blush/lipstick?**  yes! i love them, especially reddish berries. my favorite lipstick is bite plum (sadly limited edition, but jordana's lip liner in plush plum matches it pretty well) - a deep berry red. i have side-by-side swatches of them [here](http://imgur.com/yeyi9jj).  **name a makeup product(s) that just 'work' with your colouring.**  aside from bite plum, nars cruella, a deep cool-toned red. those are both pretty bold colors, so as far as others go, revlon adore, a very muted rusty red, looks very natural on me. (swatches of cruella and adore [here](http://imgur.com/gfx3md6).)  **describe the process of tanning for you. can you tan? do you burn first? how many of you look good with a light facial sunburn? do you look better with a tan?**  i tan pretty easily. i've only gotten sunburned maybe three times in my adult life (i can't remember getting sunburned as a kid, but i don't have the best memory), all times when i was outside in really sunny weather with no sunscreen for an extended period of time. :( i don't think my face has ever been sunburned. i do think i look better with a tan - in photos of myself from when i was a kid/teenager with maybe nc30/35 skin, i did have a ""healthier"" look about me. but oh well.  **jewelry - gold or silver?**  i don't think it really makes a huge difference for me, because i only wear tiny, barely-there jewelry. i do stick to gold jewelry just because i dislike how cold silver looks, but that's not a skintone flattery thing, just a personal preference.  **does nars orgasm blush work for you?**  once a sephora employee put it on me, and i just could not deal with the giant glitter chunks. :\ however, it was so long ago i can't really remember how i liked the color itself.",1,-1,

"" ""the knights templar were warriors,"" teabing reminded, the sound of his aluminum crutches echoing in this reverberant space"".  “remind” is a transitive verb – you need to remind someone of something. you can’t just remind. and if the crutches echo, we know the space is reverberant.  * 18.the da vinci code, chapter 4. ""he could taste the familiar tang of museum air - an arid, deionized essence that carried a faint hint of carbon - the product of industrial, coal-filter dehumidifiers that ran around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbon dioxide exhaled by visitors"".  ah, that familiar tang of deionised essence.  * 17.deception point, chapter 8. ""overhanging her precarious body was a jaundiced face whose skin resembled a sheet of parchment paper punctured by two emotionless eyes"".  it’s not clear what brown thinks ‘precarious’ means here.  * 16.the da vinci code, chapter 4. ""a voice spoke, chillingly close. ""do not move."" on his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly. only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars. he was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. his irises were pink with dark red pupils"".  a silhouette with white hair and pink irises stood chillingly close but 15 feet away. what’s wrong with this picture?  * 15.the da vinci code, chapter 4. ""as a boy, langdon had fallen down an abandoned well shaft and almost died treading water in the narrow space for hours before being rescued. since then, he'd suffered a haunting phobia of enclosed spaces - elevators, subways, squash courts"".  other enclosed spaces include toilet cubicles, phone boxes and dog kennels.  * 14.angels and demons, chapter one hundred. ""bernini's fountain of the four rivers glorified the four major rivers of the old world - the nile, ganges, danube, and rio plata"".  the rio de la plata. between argentina and uruguay. one of the major rivers of the old world. apparently.  * the da vinci code, chapter 5.

""captain bezu fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his chin tucked hard into his chest. his dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like widow's peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. as he advanced, his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth before him, radiating a fiery clarity that forecast his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters"".  do angry oxen throw their shoulders back and tuck their chins into their chest? what precisely is a fiery clarity and how does it forecast anything? once again, it is not clear whether brown knows what ‘forecast’ means.  * 10.the da vinci code, chapter four.  ""five months ago, the kaleidoscope of power had been shaken, and aringarosa was still reeling from the blow""  did they hit him with the kaleidoscope?  * 9.the da vinci code, chapter thirty-two. ""the vehicle was easily the smallest car langdon had ever seen. ""smartcar,"" she said. ""a hundred kilometers to the liter.""  pro tip: when fleeing from the police, take a moment to boast about your getaway vehicle’s fuel efficiency. and get it wrong by a factor of five. smartcars do about 20km (12 miles) to the litre.  * 8.the da vinci code, chapter three.

 ---when people dont watch where they are fucking going! then they plow into me and say ""oops, sorry."" or ""watch it!"" nnnyaaaa!!! next time that happens i will rip out 2 of your damn ribs and shove em into your fuckin eye balls!!!  you know what i love!!?  ---when some rich ass stuck up piece of shit white trash person gets in a car wreck with their brand new car! you know what i love!!?  ---when some stupid ass kid blows his fucking hand off because he couldnt figure out that a lit fuse means that the firecracker is going to go off soon!! hahaha!dumbass!!  you know what i hate!!?

 ---natural selection!!!!! god damn its the best thing that ever happened to the earth. getting rid of all the stupid and weak orginisms........but its all natural! yes!i wish the government would just take off every warning label. so then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or die! and boom, no more dumbasses. heh.  you know what i hate!!?

and thats just one person!! another big example is brooks brown(# removed for privacy's sake). now, according to him, he has a 215 iq, 5 other homes (2 in alaska, and 3 in florida), 95mph fast ball(he is only 16), runs a mile in about 5 minutes, has an uncle thats the former head of all the armed forces and has access to.....theee button..., his other uncle is a multi-millionare that lives in downtown detroit, and his neighbors are the chick that sang ""r.e.s.p.e.c.t."" and the lead singer of aerosmith. and that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. and his grandparents give..give...him about 1000 dollars for each month, and his other grandpa can blow up every house in america because all the houses have c-4 in the foundations. again, according to brook brown. ok, when people lie like that, its not impressive, noone believes it, it sounds just plain stupid, and its a fuckin waste of my time.  you know what i hate!!?

632546,"here you go, [from boeing](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/777family/compute/compute4.html): &gt;central to the digital design approach was the catia system. catia was developed by dassault systemes of france and marketed by ibm in the united states. from the beginning of the 777 program, the three key participants in the system -- boeing, dassault systemes and ibm -- developed a ""working together"" agreement signed by their respective chief executive officers.  the very great sophistication of the cad/cam system, which as used to design, model and test the whole plane before any metal was cut is the main thing that makes the 777 programme special. and clearly that was an *international* achievement.  what's interesting about this, i'd suggest, is that it's an example of the  near nonsense of phrases like: ${country}, after all, is capable of ${great_achievment}  the world just doesn't work that way any more--and this is relatively recent. this here internet is pretty solidly an achievent of the united states, for example, and i thank them for it; but such great endeavours are increasingly out of the reach of individual nations. even of ones as prosperous and well-educated as the us. and the greater the achievement the more international it tends to be.  even if we consider the rather limited domain of, say, rollercoaster engineering we find that the best coasters are *built in* the us, but to swiss designs, and often from parts fabricated in third countries.   it's this sort of collaboration that makes all our lives (in the reddit-editing parts of the world) so much more physically comfortable etc. than those of our ancestors. this can be embraced, or we keep plugging on with outdated ideas about national genius and--well, end up all doing the equivalent of driving gm cars.",0,,
216502,"it all started when tom went home for christmas. he'd not been back to his hometown for quite a while - years in fact - as all of his school friends had moved away, and he wasn't particularly close to his parents.  he wasn't looking forward to the trip. interminable evenings, sat in a replete daze by the fire, listening to monotonic voices debate over issues he didn't care about on the radio. much different from his usual lifestyle, the one he'd been enjoying back on the west coast... drugs, girls, music, art, technology: everything he loved was right there in la, but the most fun to be had here in his parents' small town was a trip to the mall and a visit to grandma in a old people's home that smelt like piss.  or so he thought.  on boxing day, after a great lunch of gammon, pumpkin, potatoes and leftover sprouts, tom was sat in his normal spot in the lounge, browsing /b/ and checking reddit. through the big, bay windows at the front of the house he could see a couple of people approaching from up the street, but instead of passing by like everyone else, these two instead turned into his garden path and walked purposefully up to the front door.  as the doorbell went, and tom's dad went to answer, tom assumed the visitors would just be another pair of their rattley old friends, come round to drone on incessantly about what they had for dinner, the weather and their various medical problems.  however, as tom sat there with his laptop, in walked in his dad, followed by a teenage girl with flushed red lips and cheeks from the biting cold outside.  at first, he didn't recognise her, but everything clicked into place as his mom said ""hello elizabeth!"". she was the rich girl from the large, imposing house up on top of the hill. he recognized her because tom's mom had tutored her in english back when tom was at high school, but things had changed since then. things had really changed.  she had been a small, intense-looking dark-haired girl 7 years ago, with no hint that she would turn into the stunning teenager he saw in front of him now. despite the layers of clothing she was wearing to keep out the cold, tom could see a ripening, firm body pressing out from under the fabric, slim and yet shapely hips and buttocks wrapped tightly in her low-cut fashionable jeans. he tried to say a polite greeting to elizabeth, but stumbled over his words and eventually gave up, trailing off in mid sentence.  her skin was lightly tanned and perfect, with none of the teenage blemishes tom had once had. her hair was still its natural brown color, but streaked with golden strands from all the time she's spent in the sun and the sea - not the garish, clashing artificial highlights tom hated so much. the expensive school her wealthy parents had sent her to was obviously working, as she had an immaculate smile, perfect posture and a silent grace, all of which was the perfect frame for the deep, dark pools of her eyes. slow, languorous, and yet when they met tom's gaze he felt a grip in his chest which almost matched the tightness in his jeans.  she was only fifteen. ten years younger than tom. he had been having a great time with girls (and women) of all ages in la, and yet now he couldn't help but wonder what he'd been missing by not hooking up with teenagers. as soon as he thought it, his conscience reacted; ""she's a child"", he thought. this was quickly followed by the more pragmatic objection ""i could be arrested if i fucked her..."".  elizabeth slowly made her way to the couch and made well-practiced smalltalk with tom's parents. he could tell that his transformation from a spotty, gangly teenage boy into the tall, confident man sat across the room from her had quite an effect on elizabeth too. whenever there was a pause in conversation, her eyes would flit over to his side of the room, run up and down his body and finally lock onto his eyes, like a starving man would look at food.  as she arched her back to peel off her outer jacked, jutting her small, perky breasts forwards, nipples pushing at the thin fabric of her long-sleeved top, she pointedly caught his eye and smiled slightly. it was at this moment that all of tom's will evaporated away, and he knew he had to have this girl. and that she wanted him.  after only a few minutes it started to get dark, and elizabeth rose to leave. fearing his opportunity was walking out of the door, tom scrambled for any reason to see elizabeth again. luckily, she was way ahead of him, and suggested that she come back round the following day so that tom could help her with her physics homework. the prospect of helping a jaw-dropping hot schoolgirl with her homework, and maybe more, set tom off in a frenzy of forbidden fantasy, but he managed to calmly accept and set a time in the afternoon.  that night, tom was aching to masturbate, but resisted the powerful urges running through his body, as he knew that he would need all his stamina and more tomorrow...  tom awoke early, only to find himself waiting for an impossible length of time before elizabeth would visit. a length of time that dragged on so much that it seemed only to get longer, with the prize waiting at the end getting further and further away. he distracted himself with whatever he could: a trip to the shops, a jaded family film on tv, but nothing made the wait any more bearable.",1,0,0

959242,"decorators are, to me at least, most useful when i have a particular ""thing"" i want to do to a lot of functions or methods; the decorator provides a way to abstract that thing out into one definition, and apply it in many places. this keeps my code cleaner and more maintainable, because it keeps each piece of logic in one place, making changes far simpler and easier (if i decide i don't want to modify a particular function/method, i can just drop the decorator line above it; if i want the decorator to behave differently, i just change its code and every decorated function updates automatically).  real-world examples: django (the web framework i use both at work and play) makes heavy use of this for a variety of patterns; view functions which respond to http requests can be modified with a number of built-in decorators, such as `login_required` (redirects to a login form if the user making the request isn't authenticated), `cache_page` (caches the response of the view for a set amount of time), etc.",0,,
952529,"reminds me of a short story by mark twain:  **the war prayer**  by mark twain  it was a time of great exulting and excitement. the country was up in arms, the war was on, in every breast burned the holy fire of patriotism; the drums were beating, the bands playing, the toy pistols popping, the bunched firecrackers hissing and sputtering; on every hand and far down the receding and fading spread of roofs and balconies a fluttering wilderness of flags flashed in the sun; daily the young volunteers marched down the wide avenue gay and fine in their new uniforms, the proud fathers and mothers and sisters and sweethearts cheering them with voices choked with happy emotion as they swung by; nightly the packed mass meetings listened, panting, to patriot oratory which stirred the deepest depths of their hearts, and which they interrupted at briefest intervals with cyclones of applause, the tears running down their cheeks the while; in the churches the pastors preached devotion to flag and country, and invoked the god of battles, beseeching his aid in our good cause in outpourings of fervid eloquence which moved every listener. it was indeed a glad and gracious time, and the half dozen rash spirits that ventured to disapprove of the war and cast doubt upon its righteousness straight way got such a stern and angry warning that for their personal safety's sake they quickly shrank out of sight and offended no more in that way.  sunday morning came – next day the battalions would leave for the front; the church was filled; the volunteers were there, their young faces alight with martial dreams – visions of the stern advance, the gathering momentum, the rushing charge, the flashing sabers, the flight of the foe, the tumult, the enveloping smoke, the fierce pursuit, the surrender! – then home from the war, bronzed heroes, welcomed, adored, submerged in golden seas of glory! with the volunteers sat their dear ones, proud, happy, and envied by the neighbors and friends who had no sons and brothers to send forth to the field of honor, there to win for the flag, or failing, die the noblest of noble deaths. the service proceeded; a war chapter from the old testament was read; the first prayer was said; it was followed by an organ burst that shook the building, and with one impulse the house rose, with glowing eyes and beating hearts, and poured out that tremendous invocation:  ""god the all-terrible! thou who ordainest, thunder thy clarion and lightning thy sword!""  then came the ""long"" prayer. none could remember the like of it for passionate pleading and moving and beautiful language. the burden of its supplication was, that an ever-merciful and benignant father of us all would watch over our noble young soldiers, and aid, comfort, and encourage them in their patriotic work; bless them, shield them in the day of battle and the hour of peril, bear them in his mighty hand, make them strong and confident, invincible in the bloody onset; help them to crush the foe, grant to them and to their flag and country imperishable honor and glory – an aged stranger entered and moved with slow and noiseless step up the main aisle, his eyes fixed upon the minister, his long body clothed in a robe that reached to his feet, his head bare, his white hair descending in a frothy cataract to his shoulders, his seamy face unnaturally pale, pale even to ghastliness. with all eyes following and wondering, he made his silent way; without pausing, he ascended to the preacher's side and stood there, waiting. with shut lids the preacher, unconscious of his presence, continued his moving prayer, and at last finished it with the words, uttered in fervent appeal, ""bless our arms, grant us victory, o lord our god, father and protector of our land and flag!""  the stranger touched his arm, motioned him to step aside – which the startled minister did – and took his place. during some moments he surveyed the spellbound audience with solemn eyes, in which burned an uncanny light; then in a deep voice he said:  ""i come from the throne – bearing a message from almighty god!"" the words smote the house with a shock; if the stranger perceived it he gave no attention. ""he has heard the prayer of his servant your shepherd, and will grant it if such be your desire after i, his messenger, shall have explained to you its import – that is to say, its full import. for it is like unto many of the prayers of men, in that it asks for more than he who utters it is aware of – except he pause and think.  ""god's servant and yours has prayed his prayer. has he paused and taken thought? is it one prayer? no, it is two – one uttered, the other not. both have reached the ear of him who heareth all supplications, the spoken and the unspoken. ponder this – keep it in mind. if you would beseech a blessing upon yourself, beware! lest without intent you invoke a curse upon a neighbor at the same time. if you pray for the blessing of rain upon your crop which needs it, by that act you are possibly praying for a curse upon some neighbor's crop which may not need rain and can be injured by it.  ""you have heard your servant's prayer – the uttered part of it. i am commissioned of god to put into words the other part of it – that part which the pastor – and also you in your hearts – fervently prayed silently. and ignorantly and unthinkingly? god grant that it was so! you heard these words: 'grant us victory, o lord our god!' that is sufficient. the whole of the uttered prayer is compact into those pregnant words. elaborations were not necessary. when you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results which follow victory – must follow it, cannot help but follow it. upon the listening spirit of god the father fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. he commandeth me to put it into words. listen!  ""o lord our father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle – be thou near them! with them – in spirit – we also go forth from the sweet peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. o lord our god, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with hurricanes of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring thee for the refuge of the grave and denied it – for our sakes who adore thee, lord, blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their way with tears, stain the white snow with the blood of their wounded feet! we ask it, in the spirit of love, of him who is the source of love, and who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and seek his aid with humble and contrite hearts. amen.""

505813,"very good question.  my fave creepy story is supposed to be true but who really knows.  you can find the story on creepypasta - its all about the black eyed kids.  very creepy.  this is one of the only things that really creeo me out. errr hopefully i am not violating any copyright laws here....it was origionaly written by a guy name brian bethel  the black eyed kids  my internet service provider used to have offices in a shopping center before they moved to their (comparatively) lush accommodations elsewhere. there was a drop box at that original location. the monthly bill was due, and thus, there but for the grace of the net i went.  it was about 9:30 p.m. when i left. from my relatively isolated apartments, it’s about 10-15 minutes or so to downtown (abilene has a population of about 110,000).  right next to camalott communications’ old location is a $1.50 movie theater. at the time, the place was featuring that masterwork of modern film, mortal kombat. i drove by the theater on the way into the center proper and pulled into an empty parking space.  using the glow of the marquee to write out my check, i was startled to hear a knock on the driver’s-side window of my car.  i looked over and saw two children staring at me from street. i need to describe them, with the one feature (you can guess what it was) that i didn’t realize until about half-way through the conversation cleverly omitted.  both appeared to be in that semi-mystical stage of life children get into where you can’t exactly tell their age. both were boys, and my initial impression is that they were somewhere between 10-14.  boy no. 1 was the spokesman. boy no. 2 didn’t speak during the entire conversation — at least not in words.  boy no. 1 was slightly taller than his companion, wearing a pull-over, hooded shirt with a sort of gray checked pattern and jeans. i couldn’t see his shoes. his skin was olive-colored and had curly, medium-length brown hair. he exuded an air of quiet confidence.  boy no. 2 had pale skin with a trace of freckles. his primary characteristic seemed to be looking around nervously. he was dressed in a similar manner to his companion, but his pull-over was a light green color. his hair was a sort of pale orange.  they didn’t appear to be related, at least directly.  “oh, great,” i thought. “they’re gonna hit me up for money.” and then the air changed.    i’ve explained this before, but for the benefit of any new lurkers out there, right before i experience something strange, there’s a change in perception that comes about which i describe in the above manner. it’s basically enough time to know it’s too late.  so, there i was, filling out a check in my car (which was still running) and in a sudden panic over the appearance of two little boys. i was confused, but an overwhelming sense of fear and unearthliness rushed in nonetheless.  the spokesman smiled, and the sight for some inexplicable reason chilled my blood. i could feel fight-or-flight responses kicking in. something, i knew instinctually, was not right, but i didn’t know what it could possibly be.  i rolled down the window very, very slightly and asked “yes?”  the spokesman smiled again, broader this time. his teeth were very, very white.  “hey, mister, what’s up? we have a problem,” he said. his voice was that of a young man, but his diction, quiet calm and … something i still couldn’t put my finger on … made my desire to flee even greater. “you see, my friend and i want to see the films, but we forgot our money,” he continued. “we need to go to our house to get it. want to help us out?”  okay. journalists are required to talk to lots of people, and that includes children. i’ve seen and spoken to lots of them. here’s how that usually goes:  “uh … m … m … mister? can i see that camera? i … i won’t break it or anything. i promise. my dad has a camera, and he lets me hold it sometimes, i guess, and i took a picture of my dog — it wasn’s very good, ’cause i got my finger in the way and …”  add in some feet shuffling and/or body swaying and you’ve got a typical kid talking to a stranger.  in short, they’re usually apologetic. people generally teach children that when they talk to adults, they’re usually bothering them for one reason or another and they should at least be polite.  this kid was in no way fitting the mold. his command of language was incredible and he showed no signs of fear. he spoke as if my help was a foregone conclusion. when he grinned, it was as if he was trying to say, “i know something … and you’re not gonna like it. but the only way you’re going to find out what it is will be to do what i say …”  “uh, well …” was the best reply i could offer.  now here’s where it starts to get strange.  the quiet companion looked at the spokesman with a mixture of confusion and guilt on his face. he seemed in some ways shocked, not with his friend’s brusque manner but that i didn’t just immediately open the door.  he eyed me nervously.  the spokesman seemed a bit perturbed, too. i still was registering something wrong with both.  “c’mon, mister,” the spokesman said again, smooth as silk. car salesmen could learn something from this kid. “now, we just want to go to our house. and we’re just two little boys.”  that really scared me. something in the tone and diction again sent off alarm bells. my mind was frantically trying to process what it was perceiving about the two figures that was “wrong.”  “eh. um ….” was all i could manage. i felt myself digging my fingernails into the steering wheel.  “what movie were you going to see?” i asked finally.  “mortal kombat, of course,” the spokesman said. the silent one nodded in affirmation, standing a few paces behind.  “oh,” i said. i stole a quick glance at the marquee and at the clock in my car. mortal kombat had been playing for an hour, the last showing of the evening.  the silent one looked increasingly nervous. i think he saw my glances and suspected that i might be detecting something was not above-board.  “c’mon, mister. let us in. we can’t get in your car until you do, you know,” the spokesman said soothingly. “just let us in, and we’ll be gone before you know it. we’ll go to our mother’s house.”  we locked eyes.  to my horror, i realized my hand had strayed toward the door lock (which was engaged) and was in the process of opening it. i pulled it away, probably a bit too violently. but it did force me to look away from the children.  i turned back. “er … um …,” i offered weakly and then my mind snapped into sharp focus.  for the first time, i noticed their eyes.  they were coal black. no pupil. no iris. just two staring orbs reflecting the red and white light of the marquee.  at that point, i know my expression betrayed me. the silent one had a look of horror on his face in a combination that seemed to indicate: a) the impossible had just happened and b) “we’ve been found out!”  the spokesman, on the other hand, wore a mask of anger. his eyes glittered brightly in the half-light.  “cmon, mister,” he said. “we won’t hurt you. you have to let us in. we don’t have a gun …”  that last statement scared the living hell out of me, because at that point by his tone he was plainly saying, “we don’t need a gun.”  he noticed my hand shooting down toward the gear shift. the spokesman’s final words contained an anger that was complete and whole, and yet contained in some respects a tone of panic:  “we can’t come in unless you tell us it’s okay. let … us …. in!”  i ripped the car into reverse (thank goodness no one was coming up behind me) and tore out of the parking lot. i noticed the boys in my peripheral vision, and i stole a quick glance back.  they were gone. the sidewalk by the theater was deserted.  i drove home in a heightened state of panic. had anyone attempted to stop me, i would have run on through and faced the consequences later.  i bolted into my house, scanning all around — including the sky.  what did i see? maybe nothing more than some kids looking for a ride.  and some really funky contacts. yeah, right.",1,0,0

819094,"my own answers:  1. what colors look best on you in clothing terms? please be detailed about shades, brightness vs mutedness etc.  navy blue (dark navy) with red a close second. the red can't be in any way orange-y, but it can't be *too* blue, either. a neutral red leaning slightly blue, i'd day. other colours i can wear include khaki (leaning more green/less brown), charcoal grey, forest green. my skin never looks better than it does when i wear navy.   2. what colors look worst on you in clothing terms?  yellow, any tone, any brightness. white. orange. coral. black (just makes me look washed out/dull). my wardrobe is almost entirely free of black and white. pastels (oh god, oh god). when tanned, i can sometimes get away with some of these colours, but not easily.  3. if you're on the paler end of things, is it possible for you to wear white without looking like a zombie?  hell no.  4. do 'berry' tones work for you re: blush/lipstick?  no with a small caveat. deep purple-y/burgundy generally looked hellishly goth and washes me out but every now and again i come across one that works for some reason. clinique black honey, which used to be the 'universally flattering lippie' doesn't work for me at all.   5. name a makeup product(s) that just 'work' with your colouring.  couple of weird/counter-intuitive ones here. nars used to make a colour wash blush in a shade called 'modesty' - https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/i/51rx7nj8rel._sy355_.jpg - i still have no idea how this looked so perfect on me but it did. most 'natural flush' blush i have ever tried. unfortunately it was an utter bitch to apply and is long discontinued. also, mac humid e/s. it's green with golden highlights (golden is generally something i need to stay away from) and it looks freaking fabulous on me. ysl rouge volupte sheer candy in 'cool guava' is one of the best lipcolours i've ever tried. i don't really like a heavy, lipstick-y look and this is sheer and more a gloss than a lipstick. oddly, it doesn't pull purple on me at all, it's very 'my lips but better.'  6. describe the process of tanning for you. can you tan? do you burn first? how many of you look good with a light facial sunburn? do you look better with a tan?  yes, i can tan. i go lobster first (i can go slowly and build it up without ever going lobster, and i don't really tan in the sun at all these days, but a few childhood/adolescent burns taught me some painful lessons) and then i go brown. i can get quite dark over the course of a summer, if i let myself. a slight sunburn actually looks awesome on me, i am forever trying to recreate the look of mildly sunburned cheeks (i realize this sounds weird!) and as for a tan, i just flat out look better with one. i'm one of those people who, without make-up, is always getting asked if i have a cold/am sick/am tired. not tired, just naturally sort of greenish greyish yellowish, sorry. i think a tan improves how i look more than any makeup product, and friends/family are full of compliments when i'm tanned.  7. jewelry - gold or silver?  gold doesn't really work, silver is fine - not awful, not wonderful. rose gold works best, i should have included that as an option.  8. does nars orgasm blush work for you?  nooooo. dead clown city. i'm not sure i've ever had one of those 'universally flattering' products ever work on me. orgasm is hilariously bad.  edit: so reddit changed all the numbers to one. eh.",1,-1,1

333851,"not a stupid question at all!          thinning, drybrush, and washes:          when applying your paints, you always want to be sure water is involved and paint is thinned. i use a wet palette for the added moisture, but also keep a cup of water nearby. you can check out acrylic wet palettes with a quick google search; essentially it's a container with a sponge, saturated with water, and a sheet of acrylic paper on top that stays wet. as you work more with thinning, you'll pick up on its technique.          __drybrushing__ is a technique to apply very little paint on the most exterior/distal of surfaces; take the white drybrush i did over the black primer for example. i saturated a flat brush (&lt;works best with this technique) with pure white paint, then pressed it into a papertowel on each side of the brush. most of the paint is applied to the papertowel, and you're left with a mostly dry brush with some paint still in it. i always test it on the palm of my hand with a few brush-strokes to ensure i'm applying light streaks of the white. then you just lightly and repeatedly brush over the desired areas of your mini until the amount of paint you want is applied.          applying a __wash technique__ is like painting with water that happens to have some paint in it, and it's kind of like the opposite of drybrushing. you take the color you want to wash with, in this case i used pure black, and you keep adding water on your palette until the paint is super-thinned. when you apply the wash, exterior surfaces just get wet and an irrelevant amount of paint is applied; instead, the paint goes where you want it, into the cracks and crevices of the mini.               here's the __color breakdown__. i used master series paints mostly and paint with 3 tones (main color, shadowed version, highlighted version):          colors - pure black, pure white, templar blue, blood red, earth brown, yriel yellow(&lt;citadel paint), tanned skin shadow, tanned skin hightlight, muddy olive, pale olive, auburn shadow, tarnished steel, and antique gold.          dat beard - _templar blue_ and _blood red_ to create a deeper purple for shadowing. you're going to see that deeper purple for most of my shadowing. blood red mixed with _yriel yellow_ to create the red-orange for the main color of the beard. a mix with more of the yriel yellow than blood red for the highlighting.          face - _tanned skin shadow_ and _tanned skin highight_ used here. thinning is crucial for the face. thinned_pure black_ for his eyes, heh.          green cloak - _muddy olive_ and _pale olive_ as the main colors, with the deep purple mixed-in for shadowing. _pure white_ mixed with either the muddy or pale olive for highlighting.          gloves, boots, satchel - _auburn shadow_, deep purple mixed for shadowing, and pure white mixed for highlighting. pure black was used in a wash to bring out the details of the satchel and his fingers.          quilted vest - _earth brown_, mixed with deep purple for shadows, mixed with pure white for highlights (you're seeing a trend here).          white undershirt - start with the shadow using pure white mostly and mixed with earth brown. more pure white mixed in moving distally and finally just pure white for the highlighting.          all metals - _tarnished steel_ and _antique gold_. thinning is crucial, but even then metal paints can be tough to work with imo. i've been mixing pure black for shadows, but thinking i should start using opposing colors (like with the deep purple and the previous colors). for highlighting i use pure white not mixed, and sometimes drybrushed. i'm still learning to use metals and haven't figured out the best techniques to get them right.          sorry that was long-winded but hopefully this helps understand the process. thank you!",1,,0

176143,"&gt;you don’t have to take my word for it. how about alan greenspan?  yes. let's ask the assclown who is at least partially responsible for causing the housing bubble that helped cripple this country's economy for advice.  that being said, greenspan's statement was accurate. it's just ironic that the author expects us to look at him as a credible source.  if by not having a debt crisis, you mean never having to worry about defaulting on debts with your own currency, then the author and greenspan are correct. however, if they mean that we won't ever face major consequences of it then they are delusional.  the second page of this article is dedicated to saying that we don't have to worry about inflation because we have the reserve currency. that is by no means a sure thing indefinitely. many people say that we won't lose the reserve currency because we are the strongest most powerful nation on earth (which ironically is largely due to the fact that we've had the reserve currency since 1944). they are basing their argument off of an antiquated idea that we can only have one nation's currency as the reserve. alternative ideas are being drafted for multiple reserve currencies or a single global currency that isn't tied to a single nation. if you look at the number of new treaties between different countries around the world you will see that the world is slowly moving away from the dollar reserve currency system. if that does happen we don't want to be stuck with massive amounts of debt.  &gt;and even if it did–well, for all the bad memories we have about it, the stagflation of the 1970s was many things, but it was not greece.   i lost even more respect for the author's point here. the economy is arguably much worse off now and the debt-to-gdp is much worse. combining the long-term structural problems we are dealing with and a need to print massive amounts of money to fix a possible debt problem and we would be in much worse shape than the 1970s.",0,,

340300,"i bought more than expected! these holiday ramp-ups are getting to me. reference info: i'm 33, with a fair neutral-leaning-yellow skintone, blue eyes and dark blonde hair. my skin is combo-oily, with persistent jawline congestion and breakouts.    **stuff i acquired (bought, gifts, etc)**  * **hada labo premium gokujyan lotion**: i bought this to replace the gel-cream version of the formula, which was nice but just a bit too heavy for me. so far i'm loving it. it's got a beautiful cushiony feel that makes my skin feel plump and soothed and happy.   * **lush bunny moon jelly mask**: lush always gets me with their weird, fun textures. this is easily the strangest mask i've tried. there's definitely a jelly element, since it bounces back when you touch it, but it's solid enough that it takes a minute to get it evenly spread around your face. i was happy with the results, though. my skin likes the main ingredients and definitely felt bouncy and plump when i washed the mask off.    * **tatcha luminous dewy skin mist**: i'm so glad i got one of the obento boxes before they sold out. it was a great value: $59 for a full size luminous dewy mist (normally 48), a full size lip balm (30), and ds sizes of the water cream and a vitamin c mask. so far i've only tried the mist, but i can't believe how nice it is. it adds dewiness that actually stays on my skin, unlike most of the other sprays i've tried that hydrate for a couple minutes and then disappear. plus, all the ingredients (especially squalane) are things i already know my skin loves, so it feels like i'm actually doing something nice for my face when i use it. i really didn't believe it could be this good, and i was dead wrong. will repurchase.    * **nyx dark circle corrector in light**:  i like this way more than i thought i would. it's replacing my emptied bobbi brown corrector. on first feel, it seems like it might be drying, especially since it has kaolin in it, but i actually get less dryness and separation than i did with the bobbi throughout the day. happy with it so far.   * **sephora collection 10-hour wear perfection foundation**: this is a solid medium coverage foundation that blends easily, doesn't look too heavy or masklike, and stands up well to oil. it's not as long-lasting as fenty or eldw, but it feels way lighter on the skin.    * **colourpop my little pony highlighter in trickles**: let's be real, i just wanted the case, but i've been impressed by the highlight! it's a cool lavender pink with an ultraviolet shift, and makes for a great, unexpected inner corner. it's sheerer and easier to blend than i expected. no regrets.    * **stila convertible color in gladiola**: i've been looking for a true orange blush for a while--not peachy, not reddish--and i finally found it. this is a bright creamy orange that makes my skin look like it's glowing, and has been pairing so well with all my warm reds and burnt orange lipsticks.    * **smashbox 24 hour eyeshadow primer**: i'm still testing this, but so far i'm really happy with it. it doesn't emphasize the fine lines on my eyelids, and it really grips onto shadows all day. i've only used it with powders so far, so not sure how it will perform with cream eyeshadows.    * **l'oreal lash paradise in black brown**: gives a nice, fluttery, not-too-obvious effect. i wanted a mascara that would look semi-natural but give plenty of volume, and this fits the bill. i don't get any flaking or smudging.    * **nyx pin up pout in sophisticated and rebel soul**: these are really nice creamy lipsticks from the drugstore. even better, they aren't scented. my biggest turnoff is heavy floral scents in lipsticks, and the drugstore brands tend to be major offenders. these are safe! this finish is somewhere between satin and matte, and they last way longer on the lips than i expected. sophisticated is a warm peachy nude, and rebel soul is a muted red-berry. both have that little cap on the end with a glossy version of the shade that you can use as a topper, and i've been wearing just the glossy side of sophisticated quite a bit lately.    * **mac velvetease pencil in oh honey**: i didn't realize this line had been discontinued when i bought it on hautelook, and i'm disappointed that i can't buy more. it's got the velvety finish of the nars matte pencils, but it feels more comfortable and doesn't slip around as much on my lips. oh honey is a nice peachy brown.    * **colourpop ultra glossy lip in contessa**: super pretty orange-gold shimmer. i've been using it as a topper for my fall warm-toned lipsticks, and it adds some sparkle without a lot of goopiness.    * **glossier balm dot com in birthday cake**: i resisted these for a while because i thought they were just fancy vaseline. but it's getting colder and drier, and a heavier balm with a great scent and some barely-there shimmer is a nice pick me up. no regrets.    * **lush naked lip tint in black rose**: a purely impulse purchase. i vaguely regret it because these color-changing balms aren't something i've liked in the past, but it's pretty and i'll definitely use it as a stain.    **stuff that's gone (destashed, used up, etc)**  * **hada labo skin plumping gel cream**: a great lightweight moisturizer that did improve the feel of my skin. but the texture was tackier and shinier than i like, so i've switched to the lotion version, which has similar active ingredients but absorbs better into my skin. emptied.    * **aveeno daily moisture lotion spf 15**: light, soothing, absorbs easily and offers light sun protection. i don't think it will be moisturizing enough for the fall/winter, so i finished this at the right time. emptied.   * **harry's shave cream**: this is a great and inexpensive shave cream. i like the unisex scent, and it makes my legs feel nice and soothed. that said, i tend to forget i have it, since my habit is just to use shower gel for shaving. emptied, probably won't repurchase.    * **mufe aqua eyes liner in 23l**: i wanted this as a brightening lower waterline liner, but no matter what i do, it will not go on! like, it just doesn't adhere to the waterline. on normal skin it's fine, but that's not what i bought it for, so i'm finally letting it go. destashed.    * **becca undereye brightening corrector**: this corrector has a lovely, creamy texture, but the color doesn't work for me. it's a very light pink, and on my skintone that looks artificial and slightly ghostly even under foundation. destashed.   * **milani make it last eyeshadow primer**: i would recommend this over any other drugstore primer. it's got a little bit of a tint that evens out your eyelid color, it stands up well to oil, and it does make shadows last through a full day. my one gripe is that it's very creamy and spreadable, so unless i'm careful i end up with primer in my eyebrows that is then hard to get off. i'm replacing with the smashbox version, which is clear and less creamy, and might solve the issue. emptied.   * **wet n wild photo focus eye primer**: i hated this. it felt like glue on my lids, and emphasized fine lines, and it's so grippy that it makes cream shadows really hard to blend. destashed.   * **julep it's whipped matte lip mousse in kiss me**: worst of all worlds: drying but doesn't stay that long, matte yet tacky, bold yet patchy. destashed.    **passed over**  * **nars man ray palettes**: i was so hyped for love game before i realized it was a u.k. exclusive. then i read some more reviews of glass tears and realized the formula was probably not going to be for me.   * **anastasia beverly hills prism palette**: this is hard. i love anastasia shadows, and i already have two palettes and a bunch of singles. but something's changed in the manufacturing, and they just aren't the same. i actually bought this, used it for a week, and decided to return it. the mattes are dustier, and several of the foiled/shimmer shades were hard to pick up on a brush, which isn't an issue i've ever had before. i'm planning to pick up a few singles from coloured raine/colourpop to match the colors i really wanted (throne, pyramid, eden). dimension will be the hardest to dupe, per temptalia, so if anyone has recs please let me know!",1,1,

786803,nah i wasn't stupid enough to do that but they found out anyway and i ended up homeless for a summer until my gf's mom got tired of wondering if her daughter was safe (because my gf wouldn't leave me by myself) and gave me a 170 bucks to get a room that i rented weekly for three years (with my own money. i got a shitty retail job.) currently my family is more used to it and we get along but i suspect things would be different if i was dating anyone. i haven't dated in two years because of health problems. now and then somebody in the family will make a snarky remark about my atheism and i usually resist making snarky remarks back. my being gay though is totally a taboo subject that is never talked about even though everybody knows.   um ... so that's my life story. enjoy.,0,,

670233,"americans do get less vacation time compared to, say, swedes.  they also produce 33% more on average than, say, swedes, and earn a corresponding 33% more, while the cost of living in sweden is about 20% higher than in the u.s. (although this is not entirely fair -- there are plenty of places in the u.s. that are expensive to live as sweden is.)  a few european countries do have per-capita gdps higher than the u.s. but they are exceptions.  working an extra week or two a year does not seem like that much, until you multiply it by a couple hundred million people and a couple hundred years.  many of us enjoy our jobs and have to be reminded to take vacation. those of us who value our leisure time take part-time jobs or short-term contract or seasonal employment. i met one guy at microsoft who works for a year, which is the longest contract you can get there, then goes scuba diving in a different country for 100 days, when he is eligible to return to microsoft on a new contract. then he does it all over again.   i suspect many more of us would do that sort of thing if we had state-run healthcare, fwiw -- that is a strong incentive to stay at work once we have families.",0,,

796840,"i don't disagree with all of buchanan's complaints, but this ""being overrun by mongrel hordes"" crap, i've had about enough of.  i'm a white guy who lives deep in the southwest, and 99.9% of people here are completely unaffected by illegal immigration.  they pontificate about the us being ""invaded"" and ""overrun"" and then hire the same people they complain about to do their landscaping and clean their pools.  they eat the foods these poor people pick in crucifying desert sun all day.  just as the ""drug problem"" in the us is primarily a result of the drug war - violence due to the artificially inflated prices of the market, so, too, are the problems of illegal immigration mainly secondary to the actual phenomenon of people sneaking in.  us citizens who live literally along the border (own land that abuts it) do not feel safe.  they have a legitimate complaint.  the way people cross, by cutting fences and the like, has to stop.  the littering of the desert because of human practice, which i've seen myself, has to stop.  the violence that goes with human trafficking has to stop as well.  all of these are a result of serious economic deficiencies and imbalances.  for all of the anti-government rhetoric of conservatives, the racists among them (i am not labeling all conservatives - even anti-illegal immigration ones, as racists - that's another canard), it is amazing how much they get their feathers ruffled when immigrants who want to eat break some laws and cross an artificial line.  who is more of a man?  who is more salt of the earth, and who would you rather live along side - men who let their families go hungry and have no future, and obey the laws of the almighty us government...or men who put their families first, take their destinies into their own hands, risk their lives crossing heat-choked deserts to work their asses off for less than minimum wage and often with no safety protections?  all for a better future for their families?  everyone's telling me what american values are every ten minutes, and man, i see a serious contradiction here.  were the situation reversed and a man would let his own family suffer because of an artificial line in the desert because he was willing to kneel before the dictates of a foreign government, wouldn't impress me.   these are all problems, but i've about had it with the demonization of these people.  listening to people wigged out about the border, you'd think these people sit around all day collecting welfare and watching soap operas just to piss whitey off.  sheesh.  you can trot out your goofy aztlan crowd to make your point, but don't whine when they trot out the kkk to represent *you*.  this *is* a problem, but it is a bureaucratic and administrative one.  it is an economic one.  it is not a lack of poor character and bad intent of the people who come here.  one thing about these people, unlike most of us who sit around in cubes moving bytes around while we sit all day on our fat asses, they do something that's supposed to be something we as americans value - hard, backbreaking work.  they remind me of my grandfather, who worked in a coal furnace, risking black lung and all sorts of other crap.  i've seen them in the middle of the day, on roofs, in 115 degrees, direct sunlight, their skins burnt to a crisp, nailing away.  on weekends.  on holidays.  before light.  after dark.  working.  constantly.  i've had it with this racist shit, and that's just what it is - racist shit.  the border is a security issue; we can't allow things to continue this way, but can we do it without, once again, demonizing immigrants the way we do constantly, without failure, throughout history?  can we get beyond this, please?  these people are changing america.  maybe more of us will learn spanish.  we'll have lots more literature at our disposal.  new words to import into our own language.  more, and better, mexican food (and anyone who complains about that is mentally ill).  like every immigrant group that came here, they'll enrich and build, and you'll see their names stamped on your bridges, and your children will date and marry theirs and america will continue to morph and transform, and i really have little in common with anyone who thinks that's a bad thing.",1,-1,

752594,"first, addressing the shoes: since we're talking about shoes and not clothes, you have a little more freedom in this area. since you can pair either color with dark blue/normal blue jeans, both would work imho. however, the black is more flexible with regard to colors (for instance, wearing white jeans with red wouldn't look too good, since the shoes would distract from the overall ensemble...). if you think you'll only pair these shoes with blue jeans i would say pick either, but the black is more flexible especially when considering multiple colors of shorts or khakis. of course, i am going off of your own description of yourself so i can't exactly make the greatest decision. again, going off from my own experience, when in doubt pick black. even though you are not using these shoes in a dressy manner, black goes with absolutely *everything*.  now, on to general appearance: okay, since you're really pale you've got a lot going for you in this department. and dirty blonde hair, i'm assuming means blonde with brownish-reddish undertones. going off of this, i'm going to make some suggestions. like i said, with black or classic, darker colors you can never go wrong. however since we're not in fall/winter you can probably postpone buying those kinds of clothes for a little bit. one caveat: some of the richer reds and browns look great with a lighter color, for instance pairing white shorts with a dark brown shirt. i think the brown would bring out the dirtier undertones in your hair and the white would really pop with your skin. i'm also going to say you might as well go for the ""royal"" colors like purple, dark blue, and emerald green while you're at it, just for some variety. i just call these the ""safe shades"" (especially for me) because it's very hard to go wrong when you pair a dark rich color with black.   since we're in summer, though, you might as well try out lighter colors. you really just have to work with what fits your body and your complexion. honestly the only colors i would say to stay away from are nasty burnt orange, canary yellow is kind of a gamble ... anything that seems to overpower the rest of your clothes is probably a no-no. darker goldenrod is okay, and cream is great when paired with black (wouldn't pair cream with white though... try to mix shades. like pair light/dark together so you can make the color shine through). i prefer black/dark shorts over white shorts because they get less dirty (noticeably) but it's really your preference. also, for some easy flair try cute striped tees (my suggestion here is buy striped tees only when one of the stripes is white or black and then another color... that way you don't get two clashing colors). a tank top with a cardigan always works great, and don't forget to check out some sundresses with sandals. floral patterns look cute but don't overdo it, for me i like more classic patterns (if you haven't noticed, i'm kind of anal retentive about style... but classic almost always works) like checkered, or again, stripes. buy some skirts too, but for summer i wouldn't suggest tight miniskirts unless you're absolutely sure your legs can pull it off (and that you're comfortable in them!). you could always buy peasant skirts. in summer you can pair brown with colors like pink/red instead of black as well.  okay, so i think i covered clothes for summer... onto shoes. sandals. buy sandals. buy sandals for walking around. comfortable sandals. as for tennis shoes, buy those too for jeans. (you've already got this covered i think.) if you want you can try the minidress + leggings + sandals pairing, but for some reason i hate leggings so i just go with the minidress. another thought if it gets a little chilly out is to try stockings with a minidress instead: this is a style that's called ""zettai ryouiki"" in japan. don't know if you're cool with that, but just a suggestion. also, another good idea is to get some cute kitten heels when you want to feel a little fancier.  and finally: accessories. (sorry for overloading you, but i figure if you really want advice... here's some! xd) for summer, maybe try some bangle bracelets, you can get them for cheap pretty much anywhere. try solid colors, again black is always a good idea, but any kind of color would look cute. some people like to buy rings, honestly they're not for me so i really don't have any advice here. i don't really like charm bracelets either, because they lack simplicity in their design. if you're going for a necklace i'd suggest the simpler the better, at least for summer. you really don't want to have to haul around sixty rocks on your neck anyway. sunglasses... i like ones with larger lenses but not so large it detracts from everything else. if you want you can even wear them on your head ... xd i guess. ummm, headbands, head scarves, go for it if it looks cute. aaaand earrings, i don't wear them anymore, but i'd say try studs and not hoops at least for now. they're more liable to get caught on things and sometimes they can be overly cumbersome (especially if they're big.) that's all i've got for now.  anyways, sorry for the wall of text. i hope this helped! ^^  edit: oh, and i really like modcloth for shopping online. it's got a lot of great styles to pick from, although it's a bit expensive sometimes.",1,1,

916726,"judging from historical texts and a variety of other sources, it seems likely that the general middle eastern area (including the arabian peninsula) and central asia were white, and that whites compromised significant populations in india (around 10 percent of the population around 500bce, in a similar situation to south africa where they were surrounded by hordes of niggers and mutts). for example, one of the last aryan migrations into india was the kushans around 300 ce, where 2 million kushans moved into india, which's population would have been around 30 million, although this would include the higher caste brahmin whom would have been somewhat white at this time.  for instance, as evidence for the aryans being white in india, in the rig veda (one of the few racist religious texts to have ever been written), the book speaks of extreme hatred for the nigger dravidians, and it encourages the aryans to slay them wherever they can. in fact, if i recall correctly, the aryan thunder god is referred to as having a long, flowing blond beard. r1a , slavic y-dna marker, is also very strongly prevalent in central asia and india, showing the legacy of the aryans. indeed, if you go to areas of central asia where the aryans inhabited, like to the pamiris, you will find many whites, even extremely nordic ones that are blonde and blue-eyed. http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/r1a_distribution_eurasia.jpg the white areas are the legacy of the turkic and mongol invasions that genocided many native whites in central asia and virtually cleansed the area of kazakhstan of all whites and weakened the other connecting areas into the heart of central asia. the mongols in the 1200s and 1300s killed 90 percent of central asia's original population.  unfortunately, the aryans in india, much like the arabs later on, took the women from lower castes and miscegenated with them, mostly producing brown babies (dark skin is dominant) that were accepted as high-caste and married with other white aryans and diluted the genepool. the aryans invaded around 3000bce, although there were other invasions by white caucasians prior. by around 500 bce, at the time of the buddha, he wrote about the hypocrisy of the higher castes who were taking lower-caste women and breeding with them. the buddha himself was described as having golden skin and blue eyes (though he was a real faggot, he abandoned his family to live with poor dravidian niggers, and in one text, it alleges that he even killed some brahmin hindus, whom most likely would have been white men at this time, who mocked him).  as for the middle east, the writings of the greeks are an invaluable source. xenophon is a really good source, if you can look him up (i don't have the time right now to dig through the text and find the specific passages), you can find his writings about the mossynoecians and the persians. the mossynoecians were described as a light-skinned people and frowned upon by the greeks because they were the most furthest from greek customs, and the persians were actually seen as inferior to the greeks because they had lighter skin than the greeks, whilst the greeks prided themselves on having a golden medium, not too dark and not too light.  furthermore, europe is half modern-day middle eastern genetically, from the farmer migrations that occurred 10000 bce - 3000 bce. here's a map and an article: http://cdn.eupedia.com/images/content/neolithic_farmer_admixture.png http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/09/european-genetics-reflect-three-ancestral-groups/ if the middle easterners were naturally brown, then surely the europeans, at rates of 50 percent middle eastern admixture, or even higher close to 90-100 percent for many southern europeans, should also have a large number of browns? but this is not the case, and because middle easterners and europeans are so genetically close,  (the distance between an englishman and a racially mixed iranian is 9 genetic units, whereas the distance between an englishman and a japanese is 59 genetic units apart), the brown-ness in the middle east is likely to stem from something else - niggers, the same group that did in india, and now seems intent on doing in europe. the admixture in the middle east would have resulted from the arab slave trade that came after the islamic conquests, where arab men took sheboon slave women and bred with them, and because of the arab custom that if the father was an arab then the child is an arab, these mulattoes were accepted as arabs and destroyed the middle eastern genepool over 1400 years. hence, this is the point where middle easterners started to become brown. you can see a gradient here, where egyptians are very niggerish looking and very few whites still exist amongst them, and they are on average 20 percent nigger, palestinians are 11 percent nigger and still have few whites, but the average palestinian is generally more lighter and looks more caucasian than the average egyptian, and syrians who are only 4 percent nigger on average (though some are completely pure) and they are the most caucasian looking, and they have the largest white minority.  the prophet muhammad, the man who is probably the most culpable to be blamed for what has happened to the middle east, was even described as having rosy-cheeks and pale skin, i believe this is from the qur'an. areas such as yemen were called ""arabia felix"" in ancient times, and were known to be areas of extreme abundance and riches, to the point where the romans mounted expeditions into. look at this native girl from yemen: https://40.media.tumblr.com/b9e513cb253fbe3749c961d3319ecb49/tumblr_mgwezv5r3f1rboj6jo1_500.jpg  you'd think it would have been taken in europe, but no, it's yemen. truly amazing.  clearly, there are still some whites left in the middle east, many of them are the best of their society who hold positions of power like syrian president bashar al-assad and even isis caliph abu baghdadi, and there's also a very small handful of whites left in india. if we could establish control over those areas, there is still a viable population that could be salvaged to return those areas to their former glories. i estimate the middle east, afghanistan and central asia have around 50 million whites, whilst pakistan and india may have around 250,000-500,000 left (these are true whites, not dubious borderline white cases like the indian actress aishwarya rai bachchan. for reference, ashkenazim jews are descended from a core population of 300-600 people.  furthermore, those areas are the original homeland of the white race. the middle east is where the first cro-magnon europeans came from. it is the spring from where all caucasians have originated from, so i think it's decisive that the caucasian race takes its true ancestral fatherland back.",1,2,-2
985116,"i found this after reading this passage from nietzsche's *human all too human*:  &gt;426. the colour-blindness of thinkers. -- how differently from us the greeks must have viewed nature, since, as we cannot help admitting, they were quite colour-blind in regard to blue and green, believing the former to be a deeper brown, and the latter to be yellow. thus, for instance, they used the same word to describe the colour of dark hair, of the corn-flower, and the southern sea; and again they employed exactly the same expression for the colour of the greenest herbs, the human skin, honey, and yellow raisins: whence it follows that their greatest painters reproduced the world they lived in only in black, white, red, and yellow. how different and how much nearer to mankind, therefore, must nature have seemed to them, since in their eyes the tints of mankind predominated also in nature, and nature was, as it were, floating in the coloured ether of humanity! (blue and green more than anything else dehumanise nature). it is this defect which developed the playful facility that characterised the greeks of seeing the phenomena of nature as gods and demi-gods -- that is to say, as human forms.  &gt;let this, however, merely serve as a simile for another supposition. every thinker paints his world and the things that surround him in fewer colours than really exist, and he is blind to individual colours. this is something more than a mere deficiency. thanks to this nearer approach and simplification, he imagines he sees in things those harmonies of colours which possess a great charm, and may greatly enrich nature. perhaps, indeed, it was in this way that men first learnt to take delight in viewing existence, owing to its being first of all presented to them in one or two shades, and consequently harmonised. they practised these few shades, so to speak, before they could pass on to any more. and even now certain individuals endeavour to get rid of a partial colour-blindness that they may obtain a richer faculty of sight and discern ment, in the course of which they find that they not only discover new pleasures, but are also obliged to lose and give up some of their former ones.",1,0,0

510835,"my response to her:  interesting piece.  a few quibbles:  &gt;like the fact that mr. obama's church gave an award to the notorious anti-semite louis farrakhan  is louis farrakhan batshit crazy? no doubt. perhaps you haven’t heard of ze'ev jabotinsky? or rabbi meir kahane? or baruch goldstein? if these names don’t ring a bell, use the google. we jews have batshit crazy people too.   &gt;having been in a suicide bomging (sic) attack which killed people- many of them survivors and their children and grandchildren- at a passover seder in 2002, i'm a little less warm-hearted and forgiving    i’m sorry for your pain; but the talmud teaches us: *“the deeper the sorrow, the less tongue hath it.”*  may i suggest that you warm your heart, and learn to forgive? holding grudges is exhausting, close-minded, and a waste of time. we must forgive, and pray for those that have died and been harmed, as we pray for those who would seek to cause us harm. jewish law in fact requires us to be gracious in granting forgiveness. the source for this *halacha* is the mishna in baba kamma 8:7 which says, ""from where do we know that it is cruel to not forgive? for it says, ""abraham prayed to god and god healed abimelech..."" (b'reishis (genesis) 20:17).  and let us not forget: *you shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; i am the lord. - leviticus 19:18*.  &gt;if i had a rabbi, for example, who publicly supported and honored a despicable racist, i'd change shuls    and abandon the others at your shul who might need your help to unseat the rabbi? surely you’re a better friend than that.  &gt;in light of this, the fact that mr. obama's father and step-father were both muslim.  his father was raised muslim, but was no longer practicing any religion by the time he met senator obama’s mother. yes, his stepfather was a muslim….and? so? my stepfather was a violent alcoholic dog thief, but i don’t get drunk, hit people, or steal dogs. your logic is flawed.  &gt;...and that he spent part of his childhood in a muslim school in indonesia perhaps should begin to concern us  i don’t know what you know (or don’t know) about indonesia…but just about &gt;everything&gt; in indonesia is muslim. obama went to a roman catholic school. not a madrassa. not a radical muslim combat training center/bomb factory. he was taught by nuns. maybe you should be more worried about that. later, he went to a public school described by the chicago tribune as being so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate christmas. why am i defending this, when it’s been debunked for almost a year? next!  &gt;but honestly, all this wouldn't be enough for me to dimiss (sic) the very articulate and charismatic mr. obama if he wasn't consistently exhibiting worrisome, non-debunkable evidence that he is neither a friend either of israel, or the jewish people   i’ve read most of his policy papers, and i’ve seen no plans to cut the billions the us sends to israel while new orleans and detroit drown and burn, respectively.   &gt;and please spare me the letter from the token jew who ""met him and spoke to him and is completely convinced he is a friend of israel blah, blah   why would that be convincing, anyway? i’ve haven’t seen obama, clinton, or mccain wearing a star of david. should we distrust them because of this, above and beyond the normal distrust one should have for any politician?  &gt;if i've made a mistake, please debunk me   done and done, above.  &gt;until then, i guess i'll have to believe what i see  that would be a good start for you, i guess, as opposed to your current policy of regurgitating clinton/mccain/rnc talking points/propaganda/lies.  &gt;just a reminder: i am a u.s. citizen who pays taxes&gt;  this reminds me of the chris rock joke about parents who brag about “taking care of their kids”. you’re...supposed to pay your taxes. don’t brag about doing something you were supposed to do anyway.  &gt;...and i have every right to express my opinion on candidates running in an election in which i plan to vote  you absolutely have that right. libel, slander...these acts you have no right to commit, m’kay?  &gt;i don't mind telling you: it won't be for barack obama    well. goody gumdrops for you.  i wonder, are you directly on the senator clinton’s payroll? or maybe senator mccain’s? or aipac? if this came from the clinton camp, i’d call it sad and desperate. if it came from the mccain camp, shame on him for using the same tactics the dubyatard and his little pal turd blossom (aka karl rove) used against him in 2000. if it came from both of them...wow. but coming from you, on the day after obama’s most recent wins, i can only assume this is a proxy attack, possible requested by the senator clinton campaign, possibly a lone wolf attack. but your tone, along with the generous use of their talking points leads me to believe you are acting on behalf of senator clinton.   here's something to ponder: what are those who are against obama more afraid of? let's imagine a world where these lies are true, that barack obama is an anti-semitic, pro-muslim with ties to black separatists. how is that different than clinton or mccain's pro-corporation/lobbyist (newsflash: corporations are the countries of the 21st century, and lobbyists are their ambassadors), pro-war/military industrial complex, anti-muslim (unless they are our friends...except they really aren't), give israel money and ignore them philosophy? for that matter, tell me that after eight years of dubya that an anti-semitic, pro-muslim president wouldn’t be an improvement. but the truth is that senator obama is not an anti-semitic, pro-muslim with ties to black separatists. is he the perfect candidate? no such creature exists. he’ll get my vote because he is a 180° turn from the fascism of dubya.   i have a number of issues with a hillary clinton presidency:  - i don’t want the history books to say bush (1988 - 1992), clinton (1992 - 2000), bush (2000 – 2008), clinton (2008 - ?). it reads like an imperial chronology, not a representation of a democratic republic. i have not once in my lifetime voted in a presidential election where someone named bush or clinton was not on the ballot. a bush or clinton has been a member of the executive branch in some capacity for the last 28 years. it’s time for some new blood.  - hilary is incredibly polarizing, and is thus less electable than obama; she’ll drive away independents (who will then vote for mccain, if he isn’t knocked out by this new sex scandal), and she doesn’t have the appeal to younger voters that obama has.  - hillary’s a hawk who will continue the bush/cheney policies of preemptive war, saber rattling/gunboat diplomacy, and warrantless spying on americans.  - if her administration is anything like her husband’s (and bush/cheney), lobbyists will invited and encouraged to create legislation behind closed doors, especially those in the oil/energy/chemical, pharmaceutical, and defense industries.  again, obama isn’t perfect. i actually liked dennis kucinich and john edwards more than i like him. but i think hillary is a democratic version of bush, who will keep the status quo, with minor cosmetic changes. i believe (hope) that obama is truly interested in improving america’s image abroad by re-building bridges with old allies, lowering the anger and resentment that bush/cheney (and clinton/gore, and bush/quayle, etc) have built up by putting american troops into muslim countries. if i were a brown-skinned person in another country, and i saw that “the great satan” usa had elected a brown-skinned person as their leader, i would probably reassess my opinion of the us. if the us can improve our world image, perhaps less people would want to kill us.   the only way that humankind can reach its true potential is to stop using these unilateral, realpolitik strategies, where everyone has to save face, and nothing actually gets done, and just talk to one another. we are all family, every one of us. every palestinian child is a jewish child. every american child is an iraqi child. we are human. let us start to act like it, before we have nothing left to fight over but dust, ashes, and tears. thanks for reading.",0,,

988113,"some things i would like to get out of the way. historically, there has been a light vs. dark issue among blacks because society tended to treat lighter  blacks better than darker ones. so i would avoid getting specific with the older generation, i'm 18 and most people like 35 and under just don't have the same hang ups. secondly, men react differently than women, i think that transcends race because as a rule men don't really like getting too descriptive about their appearance. so i would stick with ""your shade/complexion"" if the case ever arises. also some terms are regional, southerners tend to use it more often. some people might classify another person completely different from the next, but i'll use some famous blacks to give you an idea  bright= (old saying goes: light, bright, damn near white) typically they come from families that have a long history of only marrying other brights or have recently mixed heritage but identify as black, or simply just took after one parent who was bright. colin powell, harold ford, jr, thurgood marshall, tisha campbell,lena horne, mariah carey and vin diesel  high yellow/ yellabone- a little darker than brights kinda yellowish, rihanna, alicia keys, beyonce, thandie newton, christina milian, lisa bonet, vanessa williams  redbone= more of a light reddish brown than yellowish but jada pinkett, ciara, tyra banks, halle berry, barack obama, chris brown  caramel= sanaa lathan, lauren london, common  bscotch/mocha/ or medium brown= gina torres, tiger woods, nia long, megan goode  dark brown or coffee= denzel washington, vivica fox, kanye west  hershey= lauryn hill, nona gaye, kenya moore, iman  dark/ebony/jet black= michael jordan, wesley snipes, alec wek  blue-black= i can't think any famous ones but when you see it you'll definitely recognize it. very visually interesting complexion.   two toned= i can't think of a celebrity but they are people whose facial color doesn't match their body.   these are the most basic ones, i mean people can get super descriptive. i guess when you are use to people you notice the little subtle things about their complexion that would go completely unnoticed to an outsider.  and some people just have 3 categories: light skin, brown skin, dark skin. keep it simple, lol. there are some terms i wasn’t aware of until recently, i was in sc and some locals called me a ""melaungeon"" lol. blacks from latin american have even more terms, like brazilians have 45 categories. crazy. white people aren't usually privy to the terms we use so some people might be like “how the f*ck you know that?” but also more likely to open up because if you know that then you must be cool with a lot of black to be familiar with terms. also if you told a hot black girl that she has a beautiful mocha brown complexion or whatever her complexion may be, she's gonna be all up on you. assuming you're not completely lame or hideously unattractive.",1,0,1
161732,"**hostel**  paint liquored walls burn cider orange above people on couches, leaping to scald the stranded beach footsteps of thousands bringing foreign dust and international ideas, sleeping wide eyed in bus striped jungle laced journeys.   lyrics of well trodden records flip through the warm shag earth of carpet sand sliding between soft cover books and napping on waterlily irish tongue while liquid optical sodafizz moments spill myriad of photo smiles over a tea-splashed tabletop.   like incubi of travel we seduce the clockwork running above our shaven hearts into yielding for the little universes of rock and sand around us climbing reaching for the milky blue breasts of sky poking through coffee warm sun.   we are ephemeral plants pistoling forth and back into playing card midnights dealing hands of slow mornings, meddling gorges of rest into our blankety milk scrubbed skin.   we taste jazz in broiled culture food and swivel to face snow hands churning turning laughing spicy laughs into supper baked dishes, fingers dolloped dish soap blue, steaming irish welsh aussie tongues clean in ivory piano sinks.   songs jog out of fresh morning honey lemon throats whistling to adelaide eyes and arkansas yawns, vibrating writhing waking old forgotten archives of flower yodeling men in detroit.   spiny nights cough energy into snow bitten lungs, inhaling smoking eating the stories of us living a purple peat moss adventure in texas, hotter than chili grins simmered down to the jalapeno crust.   spanish souptalk dribbles in sporadic sentences fucking our souls with its vernacular, leaving us to spit the apple seed replies between catching our breath and tossing it back to the rapid rock garden karma speaker.   six o'clock teapots sizzle scream exhale howl for dawn, dancing to hitch upvalley till our gears lock up and crackle, stopping on the futon conversations that spit ash and drink magma granola shakes.   jackeled hyena eyes stare from fireplace corners preying meditating weeping their tales of seattle wind inquiring black cotton scarves and of rain squished mississippi drives flaring chestnut puddles at trotting children, drawing cries of gumbo coated excitement.   these sight triggered memories ricochet across the tea walls of album orgies, invisible repeating repeating soundtracks dipped in vanilla extract cat stevens symphonies.   vinyl groove oxen yoked with bluegrass rhythms swindle us out of hour long hot chocolate naps, spreading homesick xylophone-tuned notes like an ant trapped in the icebergs of lonely freezerburned yams.   succulent chalk textured telephone calls buckle weak beneath quiet stampedes of angora thoughts scraping our discount womb of back-front house clutter, gutting perfect stucco canyons into the heels of thick russian madmen and speaking america's holiday poems into our stinking bellybutton eardrums, linty with seven languages of warhol landscapes.   soup burned lips lick refrigerator chilled items clean like cold kitten brillo rash tongue, scraping orange juice dry.   front porch coffee ashcans stand squat shivering on brine colored benches, smoking charred camel cigarette butts stained wet drippy with snow spackle, ingesting nicotine talk and crumpled cellophane secrets like carcinogen parasites.   ice stomped boots flick over the wooden tongue boards dragging dirt wilted laced in a fatigued march to the porchmouth stairs, letting chipped paint teeth chew stress necklaces into the soles of size six leather.   sidewalk shovels stand tinfoil shiny against weary steps waiting, checking wristwatch sunshadows for zeus news of blizzard wind tossed flakes, at ease hearing giggle woven rapture essays between numb winter lipped nomad boys and journey hunters.   scrabble sown literary kids sweeten brash fucktalk with fifty-point words and double-letter fudge sundaes melting ambitious infant minds into butter molds of intellectual cream and two penny palm readings, a dictionary tarot of word fiddles and hungry foresight.   scattered simply in bunks of dorm dimpled reservations there sleep wild nightmares of time running sideways into walls and bouncing against locked doors, shrieking some garbled sapphire schedule to door frame dreams.   thick inside the uterus of this cozy supermarket variety clanhouse forms a small hope-bead layering luminous sequined souls together like baby barnacles.   sparrows pencil short hunkering haikus around the pearl fetus, weaving a fallopial translucent shell over the stained glass eyelids of this developing epiphany.   lemon acid ink types a double helix of future far into the awe-covered arteries, sealing red wax vows in a timpani tattoo of diseroding arpeggios.   this tipi of flint sparks high altitudes of praise into birth canals of our destitute brain boxes, leading us to meditating zen yelling in raucous heaps of peace.   purring ambition-laced kittens and woolen socks worn tribal patterned and inside out walk tight trails to the valleys we ran from, clutching to high peaks of the bony shoulders of america, gasping magenta grief mantras in pulse with the haunted throb of the rockies.   a cowering sleep cave pressed down into a small tour town, this hidden belly of music and food and culture-children nourishes the broken necklaces of entropy threaded destinies with chocolate-barefoot mural walls and foamy theory talk and front porch nicotine exercise.   a sweltering sofa cushion box of sleep veins, this sacred niche is piecing red-apple bach verse into resting beds of ginseng wrought tea leaves and gorgeous herds of pineapple haired travelers.   a parer of sharded old ideas, we have skinned ourselves down to raw bone love and made petri-dish hope thrive.   **meaning**  i was life before those drug hazed caramel sticky days weaved through me like a young boy - roving creeping flailing looking for meaning in: snorting breathing smoking, high up high in kite filled dreams of purple words spitting off the lips of coke tongues numb like february - quietly crackling in frozen fires of speed filling up post-addiction paragraphs in terrific tomes of powder and razor blade leftovers.   i felt life loom lustrous in cool cold cars iced over and steamed up in short staccato whispers of hasty boys and sparkling frost, stealing my supper of standards and stomping it to the frozen sidewalks trying to keep warmhotsweaty, eating after-sex cigarettes; i am listening to sweet smelling metaphors of lust loop over over over into slippery songs tasting the twinge of guilt brought by baneful substitutes of pussy contentment caught by the web wisp of growing up.   i remember meditating in beds against the ceiling against me, wallroommusic melting in cacaphonous catalepsies, so our dusty dances wake and dream together: acid in retinal thoughts; dripping daisies in miniature rivers of tea and tangy biscuits, epiphanies climax and explode crisply into meaning only to be forgotten when flavors of sleep wake me the next morning.   i know we flowed into the air during these days for air is: space and i and dirt and sweet honest children gasping for spirit in distraught devilish corruption, society mixing morals and melodies together in sex and cold steel cells and angry death monsters sleeping in cozy closets of mind and childhood; pink wrinkled babies aborted into wombs of dumpsters scream for truth and breast, the result of whiskey baptized backseat orgies unwanted by giggling girls frothy in youthful hard-ons of impulse.   then i recall life linked me to the jeering rock jetties and seraphim sand i stood sat fucked on every moment, kissing ozone breath and cigarette exhales with every thought. super walls of seashell worries babbled concrete sidewalks under my feet, laced loosely in chewing gum and bread crumbs connecting the chess thought intellectuals of each step taken by: man child bird horse, walking blindly like bar-close crowds laughing slipping tossing themselves into the next moment like marionettes with missing meringue strings.   next i laugh over cherry whipped cream smiles during love, locating this question - not idea - of purposeful reason for the quiet fireplace nights and goosebump kisses by so many boys eager for the next wet moment of greed. i see need for this cigarette burn pain in meaning, searing slowly through weekends dipped curry sauce hot and seconds of gasoline lit fights with overtalk and ideas strung up and out in mushroom fueled christmas decorations.   soon i will bundle life in my red pack next to socks and poor poems, trekking toward effervescent days of sugar soaked light flickering now in my hopes, short circuiting bulbs of doubt and past. wasted time is level with forever, gone and to be still, coupling frog princes to literary tightropes of search-and-rescue of lost marijuana babies, reverberating mini-slide shows of memories in the arteries of us finding more meaning than quick pussy and yellow eyed parties.   **june 29th 2014 writing** sweet sanctuaries of song, rhythm and chords slip past the ears like a memory just out of reach.  measures of melodies twist the trepidation i have and hook onto gentle golden sensations.  soft somnolent impressions press against my soul, easing out into phrases of pliable emotion.  cultivating the creativity hindered with firm barricades around my spirit, the music unchains the paragraphs i quietly collected.  innumerable ideas lost to the doubt i harbor, i strain to seize so many sentences that escaped while i hid deep inside myself.  i wilted into a shadow of myself, diminished and translucent. i was diaphanous, camouflaged and lifeless.  i see through myself, like i never existed, a vague speculation of self.  frantically i attempt to color myself in, blues and purples scribbled hastily.  i need to be visible to the world like i was when i felt that intoxicating existence of ambition and anticipation for everything.",0,,

300735,"i've actually told this story before on another message board, so i'll just copy/paste it (kind of long):  i was traveling back home for the weekend today. i made two mistakes. first, i forgot my pajamas back at my dorm and i hate sleeping without my pajamas. second, i ate a ton of taco bell. and i mean a ton. i loaded up on those cheap 99 cent nachos along with a few soft tacos drenched with fire sauce. i knew this was a mistake when my indigestion started acting up.  i got into the car to start out on my 4 hour trip back home. after about an hour in, i realize my near future would undoubtedly include me taking a ginormous shit. little did i know, it'd be the worst dump of my life. everyone knows that when you're on a highway and are expecting to take a dump, you have to time it correctly. there are points on the highway filled with various fast food restaurants where you can easily pull off and go to work. however, there are more rural areas on the highway filled with nothing but farmland and cow shit.  and i don't shit with the cows (i just don't, it's inhumane).  anyway, i timed it badly. very badly. i thought i could make it through the next patch of rural area, but it turns out that fiery sauce was extra fiery today. just like when adam and eve suddenly realized they were two nude humans rubbing each others virgin bodies, i realized that i had to go. now. now!!! i pulled off at the next exit. i had no idea where i was, but i had exactly 4 minutes (not 5) before i gave my own smelly demonstration on what it'd be like if the hoover dam suddenly cracked and let loose everything it was holding back.  i came across a single gas station with no more than 4 pumps. i ran in. blurry visioned and barely conscious, the immense pain that pressed against my inner bowels was enough to put a typical human being to his knees. but this gas station was so damned crowded! why the fuck were there so many god damned people out in the middle of nowhere, buying random shit at this run down gas station? i finally found the mens bathroom. small, hot, dirty. it'd have to do.  my nightmare reached its climax. occupado. taken. some fat asshole was sitting on the john dropping off his equally fat kids. ""yo how long?"" is all i could manage to say. no response, and i summoned the will to move my torso and knock lightly on the door.  ""it'll be a while man sorry.""  it suddenly came to me. rushing at me as fast as the original storm of mexican fast food rushed my digestive system. i was fucked. this shit was coming out whether i liked it or not. could i run outside and use the parking lot? the grass in the back? public dumping was the least of my concerns right now, let alone wiping my ass. no time. literally, the leakage began. my pants were already damp from sweat and a soft, mushy mixture of diarrhea began to add itself to the mix.  i'm sorry to all the ladies out there, but i did the unthinkable. i had to. i ran in.  there was a woman at the mirror. i barely noticed the weird look she gave me as i stumbled to the stall furthest to the left. it was already filled with piss but i didn't care. my pants were off so quickly, i'd put paris hilton to shame.  and then....ohhh...god...oh god....  the amount of crap. the amount of seepage that ran out of my asshole was equivalent to a high powered fire hose. the initial stream lasted roughly 15 seconds. when i say that, i mean 15 seconds of pure, uninterrupted spewing liquid shit. the lady in the bathroom had already gasped and left but i was experiencing a feeling of relief thousands of times more powerful than even my greatest orgasm. i was a tire being deflated. a balloon being popped. like jesus walking on water, my asshole was lifted by the slight buoyancy provided from the forceful blast. achieving true nirvana, i let out a primalistic cry from the very depths of my thorax. but that was only the beginning.  soon after, more solid pieces of crap began to drop out. like the dresdon bombings, the bacteria inhabiting that toilet were immediately annihilated. a tortuous raining of ass goblins covered the off white porcelain with a dull blackish brown. the methane content of the immediate vicinity was at dangerous levels. i heard a baby crying in the distance. i teared up. i couldn't breathe. i tried my covering my nose with my shirt, but it was so dry, the air leaked right through. i gasped and choked. i coughed. thinking more clearly now that i was 20 lbs lighter, i did what i had to do. i soaked a fistful of toilet paper in my own urine and buried my nose inside. the salty scent of my dehydrated urine (i drank a lot of dr. pepper, forgot to mention that) was a relief. with every inhale, a flood of my own waste ran against my violated nostrils. the relief was temporary but necessary.  i heard the door open. the rush of sound from the outside filled my deaf ears. you see, i had achieved such a divine state of zen, i had no track of time. what felt like hours to me was in reality only a few seconds. but the sound, the murmur, the gasps from the outside woke me up. it brought me back.  i was sitting in a womens bathroom, unloading the largest, nastiest dump of my life, when a group of women walk in on my, inhaling the putrid smell my asshole had unleashed upon this universe. ""get out!!!"" i heard. ""i'm going to call the cops!!!""  it was the manager. i was told on. i acted quickly. too quickly. with my new found agility, like a phoenix reborn, i gathered my garments and rushed past the angry mob. i glanced over the mob briefly and saw the whale-man who had put me in this position. under my breath, i cursed him, and swore to enact revenge at a later point in my life. my ass, covered in liquid poo, reeked of dead squirrel and undercooked low grade beef. from the front door, to the car, to the road, to the next gas station, i didn't think, but just acted.  i had escaped. covered in shit, my car now permanently tainted, but i had escaped.  i went to the next gas station and finished the rest of my dump (still had a lot left in me) and took a mini-bath in their sink. ditched my underwear and scrubbed down my car seat.  it's like nothing happened. but the memories are all still there.",0,,
926806,"sorry you missed my point. people like you claim the working poor have to earn higher pay by gaining skills and training, so that they actually earn what they get. in other words they don't deserve to simply get a gift of higher pay. using the same logic on the walton family, i don't think they deserve what they have because none of them earned it at all. it was passed to them through no hard work of their own. through no contribution of their own. your statement about them running it and growing it is just wrong. they don't. and your statement about ""giving the company to the state"" is a non-sequitur. i never suggested (or thought) anything even remotely like it. but it is a matter of inheritance tax. they did nothing to earn the money and yet you fight for their right to keep as much as possible. the worker at walmart on the other hand actually works and you think they deserve very little. it is a double standard. this is not an envy issue as you seem to be obsessed with. believe it or not, not all arguments about wealth accumulation have to do with envy and disdain.",0,,

495864,"**humans:**  baseline traits: nothing that isn't foreign in this world. average height is between 5'6"" and 6'.  * ausiatic- live on the southern end of the continent. tend to be pale, short, blond hair, blue eyes. renowned for tolerance to the cold. many ausiatic nations rely on seafaring trade, fishing, and hunting to prosper. [i.e., germanic people0  * mediatic- inhabit much of the center-south of the continent. average height, slight build, tan-to-olive skin, brown or black hair, brown eyes. many are involved in agriculture, though many prefer to congregate in large cities. [mediterranean]  * occidentic- inhabit the western sub-continent. most of them are average-to-short height, have an average build, tan skin, narrow eyes, black hair, and brown eyes. most live along coasts, in jungles, or in deserts as nomads. [asian/polynesian]  * boreatic- live in the north of the continent. have a vague resemblence to the occidentic people, although paler. often live in isolated hunter-gatherer tribes in the tundra. [siberian/inuit]  * senetic- once inhabited most of the central and southern continent, considered 'extinct' after the great ruin eight millennia ago. renowned for their (now-ruined) extensive stone cities and elaborate ironwork. the majority are believed to have assimilated into other cultures, which is the commonly accepted explanation for why there are several austriatic regions with red-haired denizens. [celtic]  there are other groups of humans that some feel should be included, but can mostly be lumped into other categories or are too few to warrant their own classification. one notable one is the sancturiatic sub-race, who are pale-skinned, have light blue-grey eyes and white-blond hair, and are almost entirely the population of the holy empire of sancturia, an isolated theocracy farther north than the boreatic tribes. another is the aequiletic sub-race, a 'half-breed' of humans (mostly senetic and boreatic) with aeyen who live on islands in the gefreyan sea.  **aeyen:**  baseline traits: average lifespan ~250 years, ears 'pointed' to various extents, have a rather isolationist or tribalistic mindset, wary of outsiders, very politically opinionated.  * nelaeyen (north elves)- stand at about equal height to humans, tend to have pale-to-gold skin, and hair colors ranging from blond to brown. many features of the nelaeyen are considered 'baseline' for many aeyen races, such as high cheekbones, 'soft-pointed' ears, a slight build, and green eyes. nelaeyen are the main race of the aeyen empire, which has continuously existed for over eleven thousand years.  * sulaeyen (south elves)- slightly shorter and stockier than nelaeyen (~5'3""-5'6""), skin colors that range from golden-yellow to dark brown, eyes are green, yellow, or brown, and hair colors between light brown and black. faces are often 'rounder' than nelaeyen, and their ears have ""sharper"" points.  * talaeyen (mountain elves)- considered to be the 'common ancestor' of all elves. grey-brown skin, shorter than both nel- and sulaeyen, brown-to-black hair, brown eyes. they have the facial features of sulaeyen, but usually have builds more in line with the nelaeyen. they mostly live in unorganized tribes in the southern mountains.  * alaeyen (sea elves)- descended from talaeyen who migrated to the gefreyan sea 12,000 years ago to avoid the aeyen empire's expansionism. some interbred with senetic humans (forming the aequiletic race), while others remained isolated. their skin colors range from white to blue-grey to brown, and their hair colors have a similarly extreme level of diversity. many dialects of old aeyen that are extinct on the mainland survive on different islands, and customs vary widely between island tribes. their athletic ability and muscle density is far lower compared to other aeyen races, and they're more prone to developing higher proportions of body fat; anthropologists believe this is an evolved trait that resulted from most islands' sparse resources and few high-protein foods in their diet.  **oyan:**  baseline traits: average lifespan ~150 years, more heavily built than aeyen and humans, mostly antisocial/agoraphobic, and most tend to be devoutly religious. renowned for their skillful stone carving and constructing elaborate cities in the sides of cliffs and underground. nobody's really sure why humans call them 'dwarves,' though it's believed to come from ancient senetic terms that were bastardized by later languages.  * oyanil (first dwarves)- similar in height compared to humans and nelaeyen, pale-to-grey skin, hair is often white, blond, or light brown, blue eyes. compared to nelaeyen, they are far stockier, have 'wider' faces, smaller, more rounded eyes, large hands, and 'sharper' pointed ears. the main population of the oyan divine confederacy, which is ruled by 8 god-emperors.  * oyandun (second dwarves)- slightly taller than the oyanil (5'9""-6'), and have skin shades similar to the talaeyen. hair colors are usually shades of brown, while eyes are usually blue. they tend to live on the surface more than the oyanil. the majority of oyandun follow the religion of true oyanism, an offshoot of oyanism that centers around worship of one god-emperor that arose 'only' 4,000 years ago.  another 'race' worth mentioning are the southern aequiletics, or oyanah (pretender dwarves). though few in number and only inhabiting the very southern tip of the human continent, they're the result of interbreeding between senetic and austriatic people and the oyandun. they are considerably more 'human-looking' than northern aequiletics, leading some pro-evolutionary scientists to believe that oyan are the 'missing link' between human and aeyen evolution.  **oeren:**  baseline traits: at least a foot taller than most humans (usually between 6'6"" and 8'), grossly obese, skin usually some shade of green, tusk-like teeth, pig-like faces, lots of body hair, incredibly fond of debauchery. top concerns are usually eating, drinking, and sex. have shown minimal high cognition, and have no evidence of writing or artwork in their entire history. [actually the result of ancient oyan (and some aeyen) being infected by a retrovirus.]  * old oeren- the 'old breed' of orcs. skin is a darker green compared to other orcs, and they tend to have lighter-colored hair. it's unknown whether orcs are biologically immortal, but their descriptions are rather similar to ancient talaeyen pictographs, down to the color of their skin. few of them are seen on raiding parties, which is either because of their advanced age or the fact that many have been around long enough to achieve leadership positions in their tribes.  * new oeren- the 'new and improved' orcs. they've been appearing in larger numbers than their older relatives over the past 6,000 years. average height is almost 8', they actually have something vaguely resembling muscle tone, their skin is more of a waxy yellow-green, and they tend to have darker hair. somehow, the new orn are even fatter, hairier, and uglier than the old ones.",1,0,0
922948,"paul bauer is a white man. quite a white man. so white he has freckles. so white his beard has grown in orange. “you won’t see me on the beach during daylight hours,” he says. “i’m just as pink as can be.”  he is proud of his whiteness, but not in a white-pride way. no, definitely not. bauer is troubled by the bad deeds his white ancestors did. and his ancestors were whiter than most.  four hundred seventy-seven years ago, one of them set foot on plymouth rock. this was on his mother’s side, mom being a warfield. (dad is second-generation german, which is not only white, it is dangerously white; possibly aryan.) in the united states of america, it’s anglo-saxons who first defined whiteness. and you don’t get much more anglo than the pilgrims.  there were 101 of them on the mayflower, splashing ashore on the chill cusp of winter, low on provisions and wearing the wrong clothes. they would survive to celebrate the first thanksgiving, but as every schoolchild knows, it happened only because the friendly local indians patiently demonstrated how to catch fish and plant corn.  and here, centuries later, stands bauer (“like eddie bauer,” he says, “but not as well dressed”) with one finger firmly on the lid of his starbucks cup so it won’t spill on his “father sky, mother earth” t-shirt. the folding table he minds is stacked with literature from the council for native american solidarity. the banner above his head bids, “free leonard peltier,” referring to the imprisoned sioux the courts call a murderer and his supporters call a martyr.  rest assured, there are people who feel very, very bad about all of this injustice–people acutely, painfully, obsessively aware of transgressions past and present, real and perceived. three hundred of these people, bauer among them, gathered last month on the fringe of harvard university, and you’ll never guess what they had in common.  the second national conference on whiteness was not what you might think. it was not what just about everybody seemed to think.  “a lot of people say, ‘oh, you’re going to a ku klux klan meeting,’ ” says carah reed, who flew all the way from orange county for what was the furthest thing in the world from a klan rally. the only hate being spewed at episcopal divinity school during three gray, introspective days was the self-loathing of committed liberals–anti-racism storm troopers who identify themselves as racists because they are, you know, white.  “one thing about white people, we tend to either be proud or ashamed of being white,” says jeff hitchcock, executive director of the center for the study of white american culture, the ne1998585857jersey nonprofit that organized the conference. “proud in a supremacist way, or guilty in a liberal way. very seldom do you find the balance. it’s either one or the other. and that’s kind of psychotic.”  this year’s conference drew six times as many attendees as last year’s, evidence that whiteness is a topic of growing, serious scholarship. some 90% of the people here are white, but they are multiculturalists at heart. they see society changing, becoming more ethnic, and they want to help it change.  but on another level, this gathering appears to be a kind of purification ritual, the way the white attendees start out by copping to the very thing they are working against, ardently confessing that they harbor (somewhere within themselves) the same snap judgments and idiotic prejudices that everyone else harbors, but which surface in them only by sneaking past a watchfulness that puts the white house security detail to complete and utter shame.  “i have an ulcer, ok? i’m 23. i have an ulcer,” a lad named eric announces to his peers at a panel devoted to dissecting, among other evils, “adultism.”  there are sessions on “ableism and racism,” on “the invisibility / visibility of arab americans,” on “the vector of whiteness” (subtitled “the latino case”). the sessions are pan-racial, as likely to be led by a stout black woman with a british accent as a fit graybeard from boston.  but at the end of the confab, after all have had their say, it is obvious who will have to carry the freight. at the closing session, a caucasoid fellow of about 60 reaches into a badly wrinkled paper bag, pulls out a bottle and throws back a hard slug of something. it is pepto-bismol.  the white man’s burden: rudyard kipling, the english writer, adventurer and, many say, racist, coined the phrase in 1899. kipling’s poem went on about the grave responsibility of caring for “new-caught, sullen peoples / half devil and half child.” in this place, on this weekend, the white man’s burden is something else altogether. the white man’s burden is his own bad self.  holding the mayo  martin mull wrung about all the tang you can from vanilla in “the history of white people in america: part i.” the mockumentary, which aired on tv 10 years ago, profiled a typical suburban family, each member of which carried around a jar of mayonnaise the size of a chair. on a tour of the living room, mull pointed out the stack of coasters, explaining that these will serve to protect the finish of a natural surface, “should any occur.”  who wants to be white? the pasty suburban kids lining up in baggy shorts to buy the latest bone thugs n harmony disc? their pasty dads who lined up for the latest sly &amp; the family stone album?  “whoever heard of a wise old white woman who gets a permanent once a week and talks on the telephone?” asks a woman named myke, reading a poem. the poem is called “wanting to be indian,” and it has set heads to nodding. these nods are not terse; they are the kind that roll off the shoulders and involve a lot of neck. the sound that goes with them is a soft “hmmmmm,” a throaty affirmation that translates to “how true.”  it seems safe to say that no one in this sea of pale faces wants to be white. and, in fact, the room does not “feel” white. it does not feel like a new hampshire rotary club meeting on the day pat buchanan shows up to campaign. it does not feel the way the roanoke room or the chesapeake room or any dimly lit conference space in any hotel in america feels at 10 o’clock on a weekday morning, with the name tags lined up there beside the big stainless steel coffee urn and a stack of pastries on a perfectly round brown plastic tray; someone has sliced every danish in half.  the big room feels as though it has no color at all. the vibe here is of a deliberate wash, of identity being pulled back, conscientiously held at bay. everyone in the room is in a receive mode, unwilling to project anything at all save the quietest, softest strength.  the people here–many of them women, many with long hair the color of steel–are practiced at this. it is what a lot of them do for a living: sit in a room with other people, thinking hard, feeling harder, withholding judgment. when the emcee, a fast-talking woman named meck groot, asks how many are educators, a third of those present raise a hand. afro-american studies. women’s studies. multicultural advisory office. another third call themselves activists or organizers. a little cheer goes up at the words, at the mere suggestion of a cause.  no one has to explain to this bunch what the “process room” is. (it’s where you go “if you have an issue,” groot notes for the record.) no one has to say why the host starts with a “centering exercise.” (it’s to remind you “that you have a body, and it needs to be paid attention to.”) a loosely structured workshop on “modern racism and internalized oppression” suits this crew like a peasant blouse, like a dashiki, like a peruvian wool jacket that looks as scratchy as a hair shirt.  colorless people  they are making history here. they are on the leading edge of something. only five people in the entire group have ever taken a weekend to meditate on “whiteness.” the concept is too new. too slippery.  here is a woman with a tortured expression on her face and a book in her lap. it is her journal. look out. she’s going to read from it.  “whiteness,” she says. “a strange, eerie, unreal thing. when you think about it.”  here is a muscular woman explaining why she is running a workshop on “white folks exploring native american cultural and spiritual traditions: appreciation versus appropriation.”  “one thing people ask us is, why are white people doing this workshop?” she says. she answers herself: “we’re all experts. if a person is white, he’s an expert on this.”  and here someone who is not: a striking 28-year-old woman with hair the color of rust and skin the richest shade of sienna. she was born in the united states, grew up in zimbabwe and has lived in the boston area for eight years.  her name tag reads: “blessing.”  “coming back to america, i didn’t identify with the african americans,” blessing says. “i identified more with the white people. the african americans seemed more like a different race. they weren’t like me.”  her black friends noticed this too. they said, “oh, you’re so white.” they said she watches white tv shows.",1,1,-1
931082,"i firmly believe that only actual experience will give you a definitive knowledge. there are several guides or systems (like color 'seasons') that can give you 'jumping-off points'; but they don't always hold true, and you can't always figure out your correct category.  the best way is to do it all in a sitting, or two or a few: set up a mirror close to a window with good natural lighting. (a camera set up on a tripod will be a good tool as well.) gather samples of *many* different colors, where the solid color covers a large area. you're just going to be holding the colors next to your face, so you don't necessarily need all shirts and sweaters. pants, jackets, fabric scraps, drapes, cushions, bandannas, even colored paper will do.  one by one, hold the colors next to your face. then focus on the image of your face in the mirror. this is not about how nice the color is or how much you like it; it's about how your face looks next to it. with each color, determine whether your face looks healthy, vibrant, alive, 'present' -- more 'you' -- next to the color, or whether your face looks pale, sallow, unhealthy, less present, or too much of the skin's color (which can especially happen with pink skin tones when they appear too blushy/ruddy, but also with others).  in my experience, it can be useful *not* to focus so much on the color of the skin, because that can get analytical and you can second-guess what you see. instead, you may see more clearly if you focus on seeing the *person*, as happens when you're walking down the street and you notice ""wow, that guy has a healthy look"" or ""uh-oh, you, my friend, do not look well"".  it's important also to try many shades and hues and tints of each major color group, since for instance some greens may help you and some greens may make you look bad.  once you have a pile of colors that help you look good and a pile of colors that cause you to look bad, you can go through the 'good' pile again and find the colors that really click, the ones that make you look *fantastic* or that look like a very natural fit. note those colors, and add them to your shopping info (along with your measurements and correct sizing). if you like, you can create a swatch book by sewing or stapling together scraps of your best colors, or threading them onto a key ring. you can bring the samples with you when you shop.  it is also an interesting response of human perception that we sense things we can name. for instance, once we identify and label the different kinds of flavors and their more subtle sub-groups, we can then perceive those flavors much more easily. if we don't know the name for a flavor, it's possible that we may not even be conscious of tasting it. this may hold true for colors as well: the more you can pin names to small differences in color, the better you will be able to identify those differences and use them in more sophisticated combinations. you don't necessarily have to have the 'right' name for a thousand different colors; but just making the effort to differentiate and name colors will probably help you use them well in putting together outfits (and understanding all kinds of design and visual arts more deeply).  if you want a short-form version of this process, you can just go through what is in your closet. or, even more abbreviated, check the most basic arsenal of shirt and jacket colors: white, off-white, light blue, navy blue, light grey, medium grey, tan, basic browns, and black.  a final note: just because a color is not good next to your face doesn't mean you can't wear it *away* from your face — in pants, shoes, belt, etc.",1,0,0
273772,"yes, i know that prices being set by sellers who are guided by costs of production *does* unsettle many austrians.  in all honesty, i think it may be a small over-reaction to the objective value ideas believed by marx and some of the classicals before him (whose labor theory of value appeared to lay the groundwork to marx's exploitation theory).  while supply and demand are the *ultimate* determinants of price, the fact the producers of manufactured goods follow profits forces me to accept that costs are more of a determinant in prices than most people realize.    for example, it is tempting to say that the price of a gm car is determined solely by the supply and demand for gm cars.  in this respect, one is led to think that the final buyers solely determine the price by their subjective valuations.  but this ignores the role of the producer.  producers will simply not produce gm cars priced at $10,000 say, if it means they have to suffer losses.  the consumer could theoretically want to pay no more than $10,000 for the gm car, and any price above that they will not pay.  but i always try to remain in the aristotelian framework that says the only reality is that which exists and is real.  a consumer who wants to pay no more than $10,000 doesn't mean the price for gm cars is $10,000.    in order for a price to be a price, money has to actually change hands.  gm producers will not be willing to accept $10,000 per car if it means they have to suffer losses, or earn below market profits.  therefore, even though the consumers *want* to pay $10,000 each for a certain supply of cars, they will end up not being able to buy any gm car at all.  since no gm cars are being produced, there are no prices.  since there are no prices, it means the consumer really isn't the direct determinant of what the price is.  if they were, then gm producers would have to produce cars at a loss, which is impossible.  therefore, the only way gm cars can be produced, such that a price for gm cars actually exists, is if the price set by the sellers of gm cars is *at least as big as the costs, plus the going rate of profit*.  since the rate of profit *tends* to be the same for car manufacturing (in a free market, without tariffs, subsidies, etc), it must mean that the costs of producing cars is the *proximate* determinant of price.  the reisman article you linked to, and the authors cited therein, especially bohm-bawerk, in all honesty pretty much sums up my sources for costs of production.  you are absolutely right that many austrians are wary of getting into the cost of production framework.  again, my best guess for why is that they don't want to give any credibility at all to objective value, because the whole austrian theory is based on subjective valuation, and so a path towards objective value seems to be a return to the exploitation framework.  if i could add to your comment regarding hours in the day, i think to myself that i can have a longer life if i study history.  history of ideas, events, economic thought, etc.  it makes me feel like i have lived a long life.  i think education is the path to immortality.  oh, i just remembered, there is an interesting story about objective value (costs of production), and subjective value (marginal utility):  mises and ayn rand, during a social gathering, were arguing over whether value was objective or subjective.  others present at the gathering were amazed at how intense the conversation became, with mises stressing subjectivity, and rand stressing objectivity.  i will try to find a reference for you.",0,,

573363,"it's a pretty interesting field for creativity. most of the skies on my planets will range from a vivid blue to white to a washed-out orange-yellow, since they are inhabited by humans and have human-breathable atmospheres similar in composition to earth's. i like to use [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/gxgmk.jpg) as a general guide for the color of an earth-like atmosphere around other color stars.  the color of the sky really depends on a few factors - the thickness of the atmosphere, and the color of the light created by the planet's primary star(s). most planets orbiting k, g, and f type stars have a sky color ranging from white to blue, while planets around m stars may be anywhere from very dim reds through orange to white. a thick atmosphere means that the sky would be brighter and whiter, while a thin atmosphere makes it darker and skews the scattering towards the highest frequencies available. you can see this on earth, where the sky tends to be a more and more brilliant blue as you ascend in altitude.   given this, yellow and green skies would tend to be very unusual and would likely be due to contaminants in the atmosphere, as is the case on the examples i give below. violet skies are also probably very difficult to achieve due to the way that the human eye collects light, but i feel that in cases where you have very hot stars and thin atmospheres it could happen. most skies would be in the range from yellow-orange to white to brilliant blue, just like star colors.   i always like to talk about examples, so here are some examples of every color from worlds in my setting:  **red:** new alaska is a medium sized planet that contains rich mineral deposits. the climate is cold due to the thin atmosphere (40% earth's) and dim m8 primary star (2200 k temperature). the dim light gives the sky a distinct reddish cast, but as most of the radiation of the star is in the ir frequencies it is only really visible near the horizon. the apex of the sky is typically very dark.   **orange:** shamash is a large world orbiting an m4 star (temperature 2900 k). the large, orange-red sun and the pale orange sky can be difficult to distinguish from each other at times. the thick atmosphere causes the sky to be a little paler than it might be otherwise.   **yellow:** galt is a small terrestrial planet with a very thin biosphere orbiting a k9 star (temperature 3700 k). there is a lot of dust in the atmosphere, which is about one-third the density of earth's. outside of the pressure domes, the sky tends to be a washed-out pale yellow color due to high-altitude dust.   **green:** virida, named for it's unusual green sky, is a planet with enough clouds and plant matter in the atmosphere that the sky on the surface is almost always a dull greenish-gray. higher up in the atmosphere it gets much more earth-like, and above the clouds the sky is a very pale, washed out blue with greenish-gray clouds below. the primary star is a k0 star with a temperature of around 4900 k  **white:** beatrice is a large terrestrial planet with a thick atmosphere orbiting a g6 star (temperature 5450 k). due to the thick atmosphere (about 2.5 times as thick as earth's) the sky is mostly white, making it hard to distinguish clouds. there is usually a thick haze over distant objects, making them appear blue or purple.   **blue:** an intensely blue sky occurs on hephaestus prime, a large world orbiting an f8 star (temperature 6200k) with an atmosphere about 70% as thick as earth's. the combination of a brighter star and a slightly thinner atmosphere mean that the sky is a deep blue color similar to what is seen at extremely high altitudes on earth.   **violet:** hi'iaka is a small, cool, mars-sized terrestrial planet with an atmosphere about 50% of earth's thickness, orbiting another f8 star (temperature 6250 k). the combination of thin atmosphere and bright white star creates a brilliantly colored sky that just barely has a violet cast to it.",0,,

119503,"truth, damn lies and execution  three hundred years ago, courts of justice could be blinded by superstition. in those dark times, people in positions of power could snuff out the light from any candle of hope that the condemned still held for life. innumerable falsely accused victims were burned at the stake, ignited by the flames of flourishing injustice, and fanned by the falsehoods spoke by their peers. sadly, no joyous sunrise would come to end their tortured nights of captivity.  but three hundred years later, courts remain hoodwinked by dishonesty. three hundred years later, lives are still tossed to the proverbial pit of fire. three hundred years later, people in positions of power demonstrate that they are impossibly all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-hearing by summarily judging the actions of others and then doling out executions with omnipotent strength. and so i share with you today a reiteration that acts can be neither omniscient nor omnipotent, that we all have faults, and by extension so do our governments and judicial conditions.  in a sense, capital punishment is like writing a cheque to purchase the life of a criminal. a payment, some argue, that is cheaper than supporting lifelong imprisonment. yet the laws of australia, canada, the united states of america, and numerous others guarantee the ""unalienable rights"" of life and liberty. our past actions liberated slaves and all but abolished slavery. our present actions show that we believe the authority to limit the life of a human being belongs to no one. but coldheartedly, these representative cheques continue to be cashed at banks of justice, even though banks of life and liberty would return them marked ""insufficient funds""!  we must refuse to endorse banks of justice that continue to honour such cheques. we refuse to believe that money can indemnify human lives, regardless of the crimes in question. these deplorable bank drafts must be nullified to redeem our courts of justice and our humanity.  every moment that our voices remain silent widens the gap between being human and being humane. there is an urgency that cannot, must not, be ignored. every hour of apathy lends credence to legalized vengeance. now is the time to speak out for those lost voices smothered behind iron. now is the time to turn our backs on barbaric states. now is the time to tell the people in power that killing is wrong. now is the time to teach compassion to all of our children.  lives are lost forever by ignoring the fierce urgency of now. the dark winter veil of cold-blooded murder will not be lifted until the springtime infusion of life is guaranteed throughout our societies. and those who believe that tomorrow will be just another day will have a rude awakening if the executions continue. there will be neither rest nor tranquility in the world until unconditional life is granted to all its citizens. the snowstorm of revolution will not end until the clear dawn of humble justice emerges.  and to the people united on the peaceful threshold of merciful justice: do not embark in wrongful deeds. life cannot be sanctioned by vengeful actions or riotous demonstrations. no, the right to life will not be chartered by outbursts of physical violence. our actions must embody this monumental goal; we must segregate villainous force from moral force.  when light from our morality is used to judge the shadows cast by criminals, we must appraise ourselves and our laws by the same rays of ethics. to do otherwise places governments and judicial systems beyond the reach of mediated introspection, beyond the grasp of justice itself. by this beam of self-inspection, when a death sentence is dispatched we lift the offender to the moral equality of societal norms, and find ourselves standing deep inside the shadows of criminals.  we shall not walk in those shadows.  we will walk without the spectre of hypocrisy to haunt our footfalls. and as we walk, our steps bring us closer to a golden era that waits ahead.  we cannot turn back.  there are those who oppose the progression toward leniency. they raise statistics like a stoic hammer, driving the belief that executing murderers will reduce homicides. however, this interpretation does not a nail in the coffin make. numbers are tools to add weight to debates; debates that must be continually cross-examined for applicability and accountability. yet statistics are also the claw to the hammer's head, pulling out deterrence arguments by suggesting that legitimising murder through the death penalty actually raises the rate of homicides!  so we will not be satisfied by statistics. we can never be satisfied as long as the guiltless are slaughtered. we cannot be satisfied when fallible humans are the judge and the jury to deadly trials. we can never be satisfied while the press pilots our opinions with sensationalized stigma. no, no, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until tolerance towers like the tallest of trees and forgiveness flowers like an endless forest.  let us be mindful that forgetfulness is not a bedfellow of forgiveness. to forget that many death row inmates committed terrible crimes would let befall a grave injustice. by the same token, to overlook that the dead can only be exonerated posthumously defiles the memory of innocent victims. instead of incapacitation, let criminals atone for their crimes with positive contributions to society. instead of martyrs, make them educators. instead of miscreants, fashion them material makers. instead of misfits, mold them as missionaries. instead of being slain for malevolence, give them the chance to change.  even though we face the turmoil of retribution, we can see the tenets of redemption. within these tenets, i, too, have a dream.  i dream of a day when no human will have the right to revoke the life from another.  i dream of a day when miscarriage of justice does not result in fresh flowers to a solitary grave, but in the freedom of an unjustly accused prisoner.  i dream of a day when even the ghosts of salem massachusetts, whose deaths were inconceivably shackled to ""spectral evidence"", and whose memories still mock modern justice, may finally find peace.  i dream of a people who understand that no heated crime warrants a cold resolution by death; that death is unjustly everlasting when pit against both fleeting and permanent transgressions; and that humane disciplines can meet the needs of society while being a fair reproach for felonies.  i have a dream today!  i dream of a world where we can judge our justice systems as though they were individuals: not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character. where at the highest courts of international law we find that justice is morally, ethically, and logically consistent across all countries.  i have a dream today!  i dream of a world in which mercy opens the door of knowledge to reveal that the real truth in any situation can never be known entirely. a world in which we are keenly aware that the whirlwind of motives, emotions, psyche, and actions behind a trial cannot be judged and punished with absolute conviction. a world that has cast off the rattling chains of death to embrace the foundations of life.  i dream of a world without injustice buried within injustice. a world where the poverty line does not foreshadow a flatline. a world where the accused wealthy and the convicted poor face their fates with equal outcomes and equal opportunities. a world where the concept of just justice is not an ironic fairytale, but a practical reality.  this is our dream, a dream inspired by an extraordinary man.  in the spirit of dr martin luther king jr, a man who made an enormous march for liberty, these words strive to be an extension of his ideas, a continuation to his ideals. but this time the walk is for life. and along the road to the global abolishment of capital punishment sits a world that is one small step closer to unity. it is only through this journey will our collective conscience truly be free at last.",0,,

697678,"this wasn't so much ""making fun of lesbians"" as it was ""saying women are greedy whores"".  gay men are a much more direct threat to the insecure manhood ideals of many people, as evidenced by the fact that ([per the fbi's hate crime stats for 2007](http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/victims.htm)) 58.9% of sexual orientation hate crimes were directed specifically at gay men with only 13% at lesbians.   &gt;not the same but probably in a similar category are jokes about white stereotypes vs jokes about black stereotypes   sensitivity to various stereotype jokes is, in large part, a function of history (ie: has that group been specifically subject to oppression recently, thus anti-jewish jokes are generally held to be more offensive than anti-polish jokes due to the events of 1933-1945) and current events.  again, per the fbi 69.3 of racially motivated crimes were committed against blacks, while 18.4 were committed against whites.  coupled with the history of jim crow, etc a greater sensitivity towards anti-black stereotypes is not entirely unreasonable, though in principle i agree that anti-anything stereotypes aren't good.  and, of course, there's question of how many of those jokes are really expressions of things people genuinely believe.  polls indicate that an overwhelming majority of americans believe that the majority of welfare recipients are black, thus we see jokes about welfare queens etc.  the reality is that more whites are on welfare than blacks (not by much, 38% white vs 37% black), yet look at jokes about welfare and you'll note that they are nearly universally about black welfare recipients.  the myth of the ""lazy negro"", much popularized following the american civil war lives on and is perpetuated on a nearly daily basis by right wing media.  following obama's election you may recall that an image of [""obama bucks""](http://contexts.org/socimages/2008/10/16/obama-bucks-caricatures-of-barack-obama/) became instantly popular on right wing blogs and mailing lists.  note that, in addition to the implication that as a black man obama is deeply invested in welfare, also the prominence of stereotypical black food (watermelon, fried chicken, kool-aid).  thus jokes that exist to perpetuate a harmful stereotype that is widely believed seem like a legitimate source of concern.",1,0,0

903458,"transcript:  *re: practicing self-righteousness (soma / south beach)  date: 2010-05-07, 3:47pm pdt reply to this post  i have a fairly large san francisco social circle and for the great majority of them, despite a little roughness with employment and around the economy, have formed a community of beautiful, wonderful, generous, interesting people. most of whom are all just doing their best to get by while spreading a little good karma into the world where they can.   by far, most i've spoken with on this topic feel the same: sure the world is far from perfect, but thank the god, goddess, universe, spirit, luck, fate, whatever, that at least we live in a time and place surrounded by so many truly cool, interesting, driven people. it is a blessing to be alive here, and now.   you see, i can't help but contrast that with the exceptions to the above pool- my pentecostal evangelical christian friends. these two, (as teen-agers they were a popular ""party-hardy"" couple until she got pregnant) were ""born again"" at the ripe old age of seventeen and shot-gun married a year later. school social-friends from back east, they moved out here his job two years ago and have never forgiven themselves for it. a mutual friend informed them i was out here, and very shortly there after, they came to depend on me for a majority of their san francisco social experiences from their home in a parent-funded, swanky evangelical community in marin.   generally i enjoy showing people around my adopted home, i host couch-surfing out-of-towners in my 260 sq/ft soma apartment more regularly than perhaps i should. i enjoy sharing this beautiful place with people, the sparkle of nob hill and market street, the gritty passion of the mission, i know but a tiny fraction of it, but what i know i love, and i have a passion to share.   for this particular duo, however, the task can be quite difficult. you see, while to a great majority of my friends, life is pretty good, people are amazing, circumstances can be overcome, but we're clearly moving forward and ""good and love"" looks like she just might win out over ""evil and hatred"". for my poor east-coast evangelical friends, quite the opposite is true. every visit brings new tales of impending calamity. every new month brings new tails of inevitable doom foreseen and repentance required.   walking through the street with them, gentlemen whom i shared a laugh and a spliff with two weeks ago become imposing, menacing ""gangsters"" out to conquer their fragile white self-righteous purity. the local fruit-vendor, who has several times saved me the four soma-block walk to safeway becomes an ""illegal"" out to seize all ""good peoples"" jobs. (where ""good people"" are defined solely by a question of ontological ideological purity, and not one iota based on the individuals actual affect and impact on his fellow travelers here on our beautiful earth.)   watching the world through these poor souls eyes is saddening, a world full of ""gangsters"" and ""illegals"". ""they"" are always out to get ""us"". how can i not join ""us""? how can i be so blind to their lords grace?   it doesn't help that these people are always trying to convert me. i try explaining to them, kindly, that i am not an atheist, i am a pagan, i know whom i serve, i know why and i do my best to do so with diligence and grace, but i've absolutely no ontological doubt. i appeal to social ettiquite: just as their faith is no business of mine, mine is no business of theirs.   but no, i am constantly lectured on how i am wrong. it's all evil! i am misguided by satan! i am reminded to be thankful that their wonderful and great and glorious god has placed them in my life to save a ""good soul"" like mine from the firey depths of sin and deprivation, around ugliness and evil that certainly inhabits all places that their god forsakes (not to mention ""eternal damnation"", which is the single must utterly irrational concept in the history of cognition: why continue to waste energy punishing failures that should merely be deprecated and forgotten?)   i tell them ""but, i don't see any such thing? i'm happy here, the people around me are happy, we help one another, in general. yeah, the crack makes the homeless go off the edge some times, it sucks that there are so many people suffering from it here. one day i hope society will be enlightened enough to tax hazardous substances to cover the social expense of treatment, rather than violent, blanket, ineffective prohibition.""   of course, this is where the self-righteous shit hits the expressive fan, because the god-warrior types always have one big social weakness, a faux-paux from which they seem utterly unable to back down; doctrine.   explicitly state support of a cause or concept that one of their preachers as ""informed"" them is ""of the devil"", and they cannot help their self-righteous fire; nor their willingness to sacrifice all pleasantries in for the purpose of 'saving(tm)' the planet from it's omnipresent 'downfall.'"" a noble concept, of course: standing for ones beliefs free of consideration for social decorum. in practice; unfortunately for these poor souls, mother earth, nature, and human life itself seems to seems to exist in stark contradiction to their principle spiritual guidance.   a long, angry lecture ensues, the same i've heard many times over, of their ""god's"" necessity in all things, especially those pertaining to morality. an assertion that ""i'm content, happy, and love a beautiful life. i possess a certainty about my faith and purpose, and absolutely no ambiguity in my understanding of karmic reciprocative morality."" is immediately followed by a quip about how the ""amazing powers of the devil's disguises."" it is, in fact, utterly impossible to free these poor individuals from their world of doom, anger, distrust and hatred. my faith that good inherently is more powerful than evil, and that righteous love will prevail all self-righteous attempts to smother it only strengthens their resolve that it is indeed the end times; after all. if ""the devil"" can so lure a man, utterly blinding him to the omnipresent discontent of original sin, obviously hell has frozen over and all shit is about to break loose.   it's all and all incredibly sad to witness. hard to watch such cognitive dissonance and omni-loathing (both self and others') in real time and space.   inevitably tempers flare, however. i consider myself a reasonable practicing buddhist, but eventually their insults wear on me, and my patience wears thin. i offhand mention an irrelevant self-righteous value judgement of my own- that i think the entire concept of eternal life is fundamentally solopsistic evil. (by definition, eternal life would require the energy of the entire universe for the rest of time- it is a wish, in essence, of saying, brattily ""i want the rest of the universe to spend the rest of it's attention on _me_,"" violating my sense of self-balance between i and others. ) this is something i feel passionate about, even if it is a bit of my own satori faith which bares no business being repeated in public.   i'm sorry, my goddess; i'm only human after all.   *wham* the discussion hits the floor like a ton of a bricks. dirty stares meet my eyes from across the table. ""honey, i think we need to go,"" the out-of-shape-and-overworked housewife says to her pale, frail husband with snear sharp enough to cut glass. they stare at me indigently for a moment before gathering their things, not even having the pleasantry to say good-bye.   now, were this a one time event, perhaps i could just pass it off as the crossing of two parallel universii. the momentary meeting between two agents of polar opposite ontologies, who fly into one another's sphere for but a moment before the metaverse sends them back to their seperate corners, lest their frail human selves fail to contain the explosive power of their respective subjective matter and antimatter.   but this is not a one time thing. it is a monthly occurrence.   sure enough, like clockwork, friday rolls around four weeks later and the ever frailer husband calls me up, seemingly stricken with amnesia: ""we want to do an evening in the city!"" they say, ""we're coming to see you! we can't wait to see what you've got in store for us tonight (please note, statement of 'fact', not request, and they come regardless of whether or not they inform me or my voicemail of this fact)! thank you for being one of our best friends, we can not tell you how much your friendship means to us. don't worry about last month, our lord assures us that with our continued gorgiveness and grace you will eventually find him.""   i shake my head. i guess no one else can put up with them either. at least, not outside their sad little ideological echo chamber of shame and self-loathing that is their ""church"".   i guess that's why they spend so much time trying to score brown-noser points with their self-righteous, hateful, opinions, and baal-worshiping desire for mass calamity, social unrest and destruction here on craigslist rnr.   it's not like they have any friends, or anything better to do. i'm sorry, my goddess, i cannot hold back:  *",0,,

914233,"in werner keller's ""the bible as history"" (english translation from the original german published by bantam, page 123-125), he quotes breitenbach dean of mainz in an account of his pilgrimage to sinai in 1483:  ""in every valley throughout the whole region of mt. sinai there can still be found bread of heaven, which the monks and the arabs gather, preserve and sell to pilgrims and strangers who pass that way. this same bread of heaven falls about daybreak like dew or hoarfrost and hangs in beads on grass, stones, and twigs. it is sweet like honey and sticks to the teeth. we bought a lot of it.""  in 1823 the german botantist g. ehrenberg published a paper which even his colleagues received with incredulity. his explanation seemed indeed to ask people to believe too much, namely that this notorious manna is nothing more than a secretion exuded by tamarisk trees and bushes when they are pierced by a certain type of plant-louse which is found in sinai.  a hundred years later an organised manna expedition was under way. friedrich simon bodenheimer and oskar theodor, botantical experts from the hebrew university at jerusalem, set out for the sinai peninsula, to clear up the disputed question of the existence of manna once and for all. for several months the two scientists investigated the dry water-courses and oases in the whole area of mt. sinai. their report caused a sensation. they not only brought back the first photographs of manna and fully confirmed the findings of breitenbach and ehrenberg, but also established the factual truth of the biblical description of the desert migration of the people of israel.  without the plant-louse mentioned first by ehrenberg there would in fact be no manna at all. these little insects live primarily off tamarisks which are a type of tree indigenous to sinai. they exude a peculiar resinous secretion, which according to bodenheimer is about the same shape and size as a coriander seed. when it falls to the ground it is white in colour, but after lying for some time it becomes yellowish-brown. naturally the two scientists did not fail to taste the manna. bodenheimer's verdict was: ""the taste off these crystallised grains of manna is peculiarly sweet. it is most of all like honey when it has been left for a long time to solidify."" ""and it was like coriander seed, white: and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey"", says the bible (ex. 16).  the findings of the expedition likewise confirmed the other features of the biblical description of manna. ""and they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted"" (ex. 16). exactly in the same way today the bedouins of the sinai peninsula hasten to gather up their ""mann es-sama"", the ""manna from heaven"", as early as possible in the morning, for the ants are keen competitors. ""they begin gathering when the ground temperature reaches 21 degrees centigrade,"" says the report of the expedition, ""which is about 8:30 a.m. until then the insects are inert."" as soon as the ants become lively, the manna disappears. that must have been what the biblical narrator meant when he said that it melted. the bedouins prudently do not forget to seal the manna they have collected carefully in a pot, otherwise the ants pounce on it. it was just the same in moses' day during the sojourn in the desert: ""but some of them left of it until the morning: and it bred worms..."" (ex. 16).  the incidence of the manna depends on favourable winter rains and is different from year to year. in good years the bedouins of sinai can collect 4 pounds per head in a morning -- a considerable quantity which is quite sufficient to satisfy a grown man. thus moses was able to order the children of israel to ""gather of it every man according to his eating"" (ex. 16).  the bedouins knead the globules of manna into a puree which they consume as a welcome and nourishing addition to their often monotonous diet. manna is indeed an exportable commodity, and if it is carefully preserved, forms an ideal ""iron ration"" since it keeps indefinitely. ""and moses said unto aaron: take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the lord, to be kept for your generations"" (ex. 16).  ""and the children of israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan"" (ex. 16). tamarisks with manna still grow in sinai and along the wadi el-arabah right up to the dead sea.",0,,

  eye definer pen, deeper: if you do eyeliner, often with a flick, and you want to treat yo self, this eyeliner is every bit worth it. there are other eyeliner pens that do a great job too, but i will repurchase this one. you know how when it's eyeliner time it's a gamble. your hands could behave and it could take you one minute to have matching liner on both lids, drawn at a perfect angle, no weird lumpy bits, etc. and other times, you take 10 minutes and end up hating the world, maybe starting over, or maybe just silently telling the world to not look too closely at your wings, and you judge anyone who compliments them because you know that they are shit. this eyeliner drastically reduces the odds of that happening. something about the length of the pen, the weight and balance of it, the silk brush tip, perfect taper, it's pure magic. and on top of that, you have an awesome formula that has no plans on leaving that perfect line you crafted until you say so. through rain. through tears. &lt;3   eye shadow quads: these are seriously beautiful- both the wet/dry formula (as seen in nude dip and honeymoon) and the regular quads. these are my favorites:   - disco dust - nude dip - cocoa mirage- i probably reach for this one everyday. - honeymoon  - golden mink  i'm also a big fan of the duo that just came out- 04 aw16. catchy name.  cream eyeshadows: i have 9 of these. not all are amazing, but there are a few that i would be supremely unhappy to do without.  - platinum- a classic for a reason. - golden peach- one of the cream and powder eye colors. i love the rose gold thing about this. also really beautiful when worn with naked bronze. - naked bronze- one of the cream and powder eye colors. perfect bronze shade. not too much more to say! - sphinx- such a cool, special color and i don't have anything else like it. - opale, midnight purple, burnished copper, and spring 16 are all great, but i just don't reach for them as much.  - night sky- one of the cream and powder eye colors... not good. granted, i don't tend towards dark colors, but the cream base was a bit of a pain the the powder part was not a celestial formula like the others.  shade and illuminate ss16 (white and peach cream duo)- i don't reach for this all too much, however, looking at it now, i'm not sure why. probably because i have hoards of other things. it's nice, but not essential.  skin illuminating powder duo, 01 moonlight- very subtle, grown-up kinda deal. the highlight is, again, very subtle. but i think the deeper shade is where this product wins me over. it's such an interesting bronzer thing. very fine shimmer throughout the rosey bronze shade. i probably reach for this one every week.  cheek color: i really do like this formula. i have 4 of these, although 2 are in the going away pile based purely on the shades (savage, ravish) and that they're not right for my skin tone. however, when i run out of frantic pink, i will buy another. although, that will be in years. i use this blush nearly every day and it's just gorgeous. it's a beautiful everyday blush, it's got something glowy about it although there is no real discernible shimmer. wicked is also a good one- more of a berry color. i like this one worn very lightly as it's very pigmented. it's more of a look than frantic pink though.   summer soleil collection:   - soleil eye and cheek palette, 02 warm (winter 2016)- nom nom nom. if i got to imagine the perfect product, it would be remarkably similar to this. first: my god, that packaging. **heavy breathing* second: everything else. the colors, the formulas, the finishes... that's all. - eye and cheek compact, pink glow (summer 2015)- this is not an everyday for me, but i do genuinely love this (rather large) compact. i occasionally see it floating around on /r/makeupexchange. if you see it, and it's a doable price, i recommend it.  - soleil contouring compact, the afternooner (summer 2016)- eh. it's nice. because 99.99% of the time i'm doing my makeup at home, the convenience of having bronzer, blush, and highlight is somewhat lost on me and there are other shades i prefer on the day-to-day. - cream cheek color, 01 pink sand (summer 2015, summer 2016)- this blush is like peachy, shimmery, bubblegum and i freaking love it. i enjoy the formula as well. i rub two fingers around it, rub those two finger against the same two fingers on the other hand and just dab it on my cheeks and it looks very fresh. - sheer cheek duo, bicoastal (summer 2016)- i do not really reach for this product unless the package catches my eye and i don't want it to feel lonely. nothing about the formula, it's just a little *too* bubblegum and cool for me.  - bronzing powder, 02 terra (summer 2016)- you know. the perfect neutral, medium bronzer. very lightweight formula that's very silky and smooth. applies like a dream. i don't bronze often, but when i do, i tend to reach for terra.  - skin illuminator, firelust (summer 2016)-  peachy, shimmery face illuminator. definitely obvious shimmer bits, but it glides over top of your moisturizer very nicely and makes the foundation on top just a touch brighter. nonessential.  traceless foundation, 01 alabaster: unfortunately a touch too dark for me so i tend to mix it with a lighter foundation so i can't really speak to it on its own.  illuminating primer: i don't know if mine is bad, but it smells bad and that just makes me nervous. actually, i think i got an old one (a risk of mue). i won't say too much here or there because i don't think it's fair of the product to judge it based on an expired one.  skin care:  - radiant moisture souffle (summer soleil 2016): smells not great. it's an odd feeling on the skin, not bad, not great. not sure how to describe it. definitely glowy. some shimmer.  - face protector spf 50 (winter soleil 2016): i've only used this three times since buying it. i don't go outside much. it's a good sunscreen (i assume, we all assume, right?) and it plays very nicely with the makeup i put on top which i suppose is the second most important thing to it actually doing it's job. i like it, doesn't seem quite necessary especially for the small size.   lipstick!  lip color matte:   - 08 velvet cherry: the formula is really great with these matte lipsticks. they're a little heavier than the charlotte tilbury matte revolution formula (which is my favorite). i'd describe it as a brick berry. it goes on evenly and sticks around a good long while.  lip color:   - 10 cherry lush: one of my favorite reds. it's a little on the pinker side, but i find it very fresh and not as serious as some other reds.  - 01 spanish pink: a perfect nude lip for my very pale skin. i liken it to strawberry milk, but it's a little peachier on.  - 07 pink dusk: a little deeper and cooler than spanish pink. not as great on my skin so it's in my to go pile as well.  - 22 forbidden pink: almost forgot about this one because it doesn't leave my purse. it's in my top 5 lipsticks for sure. it requires no thought, no mirrors, nothing. it's the perfect natural coral. it looks just as good on a no makeup day as it does on a more glam day.   lips and boys:  - 25 giacomo: a very fun, shimmery magenta/fuschia.   - 31 luca: very light, shimmery peach. not a good look on its own on me, but makes a good topper. not something i reach for, in the to go pile.  soleil lipsticks (summer 2016):   lip color sheer:  - 09 skinny dip: a lipstick topper i actually reach for, but also a really nice sheer wash of something.   - 07 paradiso: bright, slightly warm magenta. i like this a lot, although i haven't worn it since it was warmer because i tend to associate this shade with warmer weather but that's just me! also, it's not as sheer as skinny dip. maybe medium coverage?  ultra rich lip color:  - 03 le mepris: this is like an electric coral. not neon, but electric. again, more of a warm-weather shade for me.   - 04 aphrodite: even bluer, louder, and more vibrant than giacomo. this is a statement lip.  moisturecore lip color:  - 06 caracaou: this is what i reach for when i look to wear a nude lip. it's got some life in it, it's not chalky or weirdly milky, and it's really quite comfortable. does require reapplication relatively frequently, but i personally don't care.  - 05 pipa: ............ almost no words. pipa lives in my purse always. pipa is a lady. i reach for her all the damn time. i have never finished a lipstick before. i've been close. but i finished a pipa. but, all is not lost because i fell in love so quickly, i bought two back ups. that's right. three pipas. and guess what. i'll probably buy more. radiant, shimmery, glowy, coral perfection.    brushes - 02 foundation brush: i'll be honest. i use my fingers 85% of the time to apply my foundation. 14% of the time, beauty blender. 1% is with a brush, and it's this brush. i use this more for a subtle contour than anything else, but truly a non-essential.  - 05 bronzer brush: hot damn. this was my first tom ford purchase, i think. it's a giant, super soft, super fluffy magic brush. lovely with bronzers, appropriately, and also with all-over powders (like the hourglass ambient lighting powders). love it.  - 06 cheek brush: this is a great blush brush. it pairs really well with the tom ford cheek colors as well as any really pigmented blushes. i do a dab of the brush into the product and then i blend, blend, blend. beautiful!  - 11 eye shadow brush: perfect all-over lid color brush.  - 13 crease brush: 97,489 steps above a mac 217.",0,,

658443,"bronwyn standing pale and tall in the nervous light that shimmered through a vibrating canopy of green leaves. the shifting bands of milky light and emerald shadow made her seem luminous, translucent, as though she were a tallow candle glowing beneath its own flame. like a porcelain lantern. like a curtain fluttering in a window at dawn. like a ghost that came and went with the twilight and darkness, that first veiled and then revealed.  her hair had the sheen of the sea beneath an eclipsed moon. it was the color of a leopard's tongue, of oiled mahogany. it was terra cotta, bay and chestnut. her hair was a helmet, a hood, the cowl of the monk, magician or cobra.  her face had the fragrance of a gibbous moon. the scent of fresh snow. her eyes were dark birds in fresh snow. they were the birds' shadows, they were mirrors; they were the legends on old charts. they were antique armor and the tears of dragons. her brows were a raptor's sharp, anxious wings. they were a pair of scythes. her ears were a puzzle carved in ivory. her teeth were her only bracelet; she carried them within the red velvet purse of her lips. her tongue was amber. her tongue was a ferret, an anemone, a fox caught in the teeth of a tiger.  her shoulders were the clay in a potter's kiln. her shoulders were fieldstones; they were the white, square stones of which walls are made. they were windows covered with steam. they were porcelain. they were opal and moonstone. her neck was the foam that curls from the prow of a ship, it was a sheaf of alfalfa or barley, it was the lonely dance of the pearl-grey shark.  her legs were quills. they were bundles of wicker, they were candelabra; the muscles were summer lightning, that flickered like a passing thought; they were captured eels or a cable on a windlass. her thighs were geese, pythons, schooners. they were cypress or banyan; her thighs were a forge, they were shears; her thighs were sandstone, they were the sandstone buttresses of a cathedral, they were silk or cobwebs. her calves were sweet with the sap of elders, her feet were bleached bones, her feet were driftwood. her feet were springs, marmosets or locusts; her toes were snails, they were snails with shells of tears.  her arms were a corral, a fence, an enclosure; they were pennants; they were highways. her fingers were incense. they were silver fish in clear water; they were the speed of the fish, they were the fish's wake. they were semaphores; they were meteors.  her spine was a snake. it was the track of a snake. it was the groove the water snake makes in the glossy mud of the riverbank. her spine was a viper, an anaconda. it was the strength of the anaconda. it was the anaconda's unknown hieroglyphic. her spine was a ladder, a rod; it was a chain, a canal, it was a caravan. her buttocks were fresh-baked loaves; they were ivory eggs, they were the eggs of the lonely phoenix. they were a fist.  her breasts were citrus, they were soapstone; they were bright cumulus and the smooth fingertips of musrum. her breasts were honeycombs and dew-beaded windows, or soft, sweet cheese. they were sweet apples; they were glass, they were cowries. they were the twin moons of the earth. the nipples rose like mecury with her heat. they rose like monuments atop flowered hills, above deserts of hot sand; the nipples were savory morsels, with the flavor of the forest.  her ribs were a niche, an alcove, an apse; her stomach was an idol in the niche, alcove or apse, an effigy, a phantom. her stomach was a beach, a savannah, a flagstone warmed by the sun, a cat asleep on the flagstone, a bleached canvas sail in hot southern winds. her navel winked like a doll's eye, like the eye of a whale, like the drowsy cat.  her pubes was a field of wheat after the harvest, a field neatly furrowed; it was a nest, a pomegranate, an arrowhead, a rune. it was a shadow. it was moss on a smooth white stone. there was an orchid within the moss. there was a drop of dew upon the orchid. it had the breath of moss-beds, of the deep seas, of the abyss, of scrimshaw and blue glass, of cold iron; she had the sex of rain forests, the ibis and the scarab; she had the sex of mirrors and candles, of the hot, careful winds that stroke the veldt, the winds that taste of clay and seed and blood; the winds that dreamed of tawny, lean animals.  —  *bronwyn: silk &amp; steel* by ron miller",1,2,

750994,"sounds like great attitudes going in. as long as you are aware of purchasing power and the insidious effects of inflation, and you seem to be, i think you'll be fine. your bank and stock brokerage statements might say you have $100,000 in an inflationary environment, but if inflation is bad enough it can be as good as -0-. that's one kind of situation where the gold can help you, if a free market in precious metals still exists to trade in your precious metals for inflated currency to buy everyday goods at inflated prices.  make sure your plans are practical. research how people who held gold before economic incidents flared up fared during currency crises or extreme inflation. if you don't know where to start, look at zimbabwe today.  i'm dubious about a safe that light. a thief sees a safe as a giant flashing light that says, ""steal me please! valuable stuff inside!"", and will expend at least a modicum of effort to move it. if two brawny guys can lift it, i would generally consider it too light to stand by itself. the primary protection of a safe that light would be a concealed location as you are investigating. you could look into sinking very, very large bolts into concrete or wood foundations. many mini-fridge size and up safes have 2-4 tiny holes in their bottom to let you bolt the safe into the floor. you might want to ask a trusted locksmith to help you site the safe, locate the bolting locations, and use the correct bolts. you don't want to return home from a vacation to find someone took a chainsaw to the parquet floor to pry away the safe. when you move, try to patch it up or let the landlord dock your security deposit for a mysterious, small and deep hole in the floor.  keep in mind that only a very, very small fraction of the population is even thinking along these lines, much less taking action. another reason to keep quiet about what you are doing is because when (not if) we start hitting severe economic turbulence, people who planned for it and don't appear to be suffering along with everyone else will become wildy unpopular.",0,,

242570,"**part 2:** dean's nose bounced off the pages of *the great provider's articles of the meg virtuous citizen* each time we hit a pothole. his eyes stared blankly at the ruined paper. i haven't heard the flick of a page since the beginning of the car ride. i look in to the rear view mirror; no one is following me except the morning sun. an hour ago, i would have bet against any comparable sight. the last checkpoints of the city are the hardest to pass. thankfully, the travel papers were handled by them, as long as i made sure dean was going to accompany me. ""how far until the old mine sight, citizen fairview?"" grumbled dean. ""we have been driving meglong and i am due back at city-fac by midsun. i nod, muscle out a ""not long"", and turn right onto the dead grass toward a clearing. dean is startled by the sudden change and starts to question the validity of our official destination. if i look at him, he will see right through me. i stare ahead until i see something in the distance. it soon becomes apparent that it's an ancient barn colored a muted straw-yellow.  that's our stop. i honk three times after parking inside, just as advised. dead grass covers the interior of the barn. suddenly, dirt and foliage fly out into the air on my left, revealing a dark hole. a familiar smile pokes out from underground.  _  ""sparrow? is that you?!""  he laughs innocently and speeds to open my door. i would have jumped at him had my provi-belt not been on! ""fairview! welcome to your new life!"" he cried. i thought he died five years ago, but i remember that the lies of the past are plenty. ""come with me to become one of us"" whispered sparrow into my ear. he grabbed my hand as he motioned toward the hole. i'm ready"", i said nervously. i grip the ladder and start my decent quickly. two empty car seats fade from view as i drop deeper.  _  all the stories sparrow ever told to me about this place were coming true before my eyes! a long golden hallway shimmers like the stars, congratulating me as my feet land on the crystal tile. two rows of grinning men, dressed in yellow gowns cover the length of the walls. banners drape alongside with them, each displaying a large red sun.  ""do you wish to proceed"" asks the wide eyed sparrow. immediately after nodding, the golden sea of men parts to reveal a walkway.  ""may your first steps in the sun be as bright as your last"" whispers sparrow. he disappears into the blinding mass.  _  each face of the rows project the same loving expression; a pair of friendly eyes and a shining grin. i haven't ever seen one man this happy in all my days, much less 1,000! welcomes are directed at each turn as i march toward a distant red shape at the end of the hall. the men at my front point me toward it with pride. as i close in, i begin to tell that it's a crimson double sided steel door.   _  the last two yellow men swing their doors open and greet me in. once past i see a grand cavern, with what must have been the most megsized roof in rockwellia. rows of yellow provi-sits lead up to an 8 ft tall mirrored rectangle. a tall limestone tower protrudes up behind the mirrorcube, dwarfing all below it. i spot a golden blur on the edge atop the tower. my neck aims up in awe. scores of voices behind me chant one word as i finally am in reach of the massive rock. a thousand as one command: **climb!**  my once weary arms are rejuvenated with a powerful warmth. the past few years of war and horrible suffering melt away with each inch toward the peak. a boiling sensation surges through my body as i grapple upwards; but they are far frostier than working for years in slavery around the steaming iron. the golden glow above me sends shivers of hope with each ray. i disappear into the welcoming sea of gold with a full heart.   _  soft fibers comfort me back into the cavern. the yellow cushion of the provi-sit meld beneath my arms and body pleasantly. the megsized limestone column stands at helm just as before. i arch my neck backward to notice 1000 gowned yellow men sitting in rows behind me at my left and right, all looking up. i do the same . at the edge of the limestone sits a pale young woman upon a throne. *her* throne. her beauty sparkles along with the playful wave of a crimson silk gown. a soft angelic voice echos at height.   ""my golden brothers, my followers of light, my truth searchers! the darkness has been cut down once again, for another has joined our glorious cosmic cause!  **""let the beam grow wider!""** chants the golden mass.  she responds with only a girl-like giggle. it fills my skull with the sweetest memories i've never had before. all start to laugh with her, so i partake as well. the lovely sounds of brotherhood cease with the upward thrust of her pale bony arm, leaving only silence.   ""our new beam brought a gift to the voiced sister and to the golden brotherhood. the messengers are pleased!""  i scoot to the edge of my yellow provi-sit, listening with fervor.   *what must i have given?*  ""this gift is imperative for our final step toward their light. brothers, tell me how do i know?""  ***the messengers speak only to the voiced sister!***  ""very glorious, my brothers. i know it's easier to only think of your voiced sister, your golden brothers, and the beam; you must however, dwell upon the time of the lord of lies. dwell upon the millions of bullets he filled your comrades with. dwell upon the rivers of truth-seeker blood that stained the world crimson. dwell upon how he tried to take away the golden vision once it shined the messenger's glow.""  angry voices curse out from the masses. i join them, venom spewing from my purified lips.  ""*we* saw it. *we* protected it. *we* fought back against the darkness with validated hatred from above. they have watched our struggle with love in their hearts. salvation is here, my cosmic warriors. first, we *must* give our 10,000th offering, our **final** offering. bring out the gift!""   venomous howls of hatred screech at my back by the crimson double sided door. i stand to see a black figure being carried by the strength of the golden masses. it's tossed violently between the crowd, yet it steadily makes ground towards me. as it closes in, i see two white eyes shine from the blackness. in a moment, they meet my own.   ""brothers, follow our new beam's light!"" caws the outstretched voiced sister atop her peak.  one scream distances itself from the calls of blood as the figure becomes in arms reach of mine.  **""fairview, the great provider will end all that oppose him! fairview!?!""** it helplessly squeals.    the golden horde place it inside the mirrored cage, locking the chains. it's blackened body slumps down like a sack of rocks just as the masses release him. motionless and defeated, it's eyes still bat toward me through a hole in the cube.  _   a soft voice calls upon me from on high.  ""brother, send us into the eternal cosmic void. offer your gift to be eternal with the light!"" howls the voiced sister. a matchbook glides off the peak into my hands. the masses cry for salvation as i am pushed within inches of the cage. i strike the match to the sound of cheers. a black hand reaches out of its prison through a small slit, with fat fingers pointing toward me. i can see it's eyes wide with terror through the crack, glaring ahead. the light of the messenger's warm me with love as i let the match slip inside.  _  orange, red, and golden beams stream out of the cube in all directions, blinding each of my brothers faces with glee. the voices of a thousand cry with joy as one. i embrace my tear filled golden brothers, as we all feel the messenger's promise dawning. we look up to see the roof of the cavern rumbling with great force, knocking pebbles down from on high.    salvation.",0,,

981334,"my advice: stay with your uncle in the monastery. a change of scenery or a new experience releases dopamine into your system. those new experiences can combat depression. try to see things from different perspectives and don't take the things around you for granted. even the smallest change in perspective can have a huge impact.  you can probably get your student loans deferred while your at the monastery. with those deferred and no rent/utilities/cable bills, you shouldn't have to worry much about money. every day that passes by is another day that you will not live again.  you must do what you want to do in your life. the trick is to finding a way to make enough money so you can do those things, but through a means that brings some satisfaction to you.",0,,
592627,"i am no pro with mf but i love that champion. i played her in season 6 and fell in love. season 7 is awesome with her because of lethality (which is the build i used in season 6).   the lethality build that i use depends on my team and on their team. what i mean by that is, one of the first items that you usually take with mf adc is ghostblade, for a few reasons... first it has an early little power spike, especially with the active. also, because of the active it gives you a little boost to get out of sticky situations (especially since mf has been in the spotlight lately, junglers love to shut down an mf).   but, like i said earlier it depends on your team and the enemy team. ask your self these questions? are you a team of mostly/ or all ad? if so you could benefit from an early black cleaver. it also provides health against enemy mages. also, you have my favorite early item, edge of night. edge of night provides a little mr, and the best active of any item in the game, next to botrk (in my opinion). edge of night active allows you to ignore the first ability that hits you.  in season 6 i had to be perfectly careful with my mf ults, because 1 form of cc and then you are done. with edge of night it takes 1 ability and 1 form of cc to knock you out of your ult. believe me that extra shield makes all the difference with an mf ult.   tldr -  edge of night is good early if they have cc and ap damage  ghostblade is good for early power spike and escape  black cleaver is good for ad team comp, cdr, health for ap damage  mortal reminder is good for %based armor pen and also if they have healing *botrk, hydra, bt, vlad, mundo, and raka, any type of healing  in most of my games i have these 4 items as mf. boots are a must but going into very late games i sell them for a deaths dance or something.   i went up against a essence reaver build mf with my lethality build, trades i won, my ult i won.. and damage to champs at the end of the game, i won.   nuff said",0,,

675238,"that summer of 1971 was a more innocent time. i learned most of the sex i knew from those little eight pager cartoon booklets of comic-page characters going at it. young men read them in the privacy of an outside john, played with themselves, by themselves and didn't brag about it. sometimes, we got off with a trusted friend and helped each other out.  under the greenhouse glass, the temperature some times climbed over the hundred degree mark. i had worked stripped to the waist since april and was as browwn as a berry. on only his second day on the job and in the middle of august, ike wore old fashioned overalls. those and socks in his hightop work shoes was every stitch he wore. when he bent forward, the bib front billowed out and i could see the white curly hairs on his chest and belly.  ""me? i just love to eat pussy!"" ike licked his lips from corner to corner then stuck it out far enough that the tip could touch the tip of his nose. he said, a man's not a man till he knows first hand, the flavor of a lady's pussy.""  ""people do that?""  he winked. ""of course the taste of a hard cock ain't to be sneezed at neither. now you answer me, yes or no. does a man's cock taste salty or not?""  ""i never. . .""  ""well, old ike's willing to let you find out.""  ""no way.""  ""just teasing,"" said ike. ""but don't give me no sass or i'll show you my ass."" he winked. might show it to you anyway, if you was to ask.""  ""why would i do that?""  ""curiousity, maybe. i'm guessing you never had a good piece of man ass.""  ""i'm no queer.""  ""now don't be getting judgemental. enjoying what's at hand ain't beiing queer. it's taking pleasure where you find it with anybody willing."" ike slipped a handside the side slit of his overalls and i could tell he was fondling and straightening out his cock. now i admit i got me a hole that satisfied a few guys.""  i swallowed, hard.  ike winked. ""care to be asshole buddies?""  ***  we worked steadily until noon. ike drew a worn pocket watch from the bib pocket of his loose overalls and croaked, ""bean time. but first its time to reel out our limber hoses and make with the golden arches before lunch.""  i followed ike to the end of the greenhouse where he stopped at the outside wall of the potting shed. he opened his fly, fished inside, and finger-hooked a soft white penis with a pouting foreskin puckered half an inch past the hidden head.  ""yes sir,"" breathed ike, ""this old peter needs some draining."" he exhaled a sigh as a strong, yellow stream splattered against the boards and ran down to soak into the earthen floor.  he caught me looking down at him. he winked. ""like what you're viewing, boy?""  i looked away.  ""you taking a serious interest in old ike's pecker?""  i shook my head.  ""well you just haul out yourn and let old ike return the compliment.""  feeling trapped and really having to go, i fumbled at my fly, turned away slightly, withdrew my penis and strained to start.  ""take your time boy. let it all hang out. old ike's the first to admit that he likes looking at another man's pecker."" he flicked away the last drop of urine and shook his limp penis vigorously.  i tried not to look interested.  ""yer sir, this old peepee feels so good out, i just might leave it out."" he turned to give me a better view.  ""what if somebody walks in?""  ike shrugged. he looked at my strong yellow stream beating against the boards and moved a step closer. ""you got a nice one,boy.""  i glanccd over at him. his cock was definitely larger and beginning to stick straight out. i nodded toward his crotch. ""don't you think you should put that away?""  ""i got me strictly a parlor prick,"" said ike. ""barely measures six inches."" he grinned. ""of course it's big enough around to make a mouthful."" he ran a thumb and forefinger along its length and drawing his foreskin back enough to expose the tip of the pink head. ""yersiree."" he grinned, revealing nicotine stained teeth. ""it sure feels good, letting the old boy breathe.""  i knew i should button up and move away. i watched his fingers moving up and down the thickening column.  ""you like checking out this old man's cock?""  i nodded. in spite of myself, my cock began to swell.  ""maybe we should have ourselves a little pecker pulling party."" ike slid his fingers back and forth on his expandingshaft and winked. ""i may be old but i'm not against doing some little pud pulling with a friend.""  i shook my head.  ""maybe i'll give my balls some air. would you like a viewing of old ike's hairy balls?""  i swallowed hard and moistened my dry lips.  he opened another button on his fly and pulled out his scrotum. ""good god, it feels good to set 'em free. now let's see yours.""  ""why?""  ""just to show you're neighborly,"" said ike.  ""i don't think so."" i buttoned up and moved into the potting shed.  ike followed, his cock and balls protruding from the front of his overalls. ""overlook my informality."" ike grinned. ""as you can see i ain't bashful.""  i nodded and took my sandwich from the brown paper bag.  ""yessir,"" said ike. ""i just might have to have myself an old fashioned peter pulling all by my lonesome. he unhooked a shoulder strap and let his overalls drop around his ankles.  i took a bite of my sandwich but my eyes remained on ike.  ""yessiree,"" said ike, ""i got a good one if i do say so myself. gets nearly as hard as when i was eighteen. you know why?""  i shook my head.  ""cause i keep excerising him. when i was younger i was pulling on it three time a day. still like to do him every day i can.""  ""some sayyou'll go blind if you do that too much.""  ""bull-loney!"" don't you believe that shit. i been puling my pud for close to fifty years and i didn't start till i was fifteen.""  i laughed.  ""you laughing at my little peter, boy?""  ""your hat."" i pointed to the soiled, brown fedora cocked on his head. that and his overalls draped about his ankles were his only items of apparel. in between was a chest full of gray curly hair, two hairy legs. smack between them stood an erect, pale white cock with a tip of foreskin still hiding the head.  ""i am one hairy s.o.b.,"" said ike.  ""i laughed at you wearing nothing but a hat.""  ""covers up my bald spot,"" said ike. ""i got more hair on my ass than i got on my head. want to see?""  ""your head?""  ""no, boy, my hairy ass and around my tight, brown asshole."" he turned, reached back with both hands and parted his ass cheeks to reveal the small, puckered opening. ""there it is, boy, the entrance lots of good feelings. tell me, boy, how would you like to put it up old ike's ass?""  ""i don't think so.""  ""that'd be the best damned piece you ever got.""  ""we shouldn't be talking like this.""  ""c'mon now, confess, don't this make your cock perk up a little bit?""  ""i reckon,"" i confessed.  ""you ever seen an old man's hard cock before,"" asked ike.  ""my grandpa's when i was twelve or thirteen.""  ""how'd that come about?""  he was out in the barn and didn't know i was around. he dropped his pants. it was real big he did things to it. he saw me and he turned around real fast but i saw it.""  ""what did your grandpa do?""  ""he said i shouldn't be watching him doing that. he said something like grandma ôwouldn't give him some,' that morning and that i should get out of there and leave a poor man in peace to do what he had to do.""  ""did you want to join him.""  ""i might have if he'd asked. he didn't.""  ""i like showing off my cock,"" said ike. ""a hard-on is somethng i always been proud of. a hard-on proves a man's a man. makes me feel like a man that can do things."" he looked up at me and winked. ""you getting a hard-on fromall this talk, son?""  i nodded and looked away.  ""then maybe you should pull it out and show old ike what you got.""  ""we shouldn't.""  ""hey. a man's not a man till he jacked off with a buddy.""  i wanted to but i was as nervous as hell.  ike grinned and fingered his pecker. ""c'mon, boy, between friends, a little cock showing is perfectly fine. lets see what you got in the cock and balls department.""  in spite of my reluctance, i felt the stirring in my crotch. i had curiositythat needed satisfying. it had been a long, long time since i had walked in on my grandfather .  ""c'mon let's see it all.""  i shook my head.  ""you can join the party anytime, said ike. ""just drop your pants and pump away.""  i had the urge. there was a tingling in my crotch. my cock was definitely willing and i had a terrible need to ajust myself down there. but my timidity and the strangeness of it all held me back.  hope you don't mind if i play out this hand."" i ke grinned. ""it feels like i got a winner.""  i stared at his gnarled hand sliding up and down that pale, white column and i could not look away. i wet my lips and shook my head.  old ike's about to spout a geyser."" ike breathed harder as he winked. ""now if i just had a long finger up my ass. you interested, boy?""  i shook my head.  the first, translucent, white glob crested the top of his cock and and arced to the dirt floor. ike held his cock at the base with thumb and forefinger and tightened noticably with each throb of ejaculation until he was finished.  i could not believe any man could do what he had done in front of another human being.  ike sighed with pleasure and licked his fingers. ""a man ain't a man till he's tasted his own juices.""  he squatted, turned on the faucet and picked up the connected hose. he directed the water between his legs and on to his still dripping prick and milked the few remaing drops of white, sticky stuff into the puddle foming at his feet. ""cool water sure feels good on a cock that just shot its wad,"" said ike.  ***  ""cock-tale telling time,"" said old ike. it was the next day and he rubbed the front of his dirty,worn overalls where his bulge made the fly expand as his fingers smoothed the denim around the outline of his expanding cock.  i wasn't sure what he had in mind but i knew it wasn't something my straight-laced grandma would approve of.",0,,
911101,"**winter**  winter is a cool tone. people with winter complexions have blue or pink/rosy undertones. skin can be pale and porcelain white, yellowish-olive, or dark. winters are generally brunettes with deeply colored eyes. many asians and african americans fall into this category. natural white-blondes may also be winters.  best colors for winter  those with the winter color profile have a lot of depth to their coloring and a lot of contrast between their hair color, eye color and skin tone. winters should wear hues that are sharp, stark and clear. you will look best in intense, rich colors, like black, navy blue, red, and hot pink. these powerful shades will compliment your coloring. for lighter colors, wear bright white or icy pastels, such as like cool blues, pinks and yellows.  worst colors for winter  avoid dressing in earthy tones and subdued colors like beige, orange and gold. they will make you look faded and ashen.  **summer**  summer is also a cool tone and like winter complexions, the summers among us have blue or pink undertones. skin is very pale and pink. summer coloring usually occurs in natural blondes, and even pale-skinned brunettes with pale eyes. if you’re a trying to discriminate between winter and summer, winters are usually brunettes and summers are mostly natural blondes.  best colors for summer  summers have a low level of contrast between their hair, eye color and skin tone. for you to look your best, choose soft neutrals and pastels, as well as muted colors with cool undertones. powder blue, dusty pink, mauve, lavender, plum, and pale yellow are all great color choices.  worst colors for summer  avoid intense, vivid hues because they will look harsh and drown you out. nor should you wear earth tones. stay away from black and orange.  **autumn**  autumn is a warm tone and people with this complexion have golden undertones in their skin, like a pale peach, golden beige or golden brown. many redheads and brunettes with golden brown eyes fall into this category. however, golden blonde and black hair coloring can also fall into this range.  best colors for autumn  you have a lot of depth to your coloring and skin tone. rich golden, spicy, and earthy colors will accent your complexion. therefore, look for a warm undertone when selecting a color. you can wear both muted and rich warm colors that are seen in autumn leaves and spice colors, such as camel, beige, olive, orange, gold, and dark brown. you will also look great in a rich warm grey.  worst colors for autumn  stay away from clear, bright colors and black and white, which will make your look tired and faded. also steer clear of pastels and blue tones, which will look cold against your complexion and give you a pale appearance.  **spring**  spring is also a warm tone. people of this complexion have subtle golden undertones and are usually creamy white or peach. springs have extremely light, ivory skin color. people of this coloring are usually natural golden blondes, auburn, or strawberry blond redheads. springs also have very clear, light blue and green colored eyes. freckles and rosy cheeks are also characteristics of this group.  if you can’t decide weather you are an autumn or a spring, springs tend to have pale eyes while autumns have dark eyes.  best colors for spring  springs can wear very pale, soft colors, such as peach, camel, golden yellow, golden brown, and aqua. you will also look fabulous in ivory, bright greens, true reds, clear blues and coral.  your colors may be particularly hard to find because they can never be too muted or too dark.  worst colors for spring  avoid black and white, which are too contrasting for you. also stay away from dark, dull colors.",1,0,0

his story was embellished, and on saturday evening his publisher canceled the release of the book.   and once again a new york publisher and oprah winfrey were among those fooled by a too-good-to-be-true story.  this time, it was the tale of herman rosenblat, who said he first met his wife while he was a child imprisoned in a nazi concentration camp and she, disguised as a christian farm girl, tossed apples over the camp’s fence to him. he said they met again on a blind date 12 years after the end of war in coney island and married. the couple celebrated their 50th anniversary this year.  ms. winfrey, who hosted mr. rosenblat and his wife, roma radzicki rosenblat, on her show twice, called their romance “the single greatest love story” she had encountered in her 22 years on the show. on saturday night, after learning from mr. rosenblat’s agent that the author had confessed that the story was fabricated, berkley books, a unit of penguin group that was planning to publish “angel at the fence,” mr. rosenblat’s memoir of surviving in a sub-camp of buchenwald with the help of his future wife, canceled the book and demanded that mr. rosenblat return his advance.  harris salomon, who is producing a movie based on the story, said he would go ahead with the film, but as a work of fiction, adding that mr. rosenblat had agreed to donate all earnings from the film to holocaust survivor charities.  berkley’s decision came in the same year that another unit of penguin, riverhead books, was duped by margaret seltzer, the author of “love and consequences,” her fabricated gang memoir about her life as a white girl taken into an african-american foster home in south central los angeles. she had in fact been raised by her biological family in a well-to-do section of the san fernando valley. it also followed the revelations, nearly three years ago, that james frey, the oprah winfrey-annointed author “a million little pieces,” had exaggerated details of his memoir of drug addiction.   this latest literary hoax is likely to trigger yet more questions as to why the publishing industry has such a poor track record of fact-checking.   in the latest instance, no one at berkley questioned the central truth of mr. rosenblat’s story until last week, said andrea hurst, his agent. neither leslie gelbman, president and publisher of berkley, nor natalee rosenstein, mr. rosenblat’s editor at berkley, returned calls or e-mail messages seeking comment. craig burke, director of publicity for berkley, declined to elaborate beyond the company’s brief statement announcing the cancellation of the book. in an e-mail message, a spokesman for ms. winfrey also declined to comment.   after several scholars and family members attacked mr. rosenblat’s story in articles last week in the new republic, mr. rosenblat confessed on saturday to ms. hurst and mr. salomon that he had concocted the core of his tale. ms. hurst said that in an emotional telephone call with herself and mr. salomon, mr. rosenblat said his wife had never tossed him apples over the fence.  in a statement released through his agent, mr. rosenblat wrote that he had once been shot during a robbery and that while he was recovering in the hospital, “my mother came to me in a dream and said that i must tell my story so that my grandchildren would know of our survival from the holocaust.”  he said that after the incident he began to write. “i wanted to bring happiness to people, to remind them not to hate, but to love and tolerate all people,” he wrote in the statement. “i brought good feelings to a lot of people and i brought hope to many. my motivation was to make good in this world. in my dreams, roma will always throw me an apple, but i now know it is only a dream.”  according to ms. hurst, who represents other inspirational writers including bernie siegel, author of “love, medicine &amp; miracles,” mr. rosenblat first concocted his story in the mid 1990s as an entry to a newspaper contest soliciting the “best love stories.” in 1996, he appeared on ms. winfrey’s show with his wife and repeated the fabricated story. from there, it snowballed, with versions appearing in magazines, a volume of the “chicken soup for the soul” series, and a children’s book, “angel girl,” by laurie friedman, released in september by an imprint of lerner publishing. mr. and mrs. rosenblat, who now live in north miami beach, appeared on cbs’s “early show” in october.  as media coverage of mr. rosenblat’s story spread, scholars and others began to question the veracity of the romance throughout the blogosphere, pointing out that, among other things, the layout of the camp would have prevented the pair from meeting at a fence.  in a telephone interview in november, mr. rosenblat defended his story against such doubts. he said that his section of schlieben, a sub-camp of buchenwald, was not well guarded and that he could stand between a barracks and the six-to-eight-foot fence out of sight of guards. roma was able to approach him because there were woods that would have concealed her.   in recounting the stunning “reunion” with ms. radzicki 12 years later as survivors living in new york, mr. rosenblat said ms. radzicki told him she had saved a boy by hurling apples over a fence to him.   “did he have rags on his feet instead of shoes?” mr. rosenblat said he asked her.  she said yes and he told her, “that boy was me.”  in a telephone interview sunday, ms. hurst, who sold the book to berkley for less than $50,000, said she always believed the essential truth of mr. rosenblat’s tale until last week. “i believed the teller,” ms. hurst said. “he was in so many magazines and books and on ‘oprah.’ it did not seem like it would not be true.” on sunday, ms. hurst said that she was reviewing her legal options because “i’ve yet to see what kind of repercussions could come from this, and i was lied to.”  ms. hurst said that mr. rosenblat did provide some documentation, including a 1946 letter from a warden with the jewish children’s community committee for the care of children from the camps that said mr. rosenblat had attended a technical school in london. evidence of an organization with that name did not appear in internet searches on sunday.   susanna margolis, a new york-based ghost writer who polished mr. rosenblat’s manuscript, said she was surprised by his description of his first blind date with ms. radzicki. “i thought that was far-fetched.” she said. “but if somebody comes to you, as an agent and a publisher, and says, ‘this is my story,’ how do you check it other than to say, ‘did this happen?’ ”   that so many would get taken in by mr. rosenblat’s inauthentic love story seems incredible given the number of fake memoirs that have come to light in the last few years. the holocaust in particular has been fertile territory for fabricated personal histories: earlier this year, misha defonseca confessed that her memoir, “misha: a mémoire of the holocaust years,” about her childhood spent running from the nazis and living with wolves, was not true.   a decade ago, a swiss historian debunked binjamin wilkomirski’s 1996 memoir, “fragments,” which described how he survived as a latvian jewish orphan in a nazi concentration camp. it turns out the book was written by bruno doessekker, a swiss man who spent the war in relative comfort in switzerland. mr. rosenblat, at least, appears to have told the truth about being a prisoner in the nazi concentration camps.   the primary sleuth in unmasking his fabrication of the apple story was kenneth waltzer, director of jewish studies at michigan state university. he has been working on a book on how 904 boys — including the nobel peace prize winner elie wiesel — were saved from death by an underground rescue operation inside buchenwald, and has interviewed hundreds of survivors, including boys from the ghetto at piotrkow in poland who were taken with the young herman rosenblat to the camp.   when dr. waltzer asked other survivors who were with mr. rosenblat about the tossed apple story, they said the story couldn’t possibly be true.   in his research of maps drawn by ex-prisoners, dr. waltzer learned that the section of schlieben where mr. rosenblat was housed had fences facing other sections of the camp and only one fence — on the south — facing the outside world. that fence was adjacent to the camp’s ss barracks and the ss men there would have been able to spot a boy regularly speaking to a girl on the other side of the fence, dr. waltzer said. moreover, the fence was electrified and civilians outside the camp were forbidden to walk along the road that bordered the fence.   dr. waltzer also learned from online documentation that ms. radzicki, her parents and two sisters were hidden as christians at a farm not outside schlieben but 210 miles away near breslau.   holocaust survivors and scholars are fiercely on guard against any fabrication of memories because they taint the truth of the holocaust and raise doubts about the millions who were killed or brutalized.   “there’s no need to embellish, no need to aggrandize,” said deborah e. lipstadt, the dorot professor of modern jewish and holocaust studies at emory university. “the facts are horrible, and when you’re teaching about horrible stuff you just have to lay out the facts.”",0,,
108111,"i posted this story on the amish school story… since the girl in the blue and white dress at the end, reminded me of the beautiful amish girls i saw voting at the schoolhouse, or one like it, on a recent pbs story…   i am lying in bed when i hear a voice calling my name, …martin  i don't answer. again i hear my name called and again i don't answer, he calls my name again…  i say, …who that,  he says, …god. next night i am lying in bed the same voice as the previous night calls, …martin.  i say, …you said you were god,  he says, …i am.  i say, …you're god,   he says, …yes.  i say, …you are actually god,  he says, …yes.  i say, …i hear voices all the time, they are not god,  he says, …no they're not,  i say, …but you are,  he says, …yes. he went on to tell me in 1965 that he had chosen me as his messenger.  i form an image in my mind of a beach not far from home in adelaide south australia, part of a large sweeping bay of white sand beaches. i ask him if he can see the beach, he says he can. i ask if he knows how many grains of sand there are, he tells me he does, then i tell him that if he told me a number i would be unable to verify it anyway, he agrees. i pick up a handful of sand and tell him that i have the same problem, of being unable to check. i tell him not to look and separate three grains, and holding them between thumb and forefinger ask, …how many,  he says, …three, i tell him ok i believe that he is god.   i ask him if he knows everything, he said he does, i say, …if there was something that you did not know, you would not know you did not know it, so you should not say that you know everything, he says he knows that too,  i say, …you know that there is nothing you do not know,  he says, …yes,  i say, ...sure.  he asks me if i wanted to know anything, i ask if there is a hell, he said there is, then asks if there was anything at all that he could do for me, i tell him i would like a guided tour of hell please. he said, …are you right.  i say, …are we going right away, he said we were.  it was dark, like it was night time and i was in bed, from where his voice was coming there just seemed to be a mist of grainy gold light. he went before me as it were, and the wall of the house just seemed to be gone and my spirit body, astral body if you like, just followed his light, for a moment i saw the outside of the house illuminated in the rain by a street light then we were aloft into the clouds and total blackness. the sensation of motion persisted, my thoughts were that here was i on a mission with god, just he and i, …that sensation persists as well, i thought about playing football and was unhappy that my father would not play with me.   presently, maybe forty seconds or so i could see a light, i said to god, …i can see a light. he said, …that's where we are going, …and i want to see a good landing. we lost altitude and the light resolved into the figure of a man, picture the great athlete from the world of pro wrestling in the 1980's, king kong bundy, that's what this guy looked like. he wore a full length gown of some brown material over a white full length smock affair. allah said, …this is philemon he will be your guide. philemon is the warden of hell, i stood still while he received his instructions facing the light. he is a big guy and a pale phosphorescent light shone from his person, he nodded a couple of times and spoke.  the golden light of allah faded and the big guy turned to me, we appeared to be standing in the pool of his light on a vast stone plain, bare rock and blackness beyond. he said, …when you came here you just came through the air right, i said …yes that i had, he said, …this is just the same, watch, and he just walks out off of a precipice into a vast abyss, he is hanging there in mid air and says, …come on out. out i go, and standing beside him see that we are standing unsupported a couple of meters from the cliff edge, he starts talking to the stone, and as he does so the figure of a man resolves among the cracks and ledges at the cliff top, philemon tells me that this is another of the guards of hell who has instructions that i should pass. he said, …we are going down. like being in an elevator down we went, down into hell... we were going down a long way, black stone all the way. i began to wonder if there was ever going to be a bottom, when in the gloom one perceived gothic arches, tombs in various stages of construction, eight or nine in number, some firmly chiseled giving the appearance of dressed stone, others mere outlines carved into the rock.  we had passed the overhang of a vast cavern, our descent had slowed. the ghastly figure of a human being, blue white skin stretched over bones shrouded by a mist of fine white hair, crouched chipping stone with a crude mallet and chisel at the entrance to one of the tombs, flees shrieking into its interior at our vertical approach. then landing at the top of a steep narrow path beside terraces carved into the rock, on the upper terrace twenty two crouching figures, like hologram images so too do aquiline human features become the figures and visages of eagles. proceeding down the path the terraces on our left, under the overhanging roof and into the cave, the terrace below had one hundred and nineteen similar figures representing lessor raptors, hawks and kites, similarly changing appearance from bird to man. one is blind and there is the mummified body of a man, who appears to have been felled by a sword stroke to his left knee, then finished off with a sword thrust thru his left eye exiting the back of his head.  another terrace below, almost hidden in the gloom with seven or eight figures smooth and rounded like stones in a stream bed, some fairly large, man sized, some smaller. we take a few more steps down and along the path, we are on a landing, crouching figures below and ahead. philemon turns to me and says, …this is hell, of all who have entered here, none have left. we were standing beside the top of a circular pit no more that ten meters in diameter, containing the crouching figures of one hundred and twenty two comely blue green winged creatures. attending them are two hideous demons, one in human form though scaled like a snake, the other a small black figure with short thick bat like wings.   to our front the wall falls away and, dejected amid his defeated company is satan, crouched, his left arm stretched around his drawn up left knee, cradling his right arm and shattered right shoulder. his right leg amputated high up, a portion of bone sticking out of the raw stump like a leg roast in a butcher's window, a small quantity of dark green blood pooled on the stone below the wound.  on and past him an agglomeration of three hundred and twenty nine human figures, their group profile suggesting the arboreal physiognomy of a low sturdy powerful tree, its leaves and branches indeed its limbs, the heads, faces and limbs of the fallen. i would later learn that these are the recidivists of hell. on the other wall further up, in past the tombs, ones eye is caught by a straight line indeed a low stone shelter maybe four meters long though only a meter or so high, and twelve hundred mm wide, is built onto the almost vertical slope. this is the dwelling of chablis, the devil of the darkness. higher on the slope, the stone levels out and ones eye can perceive in the gloom what looks like a hospital bed with two demon attendants, themselves attended by the green glowing bearded human figure of another of the guards of hell. seen further in, thru and beyond the entrance of another cavern, faintly illuminated in a pale phosphorescence, the dark billows and strong flow of an underground river, a flat bottomed craft is against a stone landing. a gaunt straining figure is poling his vessel into the stonework against the fierce pull of the current, this is charon the ferryman.",0,,

465343,"**then you could buy weed in stores and it would go something like this:**  **weed from the corner bottleshop:** the weed is all quite potent, but a bit dry. you can buy as little as a $1 spliff or as much as an eighth, but at all levels it's too expensive unless everything else is closed or you don't really want to walk very far. however, finally you can get a rockstar, a hip flask of vodka, a blunt wrap or pack of papers and and a few nugs all in one purchase. previously you had to buy everything but the weed in the store, and then step outside for a second transaction with some kid wearing three cell phones, baggy pants, a $200 baseball cap covered in graphics of various guns and an oversized t-shirt so ornately decorated with rhinstone-embedded marijuana leaf imprints you actually find yourself questioning if he might be gay.  **weed from the grocery store:** there's only one kind of weed, and it comes in a cellophane baggy on a lurid orange hang tag, found amongst the ""ethnic spices"" isle, hanging between some bland looking dried peppers and a pale bag of dubious looking horchata drink mix, all in the same plastic bags. the weed looks and smells suspiciously like oregano. despite this it still costs $20 per gram.  **weed from bevmo:** everything is available from $5 bales of ditchweed to $200 dollar a gram gourmet hybrids grown exclusively in a caviar-seaweed mulch constantly prayed over by rastafarian priests playing deep, soothing dub. thankfully, there's also an array of consumer friendly pot - all of which pretty much costs $20 a gram, just like before legalization.  **weed from trader joe's, round 1:** decided by a coin-toss, trader joe's decides that weed is ""produce"" to be sold in the ""produce"" section. therefore there is only one or two kinds of weed. one is labeled ""organic weed"" while the other just says ""weed"". the organic variety costs about 30% more by volume. both varieties come in the same packaging - a clear plastic shell crudely taped shut, with simple labeling. the weed in both containers looks roughly identical, and it looks like they came from the same farm. in some trader joe's, you can find ""fresh weed"" in the refrigerated produce isle between the bags of spinach and blocks of feta. it looks just like the other weed they sell, except it is slightly moist and refrigerated.  **weed from trader joe's, round 2:** realizing the error, the trader joe's team moves all weed from the produce isle to the wine, beer and spirits isle. there are now approximately 50 kinds of weed here. many have hipster and irony-friendly labels such as ""skunk ass"", ""sierra nevada golden glow grow"", ""dude, where's my car?"" and ""indica uber alles"". upon asking a friendly, hawaiian-shirted associate which one would be the equivalent of their affordable but highly recommended monopolowa vodka offering, you're readily directed to a bag of intense looking but affordable flowers in a plain looking package, labled ""afghani death blossoms"". it does the trick nicely.  **weed from trader joe's, round 3:** same as round two, but the weed has been relocated to the far end of trader joe's infamous snack isle - you know the one, filled with nuts, dried fruits, chocolate covered everything and a startling array of popcorn-like objects and something known as ""pirates booty"" which resembles cheese-dusted styrofoam packing peanuts. free weed samples are given out by an expert bongmaster and spliff roller at a small but comfortable kiosk on an endcap, where samples of lemonade and snacks are also provided.  after lingering for two hours, all hopped up on free coffee and chocolate and more than a little red-eyed, you dumbly shamble down the snack isle to check out. it takes another hour to make it to the checkout line, and you've discovered that your plan to quickly dart in and out of the store has succumbed to an entire shopping cart full of snacks, half of which seem to be variations of ""pirate's booty"", while the other half seems to be about fifty pounds of nuts and another twenty pounds of various kinds of chocolate.  meanwhile, the locally-hired-artist hand-painted signage in your local trader joe's rapidly moves from bland to impressively ornate displays of creativity and whimsy - but things tend to be labeled incorrectly, if the signs are even in the right isles. you mention this to the manager, who replies ""oh, right. i've been meaning to have a chat with him about that, but every time we go on break i forget what it was i was going to talk to him about. did you find everything ok? do you need any... snacks? i think i need some... snacks,"" at which point the manager goes back to trying to build a miniature desktop trebuchet out of pretzels.   **and last, but best - weed from the local farmer's market:** there's two or three stalls selling weed, each with many varieties. oddly, you remember just a few weeks ago that these same stalls and farmers sold a lot of delicious tomatoes, salad greens, apples, and berries at ridiculously cheap prices. you've often noted the hippy-like nature of the stall operators, and wondered how they could sell vegetables so cheaply week after week. now you know.  the names on the signs are exotic, hand-inked with colorful markers. the signs also indicate local origins, growing conditions, hybrid types and organic or inorganic status. the weed is ridiculously cheap, as well as lush and outrageously delicious - but much of it is also poorly groomed or otherwise rather wild looking. some booths have entire plants hanging in them. when you ask for a twenty dollar bag the rather faded looking hippy farmer shrugs, picks up a large machete and hacks off about half of a plant and stuffs it into your burlap shopping bag, spilling weed everywhere. he or she starts to ask ""is that enough... no, wait..."" and then also puts a large brownie in your bag and then, with a large metal scoop, shovels up about a cupful of what looks like beige sand or salt, drops it in a baggy and also puts that in your bag. ""a little table kief. good for cooking or sprinkling on spliffs! have a great weekend!""  which you do. though you don't remember much of it, you do remember eating everything in the house, including a sandwich involving peanut butter, ice cream, bacon and pancakes that sounded like a good idea at the time but was proven otherwise - much like the attempt at repainting the bathroom about the same time. something about being inspiried by the color of fresh blueberries in vanilla ice cream ""soup"", which involved rushing off to the local hardware store with a handful of blueberries and a bowl of rapidly melting ice cream as ""color samples"".  **what about weed at whole foods?**  whole whats? isn't that a subsidiary of pottery barn?  oh, fine. the weed at whole foods is sold from what used to be the ""olive bar"". even people who really like olives could never figure out why whole foods would dedicate an entire store within a store to olives, but i digress.  there are approximately 400 kinds of weed at the bar. most are sold in bulk from bulk bins. the bins appear to be clean, but if you inspected the inside or underside of the bins you'd probably walk out of the store a distinct shade of unpleasant green which was neither envy nor plant envy.  some of the weed is sold in highly complicated looking recycled-paper packages that look like they were designed by art center or fashion school dropouts, and other boutique brands are packaged in reusable tins (which are promptly thrown away after collecting a dozen or so). the tins have brightly printed, life-affirming quotations all over them by notable, peaceful world figures.  however, even the least expensive bulk weed they have in stock is about 3x overpriced, and appears to be infested with what appear to be organic mites.  just before you make a selection from a bin with only a mild mite infestation, some young rasta looking kid warns you off and asks you to meet him outside, where he hooks you up with a nice bag for about half the price. ""real hippies only come here to shoplift,"" he says knowingly, pulling a vegan deli sandwich out of the cargo pocket of his surplus army jacket and munching on it before walking away.

464476,"well, it's quite simple you see. a rainy evening the current owner of these fine furnishings was sauntering down a quiet road, eager to return home after a mind-numbing day of repetitive office work. as they gazed across the unforgiving street, there was a huddled, dark figure amongst the wind-blown pieces of garbage and debris, looking very much like an injured animal. momentarily forgetting the cold and discomfort caused by icy water being splashed in one's face, the owner ran up to the figure, caution being bested by curiosity. surprisingly, there was a small, pathetic looking elderly lady huddled down in a dark coat, whimpering and clutching her pale, gnarled ankle with a look of contained agony on her face. concerned, this person offers their assistance at once, in a manner reminiscent of a boy scout. the lady looks up and beams in response to the kindness, and requests to be carried to the structure at the end of the block. moved by pity, our misguided seller complies, momentarily shocked at her weight, or lack thereof. making slow but steady progress against the merciless gusts of wind and buckets of water that were now gushing forth torrentially from the heavens. as they approach, a building in a state of mild disrepair becomes clearer, surrounding it is a foreboding cast-iron fence, sinister black points jutting out like claws. with some difficulty, the pair manage to negotiate themselves past the overgrown lawn and inside of the house. despite its homely appearance, the dwelling is finely furnished. luxurious shag rugs grace the floor, the kitchen gleams of modern, top-of-the-line appliances, and the living room displays an unmistakable taste in well-coordinated, expensive furniture. the old lady hobbles over to a plush couch, and smiles at her benefactor. in a quiet albeit authoritative voice, she offers a cup of tea. realizing how cold and dank he has grown, the owner gratefully accepts, and half-turns to the kitchen, expecting to be directed to a kettle. the lady merely indicates a handsome oak coffee table, two ivory mugs bearing a steaming brown liquid. hesitantly, the owner of these craigslist commodities seats himself in the chair opposite of the table, cushioned immediately by the the most comfortably firm yet squishy material he has ever felt. he grasps the mug with a confused expression, certain it was not there before, and not sure what to expect. at first they begin to engage in light small talk. an austere grandfather clock in the corner of the room dominates the scene, sternly keeping watch. time slips by abnormally fast. at one moment, pausing to adjust her saucer, the lady stares with an animal sort of longing at the seller's face and mentions, ""you look almost like my grandson,"" volume tapering off with each syllable. the seller is at a loss for words, and, not knowing what social protocol to follow, merely nods and sips more tea. they begin to speak of issues at great length, and the seller finds himself entranced. time passes by ever quicker, and before he can gauge how long he has spent, the grandfather clock chimes 11 o'clock, its brassy peals sending a chill up his spine. mumbling an awkward apology, he excuses himself and rushes home, but not before having contact information thrust upon him. he hurries through the thick clouds and heavy rain to his comparatively less magnificent apartment. removing his soaked jacket and shaking his wet hair, the seller allows his mind to wander. what an eccentric lady! she didn't seem quite right to him. but where did the tea come from? where did all the luxury items come from? she could have been an heiress, or a widow to a captain of industry, but if so, then why such a run-down building in such a mundane part of the city? he grunts and walks slowly over to his refrigerator, pinning the yellow piece of paper she insisted he take on it. inscribed in a tidy hand on it was: ""lydia miller 41 charity way 438-7009."" strange that such a seemingly independent and resource wealthy person would feel the need for a person like him to watch her. shaking his head a final time, the seller attempted to silence his internal thoughts and sleep. he had an early day tomorrow.       our seller found himself staring in varying states of disinterest out the window. once again, he found himself at his completely menial office job, assaulted by the monotonous cacophony of keystrokes and cubicle-dweller small talk. at least he had a cubicle by the window, his one solace. the seller reverted to his normal pastime of monitoring the people passing through the street 2 stories below. how they rambled on in futility like ants! bustling in a frenzy to their destinations, moving as if with a hive mind, always focusing on their next breadcrumb. so pacifying was this activity to the seller that he hardly noticed the lady head towards his building. about two seconds late, his brain registered with a jolt that she was coming in the lobby! the seller glanced towards the large, gray clock against the monochromatic office background. 12:15. it was just in time for his lunch break. with foreboding thoughts dancing around in his head, the seller proceeded to the lobby with a dreamlike sense of knowing what would happen next. after what seemed to be an eternity's elevator ride, he emerged in the marble lobby, and scanned the area. within moments, his eyes caught that of the lady, whose face lit up. she sat up straighter and waved him over, beaming. with mild reservation, the seller walked a straight line to her.      ""good afternoon mrs. miller,"" he heard himself say. it was odd that she would show up here at this time, with no prior announcement.     ""good afternoon to you too!"" she responded, white hair gleaming ethereally in the sun that had poked through the clouds in previous days. ""now that i'm all fixed up, i've decided to come and take you to lunch,"" she continued, indicating a blue cast affixed to her ankle. the seller was taken aback, but, in keeping with his polite demeanor, nodded and smiled.      in a matter of minutes, he found himself opposite mrs. miller in a previously unnoticed cafe, decorated in a manner very similar to her house. he was biting into a cream cheese and cucumber sandwich when it suddenly hit him how surreal she looked. mauve cardigan far to clean and fluffy to belong anywhere but an advertisement, pants so white they reflected the sun, wrinkles so defined he would've thought them magnified. her brow furrowed under his examination. realizing his stare, the seller resumed to eating his lunch, hastily completing it in as little time as possible. suddenly, another thought hit him. how did she know where he worked? he didn't even leave her his surname. why were people staring at him as he spoke with her  walking down the street? again, he excused himself at the first opportunity, somewhat awkwardly, and half-jogged back to work.      ""where were you?"" demanded his boss as he entered the doors with mild perspiration adorning his brow. but why the suspicion? the clock would vindicate him, he couldn't have been more than thirty minutes... 2:45! how could it have been two and a half hours since he left for lunch?     ""oh, i'm sorry, i was out at that cafe... cafe del sol, i think it was? you know, the one on the corner two blocks from here...? i guess i lost track of time,"" his excuse sounded weak even to his own ears. the seller felt color rise in his cheeks and walked off slinkily under the withering gaze of his supervisor. behind him, a coworker exchanged glances with their boss.      ""i worry about him,"" the coworker mentioned, ""he was talking to himself for a good ten minutes down the street before entering a condemned building. you might want to keep an eye on him.""",1,0,

701151,"before i give my constructive criticism, i wanna say that jasper deserves huge kudos for doing these textures, and also for tolerating whatever backlash the community may give (and has given). also, if anyone reading this disagrees with my opinions, that’s fine. disagreement is a natural part of dialogue.  this is a list of things which i did not like about the new textures. i tried to figure out why i did not like the textures that i didn’t like, and provided these reasons so that the mojangstas know what to fix and know why they should fix it. let’s begin:  diagonal lines on glass are too thick, and darkest areas of blue should be lighter - this needs changing because glass now becomes more of a focus than what is behind the glass.  the ends of ferns are too light. this makes them stand out too much.  the colour variations between individual leaves on the leaf texture are too great (especially in the middle, where a light-coloured leaf is contrasted by a very dark one)  the above problem is also seen with soul sand. the problem is that when you go far away from the texture, it still looks busy, whereas the original texture ended up blending into itself when you moved away from it.  vines are too thick now, which causes vine-covered tree trunks to look more green than brown. (this is also noticeable when vines are on dirt).  spruce planks are now too light, which makes them look more separated when spruce stairs or slabs are placed in conjunction with oak or jungle logs, which is a common use for spruce wood.  pure andesite looks too smooth. it is commonly used to break up the smooth texture of  stone, but this effect is lessened because andesite is not as rough now.  gravel also looks too smooth. the texture is not recognisable as gravel, because it is hard to distinguish the individual pieces of gravel that the previous texture represented.  the outline of the egg texture is very dark. the same goes for buckets.  the colour of glowstone dust is much closer to the colour of the grooves in the glowstone block, rather than the colour halfway between the darkest and lightest parts of the block, which would make more sense.  shears are red. i assumed the handles were leather; therefore they should stay brown. if there’s a reason for making the shears red i’d love to hear it.  golden apples are much darker than gold bars/nuggets. gold should be the same colour all around.  sponges have less of a depth to them; because the texture has been smoothed out.  netherrack is very very busy. the original texture had lines which separated the texture into chunks, the same way that cobblestone and glowstone does. these separation lines should remain in the new texture.  ice (normal and packed) is extremely smooth now, which makes it feel very out-of-place. logs also look somewhat out-of-place because of their smoothness (i think the logs look smooth because of the lines... all the lines are straight which causes it to not look very rough.)  the border on the redstone lamp block looks strange because it is not very dark, and because it is a solid colour instead of a gradient or texture.  the colour difference between dark oak planks and dark oak doors has increased. the doors should be darkened a bit so that they fit together.  the tops of crops are extremely bright. they should be dulled down a bit, because they draw the eye away from everything else.  beetroot has become much more orange-red. it is also a duller colour than it used to be. it should return to its purple-red colour, because it is both richer and more interesting, and a colour that is not very common in the game. the beetroot item is purple-red so why is the crop different?  the colour of full-grown and mostly-grown wheat is very yellow. this makes wheat clash with colour schemes it originally worked in. because it is more realistic, i will not request it be reverted to its original colours. however, to reach a happy medium, the colour should be slightly more green, and darker rather than the very pale colour that it is.  the outline of the wheat item is very faint on the edges facing to the top left.  diorite is busier than it used to be. (this makes it harder to look at).  the border on polished diorite is dark, which makes the texture look really separated.  mushrooms don’t have an outline - this makes them look out-of-place with the rest of the items.  melons are much darker and greener, this breaks some colour schemes which it may have been included in.  the fuse on tnt is very blue. this doesn’t make sense.  the locations of the “eyes” on dispensers and droppers is different to what it used to be. i liked the cute faces but now they look scared or constipated... and that’s not a good look. the shadows below their eyes are more pronounced also, which also make them look less cute  i could not recognise that the baked potato was a baked potato. the original texture was a bit strange as well but at least it was more potato-shaped.  the outline of the brewing stand texture is faint and somewhat nonexistent, which makes it look out-of-place. the front-on perspective is also strange.  i have been as critical as i can be, so some of these things are minor, but most of what i have written are problems which i believe really should be fixed. i care about the future of minecraft’s aesthetic and i don’t want it to be ruined because people like me didn’t speak up about it. i hope this is helpful to those at mojang and i thank you for reading. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  p.s. while we’re here, can white concrete be made a little bit warmer? just something that i’ve wanted since it was added ;)",0,,

857536,"well i just moved out 2 months ago. so i'm definitely still very much in the healing process. but i've already made a lot of progress. the biggest help with that has been my therapist - i recommend getting into therapy to help you cope with all of this asap.   there have been a lot of layers of grief. one of the things i had to grieve was closure. in other words, grieve the fact that i won't get it. if he could just admit that he screwed up so royally over and over that he finally sabotaged the relationship for good, it would help. would it change anything? no, but we might be able to be friends. then again, if he had that ability, we wouldn't be here in the first place.  he can't just admit that his selfishness and manipulation, and just sheer terrible way of treating people close to him, were the cause of *everything.* i've never claimed to be perfect or faultless but seriously, all i ever did was my best, and all it got me was to constantly have to reel from one chaotic or unfair thing after another.  i've had to deal with a severe lack of trust, fear of vulnerability, lack of faith in men, lack of faith in myself and my decisions (and ability to see red flags). these are all things my therapist is helping me with.  i was also suffering the consequences of not getting that closure. it really fucks with your head. and just the sheer disappointment in my partner, the stupidity of it all, it all could have been avoided.  you have to just accept that some things are outside of your control. accepting that he simply wasn't the person i imagined him to be helped me to start looking away from the past and toward the future. silver lining: i don't have to deal with this crap anymore!  i've been in therapy every week since leaving and it has helped me process these things immensely. it helps to have a trained counselor say to you: it's not you; you should trust, you can trust, you don't have to be black and white with people. you just have to know when enough is enough, and i'll help you establish those boundaries.  while with my husband, i developed severe anxiety that i could feel devolving into serious depression - and i'm a generally very happy and optimistic person. in just two months, my sense of hopelessness has completely vanished, and my anxiety is much more under control - and i know it will get better and better.   meanwhile i'm focused on regaining my reality, being true to myself, and developing my self-esteem with relationships. my therapist has been instrumental in all of this - identifying some of my root issues (you don't just end up putting up with this shit if you don't have your own issues) and working on fixing them.  once i feel stable enough in my own right, i'll look into finding a good, equal, loving, functional partner and i can't wait to find that :)",0,,
240573,"to be perfectly honest, i struggle with this too at times, but i don't think pointing out racial traits should be avoided for the exact reason you explain. i think it's a matter of using words delicately and avoiding ones that were used as slurs, not focusing too much on traits that are used to distinguish from the default white, and making sure that diversity within racial groups is just as varied as those of the white characters.  i'm a black woman. one trait that's often exaggerated in racist caricature for black people is their lips. for east-asian people it's often their eyes. skin color for both.  but i think it's fine to describe a black man or woman as having ""full"" lips. saying ""big lips"" or ""fat lips"" however *would* be considered offensive.  just like ""tilted"" or ""slanted"" eyes is offensive in regards to east-asians. you might be looking for the word ""monolid"" or ""epicanthic fold"", and of course, not every east asian person has monolid eyes, just like not every black person has full lips, dark skin and coily hair, but i really think as long as you're careful it doesn't end up being an issue.  mix other traits in as well, like face-shape (obviously be delicate with this as well; try to avoid describing an east-asian person as having a ""flat"" or ""round"" face) and body-type.  point out your white characters' traits just as much, and not just with color alone. you can describe someone being very fair in hair, skin, and eye color without even saying ""blue eyes"" and ""blond hair"" and ""fair skin"": i.e., skin that burns or reddens easily, eyes that are sensitive to sunlight, and eyelashes that aren't as noticeable without makeup.  white characters can also be dark-haired or dark-eyed, obviously. so say you have a white-coded character describing an east-asian-coded character and they say something like, 'his eyes were the same honey-brown as mine, but mine had a crease over them' or something.  describe white characters as having varied noses and lip shapes and hair textures and skin/eye tones as much as you do the ""poc"" characters.  if you do describe an east-asian-coded person with monolids, you could have their hair be curly and their lips full. make sure they're not racial caricatures while your white characters are diverse. i think that can end up being one of the biggest issues.  i have a character in my current novel (not fantasy) who's taiwanese, but when describing him the mc (who's attracted to him) focuses a lot on his full lips as a trait of him as an individual even though the traits that make him ""look"" east-asian are mentioned but less focused on.   i have a black woman character who's described as very tall and lanky, while, you know, the more stereotypical idea of a black woman's body is very curvy with a big butt.   east-asian men are sometimes stereotyped as short, so have a tall, ripped east-asian-coded man for example.   my father (who is black and not that light-skinned) has freckles and blue-gray rings around his eyes, which are generally brown.  your options are endless.   at the same time, as long as you don't make it fetishy-sounding, i see nothing wrong with celebrating those racial traits as something noticeable and beautiful.   like how blue eyes or long blond hair can be harped on a lot as stereotypical traits of a beautiful white woman, i think it's fine to describe someone's deep brown eyes with epicanthic folds or their big coily afro as lovely if a character thinks so.  but it's a careful, delicate balance.    /u/batboss is right in that it's a fantasy world, and so you could have a full mix of traits. people with monolids, wavy red hair, brown skin, wide noses but thin lips could make up a group of people.   here's what i would do.  1) read novels and short stories written by a person of color where a/the character(s) are the same race, and see what descriptions they use for characters.  2) look at makeup and beauty gurus of various races and see how they discuss using makeup to enhance certain features. you can also note things people of certain races struggle with beauty-wise.  -i've noticed (and i could be completely wrong, so take this with a grain of salt) that some people with monolids can have straight eyelashes that don't curl well.   -certain colors of makeup don't look good on people with certain skin-color undertones, and for some fairly pale women, foundation shades can end up looking orangey on them.  -in my personal experience, people with dark skin can get ""ashy"" (though i suggest you avoid using that particular word), as their dry skin can appear pretty gray around the knees and elbows.   -people with kinky/curly hair (myself included) can get ""fairy knots"" which is where your shed hair ends up tangled at the ends and kinda forms these little annoying clumps.  race is not just about color and the obvious stuff that distinguishes us.   helpful links:   hair: http://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/113627509260/words-to-describe-hair  skin color: [1](http://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/109701193130/dark-skin-paleness-and-undead-skin), [2](http://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/96830966357/writing-with-color-description-guide-words-for), [3](http://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/94355184347/introducing-race-skin-color-naturally)  ""asian eyes"": http://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/101967940901/wwc-guide-describing-asian-eyes  sorry, this was a bit of a disorganized ramble, but i hope it was helpful.",1,1,1

903762,"once again, i remind you that the purim story does not contain any genocide.  there was no attempt to massacre all persians.  there was only an attempt to massacre all persian jews, which failed.  as i said, if jews' refusal to stop observing their 2500-year old tradition of justified revenge convinces you they are more vengeful than cultures without such a tradition, go ahead believing that.  &gt;i don't need to do a double-blind experiment to know that i'm more likely to get stomped to death by blacks at an atm than by a bunch of chinese. i just look at the paper, read about violent crimes and conclude that indeed, blacks are a lot more criminal than chinese. and then i act accordingly.  if the newspaper itself is not biased, you'll be able to get the data and do the quantitative analysis if you want to.  it's not hard to rigorously show that blacks are more violent than chinese, even controlling for economic status. you haven't show the corresponding thing for jews whites viz a viz revenge, because you can't.  &gt;iraq is a good example. were the usa to act jew-style, we'd have driven away thousands of iraqis, as the jews did to the lebanese, who captured a few jews.  you see usa/iraq as a parallel to israel/palestine or israel/lebanon?  did iraqis cross the us border to kidnap us soldiers?  did they target attacks at us civilians?  is israel trying to ""win hearts and minds"" in the west bank and gaza?  and what about the leveling of fallujah after the lynching of a few contractors in the city?  and studies have shown that the us invasian *has* driven hundreds of thousands of iraqis out of their country.  also, why not consider usa/vietnam, or britain/south africa?    &gt;i was only responding to the fellow's comment. he was saying it was surprising jews were so nasty, yet to anyone who knows jews, it was just tjb - typical jew behavior.  so you start off saying jews are vegenful, and when i point out this is off-topic you switch to saying they're generally ""nasty?""  why didn't you say so in the first place?  and do you know any jews?  have you experienced this ""nastiness,"" or talked to someone who has?  &gt;you don't care why - you just care about reality.  fair enough, let's ignore causes, but then at least be clear about what you are measuring.  what do we mean by vengeful (or ""nasty"")?  i say one group of people is more vengeful than another if their responses to offenses is proportionally greater.  i think this is an very reasonable definition that agrees with common usages, and is quantifiable.  if you want to define vengefulness according to the total size of responses to offenses meted out, regardless of the size of the offense, then yes, i agree that israel is more ""vengeful"" according to that definition than any ""white"" nation today, excepting russia and perhaps the us.  this is obviously due to the fact that these ""white"" nations are not engaged in hostilities with their neighbors.  but i already mentioned this above, which you seem to have ignored as usual:  &gt;there is a different form of your thesis which i might accept. that is, that the jews have enacted more collective retribution in their 3000+ year history than most nation states with ""white"" (still not defined by you) populations existing today, is probably true.  i think that the standard dictionary definion of vengeful, that is ""desiring or seeking vengeance"" agrees much better with my definition, which incorporates the proportionality of the response.  killing in retribution for a murder is not generally considered excessively vengeful, whereas killing in retribution for vandalism or verbal abuse is.  but even accepting your eclectic (one might say ""talmudic,"" though the common usage is ""sophistic"") definition of vengeance that neglects the size of the provocation, it falls totally flat when applied to american, european, or turkish jews, or when applied to ""whites"" in the first half of the 20th century, or earlier.",1,-1,-2
875577,"more atheist bullshit. in the communist world, countless people have been murdered specifically because they were creationists or for declaring themselves as religious. but nobody sees those crimes - they don't serve the atheist agenda.  &gt; atheism kills  &gt;in these secular times, religion regularly gets a bad rap. and anti-christian bigotry especially accelerates, with most of the world’s ills, from burnt toast to global warming, somehow pinned on the christian faith.  &gt;of course christianity has made its fair share of mistakes over the years, but according to the atheist militants, it can do no right. indeed, the secular jihad takes no prisoners, finding all religious folk guilty of every conceivable villainy and vice.  &gt;the secularists are especially happy to lay the blame for the wars of the world on the shoulders of religion. they argue that if we just get rid of religion, most conflict would cease, and we could all live together in peace and harmony.  &gt;historical fact, however, will not allow for such a distorted view of things. writing in the november 21, 2006 christian science monitor, dinesh d’souza argues that “atheism, not religion, is the real force behind the mass murders of history”.  &gt;he begins by citing a number of atheist authors, from sam harris to richard dawkins, all of whom take cheap potshots at religion, seeking to attribute mass murder to religious belief. “the problem with this critique,” says d’souza, “is that it exaggerates the crimes attributed to religion, while ignoring the greater crimes of secular fanaticism. the best example of religious persecution in america is the salem witch trials. how many people were killed in those trials? thousands? hundreds? actually, fewer than 25. yet the event still haunts the liberal imagination.”  &gt;he continues, “it is strange to witness the passion with which some secular figures rail against the misdeeds of the crusaders and inquisitors more than 500 years ago. the number sentenced to death by the spanish inquisition appears to be about 10,000. some historians contend that an additional 100,000 died in jail due to malnutrition or illness. these figures are tragic, and of course population levels were much lower at the time. but even so, they are minuscule compared with the death tolls produced by the atheist despotisms of the 20th century. in the name of creating their version of a religion-free utopia, adolf hitler, joseph stalin, and mao zedong produced the kind of mass slaughter that no inquisitor could possibly match. collectively these atheist tyrants murdered more than 100 million people.”  &gt;moreover, many of these so-called “religious wars” were not really about religion at all, but about territory and power claims. “can the wars between england and france be called religious wars because the english were protestants and the french were catholics? hardly. the same is true today. the israeli-palestinian conflict is not, at its core, a religious one. it arises out of a dispute over self-determination and land. hamas and the extreme orthodox parties in israel may advance theological claims – ‘god gave us this land’ and so forth - but the conflict would remain essentially the same even without these religious motives. ethnic rivalry, not religion, is the source of the tension in northern ireland and the balkans.”  &gt;yet the secularists not only blame religion, they seek to whitewash the crimes of secularism. indeed, a common trick is to claim that hitler, et. al., were somehow actually religious! the atheists speak of ‘political religion’ and the like, attempting to defuse the secularism of last century’s great mass murderers. “dawkins and harris are employing a transparent sleight of hand that holds christianity responsible for the crimes committed in its name, while exonerating secularism and atheism for the greater crimes committed in their name.”  &gt;he continues, “religious fanatics have done things that are impossible to defend, and some of them, mostly in the muslim world, are still performing horrors in the name of their creed. but if religion sometimes disposes people to self-righteousness and absolutism, it also provides a moral code that condemns the slaughter of innocents. in particular, the moral teachings of jesus provide no support for - indeed they stand as a stern rebuke to - the historical injustices perpetrated in the name of christianity.”  &gt;the secular attempt to create a ‘new man’ as in marxism has time and again resulted in coercive utopianism. whether the bloodlust of the french revolution, or the ideological terror of the russian revolution, these secular crusades have been the real source of misery in the world. “the crimes of atheism have generally been perpetrated through a hubristic ideology that sees man, not god, as the creator of values. using the latest techniques of science and technology, man seeks to displace god and create a secular utopia here on earth. of course if some people - the jews, the landowners, the unfit, or the handicapped - have to be eliminated in order to achieve this utopia, this is a price the atheist tyrants and their apologists have shown themselves quite willing to pay. thus they confirm the truth of fyodor dostoyevsky’s dictum, ‘if god is not, everything is permitted’.”  &gt;concludes d’souza, “whatever the motives for atheist bloodthirstiness, the indisputable fact is that all the religions of the world put together have in 2,000 years not managed to kill as many people as have been killed in the name of atheism in the past few decades. it’s time to abandon the mindlessly repeated mantra that religious belief has been the greatest source of human conflict and violence. atheism, not religion, is the real force behind the mass murders of history.”  &gt;perspective, in other words, in needed here. religion has certainly been responsible for much grief and bloodshed. and militant islam certainly needs to be mentioned here. but the secular holy wars have been the chief culprit in human history, and it is time religious folk call the secularists’ bluff in this regard.  http://www.billmuehlenberg.com/2006/11/23/atheism-kills/  edit. the athenazi brigade already downmodded this. hey, morons, you would have been good some years ago working for ""pravda"" or for the atheist association of the ussr.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm4woam7d3w",0,,

(well, no. there are no wrong answers. “we can process out here if you want to.”) every perspective has value here. but when it comes to fighting racism, certain perspectives are more useful.  an african american woman declares: “whiteness to me is a threat.”  “it’s not a real human identity,” says a black man.  “definitely the absence of color,” says another.  “whiteness,” says the woman who speaks last, a young caucasian named jane, “is potentially the one place of refuge i think i have in my life.  “the challenge for me is not to claim it.”  and there it is. for the purposes of this discussion, white is not a color, not a pigment, not a race. it is a mantle that must be claimed–but also spurned.  even the center for the study of white american culture, which brought everyone together to talk about whiteness, at times seems to want no part of it.  jeff and charley  “center for study.”  this is how jeff hitchcock has learned to answer the phone. it’s what the executive director calls the “nonreactive” name for the center for the study of white american culture, hard experience having taught him that if you utter the word “white” you will spend half the workday explaining what you are not.  he carries business cards that do it for him: “not an organization for white people, as some people may infer… . ”  these are the same cards carried by the center’s president, charley flint, but charley flint has less need of the explanation, being, as charley flint is, a black woman.  “i was named for my father,” she explains.  they are husband and wife, hitchcock and flint, as well as salt and pepper. they have been together 22 years, which means that the officers of the center for the study of white american culture are everything their group stands for: a harmonious multiracial society, living a day-to-day existence that tries to push whiteness “out of the center” of life to make room for a new way of doing things.  in other words, hitchcock and flint put flesh on the bones of the issues that wisp around the rafters of the episcopal center for three days.  for example: their son goes to a public school. most of the kids in the school are black–about 90%, hitchcock says.  flint says it’s only 70%.  you could count the kids, of course, but the point is the disagreement. despite all these years with a black partner, hitchcock sees things with white eyes. or at least with what his wife considers white eyes.  “i believe when blacks get to 10% or 12%, whites see more blacks,” flint says.  it might be one way of defining whiteness: paranoia, or at least a looming sense of being outnumbered. (by 2050, whites will be only a bare majority in the united states, the census bureau projects.)  there are other ways.  “being on time for appointments, that’s a white thing,” says christine maguire. she thinks a moment.  “making lists.”  she is making one now. folded onto a sofa in the lobby, taking a break, she has just finished leading a workshop on white people appropriating native american culture–wannabes looking for purification in sweat lodges, or paying to watch a hopi medicine man work.  maguire, whose ancestors were scots, regards her list.  “very linear thinking, that’s a white thing,” she says.  the list is hard to make for a couple of reasons. one is the very vagueness of “whiteness.” if you begin, as everyone here seems to, with the premise that the majority group is the historical oppressor and that the oppressor has established the society’s norms and established its institutions, you can end up defining whiteness as everything around you, and all the usual ways of doing things.  hitchcock, for one, argues that by simply acknowledging that you are white, you are also acknowledging that you have privilege. you may not have asked for the privilege, but you do enjoy it, even if the privilege amounts to not being noticed.  “white people never think about a group identity,” says paul marcus, one of the conference organizers, who works for the boston anti-racism group community change inc. marcus is white and, therefore, an expert. he believes that white people think of themselves as individuals, which is why they get their backs up when called racists: “who, me? i don’t think like that.”  but blacks, he says, are more likely to identify with a group. maybe it’s a result of being seen that way by others. maybe it’s the natural inclination of a population that feels aggrieved (this would explain rush limbaugh’s dittoheads).  in any event, marcus points out, it begins to explain why whites and blacks spend so much time talking past each other when the topic is race.  not that white people really like to talk about race.  “you know, white people do feel terribly self-conscious,” says hitchcock: ” ‘what if i say the wrong thing?’ ”  a great white hope  uptightness. it is a hallmark of whiteness: think of richard pryor doing his white guy, cutting the wattage by two-thirds and ratcheting up the sphincter factor. think of billy crystal out on the dance floor in “when harry met sally,” doing “the white man’s overbite.”  the ward cleaver-ed sullivan archetype of whiteness is a parody of rigidity, and about the only place it survives today in public life may be the good old american workplace. (who wants to be white? quite possibly someone who isn’t, when applying for a job.) it is an arid substitute for identity, the opposite of ethnicity. the archetype is such an easy target for satire because it is so obviously artificial.  and that artificiality turns out to be the central point of “exploring whiteness to end racism,” as the banner over the lectern in the episcopal center reads.  the thinking here is that we might never have enshrined “whiteness” as a concept if people with lighter skin had not felt the need to feel superior to people with darker skin.  and, in fact, scientists looking for something in the human genome that is as tidy as the categories on the u.s. census survey are now concluding that there appears to be no gene for race.  “the idea of people, in 1997, buying into the concept of race is like the flat earth society,” says lowell thompson, one of the livelier wires at the conference.  a black man who works in advertising, thompson has written a book called “the invisible man in the gray flannel suit.” at the conference, he circulated a petition reminding president clinton that he has “a chance to begin the next thousand years, as james brown would say, ‘on the good foot.’ ” but mostly he peddled his latest book, “white folks.” this, thompson explains to a white man, is how black folks refer among themselves to the majority population. it’s also the name of the web site (http://www.whitefolks.com) where thompson posts his “white folks funnies,” featuring leroy freud, the world’s first “clinical whiteologist.”  when hitchcock of the center for the study (http://www.euroamerican.org) ran across the site a couple of years ago, the two struck up a relationship that resulted in the first national conference on whiteness. held in new jersey last year, it attracted about 50 pioneers, one-sixth the number who have turned out in cambridge. at this rate, next year’s confab in chicago may well push the study of whiteness somewhere powerfully near the mainstream.  one of the enemy groups actually had the temerity to ask to be included on the program this year. it wasn’t a militia wing, but a dubious pack of revisionists that goes by the name american renaissance. its web site includes writings such as a 1993 article summarized as follows: “american slaves had surprisingly positive things to say about slavery.”  the antidote hitchcock prescribes is itself enough to make your head hurt.  but it begins with the blandly profound observation of author robert terry, who back in 1970 said that part of being white is not thinking about it. therefore, says hitchcock: “as you learn what it is to be white, that takes you out of the traditional experience of being white.”  standing there under the “free leonard peltier” banner, paul bauer seems to know all this instinctively. he realizes that his heritage leaves him no choice but to be conflicted. he also realizes that the point of talking about whiteness is not to make white people feel self-conscious, which is uncomfortable. the point is to make them self-aware, which can lighten the load of that big jar of mayo.  “i personally prefer miracle whip light,” bauer says. “but that’s a neo-white thing.”   http://articles.latimes.com/p/1997/dec/07/news/ls-61415",1,0,0

555843,"ooh! [i can do that!](http://imgur.com/a/vzcrf)  overall: i think this palette is freaking awesome. i love the soft chocolate smell and the arrangements of color. the colors blend easily and coordinate in a super awesome way. the shadow texture isn't exactly ""buttery"" for most of them, but that also makes them less powdery and leads to less fall out, which i love. that being said, the shadows still apply wonderfully, and are actually a bit easier to apply and make last throughout the day without a super-soft, buttery texture.   each color:   gilded ganache has a rough, glittery texture but applies and swatches wonderfully. it's a glittery green-brown, or a brown with a green undertone and sparkles. it is superbly pigmented with just a small amount of product and blends beautifully (seriously, it's freakin' awesome.)   white chocolate is a matte cream color that leans more towards white, truly the color of white chocolate. it has a buttery, soft (and unfortunately, powdery) texture. as a pale girl, it takes two full swipes of my finger to build this up to where i can see it on my skin. for lighter skintones, it makes a lovely base or blending color. for medium to darker skintones it could be a beautiful highlight color. it blends out beautifully   milk chocolate is a matte light brown. it has a semi-buttery texture. it really does look like the color of milk chocolate when applied. it goes on darker on the skin than it appears in the pan when applied heavily, but when blended out or applied lightly is nearly identical. it's a bit harder to blend out than some of the other colors. i personally love to use this as a contour.    black forest truffle has a texture similar to gilded ganache, but is smoother. it is a dark brown with gold glitter. it applies smoothly and looks identical to the pan color. it is very pigmented and blends super duper easily. you don't need to dig into the pan to get a good amount of color at all.   triple fudge is an extremely dark, matte brown. it's almost black. it has a bit of a harder texture with swatching. when swatching, this color is a bit hard to get a good amount of with your finger, and develops a weird film over it when using your finger.when using a brush, it is easier to pick up product but still not as easy as most of the other colors. it blends pretty well, but i would still advise using a lighter brown with it to form more of a gradient.    salted caramel is a weird color to describe. it's sort of a lighter brown, with more pink-orange/peachish tones, and is matte. it's a very buttery and easy to pick up shadow. it's pretty easy to blend out and leaves a beautiful flush of color when used between the brow bone and the crease. it's a super duper awesome transfer color.    marzipan is a peachy champagne shimmery color. it has a smooth, buttery texture but is also a bit powdery. the color has to be built up on paler skintones. it could be used as a wonderful highlight on darker skin. it blends with amazing ease. super pretty color, imo.    semi-sweet is a medium brown matte shade. it's almost a mid-shade between milk chocolate and triple fudge. it has a very buttery, smooth texture. it's amazingly pigmented and easy to apply for a matte shade, and is probably the easiest matte in this palette to work with, and the easiest matte to work with that i've ever found. it's pretty easy to blend out.   strawberry bon bon is a matte light pink color. it has a very buttery and smooth texture. it takes quite a bit to build this product up. it's not a supremely pigmented pink and isn't very visible on my pale skin, but might do better on darker skintones. it blends easily (at least into my skin color, but i cannot vouch for others).   candied violet is a beautiful, glittery purple. it has a bit of a pink sheen and pink sparkles. it has a rougher, glittery texture, but is still rather smooth. it's got some fallout and takes a bit to build it up into full opacity. it's not the most pigmented color in the palette for sure, but it still has quite good pigment. it's a beautiful color that blends easily, but gets to where it's basically just glitter if you blend it out too much.   amaretto is a reddish brown shimmer, or a brown with a slightly rust colored sheen. it's a shimmer eyeshadow. it's pretty smooth and buttery, but not overly smooth in texture. it's very well pigmented and blends very very smoothly with no patches or disturbances.    hazelnut is a beautiful shimmery brown with a golden sheen (with a hint of reddish brown undertone). it's got a wonderful, smooth and buttery texture that just glides on the skin. it's sooooooooo pigmented and just amazing. probably one of my favorite shades. blends like a complete dream.   creme brulee is such a gorgeous gold shimmer. it's half the reason i even got this palette. it has a smooth but not quite buttery texture. it's very very well pigmented and it's by far my favorite shade in the palette. it's so wonderful, you won't even understand unless you experience if first hand. it's not too yellow or too orange, it is the perfect gold. it blends like... angels personally came down from heaven and blended it for me.   haute chocolate is a true brown shimmer with golden sheen. it's got a buttery and smooth texture. it's very similar to hazelnut, but lacks the rusty undertone. it's amazingly pigmented and blends with no difficulty.   cherry cordial is a matte-based darker red-brown shadow with a small amount of small gold glitter. it's got a tougher texture from the glitter combined with the matte quality. it's got the same pigment as the rest of the mattes, which is pretty great. it's not very easy to blend at all. it takes some time to get the color even when blending.   champagne truffle is a wonderful shimmery, pink-toned white. it's got a buttery smooth texture. it's very pigmented, especially for a white. i love to sheer it out and dab a little bit of it on my face for a shimmery highlight. it blends out wonderfully and makes a great highlight for any skintone.",1,0,1

543748,"henry leaned back in the lawn chair he'd set up for his garage sale. some of the blue and white hard plastic straps had come loose and were stinging the raw red hair on his bared legs. on another man the glowing orange shorts he wore would have looked hideous. with his sickly white skin, they just looked unfortunate.    before him were half a dozen tables filled with dusty relics of all shapes and sizes. his grandfather's collection of old watches. stained baseball cards and comic books. twenty or so musty smelling beany babies his grandmother had been sure would make her rich. all he owned and had ever owned was spread out like a moldy buffet for sinners.    it was late in the afternoon. most of the serious hunters had come and gone. he had eighty eight cents in his pocket from a couple of paperback romances one old woman had bought. he was just about to pack up when she appeared.    she held a bust of garfield. he was so covered in dust he looked brown rather than orange. she looked like a two dimensional sort of girl. skinny arms and legs. hands that trembled around the ceramic she held. big blue eyes behind square red frames.    ""how much?"" she asked.     ""fifty bucks,"" he said.    she rolled her eyes. ""this is barely worth a dollar mister.""    he eyed her black converse sneakers. someone had drawn clouds on the white space. ""the head pops off. a while back my grandmother kept my grandfather's ashes in that thing. she said he liked to travel. took him on cruises and everything. it's got sentimental value.""    she tapped her nails on her pink plastic purse. ""i'll give you twenty and you throw in that set of dinner plates with the hot peppers wearing top hats on them.""    henry cocked his head. ""deal,"" he said.    the girl took off in her yellow bug, leaving henry alone again. he was waiting for the jogger. she always came around 3. bouncing in her blue lycra suit. such a plump mouthful.    he gave up at four fifteen. he packed his junk into clear plastic boxes, hauling them once again to the garage. next month he might just bring everything to the junkyard and let it be crushed to dust.    the rain started that night.    henry hated driving in the rain. his eyes were weak and he often saw misty shadows walking along the pavement. he hated walking in the rain. that feeling of being wet and cold. it reminded him of things he'd rather not dwell on.    for days it rained. weeks. almost two months of constant rain.    he knew it was a sign. he wished he'd followed that jogger.    he went to a nearby supermarket to get some fruit and food for his beta fish when he saw her. the girl from the garage sale. the one with the cloudy sneakers. she was kneeling near the bread, squeezing a loaf of dark colored wheat bread.    henry couldn't take his eyes off of her shoes.    he followed her to the parking lot. her car was easy to keep track of. like a moving sun drifting through traffic. she stopped at all the stop signs. all the yellow lights. signaled when she was turning. he was careful not to let her see him. it was all so easy.    she got out at a small cottage with lemon colored shades over the windows. she wore no raincoat and carried no umbrella. he watched her race into the cottage, carrying plastic bags in each hand.     for days he watched. no room mate. no dog. no cat. no boyfriend.    on mondays and wednesdays she went to the local community college and after studied at the library. on tuesdays and thursdays she worked at an animal shelter. friday through sunday she stayed home. mostly eating takeaway and watching animal planet.    her name was melanie brooks. and she would make the rain stop.    friday night henry took his rope and his knives and his ash and his roll of duct tape. he made sure the latch in his trunk was secure. he'd had problems with it before and he didn't want to repeat them.    melanie brooks was in her living room with a bowl of lucky charms and a glass full of coke and rum. she'd considered perhaps baking or frying something for dinner but that seemed too much work. the room was dark as she watched flickering images of golden retriever puppies frolic on the television screen.    she wanted a puppy so badly. her dog, rin, had been hit by a car a few months ago and it still felt too soon to replace him. beside her on the couch sat the bust of garfield she'd bought at the strange man's garage sale. now clean, it almost glowed orange in the dark.    she heard a noise come from the back of the house. something like the snap of a firecracker. she put her bowl down and went to check it out. the back door was open. she was sure she'd closed it. she wasn't sure if she'd locked it or not.    maybe she hadn't closed it? this constant rain was driving her up the walls. she had a leak in her roof that she hadn't been able to afford to get fixed yet so there was a constant drip drip drip as the water fell into a bucket she'd put in her bedroom.    she turned to go back to the living room. a hand came over her mouth and nose. she screamed but no sound escaped.    ""don't worry. this will go a lot easier if you don't panic so much,"" a voice crooned in her ear. she struggled, getting weaker and weaker from the lack of air. the dark came upon her like a newly tarred road.    when she woke she smelled wood. and rain. she couldn't move. her hands were tied around a tree. the rain fell onto the canopy of trees above her, dropping only an occasional smattering of rain.     henry stood across from her. he wore an odd pair of rubber pants. his face was awash in sweat. it poured down his red nose and red cheeks. he knelt on the ground, drawing a circle with ash from his hand.    ""you're awake!"" he said. ""that's good. it's always better when they're awake. i bet you have many questions. they all do. let me just finish my skath here and then we'll begin.""    he sounded much more cheerful than when she'd bought the garfield from him. it was almost like it was his birthday. his watery brown eyes gleamed as he drew symbols within the four corners of the circle.     melanie wiggled her wrists inside the bindings. she had small wrists and hands. she thought she might be able to get free. if only he'd keep talking.    ""these are my grandfather's ashes. i save them for special occasions like this. my grandmother insisted she be buried next to him even though the plot is empty. she was such a useless woman,"" henry said. he straightened up, dusting his hands off on those gleaming pants.    ""well i can't say useless. i suppose she did have a use. remember that blizzard in ninety-eight? it snowed so hard. so hard. until she died. i can't say i meant to push her down those stairs. she kept screeching about money of all things. like some old woman needed all that money. the minute she died, the snow stopped.""    he moved over to a bag near the ash circle. he took out a sharp looking knife almost as big as his arm.    ""then there was the drought we had a few years ago. droughts are almost as bad as blizzards. nothing grows. you have to ration water. my lawn was this horrible shade of brown. i'm sure i could have stopped at one or two of the children. but you can't leave kids with no parents and no siblings. that's just plain cruel.""    henry brought the knife just under melanie's chin. it pierced the soft flesh there. she felt her blood warm and wet sliding down her neck.    ""it's more of a science than anything. controlling the weather. i discovered my skath later. it functions as a power circle. makes it easier. as long as i find the right one. the right one.""    behind the gag she thought she screamed. she couldn't hear anything over the pounding of her heart. her wrists were almost free. she felt the rope burn along the already abused skin.    ""i had this other girl in mind. blonde and pretty. bouncy, like a ball children play with. i can see now that you're much more interesting. she might not have worked. we might have been stuck with this damned rain for another month."" he grinned, revealing yellow teeth. a piece of green was stuck between the front two. he'd be furious if he noticed.    ""as much as i've enjoyed our conversation i'm afraid it has to end. you'll bleed out over there on my circle. the rain will stop. i can have my garage sales again. i wonder if i should reduce the price on those beanie babies? she loved those horrible things.""    henry shrugged and thrust the knife into her side. melanie kicked him as hard as she could. she pulled the knife out. behind the gag she was screaming. still screaming. in anger or pain. she couldn't tell.    ""bitch!""    henry hit her across the face. she still held the knife. she slashed at his hands and arms. he hissed each time she cut.    ""it was going to be easy. now i'll have to hurt you. now you'll have to suffer,"" he said.     he punched her in the chest. she fell back, rolling over to avoid his feet as he kicked down at her. she slashed at his ankles, aiming for a tendon. he cursed, falling to his knees.    ""it hurts!""    melanie thrust down with the knife, sinking it into his chest and his neck as he wailed. eventually the wails turned into a gurgle. she ripped the tape from her lips.    she grabbed his arms, dragging him a few feet until he was in the circle. there, she made sure he was dead by slitting his throat from ear to ear.    the rain stopped.    melanie looked up at the green and thought of how beautiful the quiet was.    she cleaned the knife on henry's shirt and tucked it into her belt.",1,-1,

599631,"it started, as do most wars, over something small and inconsequential.  a single hamburger.  the chinese ambassador sat across the table, as he and the american president shared a meal.  they had decided that the best place to hold this summit was in iowa, away from the cameras, the big cities, the prying eyes of the public, and most importantly, the pressure of their governments.  so when they ordered their food, these two powerful men from opposite sides of the world decided that they could put aside their egos, and change history forever by sharing a single sandwich.  and so they did.  ethel had been living in ainsworth for most of her life.  she would be turning 55 this summer, although the undiagnosed cancer in her colon would make it a gruesome and painful departure.  the first signs of trouble began after her cousin jaylene shared some of her famous two alarm chili over labor day weekend, and poor ethel had the burning runs ever since.  visiting the toilet three and four times a day, she assumed the blood in her toilet was a byproduct of the cheap toilet paper she was forced to use in this tiny dive of a greasy spoon, and had heard from some of her regulars that hemorrhoids were common amongst women of her declining age.  still, it didn't explain the sweats and fatigue she was feeling, but grabbing a drink in the mop closet every now and then tended to make the day a little more bearable.  ever since her husband had left her for that slant eyed slut in coralville (just north on 218) and her disgusting mexican thai fusion concept that everyone in town was raging about, she'd hit the bottle pretty hard.  mr. wilkerson, the widower sitting at the bar, had lost most of his sense of smell along with his ability to control his inhibitions.  because of this, he demanded his coffee scorching hot, which was exactly how it was being served to him in the special pot that ethel had set aside.  topping off his cup, she gave a quick glance to his attire today.  mr. wilkerson was frequently spotted walking around town in his proper brown sport coat, camel colored fedora, and a nice double windsored knot on his heavily starched color, and nothing else, save for a pair of well polished leather shoes without socks.  not many people knew how the late mrs. wilkerson passed, but if one could submit into evidence the enormous and often semi-erect 8 and half inch long penis that he casually swung from behind a scraggly patch of now white pubic hair, the likely cause of death would have been either exhaustion or ecstasy.  fortunately for ethel and the other occupants of the ainsworth diner, mr. wilkerson had caged the monster in a pair of longjohns today, although he still wore his coat and tie, with his fedora occupying the seat next to him.  ""order up!"", shouted carl, the line cook.  there was nothing remarkable about carl at all.  his intelligence was slightly below average, as was his appearance.  in fact, in years to come the only thing anyone had to say about poor carl jackson was the horrible nature of how he died, and a certain paleness would sweep over their faces as they emphatically felt the long passed agony of the deceased man.  some winced and cringed inwardly.  others dismissed themselves from the conversation, and wept quietly.  but everyone was sincere in their hopes that if there was a god in heaven, he had taken mercy upon the everlasting soul of that poor man by ending carl's suffering.  grabbing the plate, ethel pivoted and swung gracefully about towards the end of the counter.  as she walked, a small, cancerous group of cells that had been matasticising in her bowel, broke free from the outer lining of her colon, and traveled into her left femoral artery.  in a matter of moments, it traveled the length of her leg, coming to the capillary juncture just below her knee, and having run out of room, promptly wedged itself firmly below the nerve cluster on the back of her leg.  the pain was instantaneous, and excruciating, as every fiber in her leg screamed out in agony.  immediately, her leg buckled, and as she traveled downward towards the floor, she did two things that would change the face of the earth forever.  the first was that she attempted to brace herself by using her hands, which were unfortunately occupied with a plate of hamburgers and a pot of hot coffee.  however, in her semi-drunken state, her coordination had suffered, and in an effort to catch her fall, she flung the plate out of her hand, aiming for the counter-top to her right.  this succeeded in saving at least one of the plates, but the inertia of her toss brought it's path straight into the scalding hot cup of mr. wilkerson's coffee.  in slow motion, the cup upended, it's angle silently twisting and turning in the air, as the inky black liquid spilled over the sides, and finally free from its prison of porcelain, it began cartwheeling out, directly on to the bulging white cotton loins of mr. wilkerson.  as the shocked and pained expression of mr. wilkerson slipped from view, obscured by the rapidly approaching floor, ethel struck her temple on the corner of the coffee machine, shattering the thin layer of bone, and emitting a sickening wet crunch as stainless steel invaded the space where soft brain tissue once was.  the sound was not unlike an osterich egg full of pudding being thrown against a glass window, and it was horrifying.  that is when the chaos began.  the scalding hot coffee pot in ethel's twitching hands upended and shattered, as she writhed on the floor, blood pouring from the open wound on her temple, as well as her mouth where the nearly severed remnants of her tongue flopped about while she suffered a massive seizure.  the flesh around her face immediately began blistering from the molten liquid.  mr. wilkerson moved faster than anyone ever expected, although it caught the eyes of the four secret servicemen standing outside the diner, looking inward.  from their vantage point, the old man stood up in a jolt, and began stripping from the waste down in a wild eyed panic.  his scream was dry and raspy, but horrifyingly high pitched.  clawing at the soaking longjohns, mr. wilkerson spun around and darted towards the bathroom, getting only two steps before noticing the untouched icewater sitting on the edge of the booth in front of the chinese ambassador.  as the secret servicemen burst through the door, the old man freed the now blistering and massive member from his torn long underwear, and gently but rapidly submerged it into the red plastic cup, displacing small chunks of ice and water onto the table below it.  his face wore an expression of agony, but then slackened as the cold started to take effect on his throbbing unit.  that was when the first bullet struck his cheek, tearing his nose and most of the flesh on his face from the impact, including his eye, splintering bits of bone from its ocular seat.  the second one struck his jaw, where it impacted with his dentures, tearing them from their gums, and altering the trajectory of the fired round down, and to the right, where it entered the neck of the chinese ambassador, severing his aorta.  as the body of mr. wilkerson slumped forward over the table and onto the ambassador, pinning his arms below the waist, a fountain of blood erupted from the wound in his neck, sending out an arc of crimson into the air.  the dislodged right eye of mr. wilkerson rolled around on to the table, it settled, and stared back at the stunned president.  the ambassadors convulsions and attempts to free himself from the weight of the dead man shifted the loose eye balls gaze, and following it down, the president and the corpse both shared a momentary glimpse at the red and blistered cock as it rested on the backhand of the most powerful man in the world.  ethel's body continued to convulse, and she shit herself.  as the secret servicemen pulled the president away, through the diner door, and into the black bulletproof gmc suburban waiting outside, a singular vision of a dead man's burnt penis resting peacefully on his hand, lingered in his head.  it was then he realized, that there would be consequences from this day.  that like a fast approaching storm, war was coming, and he would be the harbinger of death for billions.  that one word echoed in his traumatized mind over and and over.  meat.  the image once again flashed in his head.  peace.  there would be none. because now, in this world, with the gruesome deaths of carl, mr. wilkerson, ethel, the chinese ambassador, and the countless others that would follow, there would be no peace of meat, and idk if you think that that's ok, but it's not...  k?  thanks.",1,0,-1

( i know i'm redundant, just play along)   subject #a: my friend from kenya has dark colored skin, speaks swahili, is an athiest, and he has become a us citizen. he can properly be labeled african-american but, that is not his race.  subject 2: my friend from south korea has a pale-orange tinted skin, speaks english, was brought up jewish, is an american citizen by means of naturalization like ""#a"".   both of these people can be labeled american but, that word too has been wrongly used for so long it is also misleading. why? because, where exactly is america?   are we talking about south america, central or latin (another addition to the confusion) america? or does ""america"" only apply to the united states of america, which is located in north america. would you call a brazilian or a canadian an ""american""?   there are affirmative action laws in place that are for assisting minorities in the usa. but what constitutes one as a minority? according to the laws, you have to have dark skin or be unable to speak english...this now poses another question: isn't everyone a minority since everyone is unique? no person is the same as another, so the law is unjust in respect to any person with the aforementioned dispositions. genetics and how they expressed is not understood so, why are there laws respecting a specific set of genetic expressions? unjust. that is one little quagmire that could be sorted out by getting to the bottom of thos whole ""who's what race and why"" game.  i forgot to mention subject letter 3: he has skin, sometimes it's pale-pink/white, sometimes it's pink/orange. in the sun it can become quite red. he was born in the usa. he speaks the english language. has anscestors of many, many countries including native american (whose genes have recently been traced to those living in ne asia). now, this guy, has no other choice but to mark the ""white/caucasion"" box on a job application, federal questionaire, or internet dating sites. he wasn't born in the caucauses and he isn't casper the ghost. but, whenever anyone asks his nationality, it is ""american"". to add to the mess he is also a christian.  now, if you want to get confused, read further.  one day, subject letter 3 was conversing with subject #a. as subject #a has a few single sisters still living in kenya and subject letter 3 wishes to meet one and perhaps take one as a wife. this of course would consist of subject letter 3 moving to kenya and renouncing his us citizenship to stay. well, if all goes as planned, and subject letter 3 decides to apply for us citizenship after being a kenyan for a number of years, and is accepted...what would happen? would this ""white/caucasian""-skined, english-speaking, christian from kenya be considered as an african-american? would this allow him to qualify for college grants and/or subsidies? would he be a ""shoe-on"" for a good job because he can now utilize affirmative action and because he is now a minority? will they have to legally recognise him? would subject letter 3 now be able to check the ""african-american"" box on the forms?  see how complex this small little bit of rampant mis/dis-information becomes? it affects so many things, yet is complete and utter bullshit. why? because as a christain, and a member of the human race (we are all humans right?), i believe that adam and eve's genetics contained all or most (some wiggle-room for mutations) of the genes that compose humans today. divide all 6 billion peoe's genes into two people. kinda makes you wonder if that is why the original two lived for almost a thousand years each. and as they multiplied the lifespans dropped as the genes were seperated...  btw, i never intended to go to africa to marry my friend's sister, but i did tell him about my little plan...",1,0,0

842786,"my fiancé and i recently went on vacation in punta cana, dominican republic. while there, i decided to take advantage of the phenomenal prices to pick up a couple of rums that i have been really looking forward to trying: bermudez 1852 aniversario, and brugal 1888. the dominican style of rum is quite similar to other spanish style rums, such as those from cuba and puerto rico. these rums tend to be light and clean, with lots of woody oak character. the rums i have selected definitely follow this trend, and yet, they could not be more dissimilar. let’s have a look:  first up for review is the bermudez 1852 aniversario. this rum is made in limited batches and bottled only once each year, by the oldest distillery in the dominican: f. armando bermudez &amp; co. the rum is aged, as far as i can tell, for somewhere between 12 years and 15 years, in toasted white oak barrels. the label itself, while completely in spanish, boasts that this is a blend that is made with the most aged rums in the country. i was really excited to be bringing this one home, as it doesn’t seem to be a rum i could ever obtain on the east coast of canada. for $750 dominican pesos, ~$20 cad a bottle, i jumped at the chance.   **abv**: 40%  **in the bottle**: i love the green glass bottle that this comes in. to me, the bottle is antique looking and very similar in shape to an old champagne bottle. the label looks like it hasn’t been updated since they first started making the stuff and that’s just fine by me. the label boasts 12 award medals, going back to 1900. above the label is a slightly tacky looking, gold-coloured, plastic emblem featuring the company’s lion-head logo.   **in the glass**: the aniversario displays a deep gold hue in the glass, with what i swear is a slightly pink highlight. it’s rather light in colour for a well-aged rum, but this is not unusual for naturally coloured spirits. there’s definitely no e-150 here. the legs run nice and slow down the sides, but they’re not chunky. these are slim dancer’s legs, probably merengue dancer’s legs.  **nose**:  the nose is floral, very buttery, and earthy. i detect butterscotch, salt water taffy, a briny sea breeze note, coconut macaroon, flan con leche, sultana, nutmeg, a touch of coriander, cinnamon, lots of woody oak and vanilla, honey. there’s a smokiness too, as well as a slightly medicinal, iodine note that i often get from islay whisky, such as ardbeg, but it is much lighter and more delicate here. sweet and salty kettle corn, praline almonds, and a grassy sugar cane note. like /u/thefatrumpirate, i’m noting some similarities between this and the havana club 7, so much so that i had to try them back to back. i must say that while both rums share similar iodine tang on the nose,  i much prefer the smell of the aniversario. the hc 7 has a much sharper aroma that i find brittle and thin, while the bermudez is rich and warm and complex.  **taste**: very nice dry rum character with a soft, medium-light mouthfeel. lots of butterscotch, maple syrup (something i’ve never detected in a rum) and vanilla fudge, lindt dark chocolate (madagascar 70% cocoa),  fried banana, slightly tangy lemon rind, damp earth, fresh cut grass, golden brown sugar, baklava, dominican coffee (it must be the soil), and slightly briny.  **final thoughts**: a very pleasurable and well-crafted rum. this little beauty is complex, with well-defined aromas and flavours. like most dominican rums that i’ve tried, the overarching themes are: soft, refined, and smooth. when this bottle runs out i will desperately miss it and will have to find some way of getting my ass back to the dominican to pick up another bottle.  **grade**: 91/100  ------------------------------------------------- the brugal 1888 is a rum that claims to be tailor made for whisky lovers. this seems appropriate seeing as brugal was purchased, in 2008, by the edrington group, the same company that owns macallan and highland park. the influence on this rum is clear: a rum that is double aged, for at least 6 years in charred american white oak barrels that once housed bourbon, and again for another 2-4 years in ex-sherry butts. i purchased this one from a little corner store and it was roughly the same as what i would pay at home for this one: $2400 dominican pesos, or ~$63 cad. i loved the brugal xv, let’s see how this one stacks up.  **abv**: 38%  **in the bottle**: gorgeous and elegant bottle with the gold and blue label embossed directly onto the glass. the base of the bottle is super heavy and the stopper is quite possibly the best i’ve ever encountered: a tight fitting cork with a heavy gold-coloured metal topper. a small label affixed to above the base of the bottle indicates that this is a limited edition rum that was bottled in 2011, with a lot number of 2, as well as the barrels used: american and spanish oak. the rum within is deep, dark mahogany with a reddish hue.  **in the glass**: very viscous and oily, with fat, droopy legs that meander down the sides of the glass at a dominican pace (not rushing, very relaxed)  **nose**: big blast of sherry, almost aberlour a’bunadh-esque, minus the intense alcohol and barley sugar. i’m getting notes of brown sugar, orange zest, dolce de leche, bourbon-y vanilla notes, plump cherries, prunes, medjool dates, rum raisin ice cream, nutmeg, clove, allspice, cinnamon, young coconut pulp, mushy banana, orange marmalade, molasses on buttered brown bread, woody oak. all very clean, and full, and luscious.   **taste**: succulent stone fruits: cherries, apricots, medjool dates, as well as raisins, that vanilla from the bourbon cask, rich and fruity wild flower honey, marmalade, brown sugar, delicious sherry (of course). intriguingly, this rum is both dry and quite sweet in equal measures. like other rums from brugal, the mouthfeel on the 1888 is absolutely remarkable. the rumhowler described it as an, “ever-so light impression of baking soda… giving the spirit a softer than usual mouth feel”. that’s about right on, the rum glides across the tongue, providing a pleasant tactile experience to compliment the rich taste and deeply fragrant aroma.  **final thoughts**: i love this rum! the brugal 1888 is effectively the aberlour a’bunadh of rum for me, right now. the packaging is classy and unpretentious, the nose is full and clean, the taste is mouth-wateringly delicious (and again super refined and clean). it just ticks so many boxes. the only thing i regret is that the bottle i purchased in the dominican is only bottled at 38% abv. i could have purchased it at the local nblc for $70 at 40% abv. really, this rum should be bottled at 43% abv at the very least in order to ensure maximum flavour. regardless, this is still an outstanding rum.  **grade**: 92/100",0,,

(i'd argue that only pale-skinned east-asian are the ones who are actually white, and that europeans are typically pink.)  to be completely fair, that's an example of a pale white person and a tan japanese person.  here are some more pale japanese women, though they probably both have makeup on as well. [one](http://i.imgur.com/lbnyz.jpg), [two](http://i.imgur.com/zvddb.jpg)(huge resolution warning).  i do see the difference more, but i don't see how it relates to anime. looking through, very few characters have more pink skin.  still, i don't know why we're going on about this.",1,-1,
319080,"i haven't written a review in *weeks*.  let's change that with four of them.  more independents from lesser-known distilleries, all of which from hogshead casks (and, from my tasting notes, all bourbon cask)  number one: signatory longmorn 19 year old (46% abv). bottled from a single hogshead cask (#48480), at natural color and non chill-filtered. longmorn is a speysider.  i added no more than half a teaspoon of water and let it set up with a lid for about 15 minutes before nosing.  **nose:** furniture polish, orange sorbet, vanilla pudding, cherry popsicle, old dried herbs/leaves (i get maybe stale oregano or dry autumn leaves), antique wood, almond liqueur, fresh strawberry, slight menthol, fennel seed, old books, and a hint of old leather. a rather aged nose that collected itself nicely a few minutes after removing the lid and seems rather fruity for a non-sherry cask.  **taste:** a steady arrival with a bit of wood and a rich flavor. again, rather fruity for what one would assume to be a bourbon cask. orange sorbet, oaky vanilla, wood syrup, roasted almond, barrel char, butterscotch, and rich vanilla cream.  **finish:** tannin-filled and slightly bitter. vanillas and butterscotch end ashy, oaky, and dry with some burnt nuts and candied pecan.  **final notes:** a solid dram that has grown fairly oaky over time and seems to be missing some complexity. i think longmorn is a dram that would be better suited for the larger sherry butt. a chameleon of a nose that piqued my interest over time and a rich, nutty, and woody flavor. at times the wood and char notes take away from the more interesting parts of this dram.  **final score: 88/100**  ----------------------------------------------------------  number two: signatory caperdonich 18 year old (46% abv). bottled from a single hogshead cask at natural color and non chill-filtered. caperdonich (formerly glen grant #2, lol yes i'm serious...) was a speyside distillery mothballed in 2002.  my first 'dead distillery' tasting.  i added a drop of water and let it set up with a lid for about 10 minutes before nosing.  **nose:** vanilla, custard, and a soft briny quality. somewhat floral, and perhaps a bit of celery or something. lemon peel and hints at artificial apple, fruit cocktail and apple cider. light and well-integrated wood notes, glazed doughnut and a bit of paraffin wax.  **taste:** a very soft arrival that starts smooth and sweet. confectioner's sugar, honeyed sweet bread, those caramel bullseye things, apple juice and some fresh lemon (slightly bitter/sour). wood spice builds over time  **finish:** the wood spice hits pretty hard in here right before you swallow and moves through the finish. underneath it all there are more caramel cream notes, some vanilla, and a slight touch of salt. more dry wood tannin notes cling on the finish, fairly spicy and a bit leathery. pipe tobacco? the fruit kind of hides under all those spicy notes in the finish.  **more water?:** so i decided that wood tannins can often get displaced a bit by some more water in the whisky and have decided to add another teaspoon or so of water to see how we get on. appreciate the cloudy. anyway, the water has opened this up quite a bit. i get lined paper/wood pulp notes coming through now and the rest kind of eases up. less spice. it's certainly feels less claustrophobic now, but no significant new flavors emerge  **final notes:** not underwhelming. a well-aged malt that is solid for what it is, but nothing too special. i sure enjoyed it but probably wouldn't go out of my way to source a bottle. to me it's ""just another bourbon cask"". no bad scores here though.  **final score: 89/100**  ----------------------------------------------------------  number three: signatory glenlossie 19 year old (46% abv). bottled from a single hogshead cask (#3438) at natural color and non chill-filtered. i added a half teaspoon of water and let it set up with a lid for a few minutes before nosing. glenlossie is a speyside whisky, for those wondering.  also i'm an extra dram deeper from my usual review so i might get a little more colorful.  **nose:** ok give me a minute this keeps changing on me. here goes...  sawdust, decades old playing cards, a bit of some sort of white wine, fig newtons (especially the newton part), white grape, and some crisp red apple. also the obligatory vanillas and creams and such that you get from bourbon cask. aged but not quite ""hit-you-in-the-face-with-a-2x4"" woody. i think i'm starting to pick up on what it means to spend over 18 years in a hogshead (spoiler alert: it gets woody).  **taste:** it needed more water so i added about a half teaspoon. pretty damn fruity for a bourbon cask, could this be a sherry? let's not jump to conclusions. orangy and tangy with some caramel notes. light fruits (apple, white grape) and some wood spice.  **finish:** spicy but not too aggressive. more vanilla, caramel, and light fruit notes underneath plenty of wood spice and tannins. a slight sour note. lightly ashy. interesting.  **final notes:** a fruity and woody bourbon matured malt. a little too spicy on the finish for me but other than that it was really good. best one of these signatory malts i've tried so far.  **final score: 90/100**  ---------------------------------------------------------  number four: signatory bladnoch 16 year old (46% abv).  bottled from a single hogshead cask at natural color and non chill-filtered (like the rest of em).  i added a couple drops of water and let it set up for a few minutes before nosing.  don't worry i was sober as a fox for this one!  bladnoch is a lowland malt, and while is one of the least known, it makes some of the best malts from the region.  **nose:** wow, intriguing!  raspberry jam and cool whip.  a touch of earthy peat with surprisingly briny tones.  is this really a lowland?  sweet naval oranges, under-ripe pear, vanilla custard, and some hay.  some resinous tobacco too.  very well put together.  a hint of acetone and fresh ziplock bags, but all things considered those notes don't hurt this nose at all.  **taste:** again, this is delivering.  sweet vanilla custard notes with sweet oranges, pear, raspberry again(?!) and a bit of hay/grass.  some sea salt, unusually, but this is full and rich behind it.  honeyed pound cake or something with a bit of lemon?  earth and peat add a bit of a vegetal note but not at all like an islay, much less intrusive.  **finish:** full.  those soft after-dinner mints... you know the ones that chew up real easy and taste more like sugar than peppermint.  anise, vanilla, and a light ashy/earthy peat-type thing.  think springbank but even more subdued.  ends dry with a light charred oakiness and some light resinous pipe smoke.  **final notes:** is this a peated cask?  perhaps lightly peated bladnoch?  signatory made no mention of it but there's something peaty in here (unless i've totally lost it).  i've got no idea but it's a bit of a winner in my book.  not a total show-stopper but i would definitely pick up a bottle if i could.  **final score:  91/100** (the best one here!)  ---------------------------------------------------------  **a wrapup:**  signatory bottles some good and bad stuff, and honestly some of these malts were on the 'meh' side for me.  i say that because the full bottles weren't bargains, and these are the kind of scores that aren't mind-blowing.  the malts were more educational than anything, and it's good to note that a lot of single-cask hogsheads (particularly first-fill, regardless of whether sherry or bourbon) can get woody in their late teens/early twenties.  be wary of that and buy accordingly.  great education in these bottles though, for sure.  stay classy everybody.  slainte!  **edit:** i had done a ""quickie"" review on about half a dozen sips of the bladnoch many weeks ago.  it has since oxidized a bit and *really* opened, but initially i got some red pepper (cayenne?) and fennel seed notes that faded.  it's a perplexing dram that must have really changed on me.",0,,

925884,"the apartment only has one closet and when its door is open it appears to have been bricked shut, cask of amontillado-style, with very large flat red oblongs, each imprinted with the image of a venerable and yet oddly cheerful and yet somehow kind of hauntingly sad naval officer. the whole pallet load was shipped here several weeks ago by avi, in an attempt to lift randy’s spirits. for all randy knows more are still sitting on a manila dockside ringed with armed guards and dictionary-sized rat traps straining against their triggers, each baited with a single golden nugget.  randy selects one of the bricks from this wall, creating a gap in the formation, but there is another, identical one right behind it, another picture of that same naval officer. they seem to be marching from his closet in a peppy phalanx. ""part of this complete balanced breakfast,"" randy says. then he slams the door on them and walks with a measured, forcibly calm step to the living room where he does most of his dining, usually while facing his thirty-six-inch television. he sets up his san miguel, an empty bowl, an exceptionally large soup spoon—so large that most european cultures would identify it as a serving spoon and most asian ones as a horticultural implement. he obtains a stack of paper napkins, not the brown recycled ones that can’t be moistened even by immersion in water, but the flagrantly environmentally unsound type, brilliant white and cotton-fluffy and desperately hygroscopic. he goes to the kitchen, opens the fridge, reaches deep into the back, and finds an unopened box-bag-pod-unit of uht milk. uht milk need not, technically, be refrigerated, but it is pivotal, in what is to follow, that the milk be only a few microdegrees above the point of freezing. the fridge in randy’s apartment has louvers in the back where the cold air is blown in, straight from the freon coils. randy always stores his milk-pods directly in front of those louvers. not too close, or else the pods will block the flow of air, and not too far away either. the cold air becomes visible as it rushes in and condenses moisture, so it is a simple matter to sit there with the fridge door open and observe its flow characteristics, like an engineer testing an experimental minivan in a river rouge wind tunnel. what randy would like to see, ideally, is the whole milk-pod enveloped in an even, jacketlike flow to produce better heat exchange through the multilayered plastic-and-foil skin of the milk-pod. he would like the milk to be so cold that when he reaches in and grabs it, he feels the flexible, squishy pod stiffen between his fingers as ice crystals spring into existence, summoned out of nowhere simply by the disturbance of being squished.  today the milk is almost, but not quite, that cold. randy goes into his living room with it. he has to wrap it in a towel because it is so cold it hurts his fingers. randy takes the red box and holds it securely between his knees with the handy stay-closed tab pointing away from him. using both hands in unison he carefully works his fingertips underneath the flap, trying to achieve equal pressure on each side, paying special attention to places where too much glue was laid down by the gluing-machine. for a few long, tense moments, nothing at all happens, and an ignorant or impatient observer might suppose that randy is getting nowhere. but then the entire flap pops open in an instant as the entire glue-front gives way. randy hates it when the box-top gets bent or, worst of all possible worlds, torn. the lower flap is merely tacked down with a couple of small glue-spots and randy pulls it back to reveal a translucent, inflated sac. the halogen down-light recessed in the ceiling shines through the cloudy material of the sac to reveal gold—everywhere the glint of gold. randy rotates the box ninety degrees and holds it between his knees so its long axis is pointed at the television set, then grips the top of the sac and carefully parts its heat-sealed seam, which purrs as it gives way. removal of the somewhat milky plastic barrier causes the individual nuggets of cap’n crunch to resolve, under the halogen light, with a kind of preternatural crispness and definition that makes the roof of randy’s mouth glow and throb in trepidation.  the gold nuggets of cap’n crunch pelt the bottom of the bowl with a sound like glass rods being snapped in half tiny fragments spall away from their corners and ricochet around on the white porcelain surface. world-class cereal-eating is a dance of fine compromises. the giant heaping bowl of sodden cereal, awash in milk, is the mark of the novice. ideally one wants the bone-dry cereal nuggets and the cryogenic milk to enter the mouth with minimal contact and for the entire reaction between them to take place in the mouth. randy has worked out a set of mental blueprints for a special cereal-eating spoon that will have a tube running down the handle and a little pump for the milk, so that you can spoon dry cereal up out of a bowl, hit a button with your thumb, and squirt milk into the bowl of the spoon even as you are introducing it into your mouth. the next best thing is to work in small increments, putting only a small amount of cap’n crunch in your bowl at a time and eating it all up before it becomes a pit of loathsome slime, which, in the case of cap’n crunch, takes about thirty seconds.  he pours the milk with one hand while jamming the spoon in with the other, not wanting to waste a single moment of the magical, golden time when cold milk and cap’n crunch are together but have not yet begun to pollute each other’s essential natures: two platonic ideals separated by a boundary a molecule wide. where the flume of milk splashes over the spoon-handle, the polished stainless steel fogs with condensation. randy of course uses whole milk, because otherwise why bother? anything less is indistinguishable from water, and besides he thinks that the fat in whole milk acts as some kind of a buffer that retards the dissolution-into-slime process. the giant spoon goes into his mouth before the milk in the bowl has even had time to seek its own level. a few drips come off the bottom and are caught by his freshly washed goatee (still trying to find the right balance between beardedness and vulnerability, randy has allowed one of these to grow). randy sets the milk-pod down, grabs a fluffy napkin, lifts it to his chin, and uses a pinching motion to sort of lift the drops of milk from his whiskers rather than smashing and smearing them down into the beard. meanwhile all his concentration is fixed on the interior of his mouth, which naturally he cannot see, but which he can imagine in three dimensions as if zooming through it in a virtual reality display. here is where a novice would lose his cool and simply chomp down. a few of the nuggets would explode between his molars, but then his jaw would snap shut and drive all of the unshattered nuggets straight up into his palate where their armor of razor-sharp dextrose crystals would inflict massive collateral damage, turning the rest of the meal into a sort of pain-hazed death march and rendering him novocain mute for three days. but randy has, over time, worked out a really fiendish cap’n crunch eating strategy that revolves around playing the nuggets’ most deadly features against each other. the nuggets themselves are pillow-shaped and vaguely striated to echo piratical treasure chests. now, with a flake-type of cereal, randy’s strategy would never work. but then, cap’n crunch in a flake form would be suicidal madness; it would last about as long, when immersed in milk, as snowflakes sifting down into a deep fryer. no, the cereal engineers at general mills had to find a shape that would minimize surface area, and, as some sort of compromise between the sphere that is dictated by euclidean geometry and whatever sunken-treasure-related shapes that the cereal-aestheticians were probably clamoring for, they came up with this hard-to-pin-down striated pillow formation. the important thing, for randy’s purposes, is that the individual pieces of cap’n crunch are, to a very rough approximation, shaped kind of like molars. the strategy, then, is to make the cap’n crunch chew itself by grinding the nuggets together in the center of the oral cavity, like stones in a lapidary tumbler.",0,,

796025,"1. money isn't made out of paper; it's made out of cotton.  actually, us currency paper is a blend of cotton and linen.  2. the 57 on heinz ketchup bottle represents the varieties  of pickles the company once had.  false. h j heinz's own story is that he liked an ad that said  ""21 different styles of shoes."" he had well more than 57  varieties of product, but he liked the number because it  sounded large without sounding huge.  3. your stomach produces a new layer of mucus every two weeks  -- otherwise it will digest itself.  true  4. the declaration of independence was written on hemp paper.  the first two drafts were written on hemp paper. about  200 copies of the declaration were printed (25 survive) on  paper that may or may not contain hemp. a calligraphic copy  was made after the printing and signed; this is the document  on display in philadelphia. it is on vellum parchment (animal skin).  5. the dot over the letter 'i' is called a ""tittle"".  true  6. a raisin dropped in a glass of fresh champagne will bounce  up and down continuously from the bottom of the glass to the top.  sometimes, depending on the raisin and the champagne. after  a while it becomes soaked and sinks to the bottom and you have  to suck it up with a straw.   7. susan lucci is the daughter of phyllis diller.  false, though diller does have a daughter named suzanne.  8. a duck's quack doesn't echo ... no one knows why.  false  9. 40% of mcdonald's profits come from the sales of happy meals.  probably false. profits are one thing, sales another. though the  60s and 70s, major profits came through real estate and franchise  fees. over the last few years mcdonald's has found it tough to be  profitable. happy meals, introduced 1979, were a major sales  boost, but so were mcnuggets (1984). as a share of sales, happy  meals probably aren't 40% except for unusual short term spurts  (such as the teeny beanie toy that sold out in two weeks) though  mcd's sells enough to be one of the world's major distributors of  small toys.  10. every person has a unique tongue print (no licking at the  scene of a crime!).  more or less true.  11. 315 entries in webster's 1996 dictionary were misspelled.  ""webster's"" is not a copyrighted term. any dictionary can call  itself webster's. so which one of hundreds misspelled words?  12. the 'spot' on 7up comes from its inventor who had red eyes.  he was albino.  false. 7up, created by non-albino charles grigg and originally  known as ""bib-label lithiated lemon-lime soda,"" was introduced  two weeks before the great stock market crash of 1929. in 1936,  the name became 7up. the logo had a white ""7up"" on a rectangular  red background for many years. sometimes, on specific products,  the background was a red circle. the circle became a dot around  1970.   13. on average, 12 newborns will be given to the wrong parents  daily.  seriously doubtful.  14. during the chariot scene in 'ben hur' a small red car can  be seen in the distance.  false. not only does the red van not appear during the chariot  race, but its appearance would have been literally impossible... since the background outside the arena is actually a mattte  painting!(see the 1994 documentary, ""ben hur: the making of an epic"").   15. warren beatty and shirley maclaine are brother and sister.  true  16. chocolate affects a dog's heart and nervous system; a few  ounces will kill a small sized dog.  true. ferrets, too.  17. orcas (killer whales) kill sharks by torpedoing up into  the shark's stomach from underneath, causing the shark to explode.  only if you believe flipper. killer whales breach through ice,  so they have the capacity to do this, but they seldom battle  sharks. no one has ever witnessed an exploding shark.  18. most lipstick contains fish scales.  true (""pearlessence"" is derived from fish scales).  19. donald duck comics were banned from finland because he  doesn't wear pants.  false. nor were they banned because donald and daisy  weren't married.  20. ketchup was sold in the 1830s as medicine.  true (dr. miles compound extract of tomato)  21. upper and lower case letters are named 'upper' and 'lower'  because in the time when all original print had to be set in  individual letters, the 'upper case' letters were stored in  the case on top of the case that stored the smaller,  'lower case' letters.  true  22. leonardo da vinci could write with one hand and draw with  the other at the same time.  supposedly true but not reported by an eye-witness.  23. because metal was scarce, the oscars given out during  world war ii were made of wood.  false, they were made of plaster.  24. there are no clocks in las vegas gambling casinos.  true (or used to be).  25. the name wendy was made up for the book peter pan, there  was never a recorded wendy before!  false  26. there are no words in the dictionary that rhyme with: orange,  purple, and silver!  true regarding a ""perfect rhyme."" however ""orange"" and ""silver""  have half-rhymes (such as lozenge with orange and salver with  silver), are technically speaking, pararhymes, or considered a  half-rhyme.  words that rhyme with ""purple"" are steve urkel,  hurtful, circle and are also ""half-rhymes."".  27. leonardo da vinci invented scissors. also, it took him  10 years to paint mona lisa's lips.  false. scissors were around for centuries before da vinci and  he worked on the mona lisa, off and on, for three or four years.  28. a tiny amount of liquor on a scorpion will make it instantly  go mad and sting itself to death.  false. the notion of a scorpion stinging itself to death is an  ancient allegory. that is, if it is surrounded by fire or by  enemies, or even if one puts liquor or alcohol on a scorpion  that these things will cause it to sting itself is a falsehood.  it is untrue since the venom has no effect on the scorpion itself,  nor on any member of the same species.  29. the mask used by michael myers in the original ""halloween""  was a captain kirk mask painted white.  true  30. if you have three quarters, four dimes, and four pennies,  you have $1.19. you also have the largest amount of money in  coins without being able to make change for a dollar.  true  31. by raising your legs slowly and lying on your back, you can't  sink in quicksand.  true. the fact is that most people can float on quicksand. it  actually holds you up better than water. if you ever find yourself  stuck in quicksand, try not to panic. try gently falling backward  spread-eagled. you may eventually have to roll or swimvery slowly to solid ground.if you find yourself only in quicksand up to your  waist, you will experience a vacuum when trying to remove your leg  from the quicksand. to release the vacuum, slowly move your leg.  remember, quick movements will make the situation worse.  32. the phrase ""rule of thumb"" is derived from an old english law,  which stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider  than your thumb.  false. this notion was invented in 19th century britain to defend  the notion of wife-beating. it was soon shown to be a fallacy.  ""rule of thumb"" comes from the fact that the final thumb joint is  about an inch, so is used as a rough measuring guide. ""thumb"" and  ""inch"" are the same word in several european languages (french,  danish, swedish, etc.)  33. american airlines saved $40,000 in '87 by eliminating one  olive from each salad served in first class.  true  34. the first product motorola started to develop was a record  player for automobiles. at that time, the most known player on the  market was the victrola, so they called themselves motorola.  false. the company was founded by paul v. galvin as the galvin  manufacturing corporation, in chicago, illinois, in 1928. its  first product was a ""battery eliminator,"" allowing consumers to  operate radios directly from household current instead of the  batteries supplied with early models. in the 1930s, the company  successfully commercialized car radios under the brand name ""motorola,""  a word suggesting sound in motion.  35. celery has negative calories! it takes more calories to eat  a piece of celery than the celery has in it to begin with. it's  the same with apples!  true. (but it's not just the chewing; it's the chewing and the  digesting that burns up the 6 calories per stalk).  36. chewing gum while peeling onions will keep you from crying!  the latest how-to-peel-onions-without-crying trick!  false (but your breath will smell better).  37. the glue on israeli postage stamps is certified kosher.  not really. israel, like the us, uses vegetable glue on its  stamps. theoretically everything in israel is kosher, but  this is now a political issue with ""true"" kosher shops  hanging out haredi signs.  38. guinness book of records holds the record for being the book  most often stolen from public libraries.  false. the american library association did a survey a few years  ago. according to larra clark, ala press officer, the titles  most likely to go awol (absent without librarian) are books  about dreams, witchcraft, astrology and the occult.  39. back in the mid to late 80's, an ibm compatible computer  wasn't considered a hundred percent compatible unless it could  run microsoft's flight simulator game.  sort of. in 1983, when flight simulator was introduced, standards  were still a bit loose. if your machine could run flight simulator  and lotus 1-2-3, then it was probably compatible.  40. astronauts are not allowed to eat beans before they go into  space! passing wind in a space suit damages them.  false. three days before a flight, astronauts are put on a ""low  residue diet"" so their diaper-style undies won't fill up so fast.  if gas could damage a space suit there'd be a lot more astronaut  fatalities. in 1968 the new york academy of sciences held a  symposium on gastrointestinal gas, in part to examine fears  that astronauts might asphyxiate themselves. as we all know,  they don't.",0,,

(going top left to right, middle left to right, and so on…)  * the first shadow is a gorgeous navy-black color. it has royal blue sparkles throughout it. it’s not very creamy, and is a bit chalky unfortunately. but once it’s on, the shadow isn’t going anywhere, as for the sparkles, that’s a different story! the just seem to go on (sometimes) and stay there for a few minutes, then disappear.   * the second color is this white-snowflake color in the pan and looks shimmery and pearlized. this shadow totally changes on the skin though! it’s actually a translucent silver-y glitter/shimmer type of shadow. this shadow is also not very easy to apply, but it really is beautiful once it’s on.    * the third color is a pearlized copper color. it looks just like a brand-new penny! and as true to too faced, they knock yet another neutral color out of the park! this is such an amazingly beautiful and blendable shadow. it’s buttery and smooth, and would look great as a lid color for anyone’s eyes.   * the fourth (second row, on the left) is a pewter-like color in the pan. on the skin it has a golden tint to it. yet again, since it’s neutral too faced blew me away! it’s blendable and buttery, and is beautifully pearlized. * the fifth is an interesting shade choice, imo, a pearlized bubblegum pink! it’s very fun and cute. i could see myself using this on my lid and blending possibly a copper eyeshadow (read: number 3!) on my lid. not for everyone, or every day, but still a fun color to include.  * sixth is a pearlized purple shadow. it’s not as smooth as the neutrals, but pretty decent. it has good pigmentation and lasting power.   * seventh is my personal favorite of the palette. i’m a sucker for gold, and boy is this a beautiful shade of gold! i compared it to honey pot, and the two are totally different. it’s darker and more gold than honey pot. it’s a very true gold. it’s buttery and smooth and beautiful to blend. i cannot wait to wear this color!  * eighth is a chocolate brown color, with some gold shimmers in it. this one was pretty surprising to me, as tf is normally amazing with neutrals, but it was chalky! it was hard to get on my brush and hard to apply. this one was definitely not a winner.   * ninth is a pretty aquamarine blue with blue shimmer. it’s pretty pigmented but also not very bendable or smooth. the shimmer does not last long with this color as well.  the two large matte shades are between the shadows and bronzer. they would likely work as all-over colors for most people. the first one is a white/cream color and the second is a tan/taupe color. both are very light, smooth, and silky.   the bronzer (seen next in the photo with the tarte blushes) is interesting. it’s pearlized and almost like a copper color. i haven’t made up my mind about this bronzer yet. i really would like to see it on my face before i make a final verdict, but from what i can tell copper usually means orange, and orange for contouring or bronzing generally isn’t a good thing. if it doesn’t work out as a bronzer, it would make for  a lovely shadow though!  the blush is another version of bubblegum pink that i will probably not have much use for (personal, again). it’s deeper in color than the tarte blush, and it has been surprisingly long lasting (holding up with the tarte blushes). it’s shimmery, which the tarte blush is not.   so, overall i think it’s money well spent, but it’s all relative for everyone. i would suggest it as a stocking stuffer (especially if you think you or whoever would use the case), because this is also a pretty universal palette. some shades are duds, yes, but the ones that blew me away more than made up for the others. 10/10 would buy again!  so, for my lips this christmas, i went ahead and took everyone’s word on purchasing sephora’s cream lip stain in always red. it was easy to apply, and has been on for about 5 hours now and has not needed a touch up. it hasn’t smeared (despite the fact that i always forget that i have on lip stain) or come off on myself or anything else. i did use a primer and lip liner, but if that’s all it takes for all-day color, sign me up (the price was nice, too!)  last but surely not least, i purchased sephora’s long-lasting 12hr wear eye liner in 05 metallic gold (whew that’s a mouthful). i wanted this to try the coveted “gold and black double winged liner and red lips christmas look” that we see every year. the liner was easy to use, super pigmented, and shows up really well. it definitely gives my eyes a nice little “pop” against the red lip.   so, if you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading! please, if you have any questions or suggestions for swatches, let me know! i’m always happy to help out a fellow mua. happy haulidays!",0,,

410382,"i'll write this as if i'm helping a first-time user, so as to not exclude anyone. i'm a *huge* proponent of safe tanning (no beds! no sun!), so i will shamelessly write a thesis for you all.  first step: hop in a hot shower. skin gets soft and warm, pores open up. use a [bristled body brush](http://www.amazon.com/kingsley-natural-bristle-contoured-wooden/dp/b0016isd04/ref=pd_sim_bt_6) to exfoliate. wash cloths, synthetic ""puffs"", and the like don't cut it. lather the brush with soap/bodywash, and brush vigorously and thoroughly from the tips of your toes to the chin. rinse the brush and reapply soap/bodywash as needed to keep the lather rich. spend extra time on heels and toes, as well as knee caps, elbows, and finger knuckles. i then use a clarisonic or textured facial scrub on my face. i spend 10-15 minutes exfoliating the whole body. it can be mind-numbingly boring, so to motivate myself i also treat it as a self-massage session and remind myself that thorough body brushing encourages blood stimulation and discourages varicose and spider veins. this keeps me going. rinse soap off.  towel off to totally dry skin. put hair up so that neck and face are accessible.  on the bathroom counter have a box of latex/non-latex/vinyl gloves (whatever suits your skin sensitivities), the bottle of tanning product, and a bottle of generic un-tinted body lotion. full length mirror helps, too, to admire yo'self while you apply.  body: put gloves on both hands. squirt a dollop of body lotion, about the size of a us quarter, into the palm of one hand, and then squirt however many pumps of tanning foam you like, depending on the level of saturation of color that you'd like for that body area (more foam=more color). massage the mixture together in hands, and then massage it from the ankle to the knee. repeat mixture, and massage from the knee to the bikini line. repeat on other leg. repeat mixture and massage onto belly and breasts, arms, lower back, shoulders, neck, booty, etc.   feet: mix lotion and foam, massage onto tops of feet and toes. i always use less tanning foam on my feet, because the heels and the toe knuckles present a risk of uneven color distribution (calloused or thick skin absorbs the dye in a funky way). the more foam you use, the more obvious the uneven effect may be.  face: mix lotion with a night cream or the generic body lotion, and massage up to and a little bit past and into the hairline, as well as under the chin. this eliminates a tell-tale line. i apply it everywhere; eyelids, under eyes, to the lip line, etc.  back: i put the mix on a hand, and i reach between my shoulder blades [like this](http://imgur.com/7lhw4d0), and other in variations, and awkwardly wipe it around. it will involve gymnastics, but you can do it.  hands: hands are the last step. snap off the gloves. rinse corn starch off your hands, if the gloves were lined with it. i wad up some toilet paper, squirt a mix of lotion and tanning foam on top, and squash it down onto the top of my hand. mush it around for a second into something consistent, and then begin massaging it away onto each individual finger, using the wad of tp as your massaging ""tool"". massage it thoroughly over whole hand. repeat on the other hand. obviously, do not apply to the palm or to the underside of fingers. make sure that you're already done any washing for the day that involves your hands, b/c if you get them wet at this point the color will rinse off immediately. hands must marinate; be a princess for the rest of the night. don't massage the color into your hands using bare fingers. nothing gives fake tan away faster than brown finger tips.  at this point, you may be disappointed with the depth of color. don't fret. the dye hasn't ""developed"" yet. you must marinate overnight first! that's when the color gains strength.   sleep on it.  wake up, look in the mirror, gasp at how ridiculously bright your color looks, plan hate mail to /u/audioboner.  wash skin thoroughly in a shower. it will look like a lot of the color is going down the drain. that's normal. your skin will have absorbed over night all the color that it's capable of absorbing. everything else must go down the drain.  step out, look in the mirror, sigh in relief to see that your color is now a natural golden hue.  treat yo'self to a good lather of your daily body lotion. just like with a sun-made tan, tans from a bottle look their best when your skin is moisturized. failing to moisturize your skin will make your bottle tan look dull, and it will decrease the longevity of your bottle tan by encouraging the loss of skin cells. moisturizer makes the color pop. moisturize every day. to quote carla bruni ""my job description is to moisturize"".  notes:   i use the mixture of body lotion and tanning product because the tanning product i use does not moisturize alone, and after a thorough exfoliation your skin will likely absorb the dye better if it's moisturized as well. when i've used tanning product alone on freshly exfoliated skin, the dye did not develop as well.  i am a blue eyed white girl with very pale skin and freckles. i use the ""dark"" formula of tanning foam, because i like to look like i've been in mexico for a month. i use a ratio of one quarter's worth of generic body lotion to three pumps of dark tanning foam for each section of my body (ankle to knee, knee to bikini line, etc.). when i wake up after a night of ""marinating"", my fiance says i look like robert downey jr's character in tropic thunder, but after i've showered it away i have a tasteful and very convincing medium/deep tan. mine fades to my natural skin color by 8-10 days post-application, at which point i repeat the process.  i *only* apply the tanning lotion before bed. as the color develops over the subsequent hours after application (i.e. the ""marinating"" period), i think that it becomes too bright and fake looking to wear in public. it's not subtle. st.moritz (the brand i use) does not stain sheets, so that isn't an issue for me. but it will rub off slightly onto any fabric/sheets your body touches (another reason to not apply it during the day). in the morning there will be a slight orange/brown tinge on your sheets where you slept. no big deal. throw 'em in the washer. it will come out.",1,,1

489104,"i can't speak for the wispy, effeminate jesus i see in many western paintings (here's [my least favorite](http://www.thecatholictruth.info/jesus_knocking_at_ur_door1.jpg).) i do know that in coptic and ethiopian iconography christ is usually portrayed as dark.  the oldest surviving icon of the type called pantocrator is from the mid 500s ad, probably made at constantinople, now at st catherine's monastery at sinai. [in that icon](http://silouanthompson.net/images/pantocrator-sinai-600.jpg), christ has quite dark hair, but the skin tone is *extremely* white. i suspect this is a feature of how the [encaustic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encaustic_painting) colors have aged rather than the original intent.  in byzantine iconography christ is usually fair of skin and most often has light hair - and, not uncommonly, blue eyes. (here's [a collection](http://www.ellopos.net/gallery/christ/default.asp).) that's a bit of an eyebrow-raiser since the oldest byzantine iconographers are palestinians, syrians, and greeks.  but homer describes a number of his characters as being ""red-haired"" including menelaus and achilles. xenophanes (5th cent. bc) describes the thracians as blue-eyed and red haired. plutarch describes the macedonian alexander's fair complexion and ruddy [skin or hair?] color. adamantius judaeus around 350 ad described the greeks in his physiognomika as dark blond/light brown (*ypoxanthous*) and light eyed. since then, a millennium or two of invasions, migrations, jihads and crusades has stirred up the genetics so modern greeks seldom resemble those descriptions any more.  in south asia, especially in nepal, i noticed that skin color was a social marker: higher castes usually had lighter skins, while manual laborers were of the lowest castes and very darkest skins (even in midwinter, not just because of sun.) women's cosmetics there included skin-*lighteners.*  i wonder if, in byzantine culture, light skin was likewise a sign of higher social class? here in north america, most of what we're taught to call beautiful is *white* beauty, which affects what children of many ethnicities consider beautiful (see [the clark doll experiment](http://abagond.wordpress.com/2009/05/29/the-clark-doll-experiment/).) that might account for generations of black-haired, olive-skinned epirote, syrian and palestinian iconographers depicting christ with light-colored features. (disclaimer: just a guess.)  for what it's worth, here are some images of jesus by chinese iconographers:   * [chinese christ](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/chinesejesus.jpg)   * [resurrection](http://www.internetmonk.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/resurrection-chinese.jpg)   * [theotokos and christ](http://s3.hubimg.com/u/147210_f248.jpg)",1,0,1

755569,"* step one:  go to an asian market and buy 10-15 lbs of beef or veal bones.   * step two: roast those bitches in the oven for an hour at 425. throw some mirepoix (carrots, onion, celery) in there with 20 minutes to go. throw in half a can of tomato paste if you want some extra glutamates in the mix (a couple tablespoons of thai fish sauce works too).  * step three: pour the grease out of the pan and dump the bones and aromatics in the biggest pot you have that will still fit in your oven. * step four: fill the pot up with cold water and bring it to a simmer, then put it in your oven overnight at 250 degrees (f). * step five: when you wake up, add a bouquet garni (with fresh thyme, bay leaves, and parsley) to the pot and return it to the oven for another hour.   * step six: strain the (now amazing, incredibly rich and delicious) beef broth through a chinois, cheesecloth, or even just a colander. * step seven: congratulations, you've finished the hard part.  now save a quart or two for your soup and freeze the rest.  now you'll have enough rich, gelatinous beef broth on hand to moisten your girl's or your boy's (or if you're a baller, both of their) panties anytime you're feeling soupy. * step eight: thinly slice and slooooowly caramelize a fuckload of onions (mostly yellow, but i like to throw in a red one or two and a half pound of shallots) in some butter and olive oil. this step should take at least forty minutes over low heat. * step nine: add that damn beef broth.  you'll be pissed at it now, because this takes more work than a bowl of soup should ever take. if you would like to deglaze the pan first with brandy and/or wine (white or red, it doesn't matter), now is the time to do so.  * step ten: bring that bitch to a simmer for 20 minutes (or a few hours). * step eleven: while the soup is simmering, make some rusks out of some decent bread (french, ciabatta, sourdough, whatever) by toasting some 1 inch slices in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes or so, until the bread is lightly golden brown. * step twelve: pour the soup into warmed, individual oven safe serving bowls (i just use some cheap souffle ramekins i got at restaurant depot). * step thirteen: top the ramekins with the rusks, and cover with some good quality cheese. take your pick of cheeses: i like gruyere or comte, but swiss or even cheddar will work in a pinch. * step fourteen: put the ramekins under the broiler until the cheese is browned and bubbly and the exposed bread is just on the good side of burnt.  * step fifteen: carefully transfer the flaming hot bowls to a serving plate and move them to the table.  don't fuck with hot soup, because it will fuck you up right back. case and point: when i was ten, i received second and third degree burns down the length of my forearm due to an unfortunate flannel pajamas and hot chicken soup incident.  i had to spend a few weeks going to the doctor to get ""debrided"" (a.k.a. having a sadist cut the dead, blackened skin hanging off your arm in sheets with a pair of dull scissors) after school instead of going to swim practice.  that was not fun. * step sixteen: enjoy the best damn french onion soup you will ever eat.",0,,
264978,"&gt;no, let's not.  give me a break.  native north americans haven't experienced worldwide stigma because they aren't found worldwide, sherlock.  within the boundaries of where they are found, they have experienced every bit as much stigma as jews have.  there were signs in toronto parks saying ""no jews"" and there were signs in toronto restaurants saying ""no indians"".    during the move westward they were every bit as vilified as jews have been in the past, with broadsheets portraying them as savages, raping white women, scalping farmers, etc.  some of them were even placed in circuses as sideshow freaks.  they have been in north america even longer than the jews have been in the golden triangle, so if anything, their claim to the land has even more credence.  as a jew, you may think your situation is unique and as a culture, it may even be profitable to portray it as such, but i wholeheartedly disagree that jews have suffered more than north american natives.  jews can hold jobs in some of the tops spots in the land - can natives?  who was the last native ceo you can name?  how many natives are bankers, lawyers or doctors?  what's the percentage of jews in us jails right now compared to their percentage in the overall population?  what about natives?  is it just the method you use as justification?  do you think that dying by gas vs. dying by gun vs. dying by purposefully placed smallpox and influenza means you are any less dead?  the move westward wasn't quite as organized and detailed as the nazi machinery, but it was every bit as planned and purposeful.  &gt;jews didn't get the land as compensation for near extermination. they decided to return to it so that the next extermination is impossible.  so it wasn't the british that decided to partition up the palestinian authority?  the jews just *decided* to move home without any help from the western powers at all?  &gt;modern jews are all descendants of jewish tribes, genetically and culturally.  modern israili jews have far greater genetic ties to germanic and slavic roots than they do to the holy land.  [edit: just read a paper on jewish genetic makeup and they share a common root with other southern european groups due to their origin around the mediterranean basin, with only slight influences from northern european stock (germanics and scandinavians) and minor influences from eastern european groups (12.7%) like the slavs, so i hereby remove that portion of my comment.]",1,-2,-1
788739,"&gt;girls are taught not to compromise their femininity regardless of what they are interested in doing.  so we're supposed to fight like hell, against our own financial self-interest, to change some social mores, but accept others as insurmountable obstacles that we must work around?  silly.   why doesn't pz meyers criticize little girls for buying pink microscopes, instead of toymakers for not releasing the most powerful model in pink (the less powerful ones are available in black, so that's what we're really talking about here)?  i'll tell you why. because pz meyers is as much a victim of conditioned, biased, unscientific thinking as the people he often rails against. the fact that he is most often right is an accident. he may be indoctrinated to a more accurate worldview, but he's still indoctrinated.   corporate entities are automatically the enemy. little girls are automatically blameless victims. parents of little girls are automatically well-meaning, but misguided.   scientists are generally only scientific about their specialty. outside that, they rarely if ever apply their disciplines of thought to the conclusions they form.   pz meyers has no idea how many microscopes are bought by/for little girls, of what power, in what colour, and how this compares to the numbers for little boys. and not knowing the *what*, he *certainly* has no idea of the why.   and yet, he has formed a clear opinion that something is wrong, that he knows what it is, and that he knows who is to blame.   he would not *dream* of leaping to conclusions in this fashion in biology, a field where he is a qualified expert. but he does so in psychology and sociology, fields where he is not.   it seems that the more ignorant someone is, the more cocksure they become.",0,,
376231,"all-righty, then.  ***************************  **lazy cook's foolproof 10-minute 1-bowl brownies**  adapted (simplified and slightly adjusted) from rose levy beranbaum’s rose’s christmas cookies   * 1 scant cup butter   * 2/3 cup cocoa (rose says dutch-process cocoa (like fry's) is better, and she’s right, but any kind of unsweetened real cocoa will work)   * 1 cup sugar   * 3 eggs   * 1 generous splash vanilla (does anybody actually measure vanilla?  i don’t!) and/or other flavouring  (i always add the vanilla even if i’m adding something else as well.)   * 1/2 cup flour (i use unbleached all purpose, but any kind of white flour is fine, with a slight variety in texture.  if using cake flour, add a couple more tablespoons.)   * optional:  about 1 to 2 cups nuts, chocolate chips, or whatever you like.  chopping up your favourite chocolate bars and throwing in the pieces can be fun, and offers great possibilities for leftover halloween candy.  preheat oven to 325f, oil or spray an 8 inch square baking pan.  melt butter in a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl large enough to mix the entire batch.  stir in cocoa and sugar and let cool to lukewarm.  (if you like your brownies more cakey and less chewy, cool to room temperature, but that will push you over the 10-minute mark.  the fastest method (if you only have 8 minutes and are vigilant), is to watch the butter carefully while it’s melting and remove it from the heat or the microwave when it’s about 3/4 melted, then stir to finish melting.  that way you don’t raise the temperature more than absolutely necessary, and the mixture should be cool enough to add the eggs almost immediately.)    when cooled, mix for about 30 seconds with an electric mixer or a little longer by hand.  add eggs while stirring, add flavouring, mix until well combined.  stir in flour just until the mixture is combined, for a “regular” brownie texture.  if you have cooled the butter mixture completely and are going for a more cakey texture, beat with an electric mixer until the batter “fluffs up” and becomes distinctly lighter in colour.   (if you want them really chewy, this is not the recipe for you.)  add any optionals, and spread batter evenly in the prepared pan.   bake in centre of oven 30 to 40 minutes, until the centre is risen and slightly resilient, but still moist.  a cake tester would come out with damp crumbs sticking to it, not clean, but not oozing either.    these cut most easily when refrigerated, but taste better at room temperature.   favourite variations  **mocha-hazelnut**:  add a level tablespoon of instant espresso powder to the batter, and some chopped, freshly-toasted blanched hazelnuts.  **raspberry truffle**:  heat the butter slowly until it just begins to brown.  (this drives off all the moisture, so you can get away with more liquid additions.)  substitute half a cup of good-quality seedless raspberry jam for all but 2 tablespoons of the sugar, and flavour with tahitian vanilla and chamboard liqueur.  add about 10 ounces of chocolate chunks or chips of your choice (white, milk, semisweet, and bittersweet are good).  make a very small amount of glaze by mixing 1 ounce of chambord and 2 tablespoons sour cream with enough icing sugar to give a drizzling consistency.  colour it whatever colour suggests “raspberry” to you and drizzle this over the cooled bars.  (for an interesting variation on this variation, use grand marnier and orange marmalade instead of chambord and raspberry jam.)  **chocolate malted**:  add 1/4 cup of horlick’s to the batter, plus a 10 oz. bag of milk chocolate chunks or chips.  **“bailey’s brownies”**:  brown the butter.

898444,"second post to keep from having just one insanely long post.  this is actually the most epic dream i have ever had (warning:  long as fuck.)  i never had to write it down because it was so vivid.  i'm in an old station wagon.  it looks exactly like the [station wagon from national lampoon's vacation movies](http://i.imgur.com/pazl9.jpg).  it's my mom's old station wagon.  i'm riding with my family on i-93 in new hampshire and a strange little boy (maybe 6-years-old) that isn't related to us.  we stop for gas.  the little boy gets out of the wagon.  i get out of the station wagon and i chase after him for a moment, but he has disappeared.  i stand still, shocked, looked in every direction.  giving up, i turn around and want to head back to the station wagon to tell people, but it's too late because after i turn around...  i'm standing in a really green, lush, field next to navy blue waters of a lake or a small bay that leads out to the atlantic.  the water is maybe an eighth of a mile ahead.  there are pine trees everywhere.  they are the deepest forest green.  the sky is clear with no clouds and it's baby blue.  in the water are docks with mid-sized yachts, maybe 4 of them.  the cool winds are blowing, the smell in the air is amazingly clean.  i relish in the moment.  i know i'm at some part of coastal maine, but i don't know where.  i know i should turn around to look and see if i can see the town or a business anywhere nearby to tell me where i am, but when i do turn...  it's hot and muggy as hell.  the clear blue skies and navy blue waters of maine are gone.  the ground on which i stand is muddy and full of weeds that are knee-high.  the water in front of me is now brownish green.  it's closer.  i hear frogs and cicadas.  the trees all have vines clinging to them.  the sky is blue, but i see it through a yellowy brown haze.  mosquitoes buzz around me.  i'm in a southern swamp, over a thousand miles from maine.    i start to move closer to the water and my feet squish.  i kneel down at a rock on the shore and look in the water.  i squint because i see something insanely weird moving up to the surface.  when it comes close enough, i see it's a fucked up evil mermaid with green, purple, black, silver hair.  her skin is pale/murky green and her teeth are jagged, broken, and brown when she smiles at me.  her eyes are completely black.  i start to back away, scared, and she grabs my forearm.  she's strong.  she pulls me into the water and drags me quickly to the bottom of this swamp.  it seemed like it would only be maybe 10 feet deep, but it's at least 40 feet.  i get down so deep that the sunlight rays aren't penetrating the dirty water anymore and i get worried.  i look at her to let me go or take me up.  i tap her with my hand a bunch of times and beg to be taken back to the surface.  she is taking me back up, but so slow i think i'll drown.  i get angry, break away, and start swimming as fast as i can to the stop.  when i get to the top, she surfaces, laughs, swims away and i am next to a wooden, unfinished, never launched, still under construction pirate ship and the swamp is about 20 times the size it was when i went into it.    all i do is touch the pirate ship and i'm standing on the back porch of my parents' house.  i go inside the sliding glass doors (which were then french doors irl at the time of the dream).  in the den there are all of the people i never wanted to meet each other together on the couch.  i freaked out, sat down next to them, and started talking to appear like it wasn't bothersome.  they were talking to each other and they didn't pay much attention to me.  i get up off of the couch and when i do...  i'm in the basement and it is unfinished again.  the steps to the basement are still wooden.  i look around me and the basement is about 10 times its normal size.  all around are hundreds of people mulling through shit, rearranging boxes, and oddly enough, the refrigerator from the kitchen upstairs.  somehow, i just know that all of these people are dead.  not zombie dead.  not decaying dead.  just dead.  they look like they are alive, though.  not discolored  they passed on some time ago, but these are like full body ghosts, not apparitions.  they are breathing.  they can't hear me, but i can touch them.  they don't feel my touch.  i start to notice one of them noticing me, and following me around as i get closer to the pack of them.  the refrigerator is getting new compartments, doors to parts of it that never existed before, and new shelves.  i see a bunch of the dead people talking to something on the top shelf.  i push my way past them, frustrated, wanting to talk to whatever is in there.  it's my aunt's head.  she killed herself a year ago in waking life.  every detail about her is fine.  it's not bloody.  it's not gross (though to kill herself it was a shot to the head).  it's just like a disembodied head.  in a fridge.  ugh.  so, i try to talk to her, ask her questions.  she won't listen.  she only talks to the other dead people.   the dead person that has been following me, the only one that notices me, is on my heels constantly.  i look to my right and i see this wooden plank made into a ramp to extend up into the air coming from the door to the laundry room.  all kinds of people are coming in through the door.  all walks of life?  everything from children to doctors to wwf wrestlers (yes, seriously).  all of them dead.    there are wooden steps in the middle of the room.  they are framed to nothing.  it's like wooden bleachers.  i am trying to just get out of the way of all of these people pouring inside.  as soon as i sit down on the steps, confused, head in my hands, staring at my feet, i see another pair of feet coming up the bleachers.  it's the person that was following me.  i sit up, keeping my gaze at my feet, and the stranger takes my hand.  the last part of the dream is where he asks me a question.    he takes my hand in his gently, compassionately, and says, ""do you think the pain stops when you die?""  **tl;dr:  fucked up vivid as hell dream about time and space travel, alternate dimensions, ghosts, ""the other side,"" and i don't know what else that left me unable to sleep for 3 days out of fear of another dream just like it.  i saw evil mermaids in swamps, a pirate ship, and my aunt's dead, talking head, in my parents' refrigerator, talking to hundreds of other dead people surrounding it.**",0,,

170483,"do you have any photoshop skills whatsoever? not to be a debbie downer, but finding an ad is very difficult. that's why ad school is usually recommended. the true value in ad school is being paired up with like-minded ads, photographers, etc.   if you have some photoshop knowledge, you may be able to pull it off on your own. don't go too complex with the designs—let your headlines shine. a poorly designed complex ad will take away from your headlines. a decently designed simple ad with good writing and a solid concept will go a long way.   i've written this before but it's a slow monday, so i don't mind doing it again....  let's say you're doing a campaign for red bull. you tried reddit, you tried fiverr, everything.. can't find an ad. so you try to design some ads by yourself. you have your headlines, a solid tagline, etc. it's all just waiting to be done!   1) first decide how your ad is gonna look. will it be stock photos? will it be a headline-driven campaign? i'd recommend headline-driven, but do know that your ads shouldn't all look the same. sooner or later you're gonna have to work with stock. but for the time being and for this example, let's say headline-driven.   2) start a folder caller ""red bull."" add some sub folders: logos, graphics, fonts, mock-ups and ""final""  3) find your logo. go to brandsoftheworld.com and download the red bull logo. don't like it? go to google images. search red bull. go to search tools and make sure you're only downloading large images, such as 1,000x1,000 px or larger. that way it won't be all grainy as you scale it. save this all in the logo folder.  4) now you want your fonts. try dafont.com. just search through all the fonts. maybe you want a bold and strong font to play off the bull factor. when in doubt, helvetica... but i'd recommend finding a font that goes with the campaign. save it in your font folder.  5) time to design the ad. start a new doc. doing a print ad? go with 8.5x11 at 300px. drop in your logo first and place it. the best layout is usually centered but play with the logo and tagline. maybe you wanna lead with the logo or put it up at the top right. maybe the bottom right looks good. mess around with it.   6) now, use the dropper tool and select your colors from the logo/product itself. make the background color the lightest color of the product. play with the font sizes and colors. the font color could be black, white or the darkest color of the product/logo.   7) now you have your first print ad. again, play around with it. see what works best. add a vector, then scrap the vector. move the logo right, then left, then center. see what looks best.   it's most important to keep folders and keep everything organized. for one, it's always a best practice. second, if you ever find a designer to make it look better, it'll be an easy transition. they'll have the fonts, graphics, logos, etc. right in front of them.   good luck. i designed most of my portfolio on my own. i taught myself photoshop and illustrator. it's not perfect, but here it is: petepirone.com. as you can see, i went very simple and tried to let the writing shine through.",0,,

346091,"i adore jasmine!  and peach.  so i have a lot of stuff with those notes.  let me go through my perfume master list!  (i made it for this reason don't ya know.)  let's start with peaches since i find that to be such a great summer scent!  **bpal**  * fae - *white musk, bergamot, heliotrope, peach and oakmoss.* very glittery, sweet, and soft with a touch of spiciness, but not like cinnamon spice, more like a soft gentle spice.    * lamia - *pale orchid, vanilla amber, black currant, white peach, champaca, coconut, arabian myrrh, burmese vetiver, and oude.* this is a bit more on the deeper side, with a hint of earthiness and incense lingering under it.  the peach isn't prominent, but it adds this unique light scent.  * les bijoux - *skin musk and honey, blood-red rose, orange blossom, white peach, red apple, frankincense and myrrh.*  one of my *favorite* scents.  you get that nice incensy base with the frank &amp; myrrh, but the peach, apple, honey, and skin musk sweeten it up.  it's hard to describe but i highly recommend getting an imp (sample) of it.  it was a hidden gem for me.  * tamora - *amber, heliotrope, golden sandalwood, peach blossom and vanilla bean.* another beautiful blend.  this one is softer and another perfect blend for the summer.  you get that heliotrope, golden amber, and the peach blossom with a base of sandalwood and some vanilla sweetening and rounding it out.  * titania - *a nocturnal bounty of fae dew-kissed petals and pale fruits: white grape, white peach, iced pear, musk rose, sweet pea, moonflower and snapdragon.*  soft and flowing, gentle and sweet.  this has none of that deepness of the above blends, but is more ethereal.   **cocoa pink**  * country picnic - *a basket of plump peaches, white wine, touches of night blooming orchid, bergamot cradled with sheer musk and the barest hint of a sweet garden pea.* seriously smells like a picnic out in a field.  it's nuts.  the peaches are juicy and ripe at first then as the blend dries you go through and are left with the sticky residue on your mouth and hands type smell and it's just wonderful.  * peach skies - *silky, smooth peach and apricot nectar kissed by the summer sun, golden honey, red poppies and spring violets sweetened with gentle strands of freshly spun pink cotton candy.* soft and golden, sweet and airy.  this is sweeter (believe it or not) than any of the aforementioned peach scents.  definitely more of the gourmand type.   **deep midnight perfumes**  * flights of fancy - *mahogany wood, amber, lavender, brown sugar, oak, with faint and fresh background notes of peach and pear.* this scent is more about the wood and amber - gives a definite clockwork feel to the blend, but the fruits give it a nice juicy lift off.   **sixteen92**  * lolita - *crisp apple skins, tart peach candies, rose absolute, sugared violet* this is innocence in a bottle.  candy and sunshine.  * paper moon - *soft vanilla musk, benzoin, oakmoss, trailing ivy, peach blossom, rose* very gentle, slightly sweet with a hint of greenness.   **solstice scents**  * chantilly cream - *fluffy whipped cream, peach nectar, vanilla &amp; yellow mandarin* sweet, soft, and super fluffy.  leans gourmand.  * kitchen - *pumpkin, sugar cookies, peach preserves, spice breads, danishes, caramel, vanilla &amp; sweet wood smoke*  heavier, more on the fall/winter side of peaches - but smells like cooking and baking and all things wonderful about that.  i'll do another post for jasmine as i'm sure i'll hit the word limit soon.",0,,

357387,"please read my wall of text first, then read this reply second.  the ""big picture"" to mixing paints. lets look at the space wolves article. your first link.  oh by the way, before i say anything else, you imply saving money on paints. if there is one rule that i will give to people that paint is to **do not try to ""save money"" on paints.** yes, there are ways you can indeed save money on paints, but you should not try to save money by *not buying* paints. do not buy other types of paints when you are starting out. you don't need to buy ""gw"" paints but water-based painted designed for miniatures will help you narrow your search (vallejo, coat'd'arms, and foundry are really good but inexpensive as well). it's just that gw is usually the most accessible. finally, this is an expensive hobby, but you can save far more money by not buying models instead of trying to paint with as little paints as possible.   say for instance, you buy those 4 colours of gray specified in the video (i didn't watch the video so i don't know what they are). assuming you have a basecoat, a shade, and highlight, that's already 3 colours *regardless* of whether you choose to mix them through your blend or not.  i've seen parents pick up a box of models for their kids along with a brush and a few paints to begin with, and those paints usually go along the lines of blood red, shining gold, skull white, and hawk turquoise. sure, this is (somewhat) acceptable if you want 4 regions of flat color, but if you were to actually buy paints as a training tool, i would recommend something more along the lines of chaos black, blood red, red gore, and fiery orange. i will explain why.  now. back to the space wolf article.  so obviously as you know, the basic premise is that after flat-coating, you need to add darker colors (shades) and lighter colors (highlights) to make your model look more three dimensional. looking at gw's guide, this is exactly what they do. (note that they use a ""wash"" here instead of a more traditional layered-shade. they've used washes in basically every painting guide since the release of gw washes as part of what i assume to be their attempt to sell more pots of wash. those greedy dogs. the same principles still apply between the ""wash"" method and the ""layer"" or ""blend"" method, but there's an added extra re-basing step in the middle for the former. the more traditional layering style can be seen in the progression of the yellow armour.)  you can see that this is actually pretty forumalic: **skin:** base = tallarn flesh, shade = ogryn flesh, highlight = bleached bone. **armour:** base = shadow grey, shade = fenris grey, highlight = space wolves gray. **yellow armour:** base: iyanden darksun, shade =tausept ochre, highlight = golden yellow. et cetera.  also. ignore the instances of scorched brown for now. i'll talk about them in a minute. excluding scorched brown, chaos black, and skull white, just about every single color uses exactly three paints.  if we look at each individual color by itself, using these three paints certainly makes a lot of sense if we say that we want a main colour that will drive the overall look of the piece of armour, something lighter than it so that we can lighten up to it, and something darker than it so that we can shade down to it. excluding the ""wash"" steps, almost every step goes something like: ""start with a solid color or some other starting mixture. paint over the entire area. add the shade to the mixture you have and paint it in and around every recess. add more shade and paint in extreme recesses. repeat for highlights/extreme highlights."" i've been painting for decades, and basically for about the last 8 years this is the only way i've been painting anything.  so, you ask, why start with a 50-50 mixture? specifically, why ""do i really need to mix iyanden darksun and golden yellow."" basically, the answer is that painting certain lighter colours like white, red, and yellow, are, and will always be, a fucking pain in the ass to paint. you'll see here that they ask you to paint instead of main tone-&gt;darker-&gt;lighter it goes darker-&gt;main-&gt;lighter for yellow and red. unfortunately the yellow and red on this model are pretty boring regions, so they're both basically about only two steps each. anyways, a few years ago games workshop released a set of paints called ""foundation paints"" to supplement their regular paint line as reformulated paints that will help in basecoating those colors that are usually a pain in the ass to basecoat. those ""foundation paints"" include (you guessed it!) tausept ochre, iyanden darksun, mechrite red, and fenris grey. thus, the addition of iyanden darksun to golden yellow isn't just to change to colour of the mixture, but also to increase the opacity (coverage) of it.  so, our coverage difficulties are temporarily over, and we've managed to paint our space wolf in every colour. lets see what this would look like. this is my post-modern rendition of a space wolf done in 10 seconds in ms paint.  [white background](http://imgur.com/8bhbu)  [black background](http://imgur.com/8fbws)  okay whoa. there's like 7 completely different colors right next to each other and they look fugly. in the grim dark future there is only fashion faux-pas.  in the world of aesthetics, this is actually a problem. some of these colours are warm (red, yellow, flesh, gold), some are cool (armour, hair, fur). but we don't really need this rank-and-file trooper to stick out visually, so maybe we can cool down the warmer colours to match the coolness of the armour, which is about 80% of the model. some contrast is good, but even the colours that should normally be harmonious are clashing quite a bit due to their close proximity.  one acceptable solution to this is to thicken the thin dark line that usually exists between every single component.  but wait, we've been mixing our paints together this entire time, so why not just add a common colour to some of our colours to make them closer together on the colour wheel?   i promised you i would get back to talking about scorched brown... every single component of this model has some scorched brown in it's colour in some fashion. the armour, the skin, the hair, the fur, the gold, etc. what colour is the base (and the edge of the base)? hint: it starts with ""s"" and ends with ""corchedbrown"".  as a parting note i would like to point out that the red and yellow parts do *not* have scorched brown to reinforce the contrast, but if you wanted to remove contrast you can certainly do so through similar methods.",0,,

713006,"&gt; between 1530 and 1780. i am talking about modern times - where is the precedent that (predominately) north american travelers are kidnapped and sold into slavery in modern times? you are conflating the fact that slavery has existed which included europeans with modern kidnapping of holiday makers for the use of sexual slavery.  no i'm not.  the question was asked why people may think white women could be targets for sexual exploitation and i gave the answer: because men around the world have desired lighter skinned women for a very very long time.  right now there may not be the mass round up of fair skinned women, but:  1.) that doesn't mean individual light skinned women aren't targeted just for their skin tone, and  2.) given the prevalence of slavery as a historical norm, the institution is only suppressed in modern times because we have the might to do so.  at least in the first world we can suppress it anyhow, those living in the third world [aren't so lucky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tpflhvn024).  3.) while modern europeans may have the collective might to prevent themselves from being sold into slavery that doesn't mean the demand doesn't exist and should that might wain there's no reason we wouldn't return to historical norms.  3a.) i feel the need to add this: a lot of people seem to believe that moral progress can't be undone, that somehow it becomes a part of the fabric of reality.  bad news: mother nature doesn't care what human beings think is right or wrong.  the law of the jungle was never repealed.  all moral progress is contingent upon our might to enforce it.  you want to maintain moral progress?  well then you better have the firepower to do it.  we have seen [moral progress undone](http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/07/afghanistan-in-the-1950s-and-60s/100544/) in modern times.  if you think it can't happen anywhere in the world... [i've got bad news](https://youtu.be/jmrbhcclzzk).  white women (and whiter / lighter skinned women) have historically been desired as concubines and sex slaves by non-white men.  &gt;[one result may be a form of trade](http://www.evoandproud.blogspot.com/2013/07/trading-in-fair-skinned-women-did-it.html): women from lighter-skinned populations will become objects of commerce for sale to men in darker-skinned populations. this was the case between the 8th and 19th centuries, when women were exported from europe to the muslim world, i.e., spain, north africa, the middle east, and south asia.  it's not like this pattern isn't repeated around the world:  &gt;sub-saharan africa  &gt;skin color does visibly differ among the various peoples of sub-saharan africa, to a greater degree in fact than what many non-africans might think. these differences seem to interact with notions of sexual beauty, as lugira (1970) writes about pre-colonial uganda:  &gt;&gt;the ganda concept of skin pigmentation considers light coloured complexions to be differing shades of white.  a dark brown skin colour is said to be — eruyeru, that is, somewhat white. a really brown‑reddish‑yellow person is said to be mweru = white, which in comparison would be considered to be blonde; and this in the ganda aesthetic language is considered as red = myufu, the most perfect skin pigmentation.  &gt;as a result, the lighter skin of some groups could become a casus belli:  &gt;&gt;[…] the nnyambo people were the handsome looking (brown‑red) inhabitants of the south of buganda, in the ziba countries and kalagwe. the nnyambo women were one of the reasons that induced suna ii to wage war with kiziba after which he suffered from small pox and died (lugira, 1970)  &gt;south-east asia  &gt;an incipient trade of this sort existed in 19th- and 20th-century thailand, where some chinese merchants would offer their daughters to thai rulers in exchange for protection and influence:  &gt;&gt;'chinese of wealth', wrote the american missionary n. a. mcdonald in 1884, 'often become favorites with the rulers and receive titles of nobility, and these noblemen in return present their daughters to their majesties.'  &gt;&gt;[…] william skinner noted that chinese women were 'prized for their light skin color'. here, skin colour was valued as a form of feminine beauty and a sign of 'chineseness'. (jiemin, 2003)  &gt;this kind of exchange was consistent with indigenous thai notions of female beauty, as shown by a recent study:  &gt;&gt;young women in all four regions of thailand considered ‘bright face skin’ and ‘white-pink (body) skin’ as the next most important physical appearance characteristics. women in the north region were most concerned about having bright face skin, perhaps because they already tend to have lighter body skin which is viewed as desirable. women in south region were most concerned with body skin color, which may be because they tend to have darker skin color. (rongmuang et al., 2011)  more regional examples at the link above.  the [muslim slave trade of europeans](http://www.evoandproud.blogspot.com/2013/07/white-skin-privilege.html) also focused on white women:  &gt;what gave rise to this desire for light-skinned foreign women? it seems that fair skin has long been key to arab notions of female beauty:  &gt;&gt;praise of a girl's looks is traditionally couched in such terms as: her face is like the full moon, her mouth is an almond, her nose a cardamon, she is plump, and dimpled etc. [...] the highest praise is perhaps that she is as white as snow — strange praise indeed to come from a people very few of whom had ever seen snow. (haim 1978, p. 88)  &gt;&gt;[the moon] is the most common image used to represent female beauty. when attempting to draw the attention of a beautiful girl on the street, a young man may call out, “’es ya qamar?” (roughly, “what’s happening, o moon?”). two important components of the image, brightness (fairness of skin) and roundness (of face), convey the popular conception of beauty in palestinian and arab culture. (muhawi and kanaana 1989, p. 60, cf. also 122, 181)  given the centuries (millennium?) desire of men around the world for lighter skinned women there is no reason to believe that individual women in the modern world wouldn't also be targeted for their lighter skin.  regardless of their actual ""race"".",1,1,-2

818061,"i'm definitely not a wine snob.  i drink what i like.  i've been drinking a lot of shiraz(my favorite) it goes really well with some brie cheese or some camembert cheese and some spicy hummus.  my bartender at my favorite dive bar had a [master of science in viticulture and enology](http://wineserver.ucdavis.edu/content.php?category=graduate%20program)  he taught me some great things about drinking wine.  - **always drink what you like.**  - the s's of wine tasting:  - **s**ee the wine- pour the wine into a wine glass and hold the glass up to the light. study the color. you are looking for clarity and brilliance. if the wine in your glass is cloudy or discolored in any way your palate is about to be disappointed, because something is wrong with the blend. white wine as it ages; the coloring changes, the color and hue reflect almost a straw or a golden-yellow. for a red wine, the color can become almost ruby or burgundy depending on how long the wine was allowed to age. white wine is stored in stainless steel vats to age. red wine is stored in oaken barrels to age.  - **s**wirl the wine- holding the stem of the wineglass lightly, pick up the glass and swirl the wine around and around. this is to achieve several purposes. you are allowing the wine to breathe, and to pick up the essence of the glass. as you swirl your wine, notice how the wine hits the sides of the glass, and then falls back down. this is known as the “legs” of the wine, giving those knowledgeable enough, clues as to how full-bodied the wine actually is. swirl the wine several times in order to allow all the components to come together and give you the full experience of a full-bodied taste.  - **s**niff- raise the glass to your nose, and sniff deeply. close your eyes taking in the full impact of the bouquet rising up to meet your nose. what you smell will depend on your choice of wine, as well as your memory. red wines carry an earthy aroma, reminiscent of pencil shavings, or rich, cool woodsy- type smells. you could smell almonds, or vanilla or even cloves. no one person smelling the same wine will come away with the same memories of another person smelling that wine. if the wine is a fruity wine, you might envision a field of strawberries, or an apple orchard, perhaps cloves or anise or another spice. all smells wafting up to your nostrils are open to individual interpretation.  - **s**ip- now, sip the wine. your mouth will confirm what your sense of smell has detected. a dry red wine with tannins will leave you with what they call the “pucker factor” completely drying out your mouth at the first sip. a fruity sweetened wine will sit on the tongue and play across the taste buds delighting the palate and leaving the mouth moist.  - **s**avor- as you gently swirl the wine around in your mouth savor the flavor. you are checking for the balance of the blends; for each wine bottle is not just the end product of one type of grape, but a carefully planned blend of several types. some wines contain not just the juice of the grape, but also the stems and the seeds.  - **s**wallow the wine and enjoy the fruits of this harvest of flavors.",0,,

780513,"the original topic was about race, but you're bringing quite a few topics of skin color so i think we need to clarify the terminology.   every person can be classified by skin color, determined by genetics. society also classifies people by race, determined by a combination of factors including phenotype, geographical origin, national origin, historical migration, common experiences such as war or colonization, culture, skin color, and more. skin color is mutable to a certain extent, as people have varying abilities to tan, and there exists bleaching products.  thus, we have white people who are pale, white people who are tan, white people who are even olive-skinned. there are lighter-skinned black people, brown-skinned black people, and darker-skinned black people. there are asian people with varying skin color, and so on. the way society treats people depends on both the person's skin color and racial classification as factors. this is what colorism addresses: how skin color functions within a racial classification.  that tanned men are considered more attractive is a function of classism; tanning is a visible sign of financial strength for white men, a reversal after the industrial revolution where it was a working-class stigma.

600830,"to dawson town came percy brown from london on the thames. a pane of glass was in his eye, and stockings on his stems. upon the shoulder of his coat a leather pad he wore, to rest his deadly rifle when it wasn't seeking gore; the which it must have often been, for major percy brown, according to his story was a hunter of renown, who in the murrumbidgee wilds had stalked the kangaroo and killed the cassowary on the plains of timbuctoo. and now the arctic fox he meant to follow to its lair, and it was also his intent to beard the artic hare... which facts concerning major brown i merely tell because i fain would have you know him for the nimrod that he was.  now skipper grey and deacon white were sitting in the shack, and sampling of the whisky that pertained to sheriff black. said skipper grey: ""i want to say a word about this brown: the piker's sticking out his chest as if he owned the town."" said sheriff black: ""he has no lack of frigorated cheek; he called himself a sourdough when he'd just been here a week."" said deacon white: ""methinks you're right, and so i have a plan by which i hope to prove to-night the mettle of the man. just meet me where the hooch-bird sings, and though our ways be rude we'll make a proper sourdough of this piccadilly dude.""  within the malamute saloon were gathered all the gang; the fun was fast and furious, and the loud hooch-bird sang. in fact the night's hilarity had almost reached its crown, when into its storm-centre breezed the gallant major brown. and at the apparation, whith its glass eye and plus-fours, from fifty alcoholic throats responded fifty roars. with shouts of stark amazement and with whoops of sheer delight, they surged around the stranger, but the first was deacon white. ""we welcome you,"" he cried aloud, ""to this the great white land. the artic brotherhood is proud to grip you by the hand. yea, sportsman of the bull-dog breed, from trails of far away, to yukoners this is indeed a memorable day. our jubilation to express, vocabularies fail... boys, hail the great cheechako!"" and the boys responded: ""hail!""  ""and now,"" continued deacon white to blushing major brown, ""behold assembled the eelight and cream of dawson town, and one ambition fills their hearts and makes their bosoms glow - they want to make you, honoured sir, a bony feed sourdough. the same, some say, is one who's seen the yukon ice go out, but most profound authorities the definition doubt, and to the genial notion of this meeting, major brown, a sourdough is a guy who drinks ... an ice-worm cocktail down.""  ""by gad!"" responded major brown, ""that's ripping, don't you know. i've always felt i'd like to be a certified sourdough. and though i haven't any doubt your winter's awf'ly nice, mayfair, i fear, may miss me ere the break-up of your ice. yet (pray excuse my ignorance of matters such as these) a cocktail i can understand - but what's an ice-worm, please?"" said deacon white: ""it is not strange that you should fail to know, since ice-worms are peculiar to the mountain of blue snow. within the polar rim it rears, a solitary peak, and in the smoke of early spring (a spectacle unique) like flame it leaps upon the sight and thrills you through and through, for though its cone is piercing  white, its base is blazing blue. yet all is clear as you draw near - for coyley peering out are hosts and hosts of tiny worms, each indigo of snout. and as no nourishment they find, to keep themselves alive they masticate each other's tails, till just the tough survive. yet on this stern and spartan fare so-rapidly they grow, that some attain six inches by the melting of the snow. then when the tundra glows to green and nigger heads appear, they burrow down and are not seen until another year.""  ""a toughish yarn,"" laughed major brown, ""as well you may admit. i'd like to see this little beast before i swallow it."" ""'tis easy done,"" said deacon white, ""ho! barman, haste and bring us forth some pickled ice-worms of the vintage of last spring."" but sadly still was barman bill, then sighed as one bereft: ""there's been a run on cocktails, boss; there ain't an ice-worm left. yet wait . . . by gosh! it seems to me that some of extra size were picked and put away to show the scientific guys."" then deeply in a drawer he sought, and there he found a jar, the which with due and proper pride he put upon the bar; and in it, wreathed in queasy rings, or rolled into a ball, a score of grey and greasy things, were drowned in alcohol. their bellies were a bilious blue, their eyes a bulbous red; their back were grey, and gross were they, and hideous of head. and when with gusto and a fork the barman speared one out, it must have gone four inches from its tail-tip to its snout. cried deacon white with deep delight: ""say, isn't that a beaut?"" ""i think it is,"" sniffed major brown, ""a most disgustin' brute. its very sight gives me the pip. i'll bet my bally hat, you're only spoofin' me, old chap. you'll never swallow that."" ""the hell i won't!"" said deacon white. ""hey! bill, that fellows fine. fix up four ice-worm cocktails, and just put that wop in mine.""  so barman bill got busy, and with sacerdotal air his art's supreme achievement he proceeded to prepare. his silver cups, like sickle moon, went waving to and fro, and four celestial cocktails soon were shining in a row. and in the starry depths of each, artistically piled, a fat and juicy ice-worm raised its mottled mug and smiled. then closer pressed the peering crown, suspended was the fun, as skipper grey in courteous way said: ""stranger, please take one."" but with a gesture of disgust the major shook his head. ""you can't bluff me. you'll never drink that gastly thing,"" he said. ""you'll see all right,"" said deacon white, and held his cocktail high, till its ice-worm seemed to wiggle, and to wink a wicked eye. then skipper grey and sheriff black each lifted up a glass, while through the tense and quiet crown a tremor seemed to pass. ""drink, stranger, drink,"" boomed deacon white. ""proclaim you're of the best, a doughty sourdough who has passed the ice-worm cocktail test."" and at these words, with all eyes fixed on gaping  major brown, like a libation to the gods, each dashed his cocktail down. the major gasped with horror as the trio smacked their lips. he twiddled at his eye-glass with unsteady finger-tips. into his starry cocktail with a look of woe he peered, and its ice-worm, to his thinking, mosy incontinently leered. yet on him were a hundred eyes, though no one spoke aloud, for hushed with expectation was the waiting, watching crowd. the major's fumbling hand went forth - the gang prepared to cheer; the major's falt'ring hand went back, the mob prepared to jeer, the major gripped his gleaming glass and laid it to his lips, and as despairfully he took some nauseated sips, from out its coil of crapulence the ice-worm raised its head, its muzzle was a murky blue, its eyes a ruby red. and then a roughneck bellowed fourth:  ""this stiff comes here and struts, as if he bought the blasted north - jest let him show his guts."" and with a roar the mob proclaimed: ""cheechako, major brown, reveal that you're of sourdough stuff, and drink your cocktail down.""  the major took another look, then quickly closed his eyes, for even as he raised his glass he felt his gorge arise. aye, even though his sight was sealed, in fancy he could see that grey and greasy thing that reared and sneered in mockery. yet round him ringed the callous crowd - and how they seemed to gloat! it must be done . . . he swallowed hard . . . the brute was at his throat. he choked. . . he gulped . . . thank god! at last he'd got the horror down. then from the crowd went up a roar: ""hooray for sourdough brown!"" with shouts they raised him shoulder high, and gave a rousing cheer, but though they praised him to the sky the major did not hear. amid their demonstrative glee delight he seemed to lack; indeed it almost seemed that he - was ""keeping something back."" a clammy sweat was on his brow, and pallid as a sheet: ""i feel i must be going now,"" he'd plaintively repeat. aye, though with drinks and smokes galore, they tempted him to stay, with sudden bolt he gained the door, and made his get-away.  and ere next night his story was the talk of dawson town, but gone and reft of glory was the wrathful major brown; for that ice-worm (so they told him) of such formidable size was - a stick of stained spaghetti with two red ink spots for eyes.  * robert service, the ice worm cocktail",0,,

703480,"i left the shelter with a small team in search of food for the rest of the survivors. i was glad to have my best friend with me, an aussie named mic, on this mission. we served in the iraq together as part of the joint nato operations and became great friends. after our tours were up, i moved back home and he decided to give my little town in iowa a try but i digress.  we were slowly making our way through the calm spring woods when we spotted huge stands of morel mushrooms. me and mic smiled at each other and with the others started picking them.      ""crickey, who woulda thought getting rid of those bloody bities would have the world down the dunny."" i just looked at mic and sighed nodding my head in agreement. it had been 2 years since the attacks started. it turned out we were not alone in the universe. and it turned out only two things had kept the aliens from invading, cold weather and mosquitoes. the aliens couldn't stand temperatures under 45° f and the enzyme that mosquitoes use a blood thinner while feeding is like cyanide is to humans. it turned out roswell was true. scientists discovered these weaknesses while experimenting on the captured aliens. what they didn't discover was the alien craft was tracking human progress using a signal that was apparently undetectable by our technology. they watched our every move, waiting to strike. then it happened. with the mosquitoes gone, the invasion started. they were mining the human population for slaves. our technology was highly inferior and in a new age blitzkrieg, the aliens swept around the world capturing those with desirable traits. they killed the rest of us, save for a few groups of survivors here and there. it is warm enough now that the threat of more attacks is ever present. hit squads patrol every square inch possible, looking for us. we had just about picked every mushroom when our look out alerted that a hit squad was coming. we grabbed our air tubes and slipped into a nearby stream. the could see our thermal signature if we tried hiding on land but the water seemed to shield us enough to protect us. after some time passed, we climbed out and went back to the mushrooms. ""we better get out of here mate before those cranky blokes come back."" i agreed but just as we started i heard it. i signaled for the group to stop. i kept hearing the faint buzz until it got louder and landed on my arm. although it was just one, the sight of it had me pent up with excitement. a single mosquito was feeding on me and i couldn't be happier for it. i turned and looked at mic with a huge grin on my face as one word escaped my lips.

173637,"""hi, i'm here because i want to be a model.""  ""well okay then honey, show us your stuff!""  ""well, actually, i'd rather not show the skin of my body. it's against my belief.""  ""would you please show your face? that veil is covering it.""  ""no, no that is also against my belief.""  ""oh... well when you model, you're going to be able to take those off right?""  ""no, no that is against my belief.""  ""right, well unfortunately because we cannot assess your body and face, because your belief inhibits you, we cannot hire you. it is pertinent to finding a model and modeling in general that we can fully assess your face and body. if we can't see your body and face, neither can clients, who will not want you to model for them. *although you might know a lot about modeling, if you don't show your body, nobody will want you working for them.*""  ""you're all the same, you pigs! you don't tolerate other religions or cultures! i'm going to take you to court! hell, i could wear a swimsuit outside my clothing, it would look just as good! selfish bastards!""  **edit**: ok, people are missing the point entirely. i honestly didn't think i would have to make it more clear.  as a bunch of adults who probably (still) asks their mum to cut their hair, i'm guessing some of you have no clue.  my girlfriend is crazy about her hair. she's into modeling and acting, and her look is important. when she looks for a good hairdresser, she looks at their hair. why? when you hire a coder, you look at his code. does he manage it respectfully, is it clean and efficient? does he comment it well?  the way a hairdresser takes care of his or her hair is pertinent. if it's clean, groovy. but looking at their hair also tells you other things. you generally go for someone who has some experience with the kind of hair you do. a hairdresser who has long hair like my girlfriends knows exactly what it's like when you want to grow hair. she takes good care of it, it's shiny, and so forth.  now, i'm not saying that this is the be-all and end-all of hairdressing. but, it is a common way to be fairly safe with scouting hairdressers. a coder may have code that is messy as shit when he writes it for himself, but when he writes it for a company or client, he may be a fucking code-monkey-genius who has the most tight code you've seen in your life.  the problem is, most people wouldn't take that risk. they'd just hire someone who takes respectful care of their own code and assume that carries across the board. and for this same reason, they wouldn't hire a coder who outright refuses to show his code at all. thus, for this reason, it's bad for business, and she was not hired.  can we end this fucking argument now?",0,,
489795,"this morning started abruptly, and continued in that fashion for a while. my mp3 alarm clock failed to go off, and so i woke to the shill sound of my backup digital alarm next to my bed. i hate that thing, and i often sleep through it, but today, it's incessant, high-pitched beeping roused me and set the mood for the morning: 'ugh'.  the rest of my wake-up ritual continued as normal: shower, get dressed, cigarette, read reddit for a while, make sandwich for lunch and leave the house. one of my housemates, danny, was leaving for work at the same time. we said our ""g'mornings"" and i headed to my car. as i pulled my keys from my pocket, something fell out onto the road, a small flash of purple and white. my ipod shuffle made a small clunk as it hit the tarmac. damn, hope that isn't broken, just got it replaced under warranty. i dropped the last one at christmas, and it was never the same again.  anyway, i digress. i unlocked the car; the satisfactory clunk of the remote central locking was joined by an unfamiliar sound of crushed ice in the distance, or very light hail. immediately as i put my head into the confines of the car i see the source of this new sound. small cuboids of glass littered the interior of my laguna, glimmering in the misty morning light. ""fucking hell, some twat's smashed my window!"", i called as danny was passing by.  ""what?"" was the eloquent reply as he approached the crime scene that was presented in my 14 year old, french automobile. ""well, i'm not going to work today!"", i exclaimed as i headed back to the house, for some reason, locking the car door as i went.  i phoned the police station, or rather the regional call centre, and made a report. after speaking to a very nice woman who logged my details, she made an appointment for an officer to come around and make a statement. due to the fantastic efficiency of our local police service this will be on thursday (in two days time).  i then spent the next hour cleaning up the uncut diamonds that were once my passenger window. i surveyed the car for clues as to what happened. my stereo was still there, not that anyone would want a tape stereo these days. my 'after work cigarettes' were still in their packet under the freshly laid snowfall of tempered glass. there were no valuables to speak of in my car, and no stones or rocks had appeared overnight. i surveyed the street. no other cars were damaged. 'a random act of vandalism?', i thought to myself. as it was not apparent that anything was stolen, this seemed to be the logical motive, if you can call needless destruction of property motive.  after clearing the glass, knocking on neighbors doors to ask if they'd seen anything only to come up empty, and ordering a new window, i decided to try and relax. the bastard that damaged my car (poor christine, named for the stephen king book as i'm sure that car is trying to kill me) had indirectly gifted me with a day off, so i put on some beethoven (9th symphony if you must know), cranked up my speakers, and relaxed to quite possibly the best piece of music humankind has ever produced.  later i needed coffee, a ritual i enjoy thoroughly. i revel in the tasks of cleaning the individual pieces of the caffetier , opening the bag of grounds to that warm, rich aroma, waiting for the kettle to boil and cool just enough before pouring to create the thick black mud i call coffee. as i was heading to the kitchen, i spotted the canvas shopping bags that i've been meaning to put back in my car, i must get into the habit of using them more often, especially as they're going to start charging for plastic ones. it would've been nice to have them on the passenger seat. they would've made the task of cleaning up a little easier.  and that's when realisation happened. i own, or rather own**ed**, three canvas bags. the two at the bottom of the stairs were made of some kind of muslin material, big and brown, and a tad unwieldy when empty. the third was different. it was black. it was made of a teflon material. it folded away into a wallet-sized package. it was on my passenger seat... it was on my passenger seat... it **wasn't** on my passenger seat. or at least, not anymore.  bastard.  the events of the night before suddenly came rushing into perspective. a man (or possibly woman) walking up the street at night, sees my car, parked under the cold orange glow of a nearby street lamp. 'oh, what's that?', the opportunist thinks as he sees a black wallet tempting him from the passenger seat. 'i'll have that"", he continues as he readies his elbow for the pounding that awaits it. with one mighty blow the protection offered by the tempered glass is all for nought, as he intrudes into the confines of my car and steals the black wallet.  and then, he's gone. off into the night to, as far as he sees it at the moment, spend his ill-gotten gains, merely to find that all he can do with this stolen item is carry his shopping home.  so there we have it. my small attempt to save the environment by keeping canvas bags in my car led to a one hundred pound bill, and a disappointed crook. i only hope that he uses that hot bag to carry his shopping home. although more likely it will be used to carry stolen goods home. but at least he wont be using any plastic bags. the environment will thank him (hopefully by opening a great big sinkhole right underneath his feet).",0,,

987959,"alright, i'm going to take advantage of this for once. the following is a completely rough draft of a new thing i'm working on. it's a high fantasy set in a pre-renaissance style world, and it is populated with mythical beasts of all kinds, who are collectively referred to as ""starrulers."" all names of characters, factions, and the story itself are subject to change.  it's ~1200 words. i'm looking for heavy critique, as harsh as it needs to be. structure, tone, and voice would be helpful, as well as any ""opening to a story"" critiques you can offer me.  ---  with a rustle not unlike that of a young maiden's skirt, the pegasus fell to earth. he was but one of many whose broken bodies had come to litter the fields of ebonmoor. i watched him from the lone window in my cabin's loft and wished that i could understand. word had spread from the edges of the world, and everywhere it was the same: in the sky, the earth, and the sea, the starrulers were dying.  the shores of the ras'manne were bathed in the sickly sweet scent of rotting eel and petrichor as the massive corpses of sea serpents boiled up from the water and washed out upon the sun-baked sand. the deserts of vol tenin swirled with the ashy remnants of felled phoenix who had burst into nothingness and would never rise again.  drowned were the forests of ak'fosh letk as the skylords wept for the deaths of their kin. the undergrowth flooded as the mourning earthenkings refused to drink of the rain. the rivers and lakes frothed with the fury and despair of the marinadaeds, whose brothers and sisters swirled in dying eddies.  it was nothing short of tragedy, and not a soul knew why it was happening. there were whispers, of course. folk in my village were worried that it was a sign of endtimes, or plague. some claimed it was punishment for our collective wickedness, or that this was the dawn of a new era. the retired warriors grunted at one another, whispering that the starrulers fought one another over that most ancient hierarchy of theirs. others said it was by will of our newest king that these noble creatures perished.  whatever the reason, we had all come to agree that it was bad luck, and something must be done. the question was, what? what was there to do, and who could do it? until we had an answer, we could only sit in the local tavern, drink, and wonder.  in the early days, i had quickly discovered my distaste for sitting around a guttering stick of smokey tallow and listening to the village elders conspire. i was a respectable young man with a homestead to keep, after all, and it was nearing planting season. by the end of a few days, the excitement of something new and strange happening had worn off. i had taken to sticking near to my cabin to work my modest garden and tend my animals, just as i always had. i paid little mind to the sounds of bones crunching in the fields near my home, or the shake of the earth as some poor beast fell from the sky.  during the night, though, the melancholy took me, and i watched them fall from my loft window. it was the eighth day now of this ritual, and i sat in brooding silence with a cup of mulled wine. it had long grown cold. the wisps had been burning just below the cloudline since this morning, and now in the twilight they looked like streaks of shooting stars. they were such delicate things, and my heart ached that they should suffer such a fate. i expected to watch the cascade of wisps wink out of existence in sharp bursts of ethereal light. i did not expect to see a dragon.  yet, from the darkened skies above ebonmoor, a dragon fell. i saw her scales gleaming against the twilit glow of the first sun and suddenly, passionately wished not to be so helpless. i prayed for just one to be saved among the bloodied, unrecognizable lumps littering the countryside. the dragon plummeted toward the earth, and against the backdrop of burnt husks and dying wisps, i prayed only for her to live.  as if in answer, she stiffened. her wings spread—snapped—and caught the air. she jerked up, away from the ground and her doom, but it was too little and too late. a cloud of dust and spraying dirt erupted from the site of her ill-favored landing.  i was off like a shot from a sling the moment i gathered my wits. she had crashed, yes, but her wings had slowed her descent and there had been no bloody mist lit by the dying sunlight. had it been enough to save her? could she be there, hidden by a mound of smoking earth, bruised and broken but still so gloriously alive?  and if it hadn't been enough—if my prayer had fallen on deaf ears, if there had been no starruler behind those reptilian eyes to hear me and grant my only wish—then what was the point of her, anyway?  *you would retract your faith as quickly as give it? pah. flighty thing.*  i stumbled, but caught my feet beneath me and kept running. that voice! such raw, intoxicating power! how she seared every thought of mine that suggested anything but complete and utter devotion, and how i yearned to give myself to her. i hadn't reached her, or seen her, and yet i loved her more than life. i despaired to ever have doubted her. her glamor enveloped me and i ached for it. she was a skylord, and, oh, how she ruled me.  *you are forgiven, poetic creature that you are,* she purred, and i drew closer to the crater she had made. *you will serve me well.*  *yes,* i assured her, *i will do whatever you ask of me.*  *i know, my pet. i know.*  then i was there, scrabbling down the side of a hole in the ground lined with still-hot soil and smoldering feathers. i drank in her lizard-skin perfume and fought through the dust cloud to find her. she reached me first, limping though she was, and caught me in between her gentle foreclaws. i was but a toy in her grasp, and it suited me.  she was three times my size and breathtaking. her scales, even dulled as they were with dirt, glittered golden-orange with spots of red and white. a single patch of black upon her underbelly marked one of her hearts. she trilled to me between scaled lips, cracked ivory teeth and a snaking tongue of pale blue. a plume of red-gold feathers rose from between her perked ears, like a crown befitting such an enchanting queen. more of this soft down circled her throat like a ruff, decorated the tip of her delicate spiked tail, and coated the outside of her half-spread wings. the underside looked like old, membranous parchment and held a faint bluish tint. her claws were a dusky orange-red and not only lined her impressive paws, but hooked at the edges of her wings, like a bat's. she drew one down my lightly bearded cheek and sheared off some downy black hair.  *this will have to go.*  i was reluctant, for a moment, but her eyes—swirling orbs of gold and silver—caught me and swept me away on a blissful wave of her desire. i would have torn the skin from my cheeks, if that is what she wished of me. the dragon's glamor is a dangerous thing.",0,,

152693,"&gt; if the seller doesn't have any service records, that's a red flag.  the last car i had didn't have any service records. definitely not a lemon. 300,000 miles. car was more dependable than anything i own.   &gt; also, discovering little problems can reveal that the seller isn't being very honest, definitely a red flag. he should have told you about them right?  i disagree. forgetting small details like worn weather stripping shouldn't be indicative that he's lying. i told the last buyer about everything that the car had done, but i forgot to mention that the right rear vanity window has worn weather stripping and that at high speeds it will have a wind-rushing sound.  &gt;  if the seller is hesitant at all or will not allow you to do a pre-purchase inspection, walk. it's probably a lemon.  this i agree with. though i have never encountered this when buying cars. i even visited a car lot that had one a very bad car up on those ramps. holes in the muffler. the bumper was all messed up. things that most people wouldn't notice unless the car was being worked on.  -----  okay, the list:  exterior   * paint. no scratches, swirls, or mis-matching panels. * body panels. should be free of dents, dings, scratches. look from many angles to make sure they body panels line up. the gap between each body panel should be even. if the body panel is misaligned or the color doens't match the rest of the car, could be a sign that there was work done. * windows should be clear. sit inside the car and point the car towards a bright light. if the window is badly pitted, you'll get a lot of sparkles. the window should *disappear*, or not be seen (of course, unless tinted.)  interior  * check the rugs. this can tell a big story about how well they take care of the car. bad upholstery is a sign of a bad owner. look for tears or sections where it's worn down. stains. carpet that looks newer than the car or is a different color from the rest of the car (gray seats/removable rug with green carpet) might suggest that the original carpet may have been replaced for some reason. * the instrument panel needles should move freely. some cars will start and the dials will do a full sweep, some do not. watch out for bouncy speedo or tach dials.  * dash should be free of cracks or fading * make sure the knobs and dials are all functional and easy to move. * glove compartment should close completely and not rattle (a pet peeve of mine) * press every button, including horn, to make sure it works.   motor  * check condition of motor oil. new oil is the color of honey, used but okay color could be brown to dark brown. black means it's due or is over due. check level - warm the car up and pull the dipstick, wipe clean, then check again. should be between the hot and cold areas. it's pretty simple to read. low oil is more of a problem than old oil.  * coolant should be bright green or orange. do not check coolant while the car is hot/warm. typically you don't check the coolant from the radiator, you check the level from the resevoir. make sure there are no cracks. you might see them as white ashy lines. you will also smell something sweet coming from the motor if it is leaking. * tranny fluid. i'm assuming this odyssey is auto, but i'll include both manual and auto for others. auto tranny fluid should be clear and red. there is a dipstick that you can check the fluid from. there should be no contaminants. get a white paper towel and wipe the dipstick on that. should be red and clear. manual tranny fluid can differ, and it is harder to check. you have to unbolt the filler bolt and dip your finger in. check for contaminents. color should be similar to motor oil.  * hydraulic fluid - brakes, clutch, power steering. open the resevoir and check for contaminated fluid. fluid should be bright yellow and clear. dark color may indicate a leak in the system. brake fluid can be a little low, but not dangerously low, due to worn pads.  * check the instrument panel for a check engine light. if so, check the obd error code. you will need a device to do this. * check the overall condition of the motor. should not see any dark wet spots which may indicate a leaking fluid.  * engine mounts. * air filter. * belts. should not have any cracks. * spark plugs. should not be overly worn, but slightly worn is okay. make sure the gap is within spec. * fuel filter. make sure changed on schedule. * cv boots. should not be ripped * check the rear bumper/exhaust. if the side under which the exhaust sits is darker and has more grime on it than the other side, this could indicate that the car is burning oil. when the car is on, there should be no visible smoke. some quickly disappating steam when the car starts to a few minutes afterward is fine. look for grey or blue colored exhaust. * make sure there are no holes in the exhaust system. check the muffler for any rust or holes. things to ask about:  were the catalytic converter and o2 sensors changed on scheduled.  tires  * run your hand over the tread. there shouldn't be anything that grabs your hand. look for uneven tread wear. things like cupping or increased wear on one side. make sure there is enough tread left on the tire. there are wear indicators. they run between the tread like a bridge. when the tread wears down enough and becomes flush with those indicators, it's time to change the tires.   brakes  * kind of hard to check while the tires are on. check for pad material thats left. check to make sure the brake rotor is free from cracks and deep score lines. the surface can be imperfect, but should be even. you can run your fingernail across it. if there are deep grooves or big peaks or valleys, there is a problem.   miscellaneous  * when driving, the car should not exessively squat or dive when accelerating or braking hard, respectively. the car should also not bounce when traveling over bumps. when taking a corner, the car should not feel like it's skidding across the pavement. when accelerating hard, the drive wheels should not hop. these may indicate worn struts.  * abs. take the car to an open area that has a patch of gravel. safely accelerate to 20 mph and travel over the gravel patch and quickly and firmly press and hold the brakes. do this in an area in which if you skid past the gravel patch, you will not hit anything else. if the abs is working, you may see the indicator light on the dash. there is a distinct grinding-whining sound along with the pulsating brake pedal that lets you know the system is working.  * open and close the doors. roll the windows all the way up or down. lock the doors. check the interior dome lights. check all exterior lights. get a flashlight, even in daylight, and inspect everywhere. including under the seats. make sure the rear view mirror stays in place. check everything that is power.  * carfax is good, but it shouldn't be considered the absolute truth. there are ways around it. on a car so new with only one prior owner, i wouldn't be too worried though.   * you mentioned you're buying from a dealer. get financed beforehand if you don't already have the money. don't walk in knowing what you can't spend. again, you know what car you won't so this might not apply, but it may apply to others.   * maintenance as inspection points (should be done by your mechanic): timing. valve clearance. air pressure. compression test. clutch. battery. belt tension. wheel balance. camber/toe inspection. pedal height and play adjustment. wheel hub play (for bad bushings).  okay, that's all i can think of. i tried to be general on purpose so i can hit a lot of points without being lost in the details.   good luck.",0,,
774673,"&gt;disingenuous parallel.  ""the real opposite"" by societal standards and pressure would be:  a woman is dating three men and wants to decide which to marry.  she decides to evaluate them.  she has each of them go home and groom and dress themselves in their best outfit to bring out their best features.  the first man, dorian, is older than the other two men.  he has a little salt and pepper mixed in with his jet black hair and has steel gray eyes.  his handsome face and overall serious look exude a sense of power.  he is dressed n a 2 piece black suit with pinstripes, he is wearing the woman's favorite tie.  overall he looks like he walked off a movie set and into an after hours party in hollywood.  dorian stares straight into the woman's eyes, looking deep into her and gives a knowing smile.  the woman is impressed.  the second man, william, arrived in what the women knew was the best visual summary of who he was.  william has dirty blond hair, a smart looking face and azure blue eyes.  he is tall, ""light"" and handsome.  he is wearing a cream linen shirt with matching slacks and sandals.  the cream contrasting against his evenly tanned skin almost appears white.  looking into his face the woman feels that she could sail away with william and forget the world and all it's frustrating affairs.  william stares directly into the woman's eyes and gently smiles.  again the woman is impressed.  the third gentleman arrives, richard.  richard is the youngest of the three and the most muscularly built.  he isn't a wall of a man but his muscle definition is that of an olympic swimmer.  his dark brown hair compliments hi olive green eyes.  he wears a 2 day scruff and it alludes to his bohemian lifestyle.  richard rode his chopper to the get together and his hands, while strong and muscular, are a bit dirty and rough.  this isn't a delicate pretty boy.  he is dressed in fitted jeans and a long worn leather jacket.  what muscle that is exposed glistens with a light sheen of moisture.  richard stares directly into the woman's eyes and gives a mischievous smirk. and again she is impressed.  the woman then goes to think for a long time about each of the man's personalities and physical traits.  she thought about their hobbies, their strengths, their weaknesses.  she thought about which was the best in bed, which was the best while cuddling, which was the best out on a date.  she thought about how each man excites her in different ways and how could she possibly do without some of those things.  the woman thought long and hard but came to a decision...  ...she married the one with the most money.  &gt;and that's the real opposite, the reason why it didn't make sense when you just flipped genders is because you didn't flip the gender stereotypes.",1,,1
914181,why is that conservatives vigorously defend blackwater? this would seem to me to be an issue that transcends party lines. privatizing the military is a bad idea. i can't imagine that even libertarians would appreciate a privatized army as it's a very clear case of a conflict of interest.,0,,

975309,"chodorov on 'defenders' of the free market, from an essay in his [one is a crowd (pdf)](http://mises.org/books/onecrowd.pdf):  ---  if the run-of-the-mill american is as gullible as this literature assumes, and there is reason to believe that he is, there are nevertheless the lessons of experience which even infantilism cannot dull. imagine feeding rags-to-riches syrup to the sharecropper who remembers being dispossessed onto the highway, or to his children who learned to hold out the hand of beggary. then, there's the glorious tale of the penniless immigrant who rose to affluence; what can be the effect of this pap on the fellow who lived by the grace of the [w. p. a.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/works_progress_administration) when bank bankruptcy wiped out his lifetime savings? what goes on in the mind of the mechanic who, on reading about the ""overall picture"" of national prosperity, or the tables of comparative wages, recalls the ten years of wage-less nightmare, until the war brought hypodermic relief? even now, dulling the enjoyment of his inflationary comfort is the spectre of impending depression.  all this experience the anti-socialistic literature passes over lightly with figures, carried out to three percentage points. the inference is plain that the ""poor ye have always""--and nothing can be done about it. it's fine solace to be labeled an ""unemployable"" or to be put among the ""surplus population.""  but somehow the lowliest of the species resents being a statistic. he flatters himself that he is a man. whatever his intellectual deficiencies, his sense perceptions are keen; recorded in the memory of his belly is data the economists cannot get to. and that memory tells him that there is a lie somewhere in the pollyannish picture of america being presented to him.  [...]  sure, the ""average"" wage in this country is a princely income compared to that of the chinese coolie. what of it? the ""average"" american worker--whatever that is--produces more; well, if he produces more he is entitled to more, and why give credit to a ""system"" for the labor he puts out? according to the figures in this anti-socialistic literature he absorbs in wages about all he produces, and yet his eyes tell him that there are a lot of fellows who produce nothing, or very little, and they seem to get along quite well. who produces what they have? he's envious, to be sure, but he's also sensitive to a wrong he cannot locate.  the socialists locate it for him. he never will understand their many-worded fable about surplus-value and the class struggle and the glories of controlled economy. no matter. these fellows at least come clean; they admit the poverty-amidst-plenty incongruity, and in so doing they gain the confidence of the mass-man. having gained his confidence, they find it easy to ""teach"" him the mysteries of their solution. their shibboleths are plausible; they ""explain"" and they promise. he accepts their leadership.  [...]  this fact the socialistic tacticians have been wise enough to recognize. from marx and engels to attlee and wallace, due homage was always given to the ""will of the people,"" although the shaping and direction of that will has ever been the private prerogative of the intelligentsia, the leadership. they won the mass-man by appealing to the intelligence they knew he did not have; in the name of education they filled him with phrases which served him well enough for understanding. but--and this is of utmost importance--he became a willing ""student"" because they told him what he knew only too well: that the world as is is not the best of all possible worlds.  [...]  the current slogan of this effort to forestall socialism is ""free enterprise.""  now, enterprise consists of nothing else, in the economic field, than the production and exchange of goods and services, by individuals acting in their own interests, and it is free only when the process is rid of legal interventions. the ultimate object is to provide an abundance of the things men want, to flood the marketplace. that means low prices, or prices determined by the equation of supply and demand without restrictions on supply. if that is what the ""free enterprisers"" were really for, they would concentrate on the rescinding of laws making for scarcities--and they would inform the mass-man that the cause for his lack (admitting first that there is an unwarranted lack) are these laws and the practices that have grown up under them.  first of all, they would direct attention to the scarcities resulting from tariffs, quotas, the manipulation of money, fictitious quarantine laws and other devices for preventing foreign goods from reaching our market. you see nothing about that in their literature. the inference is that free trade is not included in their concept of free enterprise. why? is it because of a concern for the higher prices which this limitation on competition affords them?  taxation is a major interference with enterprise, simply because what is taken by the state is production which was intended for the market. taxes on commodities are added to price and therefore decrease the purchasing power of wages; taxes on incomes and inheritances discourage production. these facts are rarely mentioned in any of the ""free enterprise"" literature; when it does touch on taxation the comment is limited to ""equitable"" distribution, which, on examination, simmers down to the shifting of the burden from one class of citizens to another. the reason is clear. you cannot expect the holders of government bonds to attack the income tax (which is the necessary precursor of state capitalism), because the prime security behind these bonds is the power of the state to levy on incomes. nor can you expect liquor interests to oppose liquor taxes because if these were abolished every farmer could open a distillery.  you read in this ""free enterprise"" literature about government extravagances. but, what about particulars? subsidies to railroads, airplane and shipping companies (via the post office) are clearly extravagances, supporting and encouraging inefficiency; but, the values of the stocks and bonds issued by these companies are enhanced thereby and hence the subject is taboo; subsidies which cannot be capitalized, like handouts to veterans and unemployed, can be attacked. parity prices provide a cushion for the commodity market, and also hold up the value of agricultural land; the ""free enterprisers"" avoid the subject. militarism is undoubtedly the greatest waste of all, besides being the greatest threat to freedom of the individual, and yet it is rather condoned than opposed by those whose hearts bleed for freedom, according to their literature.  one could go on paragraph after paragraph with instances of state interferences with enterprise which the ""free enterprise"" bilge skirts around or ignores. one is driven to the conclusion that the sponsors are not at all in favor of what they preach. they are rather for the status quo, for the legal into favored position. they are for privilege, as is, and not for the sanctity of private property.  is it any wonder that the only following this kind of leadership can muster is what it can buy? is it any wonder that the socialists have the mass-field to themselves?",0,,
111338,"hey! i always felt really ugly, especially growing up. my mom was not a ""girly girl"" at all, she doesn't care about clothes, makeup, hair, or any kind of personal hygiene other than base stuff (bathing, cutting nails, brushing teeth). but learning a few tips and tricks for personal hygiene &amp; grooming has really made me start to feel beautiful. this is all highly subjective and i'm not an expert by any means but hopefully some of this can help.   1. losing weight a lot of people say to only eat when you're hungry, but i think this is a bad idea -- schedule your meals and don't snack excessively. sometimes i've eaten a mountain of food and i still feel hungry, other times i haven't eaten all day and i don't feel hungry at all. i'm sure i'm not unique in this. making sure that you eat a consistent and appropriate amount of calories every day with balanced and planned meals ensures that you don't become overweight *or* malnourished/underweight, and it helps fend off eating disordered thoughts when you're trying to lose weight. otherwise, i've found that taking the bus and walking instead of driving has helped me stay thin. i literally don't do any other exercise, but **wow** do cars make you gain weight.    2. eyebrows don't overpluck them, because they won't ever grow back the same! if you want, go to a salon and get them waxed/threaded -- you can have the aesthetician decide what they think is best, or give them a general guideline of how you'd like them to look (e.g. strong brows if you like the cara delevingne look). i am blonde and used to just pluck my brows, but i've recently started filling them in with brow pencil. not only do defined brows frame a person's face much better, you can make them even with a pencil in ways that just plucking won't do.    3. hair is frizzy tbh i don't know what to tell you on this one -- my hair sucks! my hair is super fine and flat and dry, but gets greasy and gross if i condition it. what has worked best for me so far is only shampooing once every 3-4 days to prevent dryness and frizz, and using dry shampoo for volume and de-oiling in between. would recommend.   4. skin not to sound like a commercial but i always recommend ceravé's foaming face wash. it's what my dermatologist recommends, and i have similar skin to yours -- both dry skin and (before i used accutane), lots of acne. always use an spf moisturizer or primer before you put makeup on, to prevent makeup drying out your skin, getting cakey/flakey, etc. use spf moisturizer all year long (you can get a snowburn from sunlight -- i'm canadian and i've gotten them). if you have acne i would recommend going to a dermatologist if you can afford it. they can give you some nice topical ointments to help with minor-moderate acne, or you can go for the big guns (accutane or antibiotics) if it's painful and severe.   5. teeth brush your teeth more, always drink soda with a straw, and get them whitened if you can afford it one day. i have terrible yellow teeth because i drink like 5 cups of (decaf) tea a day, but drinking tea, coffee, or wine with a straw (metal, to avoid hot drinks causing plastic to leech chemicals) helps avoid staining on the front teeth. it looks stupid while you're out and about but is totally feasible at home.    6. hair removal this is the easiest one :) your own personal preferences and hairiness level will likely determine how time consuming this is for you. it could be anything from 5 minutes a week to 30 minutes a day. legs you can do quickly and easily with shaving cream/gel (or conditioner, in a bind) and razors. just wipe some of the shaving cream on your legs, and gently (not scraping!) slide the razor up your leg, while still applying a gentle but firm pressure. rinse the shaving cream off the razor and go again until your legs are nice and smooth. you'll notice what works and what doesn't :) waxing legs isn't really worth it imo. underarms you can get waxed or can shave. bikini area you can either get waxed, lazered off, shave, or trim. i don't recommend leaving your bikini area totally unattended to because long hairs can trap period blood, discharge, sweat, and other ickies in there all day. trimming once or twice a week with scissors or (preferably) an electric bikini trimmer is the perfect low-maintenance, relaxed option for pubic hair maintenance, whereas a wax is more effort &amp; money but you get a very smooth, nice end result. shaving works for a lot of people but if you have sensitive skin it can give you painful/itchy little red bumps. if you have facial hair that bothers you, many women wax, pluck or bleach that -- a salon can help. arm hair is usually either ignored or bleached. to be honest in winter time i (and most of my female friends) just *become hairy* because we live in canada so nobody but our kind, understanding, thoroughly winterized boyfriends are gonna see anything but our faces and hands anyway. winter is nice. i would thoroughly recommend being hairy during winter -- girls don't have time for all of this shit all year long!   7. make-up make up is hard! i'm still not very good at it and i've been wearing it since 14 (i'm 21). one of the easiest things you can do to look better is have a good base, so foundation/concealer/powder. if you're worried about acne, clinique makes a liquid foundation called ""acne solutions"" infused with salicylic acid, but if you're pale it might not work -- i can't wear it as i'm too pale. something that i've found is low-maintenance and lets my annoying skin breathe is applying a good amount of spf moisturizer, letting it mostly dry, using a beauty blender to apply concealer (it comes in paler shades than foundation) over red or tired spots while blending into the normal-skin next to it, and then applying powder foundation or sensitive skin in the palest shade, to provide light coverage and prevent shine. fixing/setting spray helps after this. if you want more coverage for a date or event, try mac studio fix fluid in nw/nc 15 -- it's the palest foundation i've found at an affordable price. it is quite heavy on your skin though, and some people break out from it, so don't use it as an everyday foundation if you're concerned about acne. eyeshadow looks good but i don't bother with it -- there are good beginner youtube tutorials. volumizing mascara and filled-in brows go a long way towards making your facial features pop. drugstore products work beautifully for this kind of stuff, although if you pay for sephora stuff it'll probably be easier to use well. if you find you tend to get clumpy lashes, buy a lash comb to help separate and define your lashes. the lash comb/spoolie brush is also nice for combing your eyebrows before you fill them in. if you want to change your face shape you can find youtube tutorials for contouring, but most people don't bother with this for an everyday school/work look :) i would avoid dramatic lip looks when not wearing foundation or concealer, if you're self-conscious about your skin -- dark, purply, and red lips can draw out acne spots and make them more visible. wearing lipsticks with a blue undertone (like berry shades, mauve-y pinks, blue-toned reds, etc.) will help make your teeth look whiter. if you find it difficult to discern what lipsticks are ""blue-toned"", beauty gurus on the internet have made lists of ""good lipsticks for yellow teeth"" -- you can just pluck your favourite shade off those lists and buy it online. to optimize teeth whiteness, avoid corals, peaches, bright pinks, and orange-toned reds. but tbh i have yellow teeth and i like wearing coral lipstick so fuck it. if it looks good and makes you happy, smear it on. lipsticks don't have very long wear but are easy to fix if you fuck up -- mac is the gold standard, but i love my $2 joe fresh lipstick too. using a lip liner pencil really does help for preventing your lipstick from bleeding onto your adjacent skin, and for outlining your lips in a more precise way than the big unwieldy lipstick will be able to, but it isn't essential if you're on a budget. lip stains are good for long wear while eating and drinking, but if you fuck them while applying them you're in for an ordeal. tinted lip balms are lovely and low-maintenance for every day -- burts bees makes some nice ones for cheap. some women like lip gloss but i find it too sticky and shiny. honestly chapstick goes a long way -- just having nice, well-moisturized plain lips still looks beautiful.    8. dress sense pick one feature on your body that you like. maybe you have big, voluptuous breasts, or a waspish waist, or a cute butt, or nice legs or arms or collarbones or whatever. pick your favourite thing, and dress to emphasize it. if you love your legs, wear skinny-fit pants, dresses with tights, shorts, skirts, etc. if you love your collarbones, wear lots of scoop-neck or boat-neck shirts/dresses that show them, and delicate little necklaces. you get the dealio. try to find people whose style you like, and emulate that. it's as simple as watching some girly tv shows and saying ""i like that"". personally i love to emulate blair from gossip girl and petra from jane the virgin. eventually you'll meld together so many different looks you like that you develop your own personal style, haha. cute clothes can make you feel 10 million times prettier.   9. pale skin honestly being pale is no big deal. every skin tone is beautiful :) i'm pale as hell -- you can see all my veins -- and i have never been told i look sick. i kind of like my vampiric, english-aristocratic paleness. tan if you want (use fake tanner/spray tan -- don't give yourself skin cancer at a tanning booth!) but it's not that important, imo -- both tanning and skin bleaching are **dangerous** and every skin colour is lovely.",0,,

147228,"water is easy. you can get pretty much whatever color you want by adding organisms of the right color. on earth, you see water color from brilliant blue to green, and muddy reds to almost black. the early oceans on earth were likely purple due the the bacteria in them absorbing green light.   the color of the sky really depends on a few factors - the thickness of the atmosphere, and the color of the light created by the planet's primary star(s). most planets orbiting k, g, and f type stars have a sky color ranging from white to blue, while planets around m stars may be anywhere from very dim reds through orange to white. a thick atmosphere means that the sky would be brighter and whiter, while a thin atmosphere makes it darker and skews the scattering towards the highest frequencies available. you can see this on earth, where the sky tends to be a more and more brilliant blue as you ascend in altitude.   given this, yellow and green skies would tend to be very unusual and would likely be due to contaminants in the atmosphere, as is the case on the examples i give below. violet skies are also probably very difficult to achieve due to the way that the human eye collects light, but i feel that in cases where you have very hot stars and thin atmospheres it could happen. most skies would be in the range from yellow-orange to white to brilliant blue, just like star colors.   i always like to talk about examples, so here are some examples of sky color from worlds in my setting:  **red:** new alaska is a medium sized planet that contains rich mineral deposits. the climate is cold due to the thin atmosphere (40% earth's) and dim m8 primary star (2200 k temperature). the dim light gives the sky a distinct reddish cast, but as most of the radiation of the star is in the ir frequencies it is only really visible near the horizon. the apex of the sky is typically very dark.   **orange:** shamash is a large world orbiting an m4 star (temperature 2900 k). the large, orange-red sun and the pale orange sky can be difficult to distinguish from each other at times. the thick atmosphere causes the sky to be a little paler than it might be otherwise.   **yellow:** galt is a small terrestrial planet with a very thin biosphere orbiting a k9 star (temperature 3700 k). there is a lot of dust in the atmosphere, which is about one-third the density of earth's. outside of the pressure domes, the sky tends to be a washed-out pale yellow color due to high-altitude dust.   **green:** virida, named for it's unusual green sky, is a planet with enough clouds and plant matter in the atmosphere that the sky on the surface is almost always a dull greenish-gray. higher up in the atmosphere it gets much more earth-like, and above the clouds the sky is a very pale, washed out blue with greenish-gray clouds below. the primary star is a k0 star with a temperature of around 4900 k  **white:** beatrice is a large terrestrial planet with a thick atmosphere orbiting a g6 star (temperature 5450 k). due to the thick atmosphere (about 2.5 times as thick as earth's) the sky is mostly white, making it hard to distinguish clouds. there is usually a thick haze over distant objects, making them appear blue or purple.   **blue:** an intensely blue sky occurs on hephaestus prime, a large world orbiting an f8 star (temperature 6200k) with an atmosphere about 70% as thick as earth's. the combination of a brighter star and a slightly thinner atmosphere mean that the sky is a deep blue color similar to what is seen at extremely high altitudes on earth.   **violet:** hi'iaka is a small, mars-sized terrestrial planet with an atmosphere about 50% of earth's thickness, orbiting another f8 star (temperature 6250 k). the combination of thin atmosphere and bright white star creates a brilliantly colored sky that just barely has a violet cast to it.",0,,

999016,"two can play that game.  where's the good science showing that the vast majority of bankruptcies are from deadbeats?  just because you can debunk one study coming to a conclusion, does not mean either a)that conclusion is necessarily false, or b)that the *opposite* conclusion is any more likely to be true.  my proposition is just common sense - every time someone goes to the er without health coverage, unless they lie on their paperwork, that is a person who's almost certainly either going to file bankruptcy, or simply become a credit non-entity.    with roughly a quarter of the public uninsured, that's a hell of a lot of people going bankrupt when their appendix needs cutting out.  are you saying a quarter of the population is comprised of addicted gamblers?  because i think it's pretty clear which group is larger and more at-risk.  but again, if you've got actual statistics showing the majority of bankruptcies being from deadbeats, i'll look.  edit - in fact, reading the article you linked to a bit more closely, the person debunking the study - while raising good questions - really contributed nothing significant.  he didn't say by what percentage, say, health-related bankruptcies would be reduced if you took out gambling addiction.  or how long a time span he considers appropirate to say health problems were a primary cause of bankruptcy.  he asks a lot of (good) questions, but gives no answers, and even concludes by saying that yes, almost certainly a lot of bankruptcies are caused by medical issues - just not as many as the study claimed.  which means he's not even disproving their overall conclusion, just bickering about their interpretation of the numbers.",0,,

449280,"&gt; what are people's reactions when you tell them you are completely colourblind?  usually it's surprise and then they point to something and ask what color it is. sometimes they follow it up with a question about color perception. typically it's something like ""how do you know which light is glowing when you drive?""  &gt; is there a certain type/style of art you prefer? or are your opinions on art/paintings not affected by being colourblind.  i really like abstract art. because colors don't come across, the textures really do it for me.  &gt; what is the worst/best thing that's happened because of your colourblindness?  worst thing was ordering $15,000 worth of the wrong colored gel for theatrical lighting.  best thing would have to be the ongoing ability to troll people. ""hey, hand me the purple paint?""  **hand them yellow** ""what the hell? i said the purple paint!""  **hand them green** ""seriously, knock it off and give me the purple paint."" ""dude, i'm color blind."" ""oh yeah, sorry.""  &gt; if you were offered disability checks because of being colourblind, would you accept them? or would you personally feel that being colourblind isn't that big of a deal.  at the moment, yes, simply because i'm riding the edge of destitute and unemployed. otherwise, no. i don't see colorblindness as being a disability.  &gt; what has been the biggest limitation because of your condition? (e.g. not being able to be a pilot/astronaut)  believe it or not, making sure my clothes match. oddly enough, showing up to a job interview with a blue tie, yellow shirt and orange suit jacket... it makes you look a little off. :p  i've since eliminated this problem by changing to a nearly all-black wardrobe.  &gt; do you have noticeable strengths when determining patterns/textures?  indeed i do. i've learned through years of practice that colors have a specific texture/feeling. i can usually pinpoint, with decent accuracy, what color something is based on how it feels on my eyes (if that makes any sense).  some colors i have a harder time with, specifically blues/greens and blues/purples. because the blue texture is so strong for me, when it gets mixed in with something else it tends to overpower the other color.  &gt; do you have any tools/aids to help you with being colourblind? or do you just point and ask people ""what colour is that"".  at this point in my life, i'm pretty okay. but doing technical theater lighting really helped. because i would have a swatch of gels, i could use those to compare the feel of something. i still keep a couple of them around.  http://www.rosco.com/us/filters/roscolux.cfm is exactly what i have.  &gt; have you gotten to a point where you can assume certain objects are ""red"" or ""blue""? or do you not feel a need to learn what colour objects are ""supposed to be""?  i can safely assume a color in most cases. leaves, grass, sky, coolers, things like that. things that tend not to vary their colors too much.  things that come in many different colors or things that have a physical texture which conflicts with the texture of the color, i often have a hard time with.  &gt; do you plan on having kids, and if so, do you plan on genetic screening with your partner to determine if there is a chance of your child to be colourblind like you?  i'm genetically sterile, so that's not really a concern for me.  &gt; do you have any funny/memorable stories that exist because of you being colourblind?  at my previous job, they gave a paper test to check aptitude/general knowledge and your ability to troubleshoot.  the first question was something along the lines of:   ""you enter a completely dark room. there is a pile of socks in the middle of the floor. there are 10 red socks, 10 blue socks and 10 green socks in the pile. how many socks do you need to bring out of the room to ensure you have at least one matching pair?""  my response: ""i'm color blind, so i could bring out two and claim they match, but the answer you are hoping i respond with is 'four'.""  when i turned in the test, one person started asking me questions while the other read over the test. the woman reading the test started laughing out loud and handed the test to the other interviewer. ""check out his first answer."" he read it and then started laughing.  ""**hahaha** that's hilarious. but you can see color, right?""   ""no, i'm completely color blind.""  they instantly sobered and apologized for laughing at my disability. :p  another that pops into mind is a co-worker who got a new t-shirt: http://www.tshirthell.com/funny-shirts/fuck-the-colorblind/?xid=69c9f418-831f-4a34-e90b-115f0a007197  he and my other teammates were laughing about it, but i wasn't joining in. he kept pointing to the disk in the center of the shirt and laughing.  ""do you get it?"" ""no."" ""c'mon, it's funny. how could you not get it?"" ""get what?"" ""it says 'fuck the color blind'! how is that not hilarious?"" ""hey, fucker. i **am** color blind."" ""oh shit. dude, i'm so sorry.""  &gt; are you told by people that a component of your vision is more acute then theirs? (e.g. you can see in the dark more easily, or something like that?)  about the only thing that my vision is better at than a color-seeing person's is camouflage. if someone is wearing some camo and trying to blend in with bushes or trees or whatever, i see a guy hiding in a bush.  the fact that i'm color blind actually has more drawbacks. for example, i have a *very* hard time driving in the rain or snow at night. the on-coming lights, plus the mist or flakes, washes everything out. imagine an old tv channel where you get nothing but the ""snow effect"" and that's basically what it is like for me.  edit: another thing that gets me is camo in video games. you'd think that with rl camo not getting to me, i'd not have a problem, but there's a big difference.  because real camo exists in 3d, i can see the difference in depth/outline. camo in video games, because it's all flat, blends in with the background colors and i can't differentiate it. it really sucks when playing an fps with those camping sniper fucks.   &gt; do you have any issues when picking out fresh groceries from the supermarket?  nah, i let the wife handle that. i grab the boxed/canned/labeled items. she grabs the produce. :p  &gt; do certain ""colours"" strain your eyes?  nope. the easiest way to get an idea of what it's like to see through my eyes would be to take a picture, any picture, and photoshop it to gray scale. according to my eye doctor, that's what it would look like.  &gt; have you ever done something you thought was normal and gotten stares from others because of your condition? (e.g. mismatched a shirt/pants, had a huge stain on your shirt that you couldn't see, ate uncooked meat)  rather frequently, though sometimes i'm just trolling people. i argue with people all the time about what color something is. or i'll pretend i can't see a physical object. like a truck parked halfway into the side-walk. i'll intentionally walk into it. ""what the fuck? why can't i walk?"" ""because there is a big red truck in the way, dumbass. how could you miss it?"" ""ummm... hello? color blind, asshole. remember?""  it usually takes them a few seconds to catch on. :d  oh, and old black and white movies. those things fuck with me. i'll comment on the color scheme of something and i'll receive looks because of it.  &gt; have you ever been taken advantage of because you are colourblind?  not seriously. i've had a few people at fabric stores jokingly try and give me fabric that's different than what i ask for.  oh, and at a local tandy leather, i was asking for assistance in color-matching a specific dye. the guy that was helping me tried explaining it like ""this is a vibrant green. you know, like the green in the mexican flag."" ""sorry, i don't know. i'm color blind."" ""oh, then this is the dye you want.""  he handed me a black dye.  i looked at the label and handed it back to him. ""i'm color blind, not illiterate.""  &gt; have you ever pretended that you weren't colourblind in certain situations, and guessed what colours things were?  i'm not sure i understand the first part of the question. i've definitely guessed at what color things are.  &gt; are you aware of any research being done to replace the missing rods/cones in people's eyes? would you be willing to try it?  sorry, i'm not. and i don't think i would be willing to try it. i'm already terrified of going blind, the thought of someone dicking around with my eyes scares the shit out of me.  &gt; how did the job interview go?  it went well, thank you. i am one of 3 people being brought back for a 2nd interview tomorrow or thursday.  edited to add: totally missed the question about what resides in my fridge. at the moment, beer. lots of beer. and some cauliflower. and some leftover spaghetti sauce.

734877,"what supplies do you already have?  what's your budget like?  you can get hues until you're rich or good enough to have real pigment matter.  it doesn't really matter with contemporary paint from what i know.  it will be expensive, you should try acrylics or watercolors unless you already have oil painting stuff.  this is a start of what to do and what to know, just some random things:  a book exists called ""yellow and blue don't make green"".    http://schoolofcolor.com/acatalog/blue_and_yellow.html  the biggest thing i took from it was that there aren't any ""just red, just blue, just yellow"" colored paints in your standard color palettes.  they will tend toward one or other direction on the color wheel:  yellow-green or yellow-orange  blue-violet or blue-green  red-orange or red-violet  this comes in handy when mixing colors because if you don't know your ""color bias"", then sometimes you mix muddy colors and sometimes you mix them vividly, but it's by luck or guessing, rather than knowing.  for example; if you want to mix purple, traditional theory just says ""mix red and blue"".  now, if you want your purple to be purple! then you would want to mix red-violet with blue-violet.  if you want a muted, more ""muddy"" purple, you mix red-orange with blue-green.  for something in between you can mix red-violet with blue-green or red-orange with blue-violet.  that's knowing!  this goes the same for mixing; oranges or greens.  when you're looking for this ""color bias"" your eye will kinda train itself i guess, but you will obviously need 2 yellows, 2 blues, 2 reds, white, and black if you need it (i never use it, i mix my own blacks) i also have burnt umber, yellow ochre, and cadmium red light.    i don't remember the recommended starting palette from the color mixing book i mentioned, so look it up before you buy paints.  thats just a starting point, you may find yourself buying many more colors than that if the painting bug sticks!  here's some different ""traditional"" color palette selections you might also take a look at, but keep in mind what i said about color bias at all times.  burn that into your brain!  http://www.gamblincolors.com/oil.painting.techniques/palettes.html  mixing my blacks i usually use ultramarine blue and burnt umber in about equal portions, but just mix until it's what you want.  another black making combo is a viridian green and alizaren red.  you can't mix a perfect black, but it's very rare in nature to find a perfect black if you can see anything, because it's all about light.  no light, you can't see, there's no color, there's nothing to paint :p  (very over simplified late night typing)   add white to lighten things.  it can also make some of those kinda transparent colors (like alizarin and viridian) more opaque, but it will also lighten it.  also, add white to your mixed ""black"" colors gradually until you get the mixed ""grey"" you want.  it's important to mix your own black because when you grey it out, it is either going to be a ""warm"" grey or a ""cool"" grey, depending your ""mixed black bias"" (made up term) toward one of the 2 colors you mixed for that black.  here's a thing you can learn in a fews seconds: look at something white and ask yourself if it is a ""warm white"" or a ""cool white""?  you'll get the hang of it, practice as much as you can!  mixing color is much more complicated than people generally seem to understand and i have very much oversimplified things!  ask me for clarification if needed.  :)  a good starting exercise to learn how to mix black, grey, and warm or cool:  materials: paper  gesso brushes palette knife (if you mix with your bushes, your brushes will pick up more paint than necessary between bristles and you ruin brushes, waste paint, make them harder to clean.) ultramarine blue burnt umber any white  assignment: construct a still life out of entirely white objects.  gesso your paper and wait for it to dry.  quickly sketch your still life to ""block in"" the composition and proportions (don't worry about details at this point).  5 to 15 minutes to sketch.  mix a decent sized glob of black out of the ultramarine and burnt umber and mix until it looks black.  pull a little away to another part of the palette and add a little white to see if its too ""warm"" or too ""cool"".  keep trying until you get the most precise grey in your little tests away from the main glob, then you will know the glob is as close to black as you can mix.  mess around on a scrap piece of paper, no gesso, and try some ""greyscales"", and some ""temperature scales"" to become familiar with mixing from white to black and warm to cool.  when you are comfortable with this, you can start painting in the sketch!  pay close attention to the sensitive shifts in colors, values, and temperatures, try to paint that as accurately as you can with this limited palette.  spend 20 to 45 minutes on it, depending on how ""into the zone"" you are.  do a couple of different paintings like this!  my first painting was done in a painting class in college, it was done like this!  also, read as much about techniques, tools, artists, and anything else related to oil painting.  practice and experimentation alone will be slow and painful.  build upon the knowledge that has come before you, they took the time to write it all down for you!  not enough artists do this, imo.  not reading enough is like trying to grow plants with too little sunlight!  you can do you first dozen or more paintings on cardbaord, cheap posterboard from the dollar store, thick paper, etc.  you can also glue paper to cardboard to give it a stiff back.  next you will cover your painting surface with ""gesso"".  it's a white base that protects the paper or canvas or any other material for absorbing the oil paints and being eaten away over time by the paint!  you can make your own gesso, but i haven't yet, so i can't recommend a mixture, but i do know it's way cheaper!  get some ""filbert brushes"" and some ""brights"" and a good variety of brushes that you just feel you might use for the work you plan to make.  research if you want, but these are pretty standard brushes, i get them about 1 inch wide, but i paint huge canvases and if i painted with small brushes it would take me forever.  buy a good variety of brushes and just mess with it.  ""fan brushes"" are generally for lightly blending, but you may find other purposes.   don't worry about painting compelling work at the start.  look up oil painting exercises and actually do them.  you can get a little creative, such as when you select objects for still life paintings and compose them.  don't waste too much time doing this.  paint self portraits, you are always available to model.  paint as many days a week, even if for a little bit, rather than having a marathon once a week.  it's a better method of practicing and memorizing than trying to cram a week of painting into a day.    wear gloves.  latex, or the other stuff if allergic.  also, do not hold brushes in your teeth or put fingers in your mouth while painting.  oil painting has more dangerous chemicals involved than acrylic painting.  my painting professors stopped me from doing this by telling me he used to do it for a long time and now has mild seizures or something.  mostly from turpentine i think, use mineral spirits or cheap industrial linseed oil (should come in a liter to a gallon, not the tiny windsor and newton jar!) to clean your brushes while painting and then use plain old soap in the sink, but not your kitchen sink.  chemicals.       here are some random oil painting tips from doc hammer, an excellent oil painter!   http://doc-hammer.deviantart.com/journal/some-oil-tips-248050850  read, read, read.  some things will contradict, there are many ways to do everything.  a good way to learn is to take in many different perspectives then triangulate a more accurate perception of the truth than from studying 1 source, so read and experience everything with a critical eye and mind and put it together the best you can with practice!   buy all your supplies online, art supply stores are way over priced!!!  plus the materials seem to be left on shelves way too long and the quality is diminished.  craigslist may have some used art supplies, sometimes for free, look there often, you never know!  it may seem expensive still, but if you've never bought supplies before you might not know, but i think i save about 50-60% off everything on average!  that adds up, just shop around online and try not to buy from too many different places because of shipping costs.   um, my brain is fried!  ask me any questions and i will answer!  i was a painting major in school and read a bunch, i know much more than i've shared!  hopefully my 3am typing off the top of my head style isn't too incoherent?  art is sometimes difficult to explain well!    good luck and welcome to oil painting, here is your license!  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-z0lk1yb37hc/twcusdtjdzi/aaaaaaaaafo/khzcaagj0lm/s1600/artistic+licence.gif",0,,
545488,"well now that i've read your point of view, i have to say that i disagree with basically everything that you said. to begin with, you're assertion that people find superman boring for what he can do is incorrect. lifting half a million tons is always interesting, no matter who or what is doing the lifting. what people fins boring about superman, and the point you seem to miss is that there is no intensity, no situations where superman can actually be hurt or killed, and has no way of being revived or healed. a trip to the sun fixes basically any injury he may have, including being mortally wounded, so where is the intrigue? the fact that he's a god and yet restrains himself doesn't make him more interesting. in fact, the instances where he loses control are the most interesting. the idea that he is the last survivor of his home world, and how tortured that made him would be interesting... if he didn't grow up in a normal kansas family that loved and cared for him. the idea that he is superman because he can be, not because he wants to is an irrelevant statement, and can be applied to basically every superhero. this brings me to your next point, about kill bill. you claim in this scene that **tarantino** has no understanding of superman, but it seems more like you have no understanding of what happened in this scene. tarantino is pretty much on the money, and basically none of what is said about superman could apply to batman. the fact is, clark kent really is the mask, and as demeaning as it is for normal people, it really is superman's perception of the average person. once again however, this has nothing to do with what makes the character interesting or not, and having his alter-ego struggle romantically with the woman superman is dating certainly factors into the non-interesting side of things. being an icon doesn't necessarily mean he's an interesting character, just one who was extremely popular, and was turned into an icon. as for your points about batman and iron man, i don't see how people's interest in different characters justifies superman's intrigue. that said, you also have an odd understanding of batman and iron man, and what people find interesting in them. for batman it isn't that he's a rich playboy, it's that he truly is an ideal humanity can become through hard work and determination, rather than alien dna. for iron man, the rich playboy aspect does factor into what some people find interesting about him, however being an anti-government rebel isn't generally iron man's thing outside of the movies. in fact in the civil war arc he lined up with the government. your last few lines have nothing to do with superman, but i'm assuming you put those in as some form of bluster since you realized you didn't actually talk about anything that made superman interesting, or was remotely accurate about other's thoughts on the character.",0,,

531758,"&gt; in particular, daybreak reveals an interesting connection to german materialism of the 19th century, a connection that often gets glossed when people discuss nietzsche. its final aphorism, at the very end of the book, is also some of the most beautiful text ever penned, anywhere.  the colour-blindness of thinkers. -- how differently from us the greeks must have viewed nature, since, as we cannot help admitting, they were quite colour-blind in regard to blue and green, believing the former to be a deeper brown, and the latter to be yellow. thus, for instance, they used the same word to describe the colour of dark hair, of the corn-flower, and the southern sea; and again they employed exactly the same expression for the colour of the greenest herbs, the human skin, honey, and yellow raisins: whence it follows that their greatest painters reproduced the world they lived in only in black, white, red, and yellow. how different and how much nearer to mankind, therefore, must nature have seemed to them, since in their eyes the tints of mankind predominated also in nature, and nature was, as it were, floating in the coloured ether of humanity! (blue and green more than anything else dehumanise nature). it is this defect which developed the playful facility that characterised the greeks of seeing the phenomena of nature as gods and demi-gods -- that is to say, as human forms.  let this, however, merely serve as a simile for another supposition. every thinker paints his world and the things that surround him in fewer colours than really exist, and he is blind to individual colours. this is something more than a mere deficiency. thanks to this nearer approach and simplification, he imagines he sees in things those harmonies of colours which possess a great charm, and may greatly enrich nature. perhaps, indeed, it was in this way that men first learnt to take delight in viewing existence, owing to its being first of all presented to them in one or two shades, and consequently harmonised. they practised these few shades, so to speak, before they could pass on to any more. and even now certain individuals endeavour to get rid of a partial colour-blindness that they may obtain a richer faculty of sight and discern ment, in the course of which they find that they not only discover new pleasures, but are also obliged to lose and give up some of their former ones.

235579,"&gt; ...[you] have preferences - things you can live without and things you like and seek out - sexuality is no different - sexuality is a spectrum...  comparing the instinct to reproduce, the thing that has driven our race to advance the chances of survival for 1000's of years, the sole point of life, as far as we can tell, of making more life to preserve our specie's existence, to a preference of color, or the dislike of a music genre? humans are not engineered to love all music, or dislike a certain color. some music is terrible, and how can a hue offend your senses unless you have synesthesia, and a aqua tastes like ferret testicles? they aren't even close. i'm suggesting that since humans have the desire for the opposite sex written in our genes, it's weird that the instinct is completely, 100% absent from someone, not just diminished, not just a preference. without a tragic event or something, why would a gay man not like the soft voice of a woman saying his name, or a gay woman not like power of a man's testosterone fueled frame? where does that instinct go, and why did it go? so why do homosexuals stop liking the *opposite gender* **all together**? i get some guys are ""more gay"" or ""less gay"" than others, but i'm only talking about the ones who are 100% not attracted to the opposite gender. i'll admit that i'm straight, but like your friend, i wanted to know if i liked it... yea, not my cup of tea. i'll stick with the boobs for now.  also  are you insinuating that unless i had named *every* color and genre of music, then i must not like one?

849350,"i just saw this, too (after stalking kerrianneta) :) my standard line is pretty similar to yours.  slight background: my boyfriend and i got together when he was in alabama and i was in ohio. after a short stint in ohio and a longer stint in germany, we are stinting it in alabama. my accent typically gives me away as not a southerner so i get asked periodically what brought me down here (i'm also a waitress and my name tag has my name and home city on it, which promotes my foreign-ness as well). and by periodically i mean at least twice a day. at this point i kind of have some standard things i say. my standard response to what brought me down is ""a guy"". (oddly, from the guys i get a lot of, ""women make that mistake a lot"" or ""ooooh, i see"" where the ladies often respond with, ""awww"".) that is some times followed with, ""he followed me to germany, so it's the least i could do to follow him to the deep south."" if we've been talking a bit they often get to the point of ""wait, if your boyfriend went to school in boston and you went to school in ohio, where did you meet?""  insert: the internet, actually.  if people ask more or i'm feeling especially insecure about people thinking we met on a dating site (i don't know why i care, but [shrug]), the conversation goes on: not on a dating site or anything like that. it's called reddit. have you heard of digg?

790896,"wow!  i went over the comment length limit!  a first.  next day, we are ready to make some pies.  let us say that we are planning to start serving pizza at, say, 7:00pm.  here is how we need to roll...  3:30: set your oven to 425, let it begin heating.  3:35: place a tbsp of black peppercorns in a small skillet over low heat.  when they become aromatic, transfer them to the mortar and crack them (don't pulverize them into a powder-- we want nice big gritty chunks).  3:40: slice the cherry tomatoes in half, and sprinkle them with a mixture of 1 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, and half the black  pepper. place the tomatoes flat-face up in an oiled oven-safe dish, and place the dish in the oven.  3:45: remove the dough from the refrigerator, sprinkle some flour on the counter, spray the flour with olive oil, place the dough-balls onto the flour and flatten them into 5""-diameter disks with your hand.  dust with flour, spray with oil, and cover once again with the plastic wrap that was over them on the cookie tray.  3:50: chop one yellow onion for the sauce. *[sidebar: the right way to chop an onion.  slice the onion  in half from the root-end to the stalk-end.  remove the  papery outer layer(s), trimming at the stalk end, as needed.  set each half onion flat-face down on a cutting board.  make parallel slices from the stalk end back towards (but not through) the root end, about 1/3"" apart.  now slice the onion perpendicularly at 1/3"" intervals until all you have is the densely connected stuff back by the stalk.  discard the stalk end.  you now have chopped an onion like a real pro.]*  3:55: lower the oven heat to 300.  4:00: peel and slice four cloves of garlic.  4:05: heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet or pot, to which you have a lid.  add the onion and stir.  when the onion becomes translucent (2-3 minutes), add a pinch of red pepper flakes and the garlic.  after 1 more minute, add the white wine, and reduce until it is mostly evaporated.  4:10: add the 28-oz can of san marzano tomatoes to the onion/garlic/wine mix, and smash them up with a wooden spoon.  stir, reduce the heat to low, and cover almost completely with the lid. this will be our sauce, and we're going to leave it slowly stewing till the very end.  every so often, you'll want to return to it and stir, but mostly we'll just be leaving it there.  4:15: thinly slice the next yellow onion into rings (or half-rings, depending on your slicing style.  4:20: heat some olive oil in a skillet, and saute the thinly-sliced onion in it until caramelized.  remove from heat and set aside.  4:25: remove the stem from the portabella, and discard.  fancy people scoop the gills out of the mushroom at this point so that they don't affect the color of the dish, but i do not.  slice the portabella cap in half across the radius, and slice the halves thinly, perpendicular to the straight edge.    4:30: thinly slice a third yellow onion, and chop the sage leaves, discarding the stems.  4:35: in a slillet, heat some more olive oil.  add the onions, and stir.  4:40: when the onions just barely start to get brown, add the mushroom slices.  when they go limp, add the sage, stir, and remove from heat.  set aside.  4:45: turn the oven off, and remove the tomatoes.  set them someplace to cool off.  they should be nicely shriveled up and concentrated.  4:50: slice the ends off of the eggplant, slice the eggplant in half, and slice the halves lengthwise into 1/4""-thick strips.  4:55: brush the slices on both sides with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.  put your grill pan on the stove to medium heat.  5:00: lay the eggplant on the grill pan.  5:05: flip the eggplant.  it should have nice grill marks on it.  5:10: take your eggplant out of the grill pan and set aside.  chop your  last yellow onion for use as a topping.  5:15: chop your basil leaves and set aside for use as a topping.  also your oregano.  5:20: chop your banana peppers (i buy them in rings, and slice them in half).  lay them on a paper towel so they can shed some of their liquid.  5:25: chop 1/2 of your red onion.  5:30: drain a few capers.  chop them a little bit.  5:35: slice your olives.  5:40: place your pizza stone in the oven.  set your oven to maximum heat. i know this looks premature, but your oven will take a few minutes to heat, and a pizza stone can take about 45 minutes to heat all the way through.  5:45: grate your cheese.  keep the mozzarella separated into four little piles (i use little saucers).  5:50: still grating.  also break up the goat cheese into little pieces.  5:55: you finish grating, but probably you need a minute to catch up. this is it.  6:00: peel and devein your shrimp.  toss them with 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp olive oil.  they should feel slightly gritty.  6:05: heat a skillet over medium heat, and lay the shrimp in it.  turn them after a minute or so-- they should have a faint caramelization on the surface.  6:10: chop the shrimp into thirds.  6:15: chop two more cloves of garlic.  6:20: open the anchovies.  6:25: place the sauce, in batches, into your food processor.  blend it all nice and smooth.  6:30: still blending.    6:35: add the cracked black pepper to the sauce, and taste sauce for salt. return to very low heat.  6:40: dust your pizza peel with cornmeal, sprinkle some flour on the counter.  dust your hands with flour.  gently pick up one of the pizza doughs, and lay it across the back of your knuckles (both hands). bounce it up and down slightly, rotating it on the back of  your hands, and it will stretch out.  be careful not to let the middle get too thin, then lay it on the pizza peel.  you can stretch it a little more here, if needed.  you want a little more than a 10"" diameter; don't worry if it's not exactly circular.  6:45: apply a very thin layer of sauce, then the shrimp, then the banana peppers, then one of your mozarella piles, then half your chopped basil, then a bit of your parmesan/romano.  slide that pizza into the oven.  6:50: check your pizza.  if it looks done, it is, so take it out. otherwise, check back in a couple of minutes.  6:55: set the pizza on a cutting board to cool.  repeat the crust-stretching process, and get another crust onto your peel.  7:00: apply sauce, the onion-portabella-sage mixture, mozarella, and romano.  dot with the cherry tomatoes.  into the oven.  7:05: cut the first pizza and distribute.  check the second pizza.  7:10: second pizza should be cooling now.  stretch the third.  7:15: apply sauce, goat cheese, red onion, capers, salmon, and  romano.  a pinch of red pepper flakes.  into the oven.  7:20: cut the second pizza and distribute.  check the third.  7:25: third pizza is cooling.  stretch the fourth.  7:30: apply sauce, green olives, chopped onion, garlic, mozarella, and romano.  top with a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of chopped basil and oregano.  into the oven!  7:35: cut and distribute the third pizza.  check the fourth.  7:40: fourth pizza out and cooling.  stretch number five.  7:45. apply sauce, chopped onion, grilled eggplant, mozarella, anchovies, and romano.  a pinch of red pepper.  into the oven.  7:50: cut and distribute pizza number four.  check on five.  7:55: fifth pizza out now.  stretch your final dough.  8:00: apply sauce, brie, kalamata olives, and caramelized onion. top with romano and a pinch of red pepper flakes and a pinch of oregano.  stick it into the oven.  8:05: cut and distribute the fifth pizza.  check on the last one.  8:10: last pizza out and cooling.  you can remove your apron and turn the oven off, and also the stove.  any remaining sauce can be saved for pasta or whatnot-- it keeps nicely.  8:15: cut and distribute the final pizza.    special tips  *do not over-sauce the pizza.  just paint the crust-- otherwise it will get soggy. * excellent wines for pizza: a mano ""primitivo"" ($10), vipra rossa ($11) * wear an apron.  you will not regret it. * drink at least two glasses of water as you do this.  it's hard work, and it's hot.  * if you find yourself with a spare moment in this process, wash something.  otherwise, you end up with a lot of little dishes and bowls to wash.  bibliography  crust recipe is based on: ""pizza napoletana,"" in reinhart, peter, the bread baker's apprentice: mastering the art of extraordinary

575630,"olivia shakespear (born olivia tucker; 17 march 1863 – 3 october 1938) was a british novelist, playwright, and patron of the arts. she wrote six books that are described as ""marriage problem"" novels. her works sold poorly, sometimes only a few hundred copies. her last novel, uncle hilary, is considered her best. she wrote two plays in collaboration with florence farr. olivia was the daughter of a retired adjutant general, and had little formal education. she was well-read however, and developed a love of literature. in 1885 she married london barrister henry hope shakespear, and in 1886 gave birth to their only child, dorothy. in 1894 her literary interests led to a friendship with william butler yeats that became physically intimate in 1896. following their consummation he declared that they ""had many days of happiness"" to come,[1] but the affair ended in 1897. they nevertheless remained lifelong friends and corresponded frequently. yeats went on to marry georgie hyde-lees, olivia's step-niece and dorothy's best friend. olivia began hosting a weekly salon frequented by ezra pound and other modernist writers and artists in 1909, and became influential in london literary society. dorothy shakespear married pound in 1914, despite the less-than-enthusiastic blessing of her parents. after their marriage, pound would use funds received from olivia to support t. s. eliot and james joyce. when dorothy gave birth to a son, omar pound, in france in 1926, olivia assumed guardianship of the boy. he lived with olivia until her death on 3 october 1938. contents  [hide]  1 early life and marriage 2 w. b. yeats 2.1 friendship 2.2 love affair 3 pembroke mansions 4 dorothy and ezra pound 5 later life and death 6 novels: description and reception 7 list of works 8 notes 9 references 10 sources [edit]early life and marriage  olivia's father, henry tod tucker (b. 1808), was born in edinburgh and joined the british indian army as an ensign at age 16. he rose to the rank of adjutant general in bengal, but retired in 1856 at age 48 owing to ill health. within a year of returning to britain he married harriet johnson (b. 1821) of bath. the couple moved to the isle of wight where their two daughters were born: florence in 1858 and olivia on 17 march 1863. soon after they relocated to sussex where their third child, henry, was born in 1866. in 1877 the family moved to london and raised their daughters in a social world that encouraged the pursuit of leisure. olivia often visited her many johnson relatives in the country, and became particularly fond of her cousin lionel johnson—the only one of many uncles and cousins not to join the military—who went on to become a poet and friend to w. b. yeats.[2] it is likely that olivia received little formal education; she may have been educated by tutors, and appears to have become well-read as a young woman.[3] in 1885 olivia married henry hope shakespear, a man described by terence brown in the life of w.b. yeats: a critical biography as ""worthy"" but ""dull"".[4] born in india in 1849, he was descended from 17th-century east london ropemakers and, like olivia, came from a military family, although of less prestige and wealth than the tuckers and johnsons. john harwood, olivia's biographer and author of olivia shakespear and w. b. yeats: after long silence believes henry probably saw an opportunity to increase his social standing and annual income in wedding olivia. he had attended harrow, studied law, and joined a law practice in 1875. the couple were married on 8 december 1885, and honeymooned in boulogne and paris. olivia's father endowed them with a comfortable income in the form of a trust. nine months after the wedding their only child, dorothy, was born on 14 september 1886; they likely discontinued physical relations after the honeymoon, and olivia realised quite soon that the marriage was devoid of passion.[5] yeats' biographer alexander jeffares writes, ""she was unselfcentered, unselfish, deeply imaginative and sympathetic and, until she met yeats, she seems to have accepted the fact of her unhappy loveless marriage"".[6] shakespear dissolved his legal partnership in the late 1880s—his partner may have been embezzling from clients' trusts—and formed his own practice. harwood writes that shakespear's attitude to the situation showed a certain amount of ""timidity"" on his part and a definite ""dislike of scenes"". during this period olivia moved from socialising with military wives to literary women: valentine fox (unhappily married to a kent brewer) and pearl craighie, a divorced american writer who published as john oliver hobbes.[7] [edit]w. b. yeats  [edit]friendship   an 1896 portrait of w.b. yeats by his father john butler yeats is the frontispiece of celtic twilight. accompanied by pearl craighie, on 16 april 1894 olivia attended a literary dinner to launch the yellow book. olivia was seated opposite w. b. yeats.[6] recently returned from visiting maud gonne in paris, yeats was in london for the production of his play the land of heart's desire.[8] the two were not introduced that evening but yeats, probably through lionel johnson (who became disruptively drunk at the dinner), enquired about the woman seated opposite.[9][10] yeats was deeply affected, later writing in his memoirs of the encounter: ""i noticed op",0,,

693581,"we had proved our might, be we'd also swept away one of the few states that could ever be taken seriously as an enemy. we were alone again. we dicked around in europe and somalia, but the nation wasn't impressed by delta operators blowing up skinnies and quickly lost interest. the balkan conflict made for some good media, what with neighbor raping and slaughtering neighbor, but it still wasn't some monolithic enemy that we could cast our righteous and noble might against.   in a lot of ways 9/11 was a godsend. we were shocked, shocked! that anyone could be so wicked, vicious and depraved as to attack the most visible symbol of our financial hegemony, the most visible symbol of our military power, and our seat of government. it was unthinkable! didn't they know that we brought them peace? didn't they know that we brought them democracy? hadn't anyone informed them that we are the good guys? did they forget to read the script?  and so america got it's any back. al-qaeda, a shadowy cabal of high tech islamofacist terrorist. from their massive underground fortresses deep in the mountains of afghanistan they were plotting a global jihad, poised to unleash weaponized anthrax and lost russian briefcase nukes and sinister light-brites on the unsuspecting and totally innocent america people.   so we got our enemy back. we invaded the shit out of afghanistan to catch osama bin laden, the muddling, mildly incompetent but quite wealthy saudi arabian construction heir who, after years of fumbling, managed to carry out a successful attack on the us. we routed the evil islamofascist taliban who were our proxy army in a twenty year battle with the russians and managed to take power afterward. after a while, based on a couple of lies from a known compromised intelligence source and with hans blix pleading with us to stop we invaded iraq. and just for fun we through iran and n. korea into the mix to give us a bonafide new ""axis of evil"". see how they're both nazis and commies? clever!  but it could only keep us distracted for so long. al-qaeda had landed one lucky sucker punch before we wiped them from the face of the earth. when no follow up attack came, when we realized that there had never been any wmds and iraq was well into it's civil war, we started to look around.  forty years of government mismanagement, deliberate deficit spending to ""starve the beast"", move wealth up to the top, and make life as ruthlessly, pitilessly competitive as possible had taken a toll. our wildly artificial economy, built one mountains of ghostly financial manipulations, collapsed.   which left us here. ashamed by our failures in iraq and afghanistan. destitute as a result of our wildly profligate gambling. deeply mistrustful of our self serving leaders. and without an enemy.  we need to have an enemy. we're fighters. we're a nation of fighters. we declare wars on everything from social phenomena to guerrilla warfare tactics. 60% of our national budget is in some way associated with war spending or taking care of veterans. we need an enemy. it's in our blood. it's in our psyche. we define ourselves by our opposition. to quote a better man than i ""war is a force that gives us meaning"".   we are out of enemies. china and india don't care about us one way or the other. they're in a race to see who can become the new dominant superpower first. europe is finally setting aside petty antagonism and is emerging as our equal, or better, the powerfully republican state that we never managed to be. russia is beggining to stir after it's devastating fall to economic forces in the 90's. and america, for all it's buying power, military prowess, and boisterous self aggrandizement, just isn't as important anymore.   but we still need an enemy. we're starved for an enemy. and like any starving organism we've begun to cannibalize ourself. the head, the multi millionaires and international mega corporations that dictate the flow of national discourse and politics were able to set the tone with frightening ease. they drew up battle lines and set us against ourselves, warring for their amusement while they glut themselves on nectar and ambrosia. this is the masque of the red death, and we're the entertainment.   the right has been sold an insane hodge podge of conspiracy theories and outright lies, any sensational story to direct their anger left. the left was gutted in the wake of 9/11 induced patriotism. the traditional forces of the left, unions and students, are strung out and living from paycheck to paycheck, without the solid base of a unionized shop or a supportive university to make any noise. most of the old hippies have long since sold out, and the yuppies are too busy drinking mochalattechinos and donating to obscure cause charities in the name of their snickerdoodle. when they finally realized that the right was coming for them it was far too late to organize, and they've been desperately trying to hold ground, outnumbered and terribly outmanuevered.  the problem, of course, is that the right didn't get us here. and the left didn't get us here. we're not even that badly off. profits are up, up, up, at record levels. if you happen to be a member of the nobility now is a very good time to be alive. the top 1% are richer than any king or emperor who has ever lived. and they've used that wealth to make more wealth. they didn't have near as much in 1970, but at some point they learned how to buy government. how to get the laws set up just right to benefit themselves and lock everyone out of the business. to set up monopolies that don't look like monopolies and to dig the ground out from under their employees without anyone noticing.   and most importantly they managed to trick a second third generation immigrant with japanese ancestry into thinking that poor blacks and mexicans are stealing his pathetically tiny slice of the pie because they don't have the right psychology to work hard and make something of themselves.   and that's why they're winning. and we're losing. and by fighting against our own class, the poor, the disenfranchised, the dispossessed, you're just helping things along.   the door to prosperity has been closed. they're not going to let you in any more than they will me. if you want in you're going to have to turn that axe away from me and start chopping down the door, friend.",0,,

[image 3.](http://i.imgur.com/elyhawx.png) here's what my equivalent of vassa, the slippist-1 f planet ""foxtrot"" looks like: [image 4.](http://i.imgur.com/uof7swh.png)  obviously it would look a bit paler for more reasonably massive m-dwarfs, but in my experimentation stars are noticeably off-white even at temperatures as high as 5000 kelvin. in ways, however, which your eyes would be able to white-balance into if you looked at it for more than a couple seconds. enough, though, to change the aesthetics of planets and the ratio between red green and blue. and that's what it really boils down to. that's the reason i don't like building planet packs around stars between m5v and g8v, the colors look awkward.   for stars around the color of temperature of 3500 k, i've noticed that that's when your eyes are really able to white balance the environment. the temperature-color relationship of stars is a visible thing, but only when taking white balancing into account. the colors of stars of a given spectral type are rather misleading. here's a handy guide:  * m: orange to pale orange. (these stars are not neccesarily blindingly bright to look at) * k: pale orange to very pale yellow-white. (bright enough to be a blazing and blinding white lens flare if you looked at it with normal human eye exposure, but a white piece of paper would reflect colored light. this is true of all hotter stars.) * g: pale yellow-white to an even paler, even whiter yellow-white. * f: white to pale-white-blue. * a: pale white-blue. * b: less pale blue. * o: sky blue.  assume you're in the circumstellar habitable zone for each comparison, not the same distance away. otherwise the m-dwarf is a reddish point and you're inside the o-giant.  you may not notice the difference unless coming from a room lit by 5800-6000 kelvin lights or the solar system in many cases. but say for instance you're on a planet orbiting two suns of different spectral type? a red giant and a blue m.s. star, for instance... orange and pale-blue light.  if you want truly red light, there is an option. brown dwarfs of the spectral type l and t will glow visibly to the naked eye, a dim and dull red color at 800 degrees for t8v and a saturated orange color at 2200 degrees for l3v.",0,,
805505,"&gt;let me tell you a little about my town.   &gt;throughout the world there are many places like it, i’m sure, but i still like to think it was special. it was tucked away on the banks of an old, slow river, which was birthed from a great lake, far, far away to the south. cradled between the soft folds of hills, you’d never have known it was there if the brightly painted signs on the side of the road didn’t direct you to it.   &gt;the streets were clean, though a little narrow, and in the winter little plumes of smoke scrolled from the terracotta chimneys of the houses. the homes curled their old brick and dark wood around the winding streets, and blanketed the sides of the valley in a curious chequerboard of colours.   &gt;the councils of old had decreed that trees should be planted wherever possible. in autumn, the cobbled paths and stone gutters were always awash with gold, orange and brown – and in the spring, the ancient cherry trees rained blossoms like pink snow.   &gt;but with the winter came the fogs; and brought with them strange things.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;some years the fogs were thin, draping the lichen-spotted rooves with curlicued tendrils, and leaving everything damp. in the bad years, they would linger all day, squatting heavy over the river and the valley like some malevolent white beast, trying to push its ghostly fingers under our doorways and into our homes. the light became strange and diffuse. shadows ceased to exist – objects appearing eerily two-dimensional, as though wrought by some old computer system that couldn’t handle the load of rendering shade and depth.   &gt;our parents always warned us to travel in pairs, so we wouldn’t get lost – and to follow the lines of the cobbled paths and massive trees. of course, we thought they worried too much, so when the fog was thick as clotted cream, we would run off from our friends and hide in it, playing the world’s easiest game of hide-and-seek.   &gt;i did get lost once or twice and had to be rescued by my father, carrying one of the peculiar fog lanterns that cut a yellow-green beam through the whiteness. if you stepped off the cobbled paths and wandered into one of the many hilly parks, all sense of direction quickly abandoned you, and you’d find yourself walking though rumpled fields, ankle-deep in the grasses that grew so fast and wild in all the sudden moisture. the houses were no longer familiar shapes, but seemed huge, looming shadows, eldritch light gloaming from distorted windows and the muffled sounds of weird music drifting from inside.   &gt;the last time i lost my way as a child, i couldn’t even find the houses; all i could see was a choking wall of swirling white on all sides, and the wet grass directly beneath my sodden sneakers. as i walked, trees would appear suddenly, flat and unreal – but they weren’t the familiar, gnarled cherry trees lining the safe pathways. these were too smooth, their boles papery and silver, but too thick to be birches.   &gt;by the time i was found, my teeth were chattering with cold, and i was wet through to the skin, my dark pigtails plastered to my neck. my father, weeping with relief, carried me back home in his arms, while i fell asleep against his chest, exhausted.   &gt;how i wish that ordeal had been enough to teach me a lesson. &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;the bad winters always followed a good one, but sometimes that cycle would be disrupted, and we’d have a few fog-bound years in a row. as the world’s climate issues increased, the seasons waxed stranger, and the badness became permanent; no winter was a good one, and the fogs seemed even more dense, spilling out of the valley and swallowing up the roads beyond.   &gt;my father owned a small electronics boutique. when i was a child it was full of vcrs and bleeping lcd watches, but eventually i took charge of it, and we sold fancy smartphones and expensive earbuds to the younger folk in our sheltered town. when the fogs were at their worst, it would feel as though the shop was an isolated world all alone; a cube of thin walls hanging in a great void of white. i’d press my nose against the cold glass of the windows and stare outside, imagining i could see shapes in the nothingness, like a child conjuring images in the static on a de-tuned tv.   &gt;then the marshy, willow-the-wisps of car headlights would pass through and scatter my imaginings; the thunder of their engines dulled to a subsonic pressure wave by the cloying white blanket.   &gt;but when there was no traffic, i would watch for hours, a cup of green tea growing cold in my hands as i sat in the window, entranced by the wonders i could paint on the pale canvas beyond the glass. i could make white deer bound through an eerie landscape of silver trees and frozen hills, their great antlers insubstantial as smoke. the sharp spires of white towers lay out of reach on distant hills; citadels seemingly carved of bone, which my mind populated with transparent people, endlessly dancing in eggshell ballrooms.   &gt;on the days when i missed my dead mother the most, i would conjure what i remembered of her face. i’d imagine she was standing outside the window, her silky black hair and dark brown eyes turned white as milk.   &gt;and then, one day, she was. &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;there had been no cars, no customers, so i’d sat dreaming in the window for hours, lost in my white world. i watched the delicate people of the bone castles make their way down the pumice roads and through the frost bound-hills, until very suddenly, they stood outside the shop.   &gt;from the middle of their milling group, a woman approached, her hair and eyes colourless, but the angles of her face achingly familiar. she seemed to speak, her small, prim mouth opening and closing rhythmically, but no sound reached me through the walls of fog and glass. when her unheard speech was finished, she extended a single pale finger and beckoned me.   &gt;this was too much. much as i enjoyed my little fantasies when the shop was quiet, this one was too real, and it was making me uncomfortable. i blinked rapidly, dismissing the images and turning back to the reassuringly solid display cabinets full of glowing miniature screens.   &gt;there was a soft sound against the glass of the window, like a finch bumbling into it mid-flight. i saw pale legs disappear into the fog as the headlights of a truck tinted the misty street a sickly shade of green.   &gt;the vision troubled me all evening, and i found myself glancing often at the small shrine to my mother, which my father kept in the dining room. white lilies flanked her sombre portrait, matched by the pale ivory figurines which had topped their wedding cake. when i made my excuses and put myself to bed, the dense fog seemed to press against the windows. i felt trapped and oddly threatened, as though the house were being engulfed by a gigantic puffball mushroom, trying to consume us.   &gt;when i finally slept, all of my dreams were white.   &gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;   &gt;i knew the pale figures would come again. on some primitive level, i think i knew what was going on – as though the ancient genes of my honoured ancestors had whispered their knowledge into my very cells, dormant until i needed it. i watched from the shop window, rugged up in a chequered scarf and a smartly cut cashmere coat, waiting for the vision to return.   &gt;but when it did, there was no elaborate dreamscape, no procession of porcelain people winding their way down from their colourless palace. instead, the face and fingers of my mother thumped gently against the glass, then vanished again into the fog, as though pulled against her will.   &gt;i reacted on instinct – there was nothing else i could do – and so, not even bothering to lock the shop behind me, i grabbed a fog lamp and i ran out after her.   &gt;i fancied i caught a glimpse of a whiter white in the pall of soupy mist, and so i ran faster, the beam of the lamp wide and low, dappling the cobbled paths faintly green-gold. she was ahead of me, i knew it – her white legs would flash and stir the fog, leaving an eddy behind her, like the wake of a ghostly ship.   &gt;“wait!” i cried after her, “please, don’t run!”   &gt;but the phantom either couldn’t hear me or did not want to stop, because she loped onward, faster than ever, her wispy body almost completely swallowed by the milky surroundings.   &gt;i didn’t even notice when my feet left the path and started swishing through the wet grass. *something* had taken hold of me, and i would not, *could not* stop until i caught up with that flickering being.   &gt;but when the silvery trees loomed, their odd limbs dark outlines in the whiteness, my adrenaline instantly cooled, leaving only icy fear.   &gt;i did my best to stay calm at first, retracing my steps in the dewy park. but after an hour of fruitless wandering, the battery of my torch began to wane, and tears began to leave hot tracks down my frozen cheeks. shouting for help was pointless; even my most strident pleas were instantly swallowed by the fog, deadened by the oppressive thickness of the air.   &gt;it was ironic that i had left my phone back in the shop. when you’re surrounded by technology, you take it for granted that it will always be there – and so in my haste, i’d doomed myself by not even noticing i had left it behind.     &gt;i could no longer tell whether the dampness on my face was dew or cooling tears, and i stumbled blindly forward, hoping the downhill slope would take me to the river.   &gt;and so it did – far more suddenly than i expected. one foot plunged into the shocking chill of the rushing water, the other losing its grip on the slippery embankment, and i began to fall. it seemed to happen with bizarre slowness, as though the air had *actually* thickened to a milky syrup.     &gt;when a freezing hand grasped mine, and pulled me back onto the grass, i lay there and sobbed with relief.   &gt;the spirit of my mother had saved my life.   &gt;

404631,"&gt;3. go organic: choose organic foods whenever possible, but remember it's always better to eat broccoli that's been exposed to pesticide than to not eat broccoli at all (the same applies to any other anticancer vegetable).  bullshit.  all ""organic"" means is that it cost more to produce less of the product. ""organic"" foods are made by the same people as the ""non-organic"" foods. the word is meaningless.  &gt;spice it up: add turmeric (with black pepper) when cooking (delicious in salad dressings!). this yellow spice is the most powerful natural anti-inflammatory agent. remember to add mediterranean herbs to your food: thyme, oregano, basil, rosemary, marjoram, mint, etc. they don't just add flavor, they can also help reduce the growth of cancer cells.  if any of that were true, your doctor would prescribe it to you rather than ibuprofen.  as for the cancer thing: bullshit.  again, doctors would gladly prescribe you some extracts from those spices to fight cancer.  the claims in this paragraph are flat out lies.  &gt;skip the potato: potatoes raise blood sugar, which can feed inflammation and cancer growth. they also contain high levels of pesticide residue (to the point that most potato farmers i know don't eat their own grown potatoes).  o rly? care to know these potato growers you know?  go fish: eat fish two or three times a week - sardines, mackerel, and anchovies have less mercury and pcbs than bigger fish like tuna. avoid swordfish and shark, which the fda says pregnant women should not eat because they contain a high concentration of contaminants.  mercury scaremongering, huh?  nice move there. you know that your gullible followers probably also buy into the anti-vaccine hysteria, so you drum up their favorite go-to chemical mercury.  nevermind that the levels of mercury in any fish you buy in a store is well below dangerous levels.  you've got people to scare, you don't need inconvenient facts like that.  &gt;remember not all eggs are created equal: choose only omega-3 eggs, or don't eat the yolks. hens are now fed on mostly corn and soybeans, and their eggs contain 20 times more pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids than cell-growth regulating omega-3s.  where on a carton of egg is it marked what number omega it is, eh?  and what makes you think that egg producers even sort eggs that way?  i call bullshit on everything here.  &gt;change your oil: use only olive and canola oil in cooking and salad dressings. go through your kitchen cabinets and throw out your soybean, corn and sunflower oils. (and no, you can't give them to your neighbors or your relatives... they're much too rich in omega-6 fatty acids!)  more weird omega 6 bullshit.  you know, if omega 3 versus omega 6 really mattered that much, you could be prescribed omega 3 in large dosages.  &gt;say ""brown is beautiful"": eat your grains whole and mixed (wheat with oats, barley, spelt, flax, etc.) and favor organic whole grains when possible since pesticides tend to accumulate on whole grains. avoid refined, white flour (used in bagels, muffins, sandwich bread, buns, etc.) whenever possible, and eat white pasta only al dente.  unless you're going to tell us some numbers about pesticide levels, you're just using scare-tactics.  also, you should note that these levels usually only matter if you're just gorging yourself day in an day out on a single product.  being poisoned by food because you need to be poisoned every day means that it takes prolonged and repeated exposure.  unless you think people are scarfing down the exact same product all the time, you're full of it.  &gt;keep sweets down to fruits: cut down on sugar by avoiding sweetened sodas and fruit juices, and skipping dessert or replacing it with fruit (especially stone fruits and berries) after most meals. read the labels carefully, and steer clear of products that list any type of sugar (including brown sugar, corn syrup, etc.) in the first three ingredients. if you have an incorrigible sweet tooth, try a few squares of dark chocolate containing more than 70% cocoa.  yeah, because cancer loves sugar... according to no scientific literature whatsoever...  &gt;go green: instead of coffee or black tea, drink three cups of green tea per day. use decaffeinated green tea if it gets you too wired. regular consumption of green tea has been linked to a significant reduction in the risk for developing cancer.  rather than just say switch, you actually named how much we should take each day.  _you just wrote us a fucking prescription for green tea_.  do you know how ridiculous you are?  how about drink neither, jackass?  &gt; banish bad chemicals: avoid exposure to common household contaminants. you should air our your dry-cleaning for two hours before storing or wearing it; use organic cleaning products (or wear gloves); don't heat liquids or food in hard plastics; avoid cosmetics with parabens and phthalates; don't use chemical pesticides in your house or garden; replace your scratched teflon pans; filter your tap water (or used bottled water) if you live in a contaminated area; don't keep your cell phone close to you when it is turned on.  oh, this one needs to be broken down.  &gt; avoid exposure to common household contaminants.  so first, you tell us to avoid the nebulous word ""contaminants"" -- just like any altie's ""toxin,"" the jargon applies to no named concrete examples.  it's a ghost, an innuendo.  &gt;you should air our your dry-cleaning for two hours before storing or wearing it;  let's disregard that this paragraph obviously suffered editing of whole sentences at a whole time for a moment.  interesting that you say we should air out dry-cleaning.  why do you say that?  don't you think that if there were anything harmful coming off of it, there would be laws against a dry cleaner giving it to you before it's aired out?  this shows a complete lack of understanding about how dry-cleaning works.  &gt;use organic cleaning products (or wear gloves);  holy shit, organic cleaning products?  are you fucking kidding me?  hey moms and dads, how about this organic bleach?  yes, it's chemically the same as any other bleach, but i put the label ""organic"" on it, so it must be better!  the fallacy you're employing here is the natural is good fallacy.  you want us to use orange-glo, and vinegar, and other stuff that doesn't sound all scary and scientificals.  in the end, all it will do is burn a bigger hole in our wallets.  &gt;don't heat liquids or food in hard plastics;  you heard'em! all those 'microwafe safe' labels are lies, lies lies! it's a conspiracah!  &gt;avoid cosmetics with parabens and phthalates;  there are lots of things you should avoid with phthalates, but usually because the danger is an exposure to soft membranes, such as the mouth, vagina, or anus -- it's a sex toy danger.  phthalates won't hurt your face.  &gt;don't use chemical pesticides in your house or garden;  unless you want your plants to actually survive. because apparently, nothing washes off, and nothing can be used safely by following instructions.  &gt;replace your scratched teflon pans;  unless you're scraping your fork across your teflon pan and eating out of it, you're not going to ingest any teflon.  get a grip.  the only thing wrong with a scratched teflon pan is that it's not non-stick anymore.  &gt;filter your tap water (or used bottled water) if you live in a contaminated area;  no shit.  &gt;don't keep your cell phone close to you when it is turned on.  the biggest sign of quackery by far.  cell phone radiation?  you do realize how often this is proved to be a false hysteria, right?  the point of a cell phone is that it's near you when you need it.  also, if you have to keep it away while it's on, how are you going to talk on it?

(in comparison, the structure of opal is microscopic spheres of silicon bound together closely with traces of water.) most agates contain water (unlike quartz, which is anhydrous), chemically bound with the silicon dioxide, but this amount is a small percentage and far less than in, say, common opal, which is a form of low temperature quartz, and has no recognized crystal structure (i.e. it is amorphous).  &gt; pure chalcedony is clear, honey colored or grey. it is semi-opaque to, rarely, translucent unless cut into thin slices. however, most agates are red and blue, although in reality the 'red' will vary from pale pink through orange to fire engine red, whilst the 'blue' will vary from gray-blue to cornflower blue through to almost black. other, rarer colors include yellow and green, or white bands standing out from the background hues. dark browns, even blacks and combinations of all of the above can produce a whole range of strong to pastel shades, each agate being either subtly or completely different from it's neighbor.  -----  &gt; among the cryptocrystalline varieties of quartz are the chalcedonies and agates. some authorities see agate as a variety of chalcedony, others as a near synonym. the name chalcedony goes back at least as far as theophrastus and pliny (ad 77). agate is a term derived from the river achates (now drillo) in southwest sicily, but the ancient word *achates* is not wholly synonymous with modern-day agate. pliny distinguished many types of agate according to their color, banding, fanciful resemblance to various objects (e.g. ""eyed agate"") etc.   **in 1747, wallerius (a swedish mineralogist), remarked that, ""to enumerate all the varieties of agate is impossible and unnecessary.""**  &gt; but it still continues, and seeing scenes in the patterns was as common then as it is today. some authors of the period divided agate (known as *achates figurate* - agate with figures) into *achates anthropomorphos* (when they showed human forms), *achates zoomorphos* (when they showed animals), and *achates phytomorphous* (when they showed plants). agate is today a truly all-encompassing name!  -----  &gt; there are, though, other types (names) of chalcedony which are accepted by common usage. iris or rainbow agate is the type which shows spectral colors due to the huge number of fine bands (maybe as many as 17,000 to the inch!). sard (*sardion* of theophrastus) has the distinction of having the oldest name known to definitely apply to a type of cryptocrystalline quartz, and is derived from sardis, the capital of the ancient kingdom of lydia (now in turkey). later, in the middle ages, the term was split into *carneolous* (now *carnelian*, from the latin for ""fleshy""), and *cornelian*, derived from the latin *cornus* for the cornelian or dogwood cherry tree, which has a reddish berry. moss agate is agate which contains inclusions (usually green) that resemble moss. other usable names are chrysoprase, plasma, prase, heliotrope, bloodstone, flint, chert, novaculite and jasper. it should be noted that these are close to each other in appearance, and are not very distinguishable. it is sometimes arguable into which category a specimen actually belongs.  -----  **flint** &gt; this is an impure form of chalcedony, formed from a gel and found within sedimentary rocks, in particular, chalk. southern england is famous for it's chalk deposits and the nodules of flint found within. the nodules are supposed to be replacements for types of sponges and are purple-black to brownish in color with white sections. it has a fetid odor when struck due to the amount of the mineral pyrite and creates sparks. all flint is opaque, even on thin edges and, like all chalcedony, has a clam-shell like or conchoidal fracture.  **chert** &gt; this is another impure form of chalcedony, mixed with clay, and the resulting stone is white to yellowish. it has been used as a building material and breaks with a conchoidal fracture.  **jasper** &gt; jasper by itself is an opaque form of chalcedony with admixtures of clays, and is colored by hematite to give red and goethite to give yellow or brown. it can also be green on occasions, possibly due to chrome oxide. these oxides commonly color all the chalcedonies, but jasper differs from agate in that it forms massive pieces in veins as well as nodules, sometimes in pieces weighing tons, and is not banded as such but the colors within can form 'swirls' of contrasting pattern and hue.  *  *from the book ""agates: treasures of the earth"" by roger pabian with brian jackson, peter tandy and john cromartie, copyright 2006, natural history museum, london - only very slightly altered to make it more readable.* ----- *and yes, i typed this all out by hand from a fucking book at 2 am on a wednesday at an [8]*",0,,
895818,"woc?  &gt;for pale people, finding a matching foundation can be an issue, but they exist and there are whiteners to blend with the whitest of ivory.  so couldn't they do something like that for dark skin? like a darkener that can be blended with another foundation to achieve a darker color?   &gt;it's not an issue of simple lack of availability, but people on creative boards aren't even asking the question. lancome was so ill-prepared to create a foundation line for woc they had to hire outside consultants. that means there aren't very many woc working for lancome or else they would have pointed this out.  probably because most of lancome's customers are asian or caucasian so they just cater to their demographic since that's who brings them profit. i mean i wouldn't expect to go to morocco or india and easily find foundation that matches my skin tone because i realize my skin tone wouldn't be the target market there. then in countries like japan i would expect to find mostly light to medium foundation tones. i don't think it's some evil conspiracy against darker skinned individuals in usa just companies catering to their market, most of which tends to have lighter to medium skin tone, but generally not ghostly white.   you really don't get a lot of options for foundation if you are very pale either, unless, as you said, you mix it yourself. i usually buy my foundation in ""porcelain"" shade, sometimes it matches other times it's the wrong shade because pale skin can also have different undertones - mine has a yellow undertone so pinkish shades don't match me even if they are very light. i never post on mua to complain about it but i didn't know it was apparently such a taboo.   i think we should all just stop being catty to each other and sympathize with/help people who have trouble matching their skin tone regardless if they are ghostly white or the darkest of browns, otherwise we just ostracize people for something that is out of their control.",1,0,0

101480,"#####&amp;#009;  ######&amp;#009;  ####&amp;#009;  [**brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;__brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. the term does not derive from the word ""brutal"", but originates from the french *béton brut*, or ""raw concrete"", a term used by [le corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le_corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [british architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/architecture_of_the_united_kingdom) critic [reyner banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reyner_banham) adapted the term into ""brutalism"" (originally ""new brutalism"") to identify the emerging style.  &gt;brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in britain, france, germany, japan, the united states, canada, brazil, the philippines, and australia. examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concrete) construction, or in the case of the ""brick brutalists"" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. there is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.  &gt;in its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. in one critical appraisal by banham, brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. ""brutalism"" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. more recently, ""brutalism"" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for ""brutal"" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.  &gt;====  &gt;[**image**](https://i.imgur.com/bk21nrm.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:dhhs2_by_matthew_bisanz.jpg) - *hubert h. humphrey building, headquarters of the u.s. department of health and human services, washington, d. c.*  ---  ^interesting: [^the ^michener ^institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_michener_institute) ^| [^regenstein ^library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regenstein_library) ^| [^bradfield ^hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bradfield_hall) ^| [^murray ^d. ^lincoln ^campus ^center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/murray_d._lincoln_campus_center)   ^parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^nsfw](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=autowikibot nsfw toggle&amp;message=%2btoggle-nsfw+cnas92m) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=autowikibot deletion&amp;message=%2bdelete+cnas92m)^. ^will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(faqs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^magic ^words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)",0,,

340511,"if you're using watercolors, the following are good basics to start with: cadmium red, cadmium yellow light, cadmium orange, hooker's green, viridian, vermillion, alizarin crimson, rose madder, naples yellow, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, prussian blue, ivory black (rarely used), burnt sienna, burnt umber, yellow ochre, and raw umber.  you may or may not choose to use white.  traditional watercolor allows the white of the paper to show through where white is desired.  you want to use good qualtiy paints, and they aren't cheap.  windsor newton is a good brand.  you also want good quality paper, for example, arches watercolour paper.  also try to invest in the best brushes you can afford.  red sable are excellent, and you want a flat brush, and some rounds and a detail brush.  it's also good to have a really wide brush to lay down large washes of color on the paper.  (i didn't mean to go into such a thorough list, but there you have it.)  what i really wanted to tell you is that you should make a color chart.  you should do this: down the left hand of the paper make a column of half inch dots of each of the colors as they come straight out of the tube mixed with a little water.  across the top, arrange a horizontal row just as you did the vertical.  then you mix each and every color with each and every color and fill your chart.  i'm sorry if this isn't clear, but hopefully it can be fathomed.  all of this, because it is an invaluable way to learn about color, and to make a color chart that can be used as a reference for years.  it is absolutely essential in my opinion to do this.  i would also learn the benefits of limiting your palette.  you don't necessarily have to use every color in your paint box in a painting.  it is very often effective to mix your own green, for example, with the one of the blues and yellows that you have on your palette. the colors are more harmoniously linked in the painting this way, rather than introducing a totally unrelated green straight out of its own tube.  you might love that particular green out of the tube, but it may not relate to the yellows and blues in your painting quite as well as a mixed green using those same colors.  this is just an example, but the fewer colors you use, the more harmonious the painting will be, generally speaking.  but, painters break all the rules very effectively on occassion, so don't worry too much about it.  i cannot recommend any book, but check out websites for all kinds of information about painting.",0,,

302415,"in her passion, she had risen to her feet and thrown her fists into the air, clenching them so tightly her knuckles whitened.  “i want a man of *strength!* i want a man who will make himself my master!” she ended screaming, her face flushing crimson, finally unveiled for the dark nymph she was. doctor blackmore put down his pen and covered his mouth with his hands. his trousers were now strained, and his heart overwhelmed by the sudden arrival of this bonnie wraith. she straightened herself, quietly composing. “that is why i was sent here.” valentine sank back into her chair. the doctor took a deep breath and willed himself to gain control over his unruly pulse. the strain lessened and he stood, walked briskly to the door and opened it. valentine followed his movement curiously.  “miss birdie, cancel all my appointments for the next hour, and please do not disturb me with anything short of death, fire or doomsday.” his secretary nodded vigorously. as he turned back into his office, he locked the door.  august took off his spectacles and folded them neatly away into his coat pocket. he advanced on the girl, his eyes burning like the gates of hell. she read his expression and sneered.  “are you so disgusted by me?” the look he turned upon her then was withering, and for once she found herself chastened. that set something within her bubbling. he stalked past her, still silent, and drew the window’s drapes.  when he turned back around again and faced her, his transformation from jekyll to hyde completed. this time his gait to her chair was measured and purposeful.  “i am not disgusted, valentine.” his voice had also transformed, no longer professional and polite. she noticed then the tawny brown of his eyes, and the darker shade in his hair. in fact, his mannerly speech and exact dress had clouded her vision to the rather virile and handsome man underneath. he reached her then, and leaned over her, imposing his height and fit musculature upon her. for the first time in her life, valentine felt intimidated by a man, and her heart fluttered. gone were her sneer and her catlike smirk. silent was her wit. august firmly gripped her wrists and hauled her to her feet. she squeaked, and felt herself get instantly, heavily wet. he captured her and brought her close, and stroked her cherubic cheek.  “i understand you, little bird. like you, i had given up quite some time ago.” valentine was frozen, her knees quaking. the doctor’s hand found firm purchase in her snarled locks, and he gently pulled her to his hungry mouth.  the kiss was hard and needy, at first closed and then no longer so prim. he slid his tongue between her ruby lips and found hers, soft and untrained, but bold. she moaned heavily and relented, the deep satiety of submission washing through her, taken from her dreams and brought to reality. as she yielded to the embrace his other hand roved her back and took firm hold of her perfect, thinly-covered posterior. her hips bucked straight into him, and valentine actually broke the kiss with her yelp of desire. oh, god! heat started within her. he was hard! and pressed right to her sex! the ache was almost too much to bear. valentine collapsed into his chest, her arms already wrapping his solid waist. oh, if only he would take her right there on the carpet!  august recaptured her mouth greedily, sucking her lower lip and then tongue into his mouth. he held her close, like he could never get his fill of her scent and taste. though her eyelids fluttered open and shut for the duration of their embrace, he retained his gaze and watched her melt- all for him. at last, he had found his night-flower, his passionate match! his own dear and true slave!  slowly he released her mouth and her body. she was trembling, overcome by lust and this taste of her long-held fantasies. with strong and careful hands he guided her back to the chair.  “valentine…” his voice was low and throaty. at last her emerald eyes flicked open and he saw the life breathing back into them. she was panting heavily.  “doctor…?” she gasped out. he shook his head.  “god has sent you to me, little bird. you are my own from this moment, do you understand?” trembling again, overcome by the rush of fulfillment and shock that swept her, she opened her mouth, her voice choked.  “yes… yes, oh, yes!” she started up and kissed him, finding new tears in her eyes. he allowed her the moment of passion, and then placed his hands upon her shoulders.  “we will speak in depth about this, valentine. i have much to arrange, and i am afraid i must leave you without much explanation at this time. but we have the rest of our hour. tell me, little bird, if you are a virgin.”  “yes, i am. you have even claimed my mouth first.” he nodded. his fingers, thick and strong, yet well cared-for, buried themselves in her hair.  “i must have you, little bird. now. you have lit the fires of my soul once again, and you are the most beautiful creature i have ever met. your soul matches mine, and you *are* mine.” another squeak of pleasure escaped her and she shook ever harder. the heat and wetness inside her was begging, begging her to open, and the words flew from her mouth with no regret.  “please, please take me! oh god, prove to me you are a man!”  he needed no further insistence. the wanton desperation in her voice was enough. on fire with his own dire need, he broke from her and turned to his own desk. it would have to do. quickly he cleared aside his papers and put away his books and ink. 	this gave him a serviceable space on which to stake his claim on the girl. fortune had seen fit to smile at last upon his black and twisted heart.  “little bird, come to me.” she sprang to her feet at his call and stepped forward. all of her mischievous nature welled up inside, and happiness flooded her body. divine joy, almost, but also intentions. he had done wonderfully to make her shiver thus far, but he must keep his will strong to overcome her. valentine smiled broadly. she flitted to his side. suddenly his hands were upon her shoulders, and there was possession in his touch. even his breath came with heavy promises. he spun her. she could not see what he did, but his hands flew down the ties of her corsetry and freed her of the restricting garment. it was so quick and focused it dazzled her, and she could not deny that he seemed an expert in all he did, like many years of his life had been spent in the art of domination. vaguely valentine wondered what explanation he was delaying. what were his secrets that he so took to her confession, and here, fulfilled it?  the girl felt exposed as he threw away the piece and surveyed the rest of his property. his eyes were molten. he stepped close and slid his hands under the hem of her chemise. its lace was no match. soon it was removed, and he fell upon her heavy, milk-white breasts with his mouth. the wild lovely girl cried out, her rosy nipple enclosed in the hot mouth of the inexplicable man. august ran his tongue around the hardening point and sucked her lightly, drawing a musical gasp for his effort. it seemed his hands would never get full enough to sate their craving. but he could not afford to spend eternity at these, though he would have been happy to. slowly his hands followed the lush curve of her waist in, and out again at her hips, and he slid away the last barrier to his prize.  a dead man could have felt the heat that came from her, and the rich scent of her arousal wafted like perfume. he drank it in. pressing her glorious nakedness to him, august kissed her fiercely, and she grew lost in the scorching dance of their tongues. he maneuvered her backward, and rested the supple flesh of her backside upon his desk. his hands found purchase beneath her thighs, and he lifted, to place her perfectly there.  “spread your thighs.” valentine shuddered inside. he had spoken the words from her dreams. her knees obeyed him shakily, and she opened herself slowly, barely withstanding the white-hot gaze. his hands roved her freely, playing with her breasts, tracing lines along her sensitive neck, shoulders, and stomach. he stood between her spread thighs and kissed her so ferociously she thought her core would melt by that alone. but his mouth traveled downward, and her muscles tightened her entire frame. his lips brushed her collarbone, as did his tongue. the trail went lower, ravaging her breasts with all parts of his sensual mouth, and she squealed at feeling his teeth. the descent continued down her belly and finally to hips and thighs. her fingers buried themselves in his chocolate-hued hair. she groaned as his insistent mouth licked down the soft flesh of her thigh, and when he bit her hard, she howled a little, seizing forward.  one rough fingertip stroked the thoroughly wetted folds of her untouched sex, and he felt her tremor. slowly, he sank that curious finger into the depths, and valentine’s moan was precious. her walls clenched him perfectly, and he languished in her intense heat. when he withdrew his finger from her, she let out a breath suddenly, as if she had drawn and held it the moment he impaled her. the natural lubrication she produced was thick, clear and silky, and he hummed his approval. drawing his left hand through the glossy curls crowning her loins, he rose slightly, drawing her look. valentine’s breath hitched and her eyes went wide as tea saucers. deliberately, slowly, the doctor captured her gaze and placed the finger, still coated with her fluids, into his mouth and drew it back, clean.",0,,

476168,"incidentally, the ""little book"" that corrupts dorian gray is a real book, and it's amazing: [*à rebours* by joris-karl huysmans (1884)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%80_rebours). an english translation [is available](http://www.huysmans.org/against/agiii.htm).  my english teacher was horrified when i told her i was reading it. she feared that i would end up like dorian. i am not joking.  here's an except. if even one person reads it and is interested, then it will have been worthwhile.  *****  the gentleman came in, made his bow and deposited in the dining-room, on the pitch-pine flooring, his gold shield, which swayed backwards and forwards, rising a little bit from the ground and extending at the extremity of a snake-like neck a turtle’s head which next instant it drew back in a scare under its shell.  this turtle was the result of a whim that had suddenly occurred to des esseintes a short while before his leaving paris. looking one day at an oriental carpet with iridescent gleams of colour and following with his eyes the silvery glints that ran across the web of the wool, the colours of which were an opaque yellow and a plum violet, he had told himself: it would be a fine experiment to set on this carpet something that would move about and the deep tint of which would bring out and accentuate these tones.  possessed by this idea, he had strolled at random through the streets; had arrived at the palais-royal, and in front of chevet’s window had suddenly struck his forehead, — a huge turtle met his eyes there, in a tank. he had bought the creature; then, once it was left to itself on the carpet, he had sat down before it and gazed long at it, screwing up his eyes.  alas! there was no doubt, the negro-head hue, the raw sienna tone of the shell dimmed the sheen of the carpet instead of bringing out the tints; the dominant gleams of silver now barely showed, clashing with the cold tones of scraped zinc alongside this hard, dull carapace.  he gnawed his nails, searching in vain for a way to reconcile these discordances, to prevent this absolute incompatibility of tones. at last he discovered that his original notion of lighting up the fires of the stuff by the to-and-fro movements of a dark object set on it was mistaken; the fact of the matter was, the carpet was still too bright, too crude, too new-looking. its colours were not sufficiently softened and toned down; the thing was to reverse the proposed expedient, to deaden the tints, to stifle them by the contrast of a brilliant object that should kill everything round it, casting the flash of gold over the pale sheen of silver. thus looked at, the problem was easier to solve. accordingly he resolved to have his turtle’s back glazed over with gold.  once back from the jeweller’s who had taken it in to board at his workshop, the beast blazed like a sun in splendour, throwing its flashing rays over the carpet, whose tones were weak and cold in comparison, looking for all the world like a visigothic targe inlaid with shining scales, the handiwork of some barbaric craftsman.  at first, des esseintes was enchanted with the effect; but he soon came to the conclusion that this gigantic jewel was only half finished, that it would not be really complete and perfect till it was incrusted with precious stones.  he selected from a collection of japanese curios a design representing a great bunch of flowers springing from a thin stalk, took it to a jeweller’s, sketched out a border to enclose this bouquet in an oval frame, and informed the dumb-founded lapidary that every leaf and every petal or the flowers was to be executed in precious stones and mounted in the actual scales of the turtle.  the choice of the stones gave him pause; the diamond had grown singularly hackneyed now that every business man wears one on his little finger; oriental emeralds and rubies are less degraded and dart fine, flashing lights, but they are too reminiscent of those green and red eyes that shine as head-lights on certain lines of paris omnibuses; as for topazes, burnt or raw, they are cheap stones, dear to the humble housewife who loves to lock up a jewel-case or two in a glasscupboard; of another sort, the amethyst, albeit the church has given it something of a sacerdotal character, is yet a stone spoilt by its frequent use to ornament the red ears and bulbous hands of butchers’ wives who are fain at a modest cost to bedeck their persons with genuine and heavy jewels. alone among all these, the sapphire keeps its fires inviolate, unharmed by the folly of tradesmen and money-grubbers. the brilliance of its fire that sparkles from a cold, limpid background has to some degree guaranteed against defilement its discreet and haughty nobility. but unfortunately by artificial light its bright flames flash no longer; the colour sinks back into itself and seems to go to sleep, only to wake and sparkle again at daybreak.  no, not one of these stones satisfied des esseintes; besides, they were all too civilized, too familiar. he preferred other, more startling and uncommon, sorts. after fingering a number of these and letting them trickle through his hands, he finally picked out a series of stones, some real, some artificial, the combination of which should produce a harmony, at once fascinating and disconcerting.  he combined together the several parts of his bouquet in this way: the leaves were set with stones of a strong and definite green colour, — chrysoberyls, asparagus green; peridots, leek green; olives, olive green, springing from twigs of almandine and ouvarovite of a purple red, gems throwing out sparkles of a clear, dry brilliance like the incrustations of tartar that glitter on the insides of wine-casks.  for the blossoms that stood isolated, far removed from the stalk, he used an ashen blue, rejecting, however, definitely the oriental turquoise that is used for brooches and rings, and which, along with the commonplace pearl and the odious coral form the delight of vulgar souls; he selected exclusively those european turquoises that, strictly speaking, are only a fossil ivory impregnated with coppery infiltrations and whose sea-green blue is heavy, opaque, sulphurous, as if jaundiced with bile.  this done, he could now proceed to incrust the petals of such blossoms as grew in the middle of the bunch, those in closest neighbourhood of the stem, with certain translucent stones, possessing a glassy, sickly sheen with feverish, vivid bursts of fire.  three gems, and only three, he employed for this purpose, — ceylon cat’s-eyes, cymophanes and sapphirines.  all three were stones that flashed with mysterious, incalculable sparkles, painfully drawn from the chill interior of their turbid substance, — the cat’s eye of a greenish grey, striped with concentric veins that seem to be endowed with motion, to stir and shift every instant according to the way the light falls; the cymophane with bluish waterings running across the milky hue that appears afloat within; the sapphirine that lights up blue, phosphorescent fires on a dull, chocolate-brown background.  the lapidary took careful notes and measures as to the exact places where the stones were to be let in. ""and the edges of the shell?"" he presently asked des esseintes.  the latter had thought at first of a border of opals and hydrophanes. but these stones, interesting as they are by their curious variations of colour and changes of sparkle, are too difficult and untrustworthy to deal with; the opal has a quite rheumatic sensitiveness, the play of its rays is entirely modified according to the degree of moisture, and of heat and cold, while the hydrophane has no fire, refuses to light up the grey glow of its furnace except in water, after it has been wetted.  finally he settled on stones whose hues would supplement each other, — the hyacinth of compostella, mahogany red; the aquamarine, sea green; the balass ruby, vinegar rose; the sudermania ruby, pale slate-colour. their comparatively feeble play of colours would suffice to light up the deadness of the dull, grey shell, while leaving its full value to the brilliant bouquet of jewelled blossoms which they framed in a slender garland of uncertain splendours.  des esseintes stood gazing at the turtle where it lay huddled together in one corner of the dining-room, flashing fire in the dim half light.  he felt perfectly happy; his eyes were intoxicated with the splendours of these flowers flashing in jewelled flames against a golden background. then, contrary to his use, he had an appetite and was dipping his slices of toast spread with super-excellent butter in a cup of tea, an impeccable blend of si-a-fayoun, mo-you-tann and khansky, — yellow teas, imported from china into russia by special caravans.  this liquid perfume he drank from those cups of oriental porcelain known as egg-shell china, so delicate and transparent are they; in the same way, just as he would have nothing to say to any other save this adorably dainty ware, he refused to use as dishes and plates anything else but articles of genuine antique silver-gilt, a trifle worn so that the underlying silver shows a little here and there under the film of gold, giving a tender, old-world look as of something fading away in a quiet death of exhaustion.  after swallowing his last mouthful, he went back to his study, whither he directed a servant to bring the turtle, which obstinately declined to make the smallest effort towards locomotion.  outside the snow was falling. in the lamplight, ice arabesques glittered on the dark windows and the hoar-frost sparkled like crystals of sugar on the bottle-glass panes speckled with gold.  a deep silence wrapped the little house that lay asleep in the darkness.",0,,

259103,"in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.  “whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”  he didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that. in consequence, i’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician, because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. most of the confidences were unsought — frequently i have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and i snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  and, after boasting this way of my tolerance, i come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point i don’t care what it’s founded on. when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — gatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn. if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”— it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again. no — gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city for three generations. the carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the dukes of buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the civil war, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.  i never saw this great-uncle, but i’m supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office i graduated from new haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war. i enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that i came back restless. instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so i decided to go east and learn the bond business. everybody i knew was in the bond business, so i supposed it could support one more single man. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “why — ye — es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays i came east, permanently, i thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington, and i went out to the country alone. i had a dog — at least i had him for a few days until he ran away — and an old dodge and a finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than i, stopped me on the road.  “how do you get to west egg village?” he asked helplessly.  i told him. and as i walked on i was lonely no longer. i was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  there was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew. and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides. i was rather literary in college — one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “yale news.”— and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” this isn’t just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york — and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  i lived at west egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some hotel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby’s mansion. or, rather, as i didn’t know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.  across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i’d known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.  her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven — a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy — even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach — but now he’d left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  why they came east i don’t know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn’t believe it — i had no sight into daisy’s heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens — finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body — he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage — a cruel body.  his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked — and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.  “now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because i’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  “i’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.  “it belonged to demaine, the oil man.” he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “we’ll go inside.”  we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it — indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise — she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression — then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.  “i’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i’ve heard it said that daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  at any rate, miss baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again — the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.  i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  “do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.  “the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”  “how gorgeous! let’s go back, tom. to-morrow!” then she added irrelevantly: “you ought to see the baby.”  “i’d like to.”  “she’s asleep. she’s three years old. haven’t you ever seen her?”  “never.”  “well, you ought to see her. she’s ——”  tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  “what you doing, nick?”  “i’m a bond man.”  “who with?”  i told him.  “never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.  this annoyed me.  “you will,” i answered shortly. “you will if you stay in the east.”  “oh, i’ll stay in the east, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “i’d be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.”  at this point miss baker said: “absolutely!” with such suddenness that i started — it was the first word she uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  “i’m stiff,” she complained, “i’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.”  “don’t look at me,” daisy retorted, “i’ve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.”  “no, thanks,” said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “i’m absolutely in training.”  her host looked at her incredulously.  “you are!” he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “how you ever get anything done is beyond me.”  i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  “you live in west egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “i know somebody there.”  “i don’t know a single ——”  “you must know gatsby.”  “gatsby?” demanded daisy. “what gatsby?”  before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  “why candles?” objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. “in two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” she looked at us all radiantly. “do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”  “we ought to plan something,” yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  “all right,” said daisy. “what’ll we plan?” she turned to me helplessly: “what do people plan?”  before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  “look!” she complained; “i hurt it.”  we all looked — the knuckle was black and blue.  “you did it, tom,” she said accusingly. “i know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. that’s what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a ——”  “i hate that word hulking,” objected tom crossly, “even in kidding.”  “hulking,” insisted daisy.  sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  “you make me feel uncivilized, daisy,” i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “can’t you talk about crops or something?”  i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  “civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out tom violently. “i’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read ‘the rise of the colored empires’ by this man goddard?”  “why, no,” i answered, rather surprised by his tone.  “well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be — will be utterly submerged. it’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  “tom’s getting very profound,” said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “he reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we ——”  “well, these books are all scientific,” insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. “this fellow has worked out the whole thing. it’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”  “we’ve got to beat them down,” whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  “you ought to live in california —” began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  “this idea is that we’re nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and ——” after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “— and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization — oh, science and art, and all that. do you see?”  there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  “i’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “it’s about the butler’s nose. do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”  “that’s why i came over to-night.”  “well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose ——”  “things went from bad to worse,” suggested miss baker.  “yes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”  for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened — then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  the butler came back and murmured something close to tom’s ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  “i love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a — of a rose, an absolute rose. doesn’t he?” she turned to miss baker for confirmation: “an absolute rose?”  this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “sh!” in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  “this mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor ——” i said.  “don’t talk. i want to hear what happens.”  “is something happening?” i inquired innocently.  “you mean to say you don’t know?” said miss baker, honestly surprised. “i thought everybody knew.”  “i don’t.”  “why ——” she said hesitantly, “tom’s got some woman in new york.”  “got some woman?” i repeated blankly.  miss baker nodded.  “she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don’t you think?”  almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.  “it couldn’t be helped!” cried daisy with tense gaiety.  she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: “i looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. there’s a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he’s singing away ——” her voice sang: “it’s romantic, isn’t it, tom?”  “very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “if it’s light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.”  the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn’t guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing — my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  ❦",0,,

472807,"edit: it would be awesome if someone could help me figure out if i am neutral cool or neutral warm.. sometimes some of the foundations i listed look too yellow one day but then they look too ashy/light another day?? i am so confused.. it doesn't help that my face and neck are two different tones and face is lighter than my neck. anyways, thank you.  hi guys! :')   so.. i finally figured out that i have olive undertones last year (when i couldn't get a perfect match in lucy minerals foundation until i mixed golden medium and medium olive together half &amp; half - epiphany time) but i'm still figuring things out.  it's too bad that i can't afford a lot of things atm so experimenting is difficult..   i think i'm around nc20? with yellow-olive undertones, neutral leaning warm(?). i am of east asian descent. the first time i went to get matched at the mac store the employee there took a 1 second look at me and matched me to nc35. i didn't use sunscreen properly then, so i was pretty tan. i noticed that the concealer i got was pretty orange, but stuck with it anyways because otherwise, it was a good match, i thought.  now that i wear sunscreen religiously, i have lightened up a ton, and i started noticing the muted-ness?? green-cast-ness?? that showed through my skin, which wasn't as visible while i was tan. i don't burn, i tan quickly without sunscreen.  now i don't know my mac color and i haven't tried as many foundations as i would like over the years, but the ones i've tried are:   - lucy minerals (creamy biqsue/creamy olive)  - thebalm time balm foundation (light/medium, slightly too dark, slightly too yellow/orange)  - physicians formula cc cream in light (too dark, too pink-toned? appears ashy)  - lumene cc cream in medium (too dark, used only a few times)  - canmake perfect serum bb cream in #02 (too dark, a little too yellow)  my veins show green and some purple, can't really place..   through girl magazines and my golden-warm sister, best friend, and mother, my entire makeup life until very recently has been all about corals, warm eyeshadows, golds, oranges, the whole ""asians = yellow = warm!!"" i always felt frustrated because i thought i could never find foundations yellow enough. i had no clue i had olive undertones until i read musicalhouse's blog post. even then i was skeptical.   my lips are pigmented, but it looks grey/purple-ish.  colors i think i look good in:  - neutral colors mostly  - deep purples  - berries/plums  - if i, for whatever reason, want to wear grey eyeshadow, warm greys   - deep, muted berry-ish red lipsticks  - cream?  - cool toned browns  - navy is so pretty!  - muted colors  - i think i look great in things like [sultry from silk naturals](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/sultry-mac-brick-o-la-clone-vegan-lipstick.html) and [beguile from sn](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/makeup-accessories/lips/beguile-deep-pink-shimmer-alg.html)   i think i look too intense/horrible in:  - orange!!  - for some reason i stay away from warm browns.. they make me look like i'm wearing ""cheap"" makeup - red-orange or even neutral red.. i look so.. weird.. they make me look either clown-ish or like i have bad, yellow teeth lmao. or on the cheeks, kind of.. dirty.  - too-cool pinks  - of course, pastels (but oh, how i wish)  - black eyeliner is way too intense and make me look dirty. i use dark brown eyeliner.  - bright colors/neons/electric blue is way too much  - cool greys (i look.. dirty? and cheap?)  - colors with a brown base on my lips? i look so old and just wrong! like [this lipstick](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/nectar-sheer-deep-red-brown-black-honey-clone-ks.html). and [this lipstick](http://www.silknaturals.com/store/index.php/nice-tan-sheer-matte-nude-alg.html) made me look horrible. cheap, zombie-lips, awful. but everyone else's swatches shows up so nice and nude pink. i don't understand this because brown-based things are supposed to be flattering for people with my undertones??  corals and peaches i am undecided on.. i don't know if they look good on me or not? and corals and peachy-pinks are supposed to be ""universally flattering"" right? i know i hate anything that pulls too orange. my sister bought me this bright, coral dress once and i thought it looked really ""off"" and much too intense for me.   i have never tried muave lipsticks or plum blushes. i'm thinking about trying some, but i'm scared of them pulling too grey on me. i don't think i've ever tried jewel colors for either makeup or clothing either.  i still haven't found the perfect match. :'( i wanted to try revlon colorstay but i don't think i could handle the formulas of either normal/dry and whipped. i went to the drugstore the other day, and held up the buff colors from revlon and almay tlc next to my hand and compared to the rest of the lines, i thought it looked like the best match. i'm thinking about trying bourjois healthy mix serum in either 51 or 52 (i'm not sure which i should).  i feel like i could never find the perfect contour color either? i  have heard nyx taupe pulls pink on olive skin tones.  as for clothing, i get the most ""wow!"" ""you look so good!"" when i wear red, even from people i've known for a long time, and even if it's just a dingy ol sweater shirt. it surprises me every time. which is strange because i don't like orange reds neutral reds for makeup. i feel too scared to wear it though because red is an intense/eye-catching color.   gosh i wrote a novel! but writing this out really helped me out? anyways, so that is me, feathereddinos. xd  edited for format.",1,-1,

998794,"communication helps.  both for having been the way to avoid this situation in the first place, since if you'd been talking to your boyfriend about sex you'd have found out about this sooner and for unpacking how each of you feel and how you'll move forward and structure your relationship from here on out.  but communication is a two-way street.  he is, after all, the one who didn't speak up for months about how he was feeling, so you cannot blame yourself or take sole responsibility for the sexual dynamic you had even if you want to guilt yourself over wanting him.  you're definitely both going to have to work on how you talk and communicate so that he doesn't zip up about other aspects of the relationship from here on.  sexual incompatibility is a real thing, so if you're fine with it, that's great, but don't pretend that it's an illegitimate reason to end things, because that's an unnecessary limitation on processing this and your options going forward.  &gt;i don't know. i just i want to work through these feelings with him, but i don't want him to feel guilty for coming out to me, of all things. it's not his fault i'm feeling like this, but he's the sort of person that will think it is regardless.  you need to be able to talk to your lover about how you're feeling without him playing the martyr or self-flagellating, so that's definitely an aspect of your relationship you're going to have to work on for the future even if you don't get it in time to actually discuss how you're feeling now in the moment.",0,,

107515,"well, i would have to say that i have quite a bit of empathy with you. i have the acne, have put on quite a bit of weight in college, and well, my dick is not a specimen for exhibition. i used to do the two shirt thing too, i have not gone swimming since my early teens. oh yeah, i have big nipples too, like really big, not outwardly, but, in terms of circumference.  i am struggling with the weight thing, i have come to understand that it will take a change of sufficient magnitude that the effort will need to be concerted, i am working on it. beyond that from what i understand about small-dickedness, i would not be too worried about it. the way the wanker dangles is governed by the part of the nervous system that we have no control over. generally, the dick is a pretty stock size on most everyone, with some outliers both toward huge and toward small. your dick is probably not as small in comparison to the general population as you think, your parasympathetic nervous system just does't let it hang low when you are not hard. while i admit that i am a virgin, my lack of sex has given me plenty of time to study it. what i mean by that is that, while i avoid porno, i do not skip the science articles on sex, and the reference material if i have a question, i don't mind commentary as long as it is not aimed at tittilating me on its own terms instead of sharing information that is insightful. i am not entirely sure that a dick needs to be as huge as we would think. like for instance, if your read about the clitoris, it is not way deep in there somewhere, but more toward the surface. i also gather that regardless of the guy's dick size, it is common for women to require some extra stimulation. beyond that, sex generally lasts, per instance, around 15 minutes, with only three to five of that being penetrative. i do not mean to be dispassionate by saying that, i am sort of alluding to the notion that a bigger part of sex might not be so dick centric as it seems to direct reasoning. the 15 minutes thing too is also consistent with studies they have done on hotel porno, the average person who does hotel pay perview porn only watches it for around fifteen minutes.  with the acne, it does suck to have that, i was very self conscious about that when it was at its worst. i  don't think most people really mind scarring that much, especially on guys. if your scars are discolored, you can get stuff to bleach them. beyond that, if you are like me, the farmer's tan from wearing a shirt all the time in the summer is as big an issue as the acne scars. i have not figured out the farmers tan yet, i have thought of going to a tanner, not as a lifelong habit, and using sunscreen there on my face and arms an legs, and just getting tanned in the regions of my body that never see the sun. i have noticed that the skin on my body that sees the sun is in better condition aestheticaly than the white stuff.  one thing i do suggest you do is refining your fashion quite a bit. this can help immensly. look the best you can right now, and don't have it set out there in the future. you are not going to be able to solve it all overnight, but you can take care of some things today. i suggest wearing a short sleeve button up shirt over a t-shirt, i have gone to wearing dickies shirts with the labels cut off, they have nice short sleeve work shirts that are consistent in quality and availability. the button up short sleeve shirt has the qualities i liked wearing two t-shirts for, but looks much better. beyond that, with pants, if you wear jeans, go for the darkest denim you can that is not black, and get a goood cut. if you are on a budget, there are ""levi &amp; strauss"" (not levi's)ones at wal-mart that are nice for around 20$. avoid light denim and cuts that are tapered, never wear anything pleated, don't wear shirts that have buttons on the edge of the collars. if you need to, don't be ashamed to go to a big and tall store, the first time i went to a big and tall store, i felt so at home, i did not feel like an outsider, i could almost feel good about being a big man, it was almost like there was different air in there, that is where the big men shop, the neurotic world churns outside.  figure out your hair, and don't hide in a hat. things to avoid are puff and frizz, this can make you look horrible, especially if you don't keep right on top of things ang get a haircut just as soon as you need one. i know it sounds crazy, but, i have found a lot of success with groom &amp; clean, that an brylcreem, these are sort of unique hair products, it is not grease, it is hair groom, hair gel and spray leaves your hair hard or brittle, pomade and wax is gooey, hair groom on the other hand is ideal, a little dab around the size of a nickel or so, maybe a little bigger, will allow you to style your hair while conditioning it, it will stay in place and you will be able to go longer between haircuts. there is also shaving, make sure to keep up on it, big guys don't look so good with stubble. i find it much easier to shave without any shaving cream, just water or with shaving oil. before i stopped using shaving cream, i shaved much less, now without the cream, it is no hassle, just wetten up and go, feeling to make sure it is smooth both ways.  i recommend also cultivating your deeper person. you are doing good by being here on reddit, just make sure to get lots of good content that is quality, try to stay away from too much negativity. virtue is important, and our culure glosses over so much of the deeper more fulfiling stuff in a superficial manner. big guys are sort of shuffled to the perimeter, use this as an opportunity to gain perspective and grow contemplatively. if you are religious, get serious about it, historically guys who were outsiders or loners have had great relationships with god, like hermits and monks and shepards, they all have time to think and pray and grow. i know it may not seem like it is for you, but, it will help a lot with things. i became a christian when i was eighteen, my high school friends, the people i had grown up with, all disbanded and went to college scattered all over, church gave me a new set of friends, ones that will be my friends for life it appears. if you have not gone to church much before, i just suggest pursuing god for whatever you can get from it, be honest and forthright, if yoou don't have the faith right now, there is only something to be gained, and not really anything to be lost. there is some superficiality in church, there is superficiality anywhere, i find with this, i just need to be a little persistent, and bear thruogh it because i am not perfect and the greater whole is worth it. i do not mean to be pushy with the evangelism. the biggest thing in my life that i think has ever helped me is my faith. i pray like a schizophrenic, my mouth is running whenever nobody is looking. prayer has taught me about myself and has taken me deeper intellectually than anything i have ever done, it sounds like your blog might be similar in function, prayer is immediate and portable, your car or your room, or a restroom stall can all be a prayer closet, it just seems to work, ask for guidance and wisdom, but mostly, talk like you would to a friend. if you are skeptic, do what skeptics do, and experiment.   as a big guy outside of the popular crowd, you have something beautiful that the people at the center of attention might never get. that is the space to think and grow as a person.",0,,

796864,"anti-zionism is very often used as a whitewash for anti-semitism. it's a clever sort of kindler, gentler anti-semitism. the rising tide of global anti-semitism is very real and worrisome (and i'm neither jewish nor israeli, just a human).   pay careful attention to your sources. rense has made it very clear they are on the side of the palestinians. no surprise they think 9/11 was a zionist plot. in fact, the majority of the anti-war movement has become sadly anti-israel, as if having suicide bombers kill your children for 50 years is no reason to fight back. to my eyes it seems like the palestinians have been much more successful at manipulating americans than the israeli's.  regarding the original story... peep this note about the israeli commando, daniel lewin, that was reportedly shot on flight 11 (read the rest of the notes for the obligatory subsequent denial and refusal to release the docs and attendant oddities... also, the site on this link has a ton of interesting and meticulous notes on 9/11 oddities):   http://killtown.911review.org/oddities/911.html#daniel_lewin  ""the american airlines faa principal security inspector (psi) was notified by suzanne clark of american airlines corporate headquarters, that an on board flight attendant contacted american airlines operations center and informed that a passenger located in seat 10b shot and killed a passenger in seat 9b at 9:20 a.m.  ""the passenger killed was daniel lewin, shot by passenger satam al suqami. one bullet was reported to have been fired.""   ...""in another tragic irony of sept. 11, three of the five islamic hijackers aboard american airlines flight 11 were seated next to an elite israeli commando. and it may just have gotten that jewish passenger killed before all the others.  in fact, his friends and associates are now sure of it, after reading a secret government memo naming israeli-american daniel c. lewin as a gunshot victim on the flight.",1,-1,

635130,"virgil: what i'd give for a pear.  beatrice: a pear?  virgil: yes. a ripe and juicy one.  (pause.)  beatrice: i've never had a pear.  virgil: what?  beatrice: in fact, i don't think i've ever set eyes on one.  virgil: how is that possible? it's a common fruit.  beatrice: my parents were always eating apples and carrots. i  guess they didn't like pears.  virgil: but pears are so good! i bet you there's a pear tree right around here. (he looks about.)  beatrice: describe a pear for me. what is a pear like?  virgil: (settling back) i can try. let's see . . . to start with, a pear has an unusual shape. it's round and fat on the bottom, but tapered on top.  beatrice: like a gourd.  virgil: a gourd ? you know gourds but you don't know pears? how odd the things we know and don't. at any rate, no, a pear is smaller than an average gourd, and its shape is more pleasing to the eye. a pear becomes tapered in a symmetrical way, its upper half sitting straight and centred atop its lower half. can you see what i mean?  beatrice: i think so.  virgil: let's start with the bottom half. can you imagine a fruit that is round and fat?  beatrice: like an apple?  virgil: not quite. if you look at an apple with your mind's eye, you will notice that the girth of the apple is at its widest either in the middle of the fruit or in the top third, isn't that so?  beatrice: you're right. a pear is not like this?  virgil: no. you must imagine an apple that is at its widest in the bottom third.  beatrice: i can see it.  virgil: but we must not push the comparison too far. the bottom of a pear is not like an apple's.  beatrice: no?  virgil: no. most apples sit on their buttocks, so to speak, on a circular ridge or on four or five points that keep them from falling over. past the buttocks, a little ways up, there's what would be the anus of the fruit if the fruit were a beast.  beatrice: i see precisely what you mean.  virgil: well, a pear is not like that. a pear has no buttocks. its bottom is round.  beatrice: so how does it stay up?  virgil: it doesn't. a pear either dangles from a tree or lies on its side.  beatrice: as clumsy as an egg.  virgil: there's something else about the bottom of a pear: most pears do not have those vertical grooves that some apples have. most pears have smooth, round, even bottoms.  beatrice: how enchanting.  virgil: it certainly is. now let us move north past our fruity equator.  beatrice: i'm following you.  virgil: there comes this tapering i was telling you about.  beatrice: i can't quite see it. does the fruit come to a point? is it shaped like a cone?  virgil: no. imagine the tip of a banana.  beatrice: which tip?  virgil: the end tip, the one you hold in your hand when you're eating one.  beatrice: what kind of banana? there are hundreds of varieties.  virgil: are there?  beatrice: yes. some are as small as fat fingers, others are real clubs. and their shapes vary too, as do their taste.  virgil: i mean the regular, yellow ones that taste really good.  beatrice: the common banana, m. sapientum. you probably have the gros michel variety in mind.  virgil: i'm impressed.  beatrice: i know bananas.  virgil: better than a monkey. take the end tip of a common banana, then, and place it on top of an apple, taking into account the differences between apples and pears that i've just described.  beatrice: an interesting graft.  virgil: now make the lines smoother, gentler. let the banana flare out in a friendly way as it merges into the apple. can you see it?  beatrice: i believe i can.  virgil: one last detail. at the very top of this apple-banana composite, add a surprisingly tough stalk, a real tree trunk of a stalk. there, you have an approximation of a pear.  beatrice: a pear sounds like a beautiful fruit.  virgil: it is. in colour, commonly, a pear is yellow with black spots.  beatrice: like a banana again.  virgil: no, not at all. a pear isn't yellow in so bright, lustreless and opaque a way. it's a paler, translucent yellow, moving towards beige, but not creamy, more watery, approaching the visual texture of a watercolour wash. and the spots are sometimes brown.  beatrice: how are the spots distributed?  virgil: not like the spots on a leopard. it's more a matter of areas of shadowing than of real spots, depending on the degree of maturity of the pear. by the way, a ripe pear bruises easily, so it must be handled with care.  beatrice: of course.  virgil: now the skin. it's a peculiar skin, the pear's, hard to describe. we were speaking of apples and bananas.  beatrice: yes.  virgil: they have smooth, slippery skins.  beatrice: they do.  virgil: a pear does not have so smooth or slippery a skin.  beatrice: really?  virgil: it is so. a pear has a rougher skin.  beatrice: like an avocado's?  virgil: no. but since you mention avocados, a pear is somewhat shaped like an avocado, although the bottom of a pear is usually plumper.  beatrice: fascinating.  virgil: and a pear becomes thinner in its top half in a more pronounced way than an avocado does. nonetheless, the two fruits are more or less similar in form.  beatrice: i see the shape clearly.  virgil: but you cannot compare their skins! an avocado's skin is as warty as a toad's. an avocado looks like a vegetable with leprosy. the pear is characterized by a thin roughness, delicate and interesting to the touch. if you could magnify it a hundred times, do you know what it would sound like, the sound of fingertips running over the skin of a dry pear?  beatrice: what?  virgil: it would sound like the diamond of a record player entering a groove. that same dancing crackle, like the burning of the driest, lightest kindling.  beatrice: a pear is surely the finest fruit in the world!  virgil: it is, it is! that's the skin of a pear for you.  beatrice: can one eat it?  virgil: of course. we're not talking here of the waxy, thuggish skin of an orange. the skin of a pear is soft and yielding when ripe.  beatrice: and what does a pear taste like?  virgil: wait. you must smell it first. a ripe pear breathes a fragrance that is watery and subtle, its power lying in the lightness of its impression upon the olfactory sense. can you imagine the smell of nutmeg or cinnamon?  beatrice: i can.  virgil: the smell of a ripe pear has the same effect on the mind as these aromatic spices. the mind is arrested, spellbound, and a thousand and one memories and associations are thrown up as the mind burrows deep to understand the allure of this beguiling smell — which it never comes to understand, by the way.  beatrice: but how does it taste? i can't wait any longer.  virgil: a ripe pear overflows with sweet juiciness.  beatrice: oh, that sounds good.  virgil: slice a pear and you will find that its flesh is incandescent white. it glows with inner light. those who carry a knife and a pear are never afraid of the dark.  beatrice: i must have one.  virgil: the texture of a pear, its consistency, is yet another difficult matter to put into words. some pears are a little crunchy.  beatrice: like an apple?  virgil: no, not at all like an apple! an apple resists being eaten. an apple is not eaten, it is conquered. the crunchiness of a pear is far more appealing. it is giving and fragile. to eat a pear is akin to . . . kissing.  beatrice: oh, my. it sounds so good.  virgil: the flesh of a pear can be slightly gritty. and yet it melts in the mouth.  beatrice: is such a thing possible?  virgil: with every pear. and that is only the look, the feel, the smell, the texture. i have not even told you of the taste.  beatrice: my god!  virgil: the taste of a good pear is such that when you eat one, when your teeth sink into the bliss of one, it becomes a wholly engrossing activity. you want to do nothing else but eat your pear. you would rather sit than stand. you would rather be alone than in company. you would rather have silence than music. all your senses but taste fall inactive. you see nothing, you hear nothing, you feel nothing—or only as it helps you to appreciate the divine taste of your pear.  beatrice: but what does it actually taste like?  virgil: a pear tastes like, it tastes like . . . (he struggles. he gives up with a shrug.) i don't know. i can't put it into words. a pear tastes like itself.  beatrice: (sadly) i wish you had a pear.  virgil: and if i had one, i would give it to you.

615159,"well here comes the shpeal. i used to work at a salon for quite some time and i would go regularly every week about 2-3 times a week, sometimes more, but 2-3 times will do just fine.  there are many things to consider when you start tanning. search around a few salons and see how the service is at each of them and how (this is key) clean the place is. you're getting naked (or you can do it in a swimsuit, doesn't matter) in this place, you want to make sure they are doing their only other job besides sitting on their ass putting people into computers, and that is cleaning.   make sure to ask what disinfectant they use.   now let's say you found your place. where do you start off at? truth is, anywhere is fine. the way tanning beds work though, is they range in levels. the levels are determined by the power of the bed, and that is figured out through the number of bulbs and wattage per bulb. so as you go higher the beds will be stronger, you will go for less time (usually) and believe it or not, they are actually safer for you.   why is that? tanning beds filter three types of uv light. uva b and c. a and c are good for you, b, however, is the burning ray. so for whatever reason, the higher level beds have less b rays inside of them, so you actually have more of a chance burning n a low level bed because it may contain more uvb. there still needs to be a little bit of uvb in the beds because you have to burn ever so slightly to tan. ever notice after a sunburn heals that you're darker? yes, you have obtained a tan, but your skin paid a hefty price in damage.  so tanning beds, i feel are safer than the actual sun because they filter out harmful rays that are found in natural sunlight. you can control how much sun hits you and where.   so go to your local salons, figure out what levels they have and how much the employee knows about them. my place had levels 3-9, i know most have 1-3.   so now that you've found your salon, and they offer a wide range of levels, it's time to determine your skin type.  if my memory serves me correctly there are 4 different types.   type 1 are usually red-headed or ginger people. they skin is pale, very fair, easily burnt and they can usually never obtain a tan.  type 2 still have light, pale skin, can be burnt relatively easily but can still obtain somewhat of a tan.  type 3 have somewhat of a dark complexity, still burn but not as often as type 2 or 1s, and they can obtain a nice tan.  type 4 are usually olive skinned people with the darkest complexity that barely burn and can be tan after being outside in the sun for two minutes.  you have to figure out which one you are. based on your judgement, if you are type 1 or 2, head for the higher levels to avoid being burnt so easily.   if you are 3 or 4, you may use the higher levels and still get dark, but sometimes, jumping down to tan in a lower level just to get that extra burn might be better for you, if you're worried about color that is. if you aren't worried about color at all. head to the higher levels and absorb the beautiful sunlight.   so you have your salon, you figured out you are a type 2 and you're going to do a level 6. now you're ready to jump in and fry. no, you're not.  always, and i stress this, always wear eye protection. it's basically like staring into the sun for a couple minutes. it will diminish your vision after a while, it is very harmful to you, so always wear the glasses. if you receive lines or marks around your eyes, move them around every so often.   figure out from your salon which type of lotion is good for you. i know it might seem like  a gimmick, but it's not. when you tan, the sunlight strips nutrients from your body and dries your skin out, then you are more sesceptible to burning and sunlight will actually bounce off your dry skin and the uv rays you need will not be absorbed.   lotions replenish your skin with the nutrients that are stripped, absorbs the sunlight, and protects your skin.   if you aren't worried about color, just find one that protects you and keeps you moisturized, you don't need to get crazy with the 30 bronzer lotion. but just remember, you need lotion, you've seen those leathery looking elders who look like they've just been taxi-dermied, that is damaged skin due to improper skincare.   okay so you're a type 2, first time tanner, going into a level 6 bed with your new eyewear and lotion. start off slow for your first few times. determine what is a low amount of time to go in based on the max time of the bed itself and work up a base tan to get some color, then move your way up in minutes. it is the safest way.   coming from a 100%, straight, hetero man, it is an amazing feeling. it feels good on your bones, any aches you have, if you're in a cold dark place it will brighten your day up and warm you up for only but a couple minutes, but you will cherish those minutes. plus, you get to get naked, and who doesn't love doing that? be careful though, it is somewhat addicting. you might enjoy the color you see yourself receiving but just remember not to go overboard with it.   i think i've covered everything. i guess if you want a bed or a standup that is your own choice. i prefer bed because you get to doze off and relax.   good luck to you!  i do believe if you go to the [smart tan](http://smarttan.com/) website, there should be more skincare instructions on there.   check to see if the salon you go to is smart tan certified, almost every one should be.   again, good luck! and feel better please! the sunlight does help with vitamin d deficiencies.   **tl;dr** : go to a salon that is smart tan certified and they will tell you everything i told you. if not go to http://smarttan.com for more information on tanning.

784942,"short answer: the beautiful medicinal quality sensimilla (virgin female cannabis) you see in pictures is much different in many ways.  there is a very noticeable difference between what is termed ""schwag"" and ""nugs"" where i live. there's a noticeable difference between varying strains of marijuana in general. welcome to the world of the pot conissieur.  herb is a bio-chemical concoction of different cannabinoids. cannabinoids come in several dozen varieties that we know about; they're what gets you high. cannabinoids are responsible for many of the traits of weed and how the high affects your body.  finding a weed right for you mostly depends on what's available, right? ask your dealer for a hookup. join a stoner club. network, make friends. you will eventually find mr. greenthumb. it's important to know a grower!   you will encounter many varieties of weed. you can ask yourself a lot of different questions about the weed you are examining. there are a myriad of combinations of different cannabinoids in different ratios. you never know what you're getting until you try it or read others' reports about it.  there are reviews online of varying strains and cannabis clubs. your best bet is to find a few you like and seek them but always consider the following:    the most important question is: what do the tricomes (mushroom-shaped resin balls sticking out of the buds) look like? this is where all of the cannabinoids are. these are whats getting you high. the size and shape of these depends on how the plant is grown, harvested, and packaged. the composition and ratio of cannabinoids is determined by genetics; harvest time; light duration, intensity, and wavelength; growing medium; and soil composition. there's a lot of growers who use a lot of different products while growing weed. many factors contribute to just how good the pot is. are the tricomes large? small? erect? bent? white? brown? milky? clear? decomposing? i think large, erect, brown, clear tricomes are the best.    what does it taste like? some taste like shit, chocolate, oranges, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, bubble gum, oil, grapefruit, etc etc.   what does it smell like?  when does the high hit? immediately? delayed?  how does it make you feel? lethargic, excited, lovey, etc?  how does it affect your mind? are you spacey? are you alert?  does it affect pain?   does it make you tired?   also: about the different smoking methods: a clean glass piece with a screen is the most utilitarian smoking device. bongs are great and i consider them 'fancy.'    edit: another thing... you can become tolerent to a variety of weed that you smoke continuously. you must switch it up to maintain a good high in the long term.",0,,

834694,"i wanted to post a video comment, a sarcastic remark to everything that was said.  i reached deep inside my brain, but there was no comment in entish, elvish or the tongues of men that i could type to appropriately get my entire point across.  today, i have failed..",0,,
235395,"ok, here's how it's done.  i don't have the programs in front of me, but looking at the drawings and googling some things, i pieced together all the command names.  almost all of the techniques i use here can be done in either photoshop or illustrator.  they are both powerful programs.  i take advantage of the strengths of both to produce art quickly.  you could use illustrator effects to achieve a lot of this, or start with the pen tool or masks in photoshop, but if you can do that you probably don't need a tutorial from me.  1) in adobe illustrator, start a new document and use the pen tool to draw a geometric shape that is roughly the shape of your land mass.  it can just be simple angles and curves for now, you can always fix it later with the point tools (add/remove point under the pen tool, and the white arrow which selects individual nodes and lets you drag them).  2) apply effect &gt; distort and transform &gt; zig zag to the shape.  it gives your land mass a rough, staggered edge.  use a small size (in increments of .1in or .01in), low ridges-per-segment, and smooth points if you want the look like my image.  3) after you apply this effect, finish editing your shape.  i usually move a few points around with the white arrow to get rid of any awkward places created by the zig zag.  also, i use the knife tool to divide some shapes, then slide them around and away from each other with the black arrow to create islands and channels.  4) open photoshop, create a new document.  150-300dpi is fine for most print work, but when in doubt, higher resolution is better.  it's always possible to make it smaller... never bigger.  5) copy your shapes from illustrator and paste them in your ps document as a smart object.  move it around until it sits where you like it.  if you need to change something, you can actually edit source by right-clicking on the smart object in the layers panel.  it will open illustrator.  when you ""save"" in illustrator it will update your smart object.  make sure you're happy, since it'll be mostly raster from here on out.  if you want to move a landmass, you'll have to start over.  6) create two new layers.  using the magic wand tool, select your ocean if you have any.  with the ocean areas selected, i go layer &gt; layer mask &gt; reveal selection on one layer and name it ""ocean"".  use hide selection on the other and name it ""land"".    *masks add a black-and-white ""layer"" calculation onto your layers.  areas that are white in the mask will be opaque, and black transparent.  we created one empty layer where the land was transparent, and one empty layer where the ocean was transparent.  we'll duplicate these layers to do our work.  hide the smart object layer (click the eyeball).*  7) duplicate the ""ocean"" layer.  (always work with copies of these layers, that way you have an endless supply!)  use the paint bucket to fill the layer with a nice blue color.  notice only the ocean fills.  on the layers panel there should be a little ""fx"" button.  this is layer effects.  on your blue layer, add an inner shadow effect.  use a low opacity, a dark color, and a big size.  this should make the ocean shapes darker in the middle.  if the edges of the map don't get dark, don't worry, you can fix that later.  8) duplicate the ""land"" layer.  use whatever tool you like (i just use a big brush) to ""color"" in your landmass with color.  a nice cream color for snow, yellow-orange for deserts, and a bright medium green for plains.  i also used a dull green blob for a couple swamps.  make sure everything's colored in.  you can rearrange layers by dragging them around in the layer panel.  if you've only halfway colored-in some spots, just duplicate your duplicate, shift-click to select them both, then right-click to merge layers.  this will combine them together, adding them, filling in the translucent spaces.  note that this process destroys the ingredients, so to speak, so use wisely.  ctrl-alt-z is undo.  once it's done, add a stroke layer effect, inside, a couple pixels wide, black.  9) duplicate the ""land"" layer again, and get out a ""soft"" brush (one with hardness at 0%).  on this new layer draw some blobs where you want the mountains to be.  i used the colors of the surrounding terrain, then colored them in with a little red-brown in the middle.  to your mountain layer, apply the bevel and emboss &gt; texture layer effect.  you should see your mountains spring off the page, probably with a rainbow or bubble pattern.  pick a texture that makes your mountains suitably rocky, without upscaling the texture too much.  photoshop comes with a lot (you load in sets of them from a submenu) or google how to make your own.  since your brush was soft, the crackles created should fade around the edges.  now's a good time to go in with brushes, erasers and the smudge tool to make any adjustments.  10) duplicate land again.  pick a brush that's like a splotch, a bunch of tiny circles.  if you don't see them in the brush menu, load them in, or resign yourself to drawing a million tiny circles (or drawing some and copying them a buncha times).  blot out thick clouds of dark green dots where you want the forests to be.  add a drop shadow effect with a relatively high opacity (75%) and low distance (2-3px).  you might adjust the light direction to 0 degrees.  if you do, turn off global light first.  11) swamps were just dull green splotches, with some fancy texture brush blotting on some slightly-darker-dull-green splotches.  that's about it for actually drawing stuff, for now.  now to finish it up.  12) select all your visible layers (shift-click each one), duplicate them all (by right clicking on the group).  after they are duplicated, all the clones should be selected.  right click again, merge layers.  you now have a single layer that's a raster copy of the whole map.  you can generate an infinite number of these using this same process, so feel free to $$$$ it up with cheezy effects (which i will do shortly).  13) effects &gt; poster edges!  this one-shot photoshop effect is what makes my map look like it does, pretty much.  the big secret's out.  anyway, use a high posterization, and the other settings should be at or near 0.  14) get an image of a sheet of crumpled paper.  one with a moderate amount of textures and and contrast, and some color is ideal.  if it looks like it would have an old pirate treasure map drawn on it, it's probably a good choice.  make sure it's big enough (hi res).  copypaste that sucker into ps and move it's layer directly underneath your merged map layer.  15) select your merged map layer (the one above the paper image).  there should be a dropdown in the layers panel that says ""normal"".  these are blending modes.  each one uses different math algorithms to decide how pixels interact with the layers below them, like filters.  ""normal"" mode means that layers cover up each other.  switch it to ""linear burn"".  you should see the dark parts of the paper texture, along with some of the color, bleed through your map image.  oh, so close!  if it doesn't look quite right, also try putting the paper over top of the map itself, and either linear burning or multiplying it in.  16) duplicate the paper and map layers and hide everything else.  now it's time for preliminary post-production.  depending on what you drew and what paper image you got, it may help to do some adjustments.  *if the paper makes image dark, image &gt; adjustments &gt; brightness/contrast.  raise the brightness, lower the contrast.*  *if the colors look flat, bump up the saturation a tiny bit.  image &gt; adjustments &gt; hue/saturation.*  *play around with the various effects and adjustment sliders for 3 hours until you like the way it looks.  consider adding a small amount of noise or other texture to the map layer.*  *(i'm actually serious about the 3 hours thing.  getting pixels down in layers is actually pretty easy.  there's very little precision work in my procedure, i let tools and effects do the heavy lifting.  about 3/4 of the time is ""boring"" work.  finding hi-resolution textures for mountains, trying every combination of layer and blending mode + every combination of contrast and brightness + level adjustments to see what makes the paper come through ""just right"".  finding a quality paper image that works well.  quality in, quality out.  do side-by-side comparisons, research, trial and error, it's the best way to go).*  17) same story again... copy, and merge the copies.  key the map.  add another layer on top.  a black circle brush or square brush makes city dots.  the text tool on the page adds black text, which you can adjust, slide around, and apply shapes to using various tools.  now's your chance for any last edits on all the merged content.  take a 5 minute break, google some images and come back.  adjustments here should be minimal.  if something looks washed out, try using the shadow/highlights menu.  check increasing shadows and midtone contrast for some punch.  play with the range sliders and see how the shadows move, see what tickles your fancy.  18) final adjustments, maybe some overal post-production (adjusting levels, color balance, and maybe brightness/contrast) then save the psd.  then, save the file in your format of choice.",0,,

above the quality of shit.  different strokes.  anyway.  yea totally this.  get out and explore reddit.  these metareddits should get you started.  good luck op.  my suggestion is to either use the [reddit enhancement suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) +shortcut feature and add each link separately, or add each link to the dashboard.  for a portable solution (cross browser and mobile) make a new account for each link.  unsubscribe from the defaults, and subscribe to each of the fifty subscriptions per account.  it will keep your posts organized, and you won't cross the fifty

837015,"shira, it was called. its name had been whispered through the frigid winter air of shrine station 7, carried by polar winds. the moniker had touched the ear of every bureaucrat, vagabond and merchant, its neon letters cast upon the sides of a dozen monolithic buildings within the city proper. doubtless it had teased the minds of well-traveled citizens sojourning in the frozen outer world as well.  she exhaled lightly, carefully calculating the state of her consciousness. her mind a kindled fire, awoken to the cold, seemingly bereft of the evolutionary stasis of lesser humans. laid bare to the supreme potential of human thought, acutely aware of all sensory input.  a merchant vessel engaged its thrusters before her, violet jets swirling and spiraling out into tendrils which then coalesced into the evening light. it decelerated steadily, touching down atop wyvern co. curling snow storms near the city's edge reflected off her turquoise eyes. she shifted them downwards.  the station underbelly. a bustling hive of human drudgery. there, the poor toiled in near permanent shadow. shrine stations were primarily used for space ship and station production, though many jobs in the tech and trade sectors were available and often highly profitable on the outer worlds. a familiar glow reached her face, she lifted her gaze. the suns were low in the sky, making their lazy descent to the horizon.  kyo was often called ""the world on the rim"". it was an arctic wasteland with a radius of nearly seven tenths that of mother earth's. the binary star system the planet orbited resulted in peculiar day and night cycles. at nine astronomical units from its parent dwarf stars, the light was dim and cold, reflecting off the glass and steel station, seemingly never reaching the city's foundation.  ""what could it be?"", she whispered, gazing back downwards to the gloom hundreds of feet below. a shimmer in the darkness caught her eye, shifted her frame of view. she had heard of onthea, glimpsed a brief holographic projection of its late home world but had never understood. the ontheans arrived in the solar system 411 earth years ago by enigmatic means. interstellar travel was available to wealthy merchant corporations, though still rare. neighboring solar systems contained little of value. their planets had all been stripped of any worth, left orbiting endlessly in disequilibrium. the enormous variable costs of extracting minerals from other star systems made it a perilous venture. through spectroscopic analysis of light passing through planetary atmospheres, the elemental composition of nearly all macrocosms in the milky way had been probed and recorded. no star system contained highly evolved, sentient life. but here they were.   they were assimilated into human society after extensive communication with the central human government revealed the loss of their planet. over the past four centuries, they have carved out a living as manual laborers in shrine stations. the rich humans pay them no mind. many poor humans have grown close to ontheans due to the proximity in which they work, however.  a yellow arc stretched out of the gloom momentarily, stinging her eyes. the index finger and thumb of her right hand gently touched and massaged her eyelids as she inhaled. she shook her head softly then turned from the building's edge, strode towards the glass threshold of her living quarters.  four violet pills lay on the glass counter top near the far door. to her right lay a small alcove containing various mason jars, filled to the brim with brightly colored capsules. cyan was the nutritional capsules, light green the vitamins and pale red a sort of cure-all for common viruses. the stark white walls matched her clothing and gave her flat a simple, pleasant atmosphere. her sitting room smelled of lavender, a comforting remnant of mother earth. though she had never been, the smell spoke to something meaningful within her.  swallowing a cyan pill, she reposed on the one chair in her apartment, gazing at the empty holovision. though shira was expensive, her enjoyment at entering this advanced state of consciousness made it worth the while. she laid her head back, pondering. perhaps these pills were the only reason to stay in shrine station 7. they were researched and developed here by hord, the heavenward onthean research and development company. though she was generally distrustful of onthean companies, it had passed the rigorous inspection process of the central human government from the inner worlds. those who could afford shira, bought it. those who couldn't, desired it. even politicians used the pills, and why wouldn't they? the increased mental capacity offered by shira was remarkable and quite useful, though short-lived.  a familiar sound broke the silence and she lifted her head. the holovision, sensing a movement of her arm, came to life, projecting three-dimensional figures over a circular table fixture in her living room. her turquoise eyes scanned the scene, recognizing a prime minister from the inner worlds. he spoke of ongoing events on the urban planets and industrial moons inside the asteroid belt. the brief war with quasi-intelligent life on a nearby moon had ended, meaning corporations such as wyvern co. and hartell would soon begin their colonization, polluting its meager atmosphere. the ontheans had assisted us in the extermination process, yielding many sentences of praise from the prime minister.  the shira was beginning to wear off. she felt her heart slow, her mind no longer processing vast quantities of sensory data. only the echoing clang of metal from the underbelly reached her living quarters, soft though it was this many feet above the ground. burnt orange tendrils of light stretched wearily across the horizon, weaving with the blue light of the companion star, both slowly fading into blackness. her head rested precariously on the back of the chair as she slowly drifted off into the deep cosmic darkness only shira could provide.  ---  a gentle shift in equilibrium awoke her. delicately opening her eyes, her head hanging uncomfortably to the left, she felt a tug on her right arm. eyes adjusting to the light, she found her arms bound, interlocked with a tall, black-robed figure on either side. she whipped her head backwards, pulled at both of the figures to her left and right, her legs flailing helplessly. they offered no response. she fought back a wave of blackness in her mind, a thick blanket being pulled over her senses. struggling to stay conscious, she realized she could not move, realized her head was still hanging to the left. had she not pulled at these mysterious figures? had she not flailed her legs? she felt a movement deep in her soul, couldn't place it. she felt herself lurch forward briefly. or did she? attempting to pull back the drape of darkness numbing her mind, she made a futile attempt to speak. from her frozen position, she scanned the scene. she was moving downwards. the figures' robes were gilded in gold trim. mysterious shapes and symbols covered the gold embroidery, hands hidden deep within the vestments. a final attempt to pull free of their grasp consumed her remaining energy. the deep cosmic darkness enveloped her world, pulling her somewhere, somewhere she felt herself simultaneously drawn to and repulsed by. down.  ---  the freezing wind bit at her cheeks, leaving ice in her amber eyelashes. the sensation felt foggy, otherworldly. a suppressing cold consumed her mind. as if waking from hypersleep, she slowly felt the thick black veil withdraw. the cold was relentless. the clang of metal on metal filled her ears, louder now than before. opening her eyes, she saw only cold blackness. desolate, cold blackness. her arms were still interwoven with two shambling, robed men, now dragging her forward. her senses returned slowly, working their way from her head downwards. she felt her wrists resting upon each other, bound behind her. ankles tied, feet bloodied from being dragged. she tried lifting her head to no avail. out of her weary eyes, a cold blue glow drew nearer. she noticed a gathering of robed figures ahead, steel structures arranged around and above them. the sounds of clashing metal filled her ears. there was also a hum, something distant and drowned out.  she was dropped to her knees, chin resting on her chest. her white clothes were now muddied and soiled, half-frozen and sticking to her skin. shivering violently, she attempted to survey the scene once more. she strained them upwards, towards the blue glow. there, an alien creation rose out of kyo. the monolith was cylindrical in the form of connected circles reaching higher and higher into the frozen sky, inscribed all over with golden markings and glowing a pale blue. a semi-circle of similarly bound humans surrounded her, heads resting on their chests, arranged carefully beneath the monolith. the hum was much louder now. a robed figure eclipsed part of the light, stepping out to the center of the semi-circle, face shrouded in shadow by a gold-embroidered cowl. the figure lowered its head and raised its arms out to the side. its low voice echoed off of the steel structures, reverberated through her thoughts as the deep cosmic darkness slowly overtook her mind.

**cryophobia** fear of extreme cold. cold – unending, heart-piercing cold – that slices through skin and muscle like a gleaming, razor-edged dagger until it penetrates bone and fills your marrow: white eucalyptus, frosted mint, raw frankincense, davana, iris petal, white grapefruit, and wormwood.  - **deipnophobia** fear of dinner conversations. wine spilled across freshly pressed table linens, a wilted holiday bouquet, and a furtive hint of whiskey and baked bread.  - **ecclesiophobia** fear of church. suffocating clouds of shroud-thick frankincense and myrrh, sepulchral tolu balsam, black labdanum, and a sin-sick thread of jasmine sambac.  - **pediophobia** fear of dolls. (but not ventriloquist dummies. that’s an entire phobia unto itself.) white porcelain cracked by white tobacco, threads of brittle cognac, and vanilla filigree.  - **pognophobia** fear of beards. definitely bad news if you live in silverlake, williamsburg, or the mission. a tangle of patchouli, upcycled leather, artisanal honey, and a couple of oils you’ve probably never heard of.  - **soceraphobia** fear of parents-in-law. a scent of judgement and scorn: blackened vetiver, smug vanilla, and a dismissive, sneering dribble of black coffee.  - **tyrannophobia** fear of tyrants. this has jack all to do with yule or winter, but it sure does apply to current events. proceeds from tyrannophobia benefit the aclu, thereby helping stem the imminent assault on civil rights. birch tar, tea leaf, and black raspberry strangled in an iron fist.  #single notes  - **actual lump of coal**  - **community church manger hay**  - **crumpled wrapping paper**  - **discarded popcorn garland**  - **drunk uncle**  - **fiber-optic illuminated aluminum christmas tree with gen-u-ine pine scent**  - **gelt-smeared dreidel**  - **limited edition action figure**  - **mud-mingled boot slush**  - **musty santa costume**  - **rapidly solidifying mashed potatoes**",0,,

728350,"looking about and taking it all in i tell philemon it was great, and thanks very much for the tour. he says he thought i wanted to see the whole of hell, i said i did and was there more, he assured me there was and cast an image into my mind of serried ranks kneeling in the oriental prayer position. tall spires of ash on their shoulders and heads, balancing on the balls of both feet and their knees, straight backed, hands on thighs palms downward, fingers together, resembling the statues in a thai temple.  just where they could be i did not know and he says to follow him, and back thru the first circle past satan, the tree and the swordsman, past sisyphus straining up the incline with his stone, across the desert and back into the fire cave. down past the place of judgment and explosions of fire every forty seconds or so, thumbs up to the faun racking them up, then down between the vast flaming stacks of burning bodies to the nether part of hell. as we move further from the front so too are the bodies burnt down, past the yellow green burners at the front, to charred corpses further in, then burnt charred corpses with just flickering blue flame and human coals, and on to a place where the bodies are mere cinders. blackened and burned beyond recognition, a guard here tries to block ones way, i sidestep him and he fades away.  at this place a huge four armed being dismantles the stacks of charred cinder corpses, those he takes in his right pair of arms, reconstructing the body in his marvelously dexterous hands, join with a blue green flying creature that has appeared from somewhere. the charred metallic body of the sinner crumbles to dust, revealing only the bright white pure human soul, they rush together and embrace. their union sealed in a blinding flash of arclight, fading to reveal a composite white robed flying creature, which then departs this place at a rate of knots. those he takes in his left pair of hands likewise reconstructed, they too put on their best face, as the blue green flying creature appears, the giant four armed being gives him the option of reconstructing with the newly raised from the fire human soul. the blue green angel lets out a scream of outrage and horror, and flies out of the place like a bat out of hell, no mistaking that at all.  thus in place in the two left hands of the angel of the second judgment, philemon did tell me his name which i have forgotten, he is a pretty cool guy, not withstanding he looks a bit like a snake just jutting up out of the ground with his four arms. he has a moustache and a part in his hair, and looks a bit like sir richard hadlee the great new zealand sportsman. so the fella in his two left hands is placed alongside another of his kind, they are in a column of six, like the chain of women in the outer darkness, some unseen mechanism is causing the column to move like a snake, of its own volition taking the men backwards out of the fire chamber. thru and beyond another overhang and out into a volcanic place, where red hot volcanic cinders alight like snow upon their heads and shoulders, until they resemble the statues in a thai temple with spires of ash on heads and shoulders, then only their faces and eyes are visible as the ash buries them. on downward and on deeper into hell, the time for remorse long gone, the underground column comes to a trip place, here the bodies do a one eighty pivot, the men are now facing forward as the column of the damned wends downward, and here in this place of dust and ash do the fallen sleep.  nor yet is their journey thru hell over, deeper and deeper goes the column of six and its company of snoring losers, two weeks pass on earth and the column intersects an underground stream. here in this place of water and steam, where the pious man looks toward heaven, bitter and beaten, a witness of failure and dashed hope. for here, in vindication of the prophesy of john the baptist, that …all flesh shall know the salvation of god, the damned are raised. attendants, two of them, two hundred kilo individuals, like funny parody drawings of, of all things cherubs, subcutaneous fat and tiny little wings on an overgrown wrestlers body. one reaches out his hand where the column goes over a hump and the ranks open out, takes the hand of the soul of the sinner. he has been in the eastern prayer position for as many weeks, and while this is an elegant pose it produces physical agony after only a short while. he assists him up, then massages him up and down the legs, toweling down his upper body with a rag cloth he keeps over his shoulder. the sinner is an ancient walter brennan type, you gotta believe just how old this man is, never would anybody really encounter any person on earth this old.  old or not and notwithstanding his double trip thru hell, he is jaunty and full of witticisms toward the demon attendant. he thinks he is still in hospital, and tells the demon about this really vivid dream he was having until woken. the attendant has heard it all before and mumbles something, he has massaged both legs and feet, done his upper body and arms with the towel, which he dips into a stone basin of water then wrings out and does his face and ears. walter is still chattering away and the wrestler hands him up to his brother, who is up a couple of steps on another landing, as he passes from one brother to the other, so does a shiver of white light commence from the brother's fingertips and right thru the newly resurrected sinners body, until he is fully up on the landing. once more a young man in the full vigor of youth, the guard directs him to a then unknown destination.  the next sinner freed is a wizened little bloke, could have been a gunslinger in the wild west, mouth just a slit and cold eyes, untalkative he is toweled down and rubbed, he thanks the attendant who passes him on to his brother. the next a dyak head hunter maybe, from the island nation of borneo, an incredibly old little dark skinned man, seems happy to be going. i pass with him onto the next level and he approaches a gate, beyond the gate his extended family, his grandfather, his mother, and his brothers and sisters are overjoyed to have him back. the next there is a caucasian youth, his beautiful wife and children, their features indistinct from my perspective greet him… the column of annealed metallic corpses progresses a little further on, till they are ground to atoms tumbling into an ash whirlpool, resembling a bottomless pit.  xiv  that's hell. the second judgment in the outer darkness is much the same, the girls progress right thru hell till they come to a body builder who has a horn trumpet attached to a thong around both wrists, that makes two trumpets in all. when their time comes, the succubus that emerged at the first judgment has drained all the goodness out of their body, which has gone up the umbilical cord and has nurtured him. the umbilical cord snaps, and the faun critter has become a blue green angel, identical to the angels that say yea or nay at the second judgment at the fire. the body builder… like this guy is built, is mostly indistinct. the guards in the darkness are a more reserved group than their counterparts in the fire, in that his light which shines from a disc of light above his head is most often very dim. he interviews the newly emerged blue green angel and, depending upon the response, raises either the trumpet horn in his left hand blowing b flat, signaling that there will be no removal. or yet he raises the right trumpet horn and blows d.  then the released human spirit, standing at the place of judgment like an intact venus de milo, risen from a terrible waste of corpse debris and the angel embrace. within the arclight their union produces the robed figure of a flying angel, who does not waste any time leaving. the losers collapse and so does the floor receive them, losing all human shape now and like a procession of bright white maggots, do they make their way toward a place where they will tumble down out of the main body of hell and be buried in freezing cold volcanic ash. down until they are liberated as the ashy medium intersects an underground body of water, then they are washed out of the ash, over a waterfall and into a pool of water. here they thaw, and dive and plunge about this strange limbo world, till they drag themselves up a cinder beach and flop down like seals. the two demon attendants here resemble asterix the gaul, in the european comic strip of that name, in that they are armored from the waist up and fully helmeted, against the amorous passions of the newly resurrected women. their eyes visible thru a horizontal slot in their helmets, handing the girls onto the next level, the white light tingles over their skin, and they arrive on that level once more in human form, as beautiful young women. stark bollicky naked however, picture koika at the winter palace.  up the path a bit and a high arched bridge, below just cloud across and a gateway, no gates on the hinges however, just inside a dress shop with diamond shaped crystal panes in the windows, here the chicks get a dress to wear. this girl chose a short sleeve blue and white full length dress with a modest neckline, that would not have been out of place among the amish communities of pennsylvania, past the shop a family group. a young man in the group, a clean limbed type, seems a tad self conscious among so many people he does not know, then erupting from the group's center a black shape, nor yet human but beast, carnivore tongue extended and feral teeth exposed, this is a puppy dog of the poodle variety…",0,,

157057,"i tried to narrow down my top ten beers that i had for the first time in 2010, but could only get it down to my top 15.  of course this is just beers i had for the first time in 2010; not sure how i could possibly name my favorite:  orval - everything else here is a bit more rare.  it's hard for me to believe i had this for the first time less than a year ago.  this is my favorite trappist ale, and an aged one might be my favorite beer.  petrus aged pale - extremely sour without the harshness of some beers with that level of acidity (i don't think everyone would agree with that).   de dolle oerbier reserva 2007 - extremely complex sour, malty, fruity.  i could have easily put 3 more de dolle beers on this list (export stout, bos keun, ara bier) but i'll stick to this one.  the only de dolle i had before 2010 was dulle teve (mad bitch), but now it's probably my favorite belgian brewery.  russian river temptation - beautiful strong blonde ale soured and aged in french oak chardonnay barrels.  the first sip at monk's kettle (san fransisco) was a revelation.  russian river mustache cuvée - a special blend from one of the bartenders at rr brewpub of temptation and supplication (brown ale aged and soured in french oak pinot noir barrels with sour cherries).  you get the acidity of the temptation with the richer maltiness and fruitiness of the supplication.  cascade bailey's quadratic formula - a single keg brewed for bailey's taproom (portland, or) barrelfest in july.  a blend of several of cascade's sours, this was a brown ale that was pretty fruity with nice caramel undertones and a beautiful, mild sourness.  awesome.  cascade vlad the imp-aler - a sour pale on steroids, this one is relatively thick and strong (10.6%) for the style, lots of sourness but backed up by good maltiness that somehow doesn't really come off as a lot of sweetness.  had this on tap at the new cascade barrel house a few weeks ago and it replaced rr temptation as my favorite american wild.  brought a bottle to the porter nye to share where they happened to have allagash interlude (one of my other favorite american sours) on tap.  drinking them back to back it was unanimous from 6 of us that the cascade was easily the better beer.  hair of the dog doggie claws 2002 - by far the best barley wine i've had.  i don't even know what would approach it.  we got talking to the manager at brouwer's cafe in seattle and after a few hours he pulled it out and opened it up to share with us.  hair of the dog cherry adam - also at the bailey's barrelfest.  adam is an unbelievable strong, dark ale, and this is adam aged with cherries in bourbon barrels.  it's intense, complex, boozy.  wish i could have had more.  hair of the dog peach fred - somehow hotd made my list 3 times.  there's a reason they're held in such high regard in portland.  fred is a great strong pale, and here it's aged in bourbon barrels with peaches for 17 months.   there were actually little chunks of peach in it.  slightly winey, somehow rich and light, a little tart.  only available at the brewpub.  founders kentucky breakfast stout - somehow manages to live up to the hype.  three floyds dark lord imperial stout 2008 - i figured this would be one of those legendary beers i probably wouldn't get a chance to try, but a few months ago a guy visiting from the midwest pulls out a bottle of 2008 dark lord he wanted to share.  delicious and shockingly drinkable for 15%.  jolly pumpkin maracaibo especial - i love jolly pumpkin, but some of their beers start to taste like each other after you've had a few.  this one really stands out. extremely complex brown ale beer brewed with cocoa, cinnamon, and orange peel.  the subtle bitter cocoa and orange melded together beautifully.  there was graham cracker on the nose from the brett along with some funk and acidity in the flavor.  hitachino red rice - this one seems temperamental, with some kegs being one of my favorite beers and others being like rotten vegetables.  fortunately the first time i had it was a good keg.  this is brewed with malt and rice, which means that besides ale yeast, hitachino also uses a sake yeast to process the rice.  it tastes like a mixture of sake, flemish sour, and belgian pale.  some funk, lactic sour, doughy sake yeast, light citrus, maraschino cherry, a little sweet, and nice prickly carbonation.  great, complex, refreshing beer.  or a drain pour if you get a bad one.  block 15 figgy pudding olde stock - block 15's figgy pudding (english old ale brewed with english pale &amp; specialty malts &amp; molasses and fermented with london ale yeast, matured in brandy barrels before conditioning with mission figs, ceylon cinnamon and nutmeg) taken a step further by aging it longer in brandy barrels with british brettanomyces, a very mild, wild yeast.  maybe the perfect holiday ale.",0,,

875065,"yeah, i've actually posted the entire recipe in a comment before.  lemme find it.  it's one of dan lepard's.  edit:  here it is, copied from when i posted it about a month ago.  ..second reply while drunk...  i decided to go ahead and post this recipe while i remember. hopefully no one is offended that i am basically copying verbatim lepard's recipe.  although if interested, it is from [the cook's book](http://www.amazon.com/cooks-book-jill-norman/dp/0756613027/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=utf8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211244756&amp;sr=8-1), which is an absolutely excellent culinary tutorial.  so anyway...  for the initial mixture:  4 tsp unbleached white or whole-wheat high-gluten bread flour or rye flour  2 tsp live plain yogurt  3 1/2 tbsp water at 65-68 degrees f  1 tbsp organic raisins (optional, provides more sugar for the yeast)  for the daily refreshment  unbleached white or whole-wheat high-gluten bread flour or rye flour, depending on what bread you want to make.  step one:  measure all the ingredients for the initial mixture into a one pint jar with a lid and stir them together vigorously with a fork. cover the jar with it's lid, then leave for a day at room temperature.  step two:  the next day, bacteria and yeasts will have begun to multiply, yet all you will see is a glassy layer of liquid over the solid matter. measure 4 tsp of your chosen flour and 3 1/2 tbsp water into the jar, stir vigorously, and replace the lid. leave again until the following day.  step 3:  on day 3, look for the odd tiny bubble on the surface of the mixture. this is the beginning of fermentation. again, add 4 tsp flour and 3 1/2 tbsp water to the jar, stir vigorously, and replace the lid. leave until the following day.  step 4:  by day 4, the mixture will be getting energetic and will benefit from a higher ratio of new ingredients to old leaven. stir the mixture, then tip three-fourths to four-fifths out (throw this away). add about 1/2 cup (100g) water to the jar. stir vigorously, then add 3/4 cup (100g) flour and stir vigorously again. the mixture will look like a thick batter. replace the lid and leave until the following day.  step 5: on day 5, bubble of fermentation will appear on the surface. repeat the procedure followed on day 4, then put the lid back on and leave until the following day.  step 6: from day 6 on, the mixture will be able to raise a dough, but it will take many more times for complex flavors to emerge. repeat the day-4 procedure each day for the following 2-4 days. you will notice the aroma becoming sharper every day. after 8-10 days, you will have a healthy leaven that you can use.  for the actual bread  4 oz natural leaven (above)  7/8 cup water at 72f  1 tsp fine sea salt  2 1/2 cups unbleached high-gluten bread flour  olive oil  step 1: early in the morning, combine leaven and water, mixing it with your fingers. in a large bowl, mix the salt with the flour, stirring well with a spoon.  step 2: tip the leaven mixture into the flour and, using your hands, mix it quickly and evenly to make a soft, sticky dough. cover the bowl and leave for 10 minutes. the dough temperature should be about 68f (20c).  step 3: spoon 1-2 tsp oil onto the top of the dough and rub it all over the surface. turn the bowl over and scrape the dough onto an oiled surface. knead the dough, repeating after 10 and 20 minutes, then cover and leave it for 30 minutes at room temp.  step 4: fold the dough by thirds, and repeat this every hour for 3-4 hours. each time, return it either to a bowl or tray, seam side down, and cover. at the three hour mark, cut a deep slash into the surface of the dough to check the aeration. if you can see a good network of air bubbles, it can be shaped.  step 5: line a basket or bowl with a dish towl rubbed thickly with rye flour. shape the dough into a round loaf or a baton. place it seam side up in the towel, cover, and let rise until almost doubled in height.  step 6: preheat the oven to 425f (220c). sprinkle a little semolina or flour on a baking sheet (i use the stone here), then place the dough onto it, rounded side up. slash the surface of the loaf, then lightly spray it with water. bake for 20 minutes. reduce the heat to 375f (190c) and continue baking until the loaf is golden brown and feels light in weight, 15-20 minutes longer.  step 7: let the bread cool on a wire rack. when cool, wrap in wax or parchment paper and store in a bread box.  end  anyway, this recipe is awesome, and the book is awesome. everyone should buy it.",0,,

262084,"i got a few products at sephora to get my birthday haul, and i had my make up artist friend to help me pick out products! i only really bought two things but i'm pretty happy with them, even if i spent way more money on a powder than i thought i would. i've used the products for just a day so these are initial thoughts.       -----            **hourglass ambient powder in dim light**   on darker skin tones this would probably be better as a highlight, but for medium skin tones this is a great all-over powder. i can't really explain how it makes the skin all pretty, and it's hard to capture with a crappy cel camera, but man, i cannot stop staring at the swatch on my arm or the skin on my face. the $45 price tag gave me pause, but once i saw it on my face i had to have it. is this how people feel about the guerlain meteorites? coz if so, i might have to try those out next.  applied heavily, dim light would also be a great browbone or cheekbone highlight, or even a decent ""natural"" eyeshadow. it says it is neutral, but i feel like it's ever so slightly cooler. on my skin it doesn't really matter, but if you're warmer than me, it might look a bit off.  i played around with the other powders at sephora too, and here is my and my mua friend's take: luminous light is way too shimmery and light for all over. it's more of a highlight shade, unless you have super pale and super dry skin. radiant is very warm and glittery--it could almost be a bronzer on fair skin, but on my medium skin it just looked too glittery. mood is way too pinky for me, but for cooler skin tones, it would be great. diffused was my second favorite--it glows wonderfully, the yellow tone is very flattering, and it can work for light to medium skin. i only didn't get this because i just liked the look of dim light more for some reason. ethereal is also pretty good and not too shimmery, but i found that it showed up too light on my skin, so it's an all-over for fair to light skintones and more of a highlight for medium to dark skin.  **tarte amazonian clay 12-hour full coverage foundation in medium**  i love the coverage and the color is pretty close to hg, but it oxidized eeeever so slightly too pink. i might be able to fix that with a more yellow-greenish powder on top (like my current fav, everyday minerals olive medium), but if that doesn't work, i might need to return it. :( damn my weird toned skin!  **benefit watt's up mini**  i know people love high beam, but i think i like watt's up is much better! i feel like the warmer golden tones suit me better, although high beam isn't bad on me. i tried it applied heavily as a cream eyeshadow and as a highlight, and it worked beautifully both ways. it did crease on my lids, but primer underneath should fix the problem.  **benefit they're real**  my mua friend hadn't seen this mascara up close (he uses more ""traditional"" mascara brushes like i do) and he said it looked like an instrument of torture, lol. i've been leery of trying this mascara because my lashes don't usually do well with spiky plastic applicators. i've mentioned before that i have a lot of lash hairs, but they're short and thin, and most plastic or rubber brushes make them clump together and look weird instead of full and natural. well, unfortunately, the same problem happened with the brush in this product. instead of separating my lashes, it made them rather clumpy and fake-looking. not very nice for everyday wear, but for cosplay where i do need my lashes to look fake, this would work well. i will say though, that the spiky end is *awesome* at getting the itty bitty lashes at the corners of my eye. however, with the rest of the lashes, i need a thicker, bristly brush that separates and almost combs out my lashes instead. if anyone has tips for using this brush, i'd love to hear them! otherwise, i might try the formula with one of my old mascara wands to see if that helps things (i wash out and keep my favorites, haha).  ------- well, that ran longer than expected for initial thoughts! but hopefully the reviews helped. :)",1,1,0

453941,"lorenna mckennitt did an [excellent musical rendition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvkbpr71dha) of it. a couple stanzas were changed slightly, and a couple others were eliminated entirely.  here's the full alfred noyes version;  the wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,  the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,  the road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,  and the highwayman came riding—  riding—riding—  the highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.  he'd a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,  a coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;  they fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!  and he rode with a jewelled twinkle,  his pistol butts a-twinkle,  his rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,  and he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;  he whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there  but the landlord's black-eyed daughter,  bess, the landlord's daughter,  plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.  and dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked  where tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;  his eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,  but he loved the landlord's daughter,  the landlord's red-lipped daughter,  dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—  'one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i'm after a prize to-night,  but i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;  yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,  then look for me by moonlight,  watch for me by moonlight,  i'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.'  he rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,  but she loosened her hair i' the casement! his face burnt like a brand  as the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;  and he kissed its waves in the moonlight,  (oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!)  then he tugged at his rein in the moonliglt, and galloped away to the west.  he did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;  and out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,  when the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,  a red-coat troop came marching—  marching—marching—  king george's men came matching, up to the old inn-door.  they said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,  but they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;  two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!  there was death at every window;  and hell at one dark window;  for bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride.  they had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;  they had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!  'now, keep good watch!' and they kissed her.  she heard the dead man say—  look for me by moonlight;  watch for me by moonlight;  i'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!  she twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!  she writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood!  they stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years,  till, now, on the stroke of midnight,  cold, on the stroke of midnight,  the tip of one finger touched it! the trigger at least was hers!  the tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!  up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,  she would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;  for the road lay bare in the moonlight;  blank and bare in the moonlight;  and the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain .  tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! had they heard it? the horse-hoofs ringing clear;  tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear?  down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,  the highwayman came riding,  riding, riding!  the red-coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still!  tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!  nearer he came and nearer! her face was like a light!  her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,  then her finger moved in the moonlight,  her musket shattered the moonlight,  shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  he turned; he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood  bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!  not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear  how bess, the landlord's daughter,  the landlord's black-eyed daughter,  had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,  with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!  blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,  when they shot him down on the highway,  down like a dog on the highway,  and he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.  and still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,  when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,  when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,  a highwayman comes riding—  riding—riding—  a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard;  he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;  he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there  but the landlord's black-eyed daughter,  bess, the landlord's daughter,  plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.",1,-1,1

635856,"&gt;the literature of the middle ages does attest to an awareness of differences in skin color, but these differences were seen as existing largely between individuals rather than between races. descriptions of human complexion as ""white,"" ""brown"" or ""black"" would correspond in modern usage to ""fair,"" ""tan"" or ""swarthy."" medieval europeans had no awareness of belonging to a ""white"" race, if only for want of contact with other races.  &gt;this ignorance made them more sensitive to color differences among themselves, particularly between the sexes. although about only a tenth of the difference separating blacks from whites, there does exist a perceptible dissimilarity in pigmentation between men and women. male skin has more melanin and hemoglobin than does female skin, i.e., men are browner and ruddier; women, paler.  &gt;my own research, and that of pierre van den berghe, suggests that race-based attitudes to skin color grew out of a pre-existing matrix constructed around the differing complexions of men and women. in medieval romances, a fair complexion was deemed an essential mark of womanhood, the heroine being invariably compared to snow, ivory, ermine, swans, starlight, or briar blossoms. attitudes to male skin color seem to have been more ambivalent. a man was considered handsome if fair-skinned; yet manly and courageous, if ""brown."" the tenth token of a knight of ""strong corage"" was that he be of ""broun coloure in al the body."" many noble english knights were named ""the broun.""

157135,"if you want to wear makeup, learn your face and how makeup works. by all means you are allowed to do your makeup however pleases you. but i find that a few simple things can really change how good it looks.   sorry about this wall of text, i like to think it's formatted to be a little easier to read. words are bolded and italicized so you can skip around to what you want.   not for all women i suppose, but for my makeup-wearers.  * **learn your color.** sometimes it changes. if you stay out of the sun most of the time and are caucasian, you're probably going to be in the paler sections. i know, they look so white! but if you go for something a little darker because you want to stay away from that ""whiteness"", you're going to look orangeish and it doesn't matter how well you blend, you could be the best makeup blender in the world,  it will still be glaringly noticeable.  if you spend a lot of time in the sun in the summer, you're going to get a little tan. go buy yourself a good color for those summer months. it will be different than your normal, by at least 1 shade.  (the same applies to lighter or darker olive, asian and brown tones. there's a color for you! don't go too dark or too light.) if you're naturally tan or darker, don't go for the pale ivory shade, don't go near that side of the foundations and cover ups and powders. just like lighter tones shouldn't go near the darker sides. hold a few selections up to your face in the mirror. you might not get it right at first, i sure didn't. (i went too dark for my little irish face in the beginning.) that's okay. you'll get it. we learn by doing.  * focus on your **eye color**. i truly believe that there are *not* ""specific"" colors that you *have to use* if you have blue eyes, or green eyes, or brown eyes, or any of that. but it is true that purple and blue make *brown* stand out, grey, silver, purple and brown make *green* stand out, orange is the opposite of blue on the color wheel, so if you have baby *blues*, try it for a bit of contrast! blue eyed gals can also try browns, tans, and whites, pinks and of course, purples. gold, brown, green and dark purple will make *hazel* eyes pop. mess with your eye shadow, see what happens. what you like matters. for example, my favorite eyeshadow is a bright dark blue, and i have brown eyes. some people might think it's tacky, but i like it. if you don't like eyeshadow at all, go for that!   * **lipstick.** if you don't like it, don't wear it! there is no rule that says you have to. this is important. for instance, i love the look of lipstick, but i hate how it feels. i usually don't wear it. if you are going to wear lipstick, such as with the foundation, learn your color. this doesn't mean you can't wear whatever the hell you want, because i look terrible in red lipstick but i still wear it sometimes. but it does make me self conscious because i know it isn't my color. *i have very, very pale skin and dark hair and dark eyes. for me personally, my preferred color is a dark, rich pink.* it's not too much, but not too little. *blondes with blue eyes* usually pull off *bright red* best. girls with *black hair and olive skin* generally look good with a *dark red.* *light-brunettes with olive skin and dark eyes* wear *nude shades* best. experiment with lipstick. you'll know what color is good and what is bad. if you're unsure, ask people. ask your friends, ""does this color look good on me? be honest."" if you're going to make a habit of wearing lipstick, invest also in some *lip liner* that *matches.* you'll be amazed at how clean and beautiful a good outline can make your lips look. (*for those who don't know how exactly: put on your lipstick, then carefully trace the edges of your lips with the corresponding liner, filling in any little parts that you missed with the lipstick.*)   don't forget to blot some of it off so it doesn't get on absolutely everything you eat/drink. take a piece of toilet paper or a napkin, fold it, put it between your lips and push them against it. when you take the paper out, it should have a perfect little kiss on it. throw it away. ta da! beautiful.  * **eyebrows.** this is up to you. eyebrows are very important and they are how you convey your emotion and they frame your lovely eyes. people will most likely always have your eyebrows in their line of vision while talking directly to you. if you pluck (i do) find a shape you like. *try to follow your natural shape as much as possible.* don't go in tearing a bunch of hairs out, follow the shape of your eyebrow, plucking a few ""strays"" along the way, and keep going until you are satisfied. don't ""shape"" from the top of your eyebrows!!! if you are going to touch the top at all, it should be to remove a few crazy hairs and *that is it.* trust me. i waxed from the top when i was younger, it was a complete disaster. focus on the bottom. this is where your arch is, what you are trying to shape.  as for filling, you can go for a pencil or shadow. i use a medium brown shadow and an angled brush to darken and fill mine in a little bit because my natural hair color is a bit lighter than my current and i don't like that my hair and eyebrows don't match. *don't dye your eyebrows unless it is done by a professional. i'm serious.* if you want a bold brow, you can opt for a pencil. but you should probably get real good at filling before you do that, i know a girl who has a long way to go and uses a pencil that is much too dark, and every time i see her i have to keep my hands at my sides to prevent myself from reaching out and wiping her brows off so i can fix them. *there are tons of videos on the internet about filling in your brows, just google it!* a well made-up face looks strange when the eyebrows are not done.  * **eyeliner.** eyeliner, eyeliner, eyeliner!!! i can't even talk about eyeliner. don't go too thick, sometimes it looks good on the top lid only, but never on the bottom lid only. very rarely. line your waterline if you want to, (i don't, because it makes my eyes look smaller.) if you are going to line your lash line instead, get good at it. otherwise i've heard it been described as a ""weird belt."" i use a small amount of black eyeshadow on a very thin brush on my bottom lash line, and an eyeliner pencil on my top lid, right next to the lash line. get as close as you can, it might take a few tries. *try not to pull on your skin near your eye too much while applying it.** i know it's hard.   * **mascara.** curl your lashes if you can! (the top ones.) this will make the effort you put into your mascara *noticeable*!!! it brings your lashes up and out, so they are showing in contrast against your skin instead of just sticking straight out curving slightly like they usually do. this hides them a bit when someone is looking at you dead on. they won't be hidden if you curl them. *curl before applying mascara.* or your wet lashes will get stuck to your curler and you'll pull some out. open your curler and put it against your lash line, so your eyelashes are in between the two metal parts. line it up snuggly against the line, but not too close or you'll pinch yourself. close and hold for a few seconds. *don't crush them* or they will look kinked instead of curled. wipe a little of your mascara against the opening of the tube, so when you apply it, it won't be too thick, then your lashes won't be clumpy. blink *slightly* down onto the brush while moving it upwards. *lightly.* this will prevent clumps. after they have dried, move em around a little with your fingers. clumps don't look good.  * **enjoy your pretty face! with or without makeup!** this is most important.",1,1,1

450827,"howdy everyone, i’m back with my reviews 9 through 15, after posting my first 8 around 6 months [ago](http://reddit.com/r/scotch/comments/1hgzkj/my_first_8_reviews/).   let’s just dig right in, shall we?              **glenmorangie original** (*single malt, highland, 70cl, 40% abv*)    tasted: first dram from a new bottle that belonged to someone that my sister was house-sitting for. she swore up and down he wouldn’t mind if we opened it. (i’m not so certain, and i still feel bad about it. :/)    colour: pale gold, reminiscent of tequila.    nose: citrus, something vaguely similar to honey, oak.    palate: oranges, roasted almonds, vanilla, maybe some oak in there somewhere.    finish: none really to speak of. it seems to dissipate immediately, and leaves only the vague taste of dry white wine and/or oak.    conclusion: i had the opportunity to try this one with some friends while on vacation—i don’t own the bottle and am better off for it. **70/100**.    **glenmorangie madeira wood finish** (*single malt, highland, 70cl, 43% abv, no age statement*)    tasted: a dram poured from a bottle brought back from the uk by a friend. (they went to scotland, only bought scotch at the airport. &gt;.&gt;)  colour: reddish amber.    nose: citrus, christmas and fruitcake, grapefruit and brown sugar.    palate: weak molasses, dulled citrus (like a lemon without the bite) and plenty of apples.    finish: lingers for a while, filled with the fruitcake i smelled on the nose and masala chai.    conclusion: i was eager and excited to try this one, but it isn’t worth what was paid for it in my opinion. different strokes for different folks—it suits the owner just fine. **75/100**.    **oban 14** (*single malt, highland, 70cl, 43% abv*)    tasted: before some fantastic fish n’ chips at a local pub with friends. (the dram was $14.50 cad. not cool, local pub. not cool.)    colour: paleish gold.  nose: grass, honeysuckle, oak, citrus (lime?), and orange crème brûlée (burnt oranges).    palate: vanilla, oak, light smoke (tobacco more than a fireplace), seawater, pepper, and pure ethanol.    finish: long and slow, citrus moreso than anything else. slight taste of cheese rind and pink peppercorn.    conclusion: not my favourite, but not bad. not sure why it’s so expensive (bottles run $140~ here), in the end it’s not to my tastes. **73/100**.    **glenfiddich 15 solera vat** (*single malt, speyside, 75cl, 40% abv*)    price: $75 cad    tasted: took a 6 hour trip into the nearest large city to buy it and a few other bottles of scotch for myself for christmas, decided on this one due to reviews on scotchit!    colour: light caramel. (the artificial sort?)    nose: demerara sugar, grapes, apple juice concentrate, plums or raisins, apricot, fruitcake, almond extract (think amaretto), montmorency cherries, molasses, a tinge of black pepper.    palate: brandy, fruitcake, butter, heavy cream, vanilla, cardamom, nutmeg, more butter, stale banana chips (dried banana), and finally warm butter.    finish: medium length, very nice. pecans, ginger, walnuts, prunes, berries and finally the virgin oak listed on the label—tastes like a candied tree.    conclusion: the nose is rife with a veritable smorgasbord of dried fruit and baking ingredients, and i would have loved it if those would have continued on and joined the palate, which while reminiscent of fruitcake was more buttery than anything else. i love the finish—it tastes like sampling the various aisles of a bakery, and ends in a refreshing oaky taste that i enjoyed quite a bit—but i wish it was longer. this has become my go-to scotch when i want a dram i don’t have to study, but will definitely enjoy. **87/100**.    **edradour 2002 vintage straight from the cask châteauneuf du pape finish (cask strength, aged 11 years)** (*single malt, highland, 50cl, 57.5% abv, ridiculous name*)    price: $115 cad  tasted: first half of a bottle i bought for myself on the aforementioned trip to the nearest liquor mecca. first a sip or so neat, then with a splash of (much needed) water. colour: reddish copper.    nose: malbec grapes/red wine (as is to be expected), honey, coconut sugar, cinnamon, intense apples, burnt wheat or toast, grass, figs, faint brie.    palate: slight smoke, strong malt, unsweetened grape preserves, chili peppers, cherries, apple cider, a delightful burn.    finish: stronger grape preserves, slightly sweetened and tart, ends with extremely potent apples. an intense finish with a lasting presence, quite warm and pleasant.     **with a drop of water**:   colour: lighter copper.    nose: much sweeter than neat. cranberries, stronger figs, black cherries, pomegranate. wheat/vegetal scent is absolutely lost amidst a torrent of sweet fruit. toasted nuts.    palate: cinnamon, strong spices, white pepper, agave, applewood, cranberries and cherries, crystalized ginger, turbinado sugar, faint smoke.    finish: overwhelming spices, moroccan chili powder, saffron, smoked paprika, crystalized ginger.     **with more water**:   colour: pale auburn.   nose: very sweet still, now with raspberries, tonnes of agave, malt, caramel apple, toasted oats, underlying spices.    palate: maltiness returns, wheat returns, sweetness blends together, individual fruit notes disappear. dull coconut sugar. a befuddling mixture of muted jams and jellies, as if someone mixed all the jars together and took out the sugar as a prank. a touch of orange marmalade.    finish: a lot of butter and wheat—like buttered toast, or maybe a croissant with a smear of grape preserves. very malty, very nice. macadamia nuts, eventually tart cranberries and oak.    conclusion: i was curious as to what a red wine finish would be like, and wanted to try a cask-strength whisky, so i opted to pick this one up. i’m not disappointed, it’s quite different than any others i’ve tried and i believe it’ll help shape and round out my palate. “*edradour 2002 stfc, etc.*” has made me a firm believer in the quality of wine-finished whiskies, and has instilled within me a strong desire for more bottles labeled with the words “cask strength”. i enjoyed it most with a teaspoon (5ml water per 30ml whisky) of water—any more than that, and it completely falls apart. **83/100**.    **laphroaig cairdeas (2012 origin edition)** (*single malt, islay, 75cl, 51.2% abv, non-chill filtered, no age statement*)   price: $100 cad tasted: first few drams from a bottle i was (somehow) able to purchase locally.    colour: amber -2. (think hay or straw.)  nose: shortbread crossed with peat, gentle smoke. rubber, faint sweet seaweed, graham crackers, salty earth, strong vegetal component, beach sand, heavy cream that has gone slightly off. sandalwood, heavily salted cashews, faint raw honey, buttered toffee.    palate: balloon rubber, raw honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, walnut fudge, buttermilk, cashews, coffee cake, weak masala chai, faint citrus, seawater (iodine and chlorine, salt), egg whites.    finish: shortbread soaked in seawater, candied seaweed, kelp, coconut, turbinado sugar and beach sand once more. a long, smooth iodine-laden finish with a subtle heat and intensity tempered by sweetness. long-lasting aftertaste of semi-sweet chlorine. quite remarkable, quite different.    conclusion: i was hoping to find a bottle of the 2013 port wood edition (pink whisky! what could be any better?), but this bottle was what was available, and it was only $20 more than laphroaig qc and $10 more than 10. i don’t know if normal laphroaig is anything like this, but if it is, consider me hooked. this is so peaty, but simultaneously light and sweet, and majestic. i love it. a very different dram. don’t add even a drop of water— it might open it up a bit, make it slightly sweeter, but the finish suffers. **87/100**.      **bruichladdich: the organic 2.10** (*single malt, islay, 70cl, 46% abv, no age statement, non-chill filtered, natural colour*)    price: $80 cad  tasted: first few drams from a bottle i had my boss pick up for me while she was out of town.    colour: dry white wine. amber -4. it is *pale*.    nose: faint peaches, wheat, apples, un-lit tobacco, sweet brine, salt water, charred oak, wine grapes, barley, toasted oats, candied sesame seed, shortbread, slight iodine, white grape concentrate, a bewildering savoury note, some herbs (cilantro, thyme), heather, witch-hazel, earthiness (or peat), nuts and vanilla. wet burlap, golden raisins and stearin wax.  palate: pears, buttercream, butterscotch, apples, faint honey, savory bread, butter and egg whites, sea water, thread or cotton shoelaces, extremely faint vanilla. a hint of shortbread. begins sweet, becomes savoury, ends bitter.  finish: long and slow. at first no taste, then slight bitterness followed by sweetness, followed by tequila.     conclusion: honestly, had no one told me that this was whisky, upon nosing it i might have thought it was an astoundingly dry white wine. the nose is extremely complex: toward the end i was picking up notes of shortbread that were strikingly similar to those in laphroaig cairdeas origin, which were followed by a slew of floral notes. this whisky just keeps on giving in the nose department. the palate and finish, however, tell a different story. these are so thin and fragile that without taking an extreme amount of time, and paying an obscene amount of attention… you just cannae get anything from them. do not add water. just don’t do it—46% or not. time changes the nose, but harms the palate. this would score much, much less if not for the complexity of the nose. i would not buy this again. **74/100**       **final remarks**:    thanks all for taking the time to read these reviews, i hope you enjoyed them or at least gained some insight into picking out your next bottle.   it turns out i’m going to have to write 100 reviews before i attain the level of tartan that i want (it looks somewhat like my family tartan), so… i suppose i’ll have to get crackin’.  *sláinte*, scotchiteers—here’s to your next dram.",0,,

253391,"jews plotted the armenian holocaust! nathanael kapner  business as usual is a powerful motivating force especially when jews like the rothschilds are running an oil business. banking is the forte of the jewish house of rothschild. but raw materials–especially oil–are money in the bank.  the young turk movement, aka committee of union and progress, arose out of the rothschilds’ oil interests in the black sea area of the ottoman empire in the late 1800s. ‘creating stability’ in an incendiary realm was necessary for the rothschilds’ new oil enterprise baku oil. the instability of the armenian christians financial and intellectual prominence in the area was not ‘good for business.’  thus hand-picked jews of salonika, (jews made up the majority of the city’s population), and foreign agitators such as the russian zionist, vladimir jabotinksy, the editor of the young turk newspaper, were just what the rothschilds needed for ridding the source of that instability, the armenian christians.  now, the zionist young turks who sought for the break up of the ottoman empire in order to obtain palestine–and the house of rothschild, who needed a jewish-controlled turkey and hegemony over the entire middle east, could work together. this meant funding for the jewish young turks and revolutionary subversives for the rothschilds.  historical background of the jewish young turks  1680: sabbatai zvi, a turkish jew, proclaims himself to be the jewish messiah in salonica. after amassing a following of thousands of jews - he led them on a zionist exodus to palestine. on the way he decided to become a muslim. many of his followers saw this as god's plan and also became muslims.  1716: a group called the “donmeh” forms in salonica of sabbatai zvi’s followers headed by sabbatai zvi’s successor, baruchya russo. by the early 1900's, the donmeh numbers in the hundreds of thousands. they were known as crypto jews because though outwardly appearing to be muslims, they were still jews following the customs of the jewish occult kabbala which sabbatai zvi taught. they continue in their fervent, (yet secret), zionist vision.  1860: jewish hungarian zionist named arminius vambery becomes an advisor to the sultan abdul mecit while secretly working as an agent for lord palmerston of the british foreign office. vambery tries to broker a deal between the zionist leader theodore herzl and sultan abdul mecit over the creation of israel but fails.  1891: out of the donmeh a zionist political group forms called the committee of union and progress, later called the young turks. the group is headed by a freemason jew by the name of emmanuel carraso who organizes the secret committee of union and progress in geneva with the help of the rothschilds.  1895-1896: sephardic jews of salonika together with the turks massacre armenian christians in istanbul.  1902 &amp; 1907: two congresses of the young turks meet in paris to plan, prepare, and effect the penetration the sultan’s army leading to the military coup of 1908.  1908: the jewish young turks revolt and force the sultan abdul hamid ii into submission.  1909: the jewish young turks rape, torture, and slaughter over 100,000 armenians in the city of adana, also known as cilicia.  1914: the jews of the young turks create unrest, turmoil, and bolster the paid serbian assassin, gavrilo princip, which leads to world war i.  1915: the armenian holocaust engineered by the ruling jews of the young turks, leaves 1.5 million armenian christians starved, tortured, and murdered.  1918: jew mustafa kemal ‘attaturk’ ascends into leadership.  1920: russian jewish bolsheviks supply attaturk iwth 10 million gold roubles, 45,000 rifles, and 300 machine guns with ammunition.  1921: attaturk occupies the port of batu in conjunction with the russian jewish bolsheviks ceding it to the bolsheviks five days later. the rothschilds are delighted.  1922: jewish khemalists orchestrate the burning of smyrna resulting in the ‘ethnic cleansing’ of over 100,000 armenian and greek christians left tortured, starved, raped, and dead.  the british ambassador to the ottoman empire sir gerald lowther’s letter to sir charles harding, may 29, 1910  — “shortly after the revolution in july 1908, it soon became known that many of the young turks’ leading members were freemasons. it was noticed that jews of all colours, native and foreign, were enthusiastic supporters of the new dispensation, till, as many turks expressed it, every hebrew became a potential spy of the young turks. turks began to remark that the movement was rather a jewish than a turkish revolution.” —  the jewish murderers known as the young turks  1. emmanuel carraso: b’nai b’rith official of italian origin. grand master of the macedonia ressurected masonic lodge in salonika;

became prime minister of turkey in 1939.  6. emanuel qrasow: jewish propagandist for the young turks. headed the delegation to inform sultan abdã¼l hamid ii that “”the nation has removed you from your office.”  7. vladimir jabotinsky: russian zionist who moved to turkey in 1908. supported by b’nai brith of london and dutch zionist millionaire, jacob kann; editor of young turk newpaper. later started the terrorist irgun political party in israel.  8. alexander helphand, aka parvus: financier/liaison of the rothschilds of the young turk revolution; editor of the turkish homeland.  9. mustafa kemal ‘attaturk’ (1881-1938): a jew of sephardic (spanish) origin. attaturk attended the jewish elementary school known as semsi effendi school run by the jew simon zvi. over 12,000 jews welcomed to turkey by attaturk in 1933 when hitler came to power.  jew abe foxman of the adl denies the armenian holocaust  for many years, the anti defamation league and now its director, abraham foxman, refuse to acknowledge that the massacres of 1.5 million armenians between 1915 and 1923 constituted genocide. jews simply can’t stand to share their so-called “martyred-race” status with anyone else. and besides, jews don’t like to have their crimes pointed out to them. if one does, he is instantly labelled an “anti semite!”  foxman has reiterated the adl’s opposition to formal u.s. recognition of the armenian holocaust calling a proposed congressional resolution a counterproductive diversion. this position is inconsistent with the adl's mission statement â€œto secure justice and fair treatment to all citizens alike.  but the jew abe foxman and his racist adl organization do not care about any other ethnic group but their own. and they will lie and suppress the historical facts (and all historical facts that incriminate the jews) of the armenian holocaust and the role that the jews played in it. foxman and all jews do this in order to perpetuate their image as “innocent victims.”  we cannot allow the jews to get away with their suppression of historical facts that incriminate the jews any longer. abe foxman and his racist jewish friends love to see revisionist historians thrown in jail for questioning particulars of the jewish holocaust in germany. but it is foxman and the rest of the jewish censors who should be thrown in jail for denying the armenian holocaust! why do jews abide by a double standard constantly? aren’t we all sick of it and all these jews for that matter by now?  i, for one, brother nathanael kapner, a former jew and now an orthodox christian, will do all in my power to expose the jews. for the jews are *not* innocent victims of persecution against them but have *prompted* backlashes against them throughout their “wandering-among-the-nations” history.   the jews in fact are the most fierce perpetrators of racist crimes the world has ever known.   and the armenian holocaust of which the jews are responsible is a clear example of their jewish racist crimes.",0,,
587913,"silhouetted starkly against the setting western sun we see a cactus and tumbleweed set against a wide-spanning and barren desert.   we hear an american black man with the slightest touch of a southern accent saying ""our father...""  an early lamppost's lightbulb blasts out in a loud spark in the streets of a midday old west town. the streets are barren.   hanging under wooden gate perched with the classic bleached bull-skull is chained a battered wooden sign for the town reading ""mercy"". underneath the printed word lies, in chalk, the word ""six"".  ""...who art in heaven..."" the man continues in overvoice.  stomping across a wooden porch of the town we see the heavy black boots of a dark stranger as he strides with slow purpose forward.  we see the back of the head of this stranger. he wears a heavy duster and a wide brimmed hat. the back of his neck is heavy with many-chinned contusions.  the strangers face, pale and thick, covered in mechanical augments along the face and neck, most apparent of which is a massive robotic lens replacing his right eye. the socket glows blue and is vaugely reminiscent of the stalk of a dalek.  we see the overvoice speaking. he stands in front of a scattered group of town residents, standing dumbfounded in the middle of the town's road. he's well dressed in starched suit and tie and himself wears a hat. he perhaps is the town's historically inaccurate town leader. he stoically continues ""...thy kingdom come...""  we see the doctor wearing his favorite stetson with his right hand cooly in his pocket staring down at the dirt with a pick in his teeth. an opponent steps in and frames his figure between his legs in the iconic western style.  the doctor looks up to his opponent with a grimace. he stands outside the clocktower of the town labeled ""grand central"".  ""...thy will be done...""  the doctor stand across from the cyborg in the center of town, nothing but dust between the two of the mas they stare off at each other.  we see a close shot of the cyborg's face as he looks outward intimidatingly in a sweep as he bellows ""face me!"". his teeth are surprisingly a pearly white.  we see the doctor, in the same town but now at night looking out at the camera. behind him are amy and rory and a handful of the town's denizens as they stand in the middle of the dirt road. he says with fearful urgency ""run!"".  the theme ""every planet, every star"" kicks in. the following scenes coincide with the score's stabs of the trumpet.  we see a window shatters open as reddish light and a strong gust of wind blast forth with a roar.  now day again in the town we see a man in a brown coat ducking and lifting his arms in instinctive defense as a shot narrowly misses his head and hits into the wooden wall behind him in an explosion of dust.  in town center, still midday, the cyborg points forward his canon-like arm like a junkyard megaman as a window across from him explodes in a shower of broken glass.  we see a man in a tweed coat and a hat cover his head as he awkwardly runs alongside the dirt to dodge something. he flings his hands up like an idiot and given that he's outside the grand central i mentioned earlier, this is almost certainly the doctor again.  in the middle of the desert there a towering orange explosion as if it were made by tnt or dynamite. nothing else, just an explosion.  we see probably-rory running alongside a portly mustachioed man in a bowler cap across the desert towards the camera.  we again see the portly man and probably-rory walking across rocky terrain alongside a white cliff face when an explosion blasts in between the two of them, throwing up a blast of dirt.  an explosion tosses up more dirt, but this time from a lower angle.  an explosion of sparks lights up the dark. a small ring of blue lights can bee seen where the right eye of a difficult to discern figure would be who seems to be creating the sparks. my moneys on it being the cyborg.  suddenly it's day *in the arctic tundra* and the doctor is sprinting forward followed by probably-rory and a figure in a full body white tundra suit.  the doctor, probably-rory, and the white-clad figure are specks on a sweeping arctic landscape.  back to the old west probably the doctor chases a tall, dark probably-the-cyborg across a flat plateau dotted with dry yellowed grass.  we see amy in a white blue-striped shirt running at night in what appears to be a modern city, possibly london's underground. she quickly looks behind her to glimpse her pursuers.  still at night, but in what appears to be a cemetery or something we see four figures running to camera. one is a woman in a white dress and two are holding flashlights. their garb appears to be modern-day.  the doctor, probably-rory and some balding red-headed bloke run *away* from camera towards a bleak rocky cliff face that stretches on across the beach. they head away from a rocky shore, the sky looks a bleak grey.  we see another shot of the red-headed bloke running alongside the beach he turns back in wide-eyed panic. he's wearing a black vest and wristwatch and apparently has a goatee. probably rory's sprinting beside him in yellow shorts.  we see the doctor's feet sliding on ice (or something) lit by colored lights, maybe he's at a skating rink, i don't know. but he's having trouble keeping balance.  we see the doctor, still in the ice-rink-thing, making a funny face as he slides forward, trying to keep his balance.  the camera is facing up at a beautiful blue sky dotted with clouds as the doctor and amy rush up to inspect it. it being the camera.  we see a figure that appears to be the cyborg in a dark room, possibly a church judging by the stained slass pane on the wall behind him marching forward with his menacing canon-arm (producing a menacing circular ring of lights), blue eye a-glowin'.  we see the townsfolk positively pissing their pants in the pews of the church as they scream at the off-screen location the cyborg would be.  we see a little girl in a red room scream. there's a banister behind her and her garb appears to be.. i dunno... victorian? i'm no dress expert, and that kid is *screaming*.  we see a buxom bartender/burlesque dancer/prostitute behind the bar of a saloon, bottle of alcohol lining the wall behind her. the doctor is leaning over the bar and she is seductively sticking something in her mouth. suddenly both her and the doctor look to someone entering the bar in surprise.  we see the town center with people bustling about, mostly shouting and yelling in panic. lots of yelling and running in this segment.  another shot of villagers panicking and running about, this time with what appears to be an elderly blacksmith panicking in the foreground.  said elderly blacksmith takes a dive and bellyflops on the dirt like a fucking grenades about to blow, but he lands painfully.  the doctor, against all of his codes of ethics and morality, is pointing a gun just offscreen as townspeople with moustaches stand behind him.  amy, standing across from the doctor in what appears to be the same spot as the last scene gesticulates with a revolver with a level of idiotic carelessness that mirrors her respect to the danger of swords, says ""have you been taking stupid lessons since i last saw you!?"" much in the way a middle-school girl would insult one of their friends if they weren't terribly bright.   the gun goes off and she nearly shoots a dude in the foot.  towns people raise their hands with the sort of immediate shock one responds to when someone crazy has a *fucking gun*.  mr. monopoly shouts ""what's wrong with you!?"" to amy as if anyone has the time to sit down and explain all that.  a sheriff with a fu manchu announces ""everyone who isn't an american, *drop your gun* as he accusatorily points directly at amy.  instead of *dropping the damn gun* amy gestures with it and fires off another shot, causing the surrounding townspeople to cringe in shock. she shouts ""i didn't mean to do that."" and looks around with an obnoxious ""listen guys, i'm explaining"" shrug. she doesn't put down the gun because *she's a goddamn idiot*.  about six of the townspeople seem to have grabbed the doctor like the least friendly form of crowd surfing possible and are running him to the edge of town. the doctor is going ""whooooooooooooooa!"" as they do this.  they uncerimoniously toss him outside of said bull-skull clad gate.  we see the doctor stand up with a pained look on his face.  we then see virtually every patron of the town pull out and cock their revolvers, pointing it directly at the camera.  the doctor, amy, and rory are having a dandy little jaunt along the town's streets when a lamppost explodes in a shower of sparks.",1,0,0

491334,"in any case, here is the full text.        i recently read a thread on /r/makeupaddiction where addicts talked about how much they spent on their “hauls”, and i nearly peed myself. if you enjoying spending thousands of dollars annually on makeup, then power to you, but for the rest of us mere mortals, building a collection can be tough.  the important thing to remember is that a makeup collection has diminishing returns. the first punchy purple lipstick you buy will have you strutting down the street feeling hot as rihanna, and the temptation will be to buy another to get the same feeling-- this is a really easy way to empty your bank account. remember, a girl only has so much face to decorate.  with this is mind, i decided to make this guide for those “starting out” building a makeup collection. i now own a mix of low, mid and high-end products, if i could go back, i could save some serious dough.  *disclaimer: i'm white, and freckled, with dark features. if you are not, the shades recommended might not work for you. i did my best to use “universal” colours, but how universal they really are is up for debate. mostly, they're just universal amongst the different kinds of “white” and “white-ish” people. i encourage a woman of colour to make a similar guide.*  *i'm canadian, so many products may be different from where you live. for example, i don't have anything by “sleek” because it's not sold here, but it comes so highly recommended that i included several items. also, i obviously have my favourite brands. don't be hating.*   ok, let's do this   **start with the face**  of all the subjects, face makeup is the most personal because it depends so much on your skin's texture, colour, and whims. i, for one, am allergic to pretty much everything that exists. so this isn't going to be as cut and dry is the rest, so let's get it over with first.   **foundation**  foundation is really personal. because your skin is unique, what works for me may not work for you. the best way to buy foundation is to get samples whenever possible, and wear them out. foundations often oxidize- this means they change colour over time. so when that mac diva has you lookin' so fly you take the set, you might still look like an oompa loompa in an hour. test yo' foundation.  if you've never worn foundation, i recommend starting with a bb cream or tinted moisturizer. because they are sheerer, you don't risk the “cake face” effect.  garnier has a decent one, so does nyx. the colours are generally very limited, so again, try to test them.    application:  you can use a brush or a sponge, up to you:  * real techniques miracle complexion sponge * real techniques expert face brush  **concealer**  under-eye concealers should have an orange tint to cancel out the blue-purple hue of your sleep-deprived bags. i like nyx under-eye concealer.   for the rest of your face, mac pro-longwear concealer will cover whatever you have to hide, but god damn that pump. unless you have the dexterity of a tolkien elf, good luck not coating your life with this amazing crap.  application:  * honestly, i just use my fingers to pat it on.    ok that was fun now let's talk about the good stuff  **finishing powder**  finishing powder is amazing-- it will make your makeup stay put and “soften” the whole look. all the powders on the market are essentially silica or cornstarch or both. you can also use these under your foundation (mua likes to call this the “wayne goss” method).   * e.l.f. studio high definition powder in “sheer” * nyx studio finishing powder   for a little added oomph, try pumpkin and poppy aphrodite. it's got slightest shimmer to it that isn't visible but makes you look more alive. if i'm running out the door, it's moisturizer+sunscreen+bb cream smooshed together in my hand, then this powder and good enough.   *  pumpkinandpoppy aphrodite inner glow powder (hourglass diffused light dupe)  application:  * e.l.f. studio kabuki face brush  **contour powder**  contouring is hard and i hate it but if you want to try it nyx taupe or pumpkin and poppy oak bark are your best bet. they're cheap(ish), they're grey tinted so your shadows don't look like brown smears, and they're easy(ish) to work with.  * nyx cosmetics powder blush, taupe * pumpkinandpoppy oak bark (taupe, cool toned contouring powder)  application:  * real techniques tapered brush  * makeup geek angled contour brush  * any cheap fan brush, eg e.l.f. studio fan brush   **blush**  nars orgasm is popular because it's a fairly “universal” colour. you can do the ol' pinch your cheek and match to that, or your can just pick one of these:  * nyx pinched * sleek rose gold * e.l.f. tickled pink  application:  the smaller brush is good for the apple of the cheek. the bigger one is good for a light application across the cheek bone. i use both most days.   * e.l.f. studio stipple brush * e.l.f. studio small stipple brush  **bronzer**  this is to make you look “sun kissed”, and not for contouring.  * elf studio bronzer in “warm bronzer” * elf studio contouring blush &amp;amp; bronzing powder in”st. lucia” (includes blush, which is nice, but too dark for really pale skin)   **eyes**  **primer**  yes, you need it. white bases are for under bright shadows or to lighten the lid, and “normal” primer is for everything else. use very sparingly, your “drop” of primer should be smaller than the head of a screw.  * nyx jumbo eye pencil in “milk” * urban decay eyeshadow primer potion tube in “original” (get the small one, it lasts forever)  application:  no tools needed.  **neutral shadows**  you will use neutral shadows a lot: these will be the base of your “smokey eyes”, your daily looks, and even you bright and wild looks. i don't recommend dropping $40+ on your first palette. my recommendations are in the $20 range and will work great with a primer.  * wet n' wild color icon in comfort zone  * if you can find it, wet n wild smoke and melrose palette * coastal scents 28 neutral palette  * urban decay naked basics * sleek i-divine palette in “au naturel” or “vintage romance”  application:  * mac 217 brush  * sigma e25 blending brush * e.l.f. studio eyeshadow ""c"" brush  * real techniques starter kit  **crazy shadows**  if you want to get wild, you can try one of these palettes:  * urban decay electric palette * sleek i divine in “ultra matte v1” or “acid” * any giant coastalscents palette   **eyeliner**  *felt style, get it in black:* * physicians formula eye booster®2-in-1 lash boosting eyeliner + serum * kat von d tattoo liner in trooper * stila stay all day waterproof liquid eye liner   *gel, get it in black:*  * wet 'n' wild - mega eyes creme eyeliner * maybelline's eyestudio lasting drama gel eyeliner  *pencil, get a brown one:* * urban decay 24/7 liner in “bourbon” * nyx slide on pencil in “brown perfection”  *powder:*  just use a black or brown eyeshadow with a damp brush. boom.  application (for gel or powder):   * e.l.f. studio angled eyeliner brush * mac 263 small angle brush * eco tools bamboo angled eye liner brush  **mascara** *in black or brown – please replace regularly:*  * cover girl lash blast volume * cover girl clump crusher * l'oréal paris voluminous mascara carbon black * maybelline new york volum' express the colossal cat eyes mascara * maybelline great lash * clinique bottom lash mascara   **lips**  **easy nude:**  * nyx butter gloss in “eclair” * revlon nude attitude (wear both together) * wet n' wild lipstick  in “just peachy” * rimmel lasting finish lip stick kate moss collection in “03” + * nyx cosmetics slim lip pencil in “natural”   **professional:**  * nyx matte lipstick in “tea rose” * rimmel lasting finish matte by kate moss in “104” + * nyx slim lip pencil in “mauve” * mac lip liner in “whirl”  **vampy:**  * wet n' wild lipstick in ""cherry bomb” * wet n' wild lipstick  in “sugar plum fairy” * wet n' wild lipstick  in “vamp it up” + * mac lip liner in “nightmoth” * rimmel london 1000 kisses stay on lip liner  * nyx cosmetics slim lip pencil in “current” and “deep red”  **sunny fuchsia:**  * mac lipstick in “candy yum yum” or “pink pigeon” * maybelline electric fuchsia  * revlon hd pink ruby (515) ultra hd lip lacquer * urban decay lipstick in “cat fight” * nyx soft matte lip cream in “addis adaba”  **classic red:**  * maybelline color elixir lip color in “signature scarlet” * revlon just bitten kissable lip balm stain in “romantic”  * nyx cosmetics matte lipstick in “perfect red” * revlon super lustrous lip color in “cherry blossom”  * rimmel lasting finish matte by kate moss in “104” * m·a·c lipstick in ruby woo (not for dry lips) + * mac lipliner in “brick” * any brands mentioned above  **lipglosses, in general:**  * revlon ultra hd lip lacquer * nyx butter gloss  **random bonus crap**  once you've got your ""base"" you can start playing around with adding it extra magic. i recommend fyrinnae.com , shirocosmetics.com , and makeupgeek brand at makeupgeek.com for affordable shadows in all sorts of colours and finishes. check out /r/makeupexchange to pick up items you're not sure about on the cheap (especially if you're american)-- learn to sanitize your products! when trying a high-end product for the first time, get it from sephora so you can get your money back if it sucks. once you know you like it, find it elsewhere for cheaper.  lastly, don't buy things because someone recommends them or because they're pretty: buy things because you want them. if you have 10 red lipsticks that you use regularly, for the love of christ stop buying red lipsticks. if you have a foundation that works for you, stick with it until it doesn't. buying makeup is only empowering to the extent that it allows you to express yourself. make sure you're buying it for you, and not because advertisement or shit-people are making you feel that you need to look a certain way. you are gorgeous in all your forms.   that is all.* **go forth and sparkle!** *",1,0,

the horsehoofs ringing clear;    tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did not hear? down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, the highwayman came riding—riding—riding— the red coats looked to their priming! she stood up, straight and still.  tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! tlot-tlot, in the echoing night!    nearer he came and nearer. her face was like a light. her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,    then her finger moved in the moonlight, her musket shattered the moonlight, shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death.  he turned. he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood    bowed, with her head o’er the musket, drenched with her own blood!    not till the dawn he heard it, and his face grew grey to hear    how bess, the landlord’s daughter, the landlord’s black-eyed daughter, had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.  back, he spurred like a madman, shouting a curse to the sky, with the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high. blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat; when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.  .       .       .  and still of a winter’s night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, when the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,    when the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,    a highwayman comes riding—riding—riding— a highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.  over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard. he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred.    he whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there    but the landlord’s black-eyed daughter,  bess, the landlord’s daughter, plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.   edit:  fixed shitty mobile formatting.",1,-1,1

744309,"obama: now in the meantime, we’ve got to work very closely with the states to monitor and to help people who are still falling through the cracks. and you know, the homeless problem was bad even when the economy was good.  part of the change in attitudes that i want to see here in washington and all across the country is a belief that it is not acceptable for children and families to be without a roof over their heads in a country as wealthy as ours. and so we’re going to be initiating a range of programs, as well, to deal with homelessness.  one area in particular i want to focus on is the issue of veterans. the rate of homelessness among veterans is much, much higher than for nonveteran populations.  and so we’ve got — a number of the increases that we’re looking for in our budget on veterans funding directly addresses the issue of homeless veterans. that, i think, can provide some real help.  ann compton? hey, ann. you sound surprised.  q: i am surprised. could i ask you about race?  obama: you may.  q: yours is a rather historic presidency. and i’m just wondering whether, in any of the policy debates that you’ve had within the white house, the issue of race has come up or whether it has in the way you feel you’ve been perceived by other leaders or by the american people? or has the last 64 days been a relatively colorblind time?  obama: i, i think that the last 64 days has been dominated by me trying to figure out how we’re going to fix the economy, and that affects black, brown and white.  and, you know, obviously, at the inauguration, i think that there was justifiable pride on the part of the country that we had taken a step to move us beyond some of the searing legacies of racial discrimination in this country, but that lasted about a day.  and, and, you know, right now, the american people are judging me exactly the way i should be judged. and that is: are we taking the steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets, create jobs, get businesses to reopen, keep america safe? and that’s what i’ve been spending my time thinking about.  ok. john ward, washington times? where’s john?  q: thank you, sir.  obama: there you go.  q: thank you, mr. president.  obama: sure.  q: in your remarks on stem cell research earlier this month, you talked about a majority consensus in determining whether or not this is the right thing to do, to federally fund embryonic stem cell research.  i’m just wondering, though, how much you personally wrestled with the morality or ethics of federally funding this kind of research, especially given the fact that science so far has shown a lot of progress with adult stem cells, but not a lot with embryonic?  obama: ok. no, i think it’s — i think it’s a legitimate question. i, i wrestle with these issues every day.  as i mentioned to — i think in an interview a couple of days ago, by the time an issue reaches my desk, it’s a hard issue. if it was an easy issue, somebody else would have solved it and it wouldn’t have reached me.  look, i believe that it is very important for us to have strong moral guidelines, ethical guidelines, when it comes to stem-cell research or anything that touches on, you know, the issues of possible cloning or issues related to, you know, the human life sciences.  i think those issues are all critical, and i’ve said so before. i wrestle with it on stem cell; i wrestle with it on issues like abortion.  i think that the guidelines that we provided meet that ethical test. what we have said is that, for embryos that are typically about to be discarded, for us to be able to use those in order to find cures for parkinson’s or for alzheimer’s or, you know, all sorts of other debilitating diseases, juvenile diabetes, that, that it is the right thing to do.  and that’s not just my opinion. that is the opinion of a number of people who are also against abortion.  now, i am glad to see progress is being made in adult stem cells. and if the science determines that we can completely avoid a set of ethical questions or political disputes, then that’s great.  i have, i have no investment in causing controversy. i’m happy to avoid it if that’s where the science leads us. but what i don’t want to do is predetermine this based on a very rigid ideological approach, and that’s what i think is reflected in the executive order that i signed.  q: i meant to ask — just to follow up — do you think that scientific consensus is enough to tell us what we can and cannot do?  obama: no. i think there’s, there’s always an ethical and a moral element that has to be, be a part of this. and so, as i said, i, i don’t take decisions like this lightly. they’re ones that i take seriously, and, and i respect people who have different opinions on this issue.  but i think that this was the right thing to do and the ethical thing to do. and as i said before, my hope is, is that we can find a mechanism, ultimately, to cure these diseases in a way that gains 100 percent consensus. and we certainly haven’t achieved that yet, but i think on balance this was the right step to take.  staff: last question.  obama: ok. stefan collison (ph), afp?  q: mr. president, you came to office pledging to work for peace between israel and the palestinians. how realistic do you think those hopes are now, given the likelihood of a prime minister who is not fully signed up to a two-state solution and a foreign minister who has been accused of insulting arabs?  obama: it’s not easier than it was, but i think it’s just as necessary. we don’t yet know what the israeli government is going to look like, and we don’t yet know what the future shape of palestinian leadership is going to be comprised of.  what we do know is this: that the status quo is unsustainable, that it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution where israelis and palestinians can live side-by-side in their own states with peace and security.  and by assigning george mitchell the task of working as special envoy, what we’ve signaled is that we’re going to be serious from day one in trying to move the parties in a direction that acknowledges that reality.  how effective these negotiations may be, i think we’re going to have to wait and see. but you know, we, we were here for st. patrick’s day, and you’ll recall that we had what had been previously sworn enemies celebrating here in this very room.  you know, leaders from the two sides of northern ireland that, you know, a couple of decades ago — or even a decade ago — people would have said could never achieve peace, and here they were, jointly appearing and talking about their commitment, even in the face of violent provocation.  and what that tells me is that, if you stick to it, if you are persistent, then, then these problems can be dealt with.  that whole philosophy of persistence, by the way, is one that i’m going to be emphasizing again and again in the months and years to come as long as i’m in this office. i’m a big believer in persistence.  i think that when it comes to domestic affairs, if we keep on working at it, if we acknowledge that we make mistakes sometimes, and that we don’t always have the right answer, and we’re inheriting very knotty problems, that we can pass health care, we can find better solutions to our energy challenges, we can teach our children more effectively, we can deal with a very real budget crisis that is not fully dealt with in my, in my budget at this point, but makes progress.  i think, when it comes to the banking system, you know, it was just a few days ago or weeks ago where people were certain that secretary geithner couldn’t deliver a plan. today, the headlines all look like, well, all right, there’s a plan. and i’m sure there will be more criticism, and we’ll have to make more adjustments, but we’re moving in the right direction.  when it comes to iran, you know, we did a video, sending a message to the iranian people and the leadership of the islamic republic of iran. and some people said, well, they did not immediately say that we’re eliminating nuclear weapons and stop funding terrorism. well, we didn’t expect that. we expect that we’re going to make steady progress on this front.  we haven’t immediately eliminated the influence of lobbyists in washington. we have not immediately eliminated wasteful pork projects. and we’re not immediately going to get middle east peace. we’ve been in office now a little over 60 days.  what i am confident about is that we’re moving in the right direction and that the decisions we’re making are based on, how are we going to get this economy moving? how are we going to put americans back to work? how are we going to make sure that our people are safe? and how are we going to create not just prosperity here, but work with other countries for global peace and prosperity?  and we are going to stay with it as long as i’m in this office, and i think that — you look back four years from now, i think, hopefully, people will judge that body of work and say, this is a big ocean liner. it’s not a speedboat. it doesn’t turn around immediately. but we’re in a better, better place because of the decisions that we made.  all right? thank you, everybody.  finis",1,0,0

may have slight chocolate, cocoa and/or grainy secondary notes. esters medium-low to none. no diacetyl. hop aroma low to none.  appearance: jet black to deep brown with garnet highlights in color. can be opaque (if not, it should be clear). a thick, creamy, long-lasting, tan- to brown-colored head is characteristic.  flavor: moderate roasted, grainy sharpness, optionally with light to moderate acidic sourness, and medium to high hop bitterness. dry, coffee-like finish from roasted grains. may have a bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate character in the palate, lasting into the finish. balancing factors may include some creaminess, medium-low to no fruitiness, and medium to no hop flavor. no diacetyl.  mouthfeel: medium-light to medium-full body, with a creamy character. low to moderate carbonation. for the high hop bitterness and significant proportion of dark grains present, this beer is remarkably smooth. the perception of body can be affected by the overall gravity with smaller beers being lighter in body. may have a light astringency from the roasted grains, although harshness is undesirable.  overall impression: a very dark, roasty, bitter, creamy ale.  comments: this is the draught version of what is otherwise known as irish stout or irish dry stout. bottled versions are typically brewed from a significantly higher og and may be designated as foreign extra stouts (if sufficiently strong). while most commercial versions rely primarily on roasted barley as the dark grain, others use chocolate malt, black malt or combinations of the three. the level of bitterness is somewhat variable, as is the roasted character and the dryness of the finish; allow for interpretation by brewers.  history: the style evolved from attempts to capitalize on the success of london porters, but originally reflected a fuller, creamier, more ""stout"" body and strength. when a brewery offered a stout and a porter, the stout was always the stronger beer (it was originally called a ""stout porter""). modern versions are brewed from a lower og and no longer reflect a higher strength than porters.  ingredients: the dryness comes from the use of roasted unmalted barley in addition to pale malt, moderate to high hop bitterness, and good attenuation. flaked unmalted barley may also be used to add creaminess. a small percentage (perhaps 3%) of soured beer is sometimes added for complexity (generally by guinness only). water typically has moderate carbonate hardness, although high levels will not give the classic dry finish.  vital statistics: og: 1.036 - 1.050 fg: 1.007 - 1.011 ibu: 30 - 45 srm: 25.0 - 40.0 abv: 4.0 - 5.0  commercial examples: guinness draught stout (also canned), murphy's stout, beamish stout, o'hara's celtic stout, russian river o.v.l. stout, three floyd's black sun stout, dorothy goodbody's wholesome stout, orkney dragonhead stout, old dominion stout, goose island dublin stout, brooklyn dry stout",0,,

263120,"let me summarize it for you :  in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.  “whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”  he didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understood that he meant a great deal more than that. in consequence, i’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. the abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college i was unjustly accused of being a politician, because i was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. most of the confidences were unsought—frequently i have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when i realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. i am still a little afraid of missing something if i forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and i snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  and, after boasting this way of my tolerance, i come to the admission that it has a limit. conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point i don’t care what it’s founded on. when i came back from the east last autumn i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—gatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn. if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament.”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person and which it is not likely i shall ever find again. no—gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.  my family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle western city for three generations. the carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the dukes of buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the civil war, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on to-day.  i never saw this great-uncle, but i’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office i graduated from new haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later i participated in that delayed teutonic migration known as the great war. i enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that i came back restless. instead of being the warm centre of the world, the middle west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so i decided to go east and learn the bond business. everybody i knew was in the bond business, so i supposed it could support one more single man. all my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “why—ye—es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays i came east, permanently, i thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  the practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and i had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. he found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to washington, and i went out to the country alone. i had a dog—at least i had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old dodge and a finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  it was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than i, stopped me on the road.  “how do you get to west egg village?” he asked helplessly.  i told him. and as i walked on i was lonely no longer. i was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. he had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  and so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, i had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  there was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. i bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only midas and morgan and maecenas knew. and i had the high intention of reading many other books besides. i was rather literary in college—one year i wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the “yale news.”—and now i was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” this isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  it was a matter of chance that i should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in north america. it was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of new york—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of long island sound. they are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. to the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  i lived at west egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some hotel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby’s mansion. or, rather, as i didn’t know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.  across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed, and i’d known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.  her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from lake forest. it was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  why they came east i don’t know. they had spent a year in france for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. this was a permanent move, said daisy over the telephone, but i didn’t believe it—i had no sight into daisy’s heart, but i felt that tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  and so it happened that on a warm windy evening i drove over to east egg to see two old friends whom i scarcely knew at all. their house was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red-and-white georgian colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. it was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.  his speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. there was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at new haven who had hated his guts.  “now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to say, “just because i’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” we were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate i always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  we talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  “i’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motor-boat that bumped the tide offshore.  “it belonged to demaine, the oil man.” he turned me around again, politely and abruptly. “we’ll go inside.”   we walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by french windows at either end. the windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. a breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  the other girl, daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and i laughed too and came forward into the room.  “i’m p-paralyzed with happiness.” she laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. that was a way she had. she hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was baker. (i’ve heard it said that daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  at any rate, miss baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. again a sort of apology arose to my lips. almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  i looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. it was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered “listen,” a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.   i told her how i had stopped off in chicago for a day on my way east, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  “do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.  “the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.”  “how gorgeous! let’s go back, tom. to-morrow!” then she added irrelevantly: “you ought to see the baby.”  “i’d like to.”  “she’s asleep. she’s three years old. haven’t you ever seen her?”  “never.”  “well, you ought to see her. she’s——”  tom buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  “what you doing, nick?”  “i’m a bond man.”  “who with?”  i told him.  “never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.  this annoyed me.  “you will,” i answered shortly. “you will if you stay in the east.”  “oh, i’ll stay in the east, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. “i’d be a god damned fool to live anywhere else.”  at this point miss baker said: “absolutely!” with such suddenness that i started—it was the first word she uttered since i came into the room. evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  “i’m stiff,” she complained, “i’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as i can remember.”  “don’t look at me,” daisy retorted, “i’ve been trying to get you to new york all afternoon.”  “no, thanks,” said miss baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, “i’m absolutely in training.”  her host looked at her incredulously.  “you are!” he took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. “how you ever get anything done is beyond me.”  i looked at miss baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” i enjoyed looking at her. she was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. her gray sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  “you live in west egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “i know somebody there.”  “i don’t know a single——”  “you must know gatsby.”  “gatsby?” demanded daisy. “what gatsby?”  before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  “why candles?” objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. “in two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” she looked at us all radiantly. “do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? i always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.”  “we ought to plan something,” yawned miss baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  “all right,” said daisy. “what’ll we plan?” she turned to me helplessly: “what do people plan?”  before i could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  “look!” she complained; “i hurt it.”  we all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.  “you did it, tom,” she said accusingly. “i know you didn’t mean to, but you did do it. that’s what i get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a——”  “i hate that word hulking,” objected tom crossly, “even in kidding.”  “hulking,” insisted daisy.  sometimes she and miss baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. they were here, and they accepted tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. they knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. it was sharply different from the west, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  “you make me feel uncivilized, daisy,” i confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. “can’t you talk about crops or something?”  i meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  “civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out tom violently. “i’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. have you read ‘the rise of the colored empires’ by this man goddard?”  “why, no,” i answered, rather surprised by his tone.  “well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. the idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged. it’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”  “tom’s getting very profound,” said daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. “he reads deep books with long words in them. what was that word we——”  “well, these books are all scientific,” insisted tom, glancing at her impatiently. “this fellow has worked out the whole thing. it’s up to us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will have control of things.”  “we’ve got to beat them down,” whispered daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  “you ought to live in california—” began miss baker, but tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  “this idea is that we’re nordics. i am, and you are, and you are, and——” after an infinitesimal hesitation he included daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that. do you see?”  there was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. when, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  “i’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically. “it’s about the butler’s nose. do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?”  “that’s why i came over to-night.”  “well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in new york that had a silver service for two hundred people. he had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose——”  “things went from bad to worse,” suggested miss baker.  “yes. things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”  for a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as i listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  the butler came back and murmured something close to tom’s ear, whereupon tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside. as if his absence quickened something within her, daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  “i love to see you at my table, nick. you remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose. doesn’t he?” she turned to miss baker for confirmation: “an absolute rose?”  this was untrue. i am not even faintly like a rose. she was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  miss baker and i exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. i was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “sh!” in a warning voice. a subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond, and miss baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to hear. the murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  “this mr. gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor——” i said.  “don’t talk. i want to hear what happens.”  “is something happening?” i inquired innocently.  “you mean to say you don’t know?” said miss baker, honestly surprised. “i thought everybody knew.”  “i don’t.”  “why——” she said hesitantly, “tom’s got some woman in new york.”  “got some woman?” i repeated blankly.  miss baker nodded.  “she might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time. don’t you think?”  almost before i had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and tom and daisy were back at the table.  “it couldn’t be helped!” cried daisy with tense gaiety.  she sat down, glanced searchingly at miss baker and then at me, and continued: “i looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors. there’s a bird on the lawn that i think must be a nightingale come over on the cunard or white star line. he’s singing away——” her voice sang: “it’s romantic, isn’t it, tom?”  “very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “if it’s light enough after dinner, i want to take you down to the stables.”  the telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as daisy shook her head decisively at tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table i remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and i was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one, and yet to avoid all eyes. i couldn’t guess what daisy and tom were thinking, but i doubt if even miss baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind. to a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  the horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. tom and miss baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, i followed daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. in its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. i saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so i asked what i thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.  “we don’t know each other very well, nick,” she said suddenly. “even if we are cousins. you didn’t come to my wedding.”  “i wasn’t back from the war.”  “that’s true.” she hesitated. “well, i’ve had a very bad time, nick, and i’m pretty cynical about everything.”  evidently she had reason to be. i waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment i returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.  “i suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”  “oh, yes.” she looked at me absently. “listen, nick; let me tell you what i said when she was born. would you like to hear?”  “very much.”  “it’ll show you how i’ve gotten to feel about—things. well, she was less than an hour old and tom was god knows where. i woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. she told me it was a girl, and so i turned my head away and wept. ‘all right,’ i said, ‘i’m glad it’s a girl. and i hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.”  “you see i think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a convinced way. “everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. and i know. i’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.” her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. “sophisticated—god, i’m sophisticated!”  the instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, i felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. it made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. i waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and tom belonged.  inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.  tom and miss baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the saturday evening post.—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. the lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.",0,,

891963,"it is not hard to imagine rabid ideologues sacrificing ""their own kind"" for the ""greater cause"" -- and what cause, in zionist minds, could be greater than the dream of a ""greater israel"", reaching ""from the nile to the euphrates"".    communists sacrificed russians, islamists sacrifice arabs, and zionists sacrifice jews -- zionists all the while posing as ""the protectors of the jews"".  http://www.zmag.org/sustainers/content/2001-09/05wise.htm &gt;reflections on zionism from a dissident jew  &gt;by tim wise / 05 sep 2001   &gt;....  &gt;that most jews have never examined the founding principles of this ideology to which they cleave is unfortunate. for if they were to do so, they might be shocked at how anti-jewish zionism really is. time and again, zionists have even collaborated with open jew-haters for the sake of political power.   &gt;....    jews of conscience in germany were targeted both by the zionists and the hitlerites.    the zionists and the hitlerites were kindred spirits.  both ideologies put the gene (ethnicity or race) above all else, both glorified a racially-pure tribal homeland, both sought to transfer jews from the ""aryan homeland"" to the ""jewish homeland"", both were anti-semitic at heart, and both were ruthless in the extreme.  http://digg.com/politics/a_declaration_of_independence_from_israel?t=7541953#c7569462 -- israel's assassination campaign costs jewish lives  .  despire the enlightment philosophy of our founders, many of us americans continue to have a tribal or ethno-centric view of the world.  too often, we regard ""the jews"" as a monolithic group, either all good or all bad.  many of us neglect to see jews as individuals, some good, some bad, most a mixture.  we simply cannot imagine jews sacrificing ""fellow"" jews in a world where ideology trumps ethnicity.  for us, ethnicity is the be-all and end-all.  that makes us easy prey for the zionists.  since we do not judge jews as individuals, zionists, like terrorists, are free to ""blend in"", free to hide behind jews of conscience and jews in general.  in this way, they put themselves above criticism -- for to criticize them would be to ""attack all jews"", or so we foolishly believe.  zionists are then free to commit the most heinous crimes, undetected.  and because they are free from all scrutiny, their brand of fascism thrives.    a similar dynamic helped to spawn the german nazis and world war ii.  because of versailles, many people felt sorry for the germans.  because the hitlerites seemed to repesent germany, they were given a pass.  in fact, british conservatives, headed by neville chamberlain, became so fond of ""poor hitler"" that they gave him whatever he asked for.  compare the hitlerite use of ""versailles"" with the zionist use of ""the holocaust"".  in germany, not all jews were alike.  while jews of conscience suffered grievously, the zionists enjoyed privileged status.  &gt;hitlerism is satan's nationalism. the determination to rid the german national body of the jewish element, however, led hitlerism to discover its ""kinship"" with zionism, the jewish nationalism of liberation.  therefore zionism became the only other party legalized in the reich, the zionist flag the only other flag permitted to fly in nazi-land.  it was a painful distinction for zionism to be singled out for favors and privileges by its satanic counterpart.  -- stephen wise, _congress _bulletin, quoted by lenni brenner, zionism in the age of dictators, p. 85-86  brenner writes that zionism had come full turn:  http://www.marxists.de/middleast/brenner/ch07.htm  &gt; ""instead of zionism being the hope of the jews, their blood was to be the political salvation of zionism"" (p.238).   &gt; ""according to lenni brenner's online book zionism in the age of dictators (ch.7), the zionist party was the only other political party in nazi germany that enjoyed a measure of freedom, and could publish a newspaper.   &gt; the reason: zionists and nazis had a common interest, making german jews go to palestine.""  -- henry makow, phd.  the ""jews not zionists"" site has documents that indicate that zionists were instrumental in preventing other countries from accepting jewish refugees.  they insisted that all refugees be sent to palestine, which was closed to more refugees.  http://www.jewsnotzionists.org/holocaust.htm -- zionism and the holocaust  http://digg.com/world_news/israel_s_president_resigns_over_sex_crimes?t=7486735#c7507021 -- zionist contempt for the victims of hitler  after the war, zionists wrapped the mantle of ""the holocaust"" around themselves and posed as ""victims"" when in fact they were allied with the victimizers, both ideologically and in deed.  we see something similar today, when bush wraps the mantle of 9/11 around himself, when it is actually his regime that, at the very least, allowed 9/11 to happen.   .  zionists wrote the book on terror in the middle east.  see  http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0151/vest.php  &gt;from the irv rubin bust to the stern gang:   &gt;the rich history of jewish terrorism / oy mcvey  &gt; by jason vest / dec 19 - 25, 2001  &gt;....   they went on to sponsor terrorists and terrorist organizations -- notably:   * abu nidal,  * hamas, and now, it seems,  * the pflp.    and when that fails to create the right climate, zionists use sadism, humiliation and murder to provoke terror.      .  zionists are, in effect, operating a ""protection racket"".   terror is all that keeps them in power.  they use it, they sponsor it, they provoke it.    .  &gt; [israel] must see the sword as the main, if not the only, instrument with which to keep its morale high and to retain its moral tension.   &gt;toward this end it may, no-it must-invent dangers, and to do this it must adopt the method of provocation-and-revenge.. .   &gt;and above all-let us hope for a new war with the arab countries, so that we may finally get rid of our troubles and acquire our space.  -- moshe dayan, quoted in israeli prime minister moshe sharatt's personal diaries for may 1955   dayan describes how this works in practice:  &gt; moshe dayan, the celebrated commander who, as defense minister in 1967, gave the order to conquer the golan... [said] many of the firefights with the syrians were deliberately provoked by israel, and the kibbutz residents who pressed the government to take the golan heights did so less for security than for the farmland... [dayan stated]  &gt; they didn't even try to hide their greed for that land... we would send a tractor to plow some area where it wasn't possible to do anything, in the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the syrians would start to shoot. if they didn't shoot, we would tell the tractor to advance further, until in the end the syrians would get annoyed and shoot. and then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and that's how it was... the syrians, on the fourth day of the war, were not a threat to us.'  -- the new york times, 11 may 1997  if jews and non-jews were ever to unite, zionists would be out of business and many would be put on trial for war crimes.  that is a good reason for genuine jews, muslims and christians to unite.",0,,

524918,"black criminal culture is reflected and perpetrated by media aimed at black consumers.  it's hard to deny that rap and hip-hop glorify the criminal lifestyle, even if many of the fans aren't criminals.  so the way that black culture presents itself to the public certainly puts the spotlight on the criminal aspect of it.  also i think it's important to realize that american black culture is much newer than american white culture.  whites have cultural roots going back to whatever country their ancestors immigrated from, whereas most blacks in america are descended from slaves.  slaves, for the most part, had their culture stolen from them.  a bunch of people from different nations and tribes of africa were all grouped together and forced to abandon what little pieces of their cultures they could remember.  essentially the black community had to start a new culture while they were almost all slaves. even after emancipation, they were largely facing the same collective situation of poverty and prejudice.    so the black population's relatively small size and common background results in a relatively homogenous culture.  i guess what i'm trying to say is that black culture is more pervasive within the black population, including the black crime culture.   it's easier for whites to distance themselves from the white criminal culture because whites have a larger passed-down history to identify with.  white culture contains so many blended european cultures that it ultimately doesn't seem like a particular culture at all.  white people come from wealthy and poor backgrounds, and carried over the cultures of many different peoples (for example puritans vs anglicans vs catholics).   also, just being the same color allowed white immigrants to assimilate much more easily. the irish, italians, and jews were all viewed as low-life criminals when they first started immigrating to the us, but with time they assimilated into the white population and they were less tied down to their previous culture.  a white person from a liberal yuppie new york background can move to texas and easily join the cowboy culture and find many other white people doing the same.  therefore the perception is ""not all white people are cowboys, not all white people are yuppies"".  even though there is a white cowboy culture and a white yuppie culture, a white person isn't assumed to be either.  there is pressure to be a cowboy if you're white in rural texas, a much smaller community than ""white america.""  like rural texas, the black community is much smaller and homogeneous than the entire white population.  much like texans are expected to be conservative, christian, listen to country, black americans are expected to listen to rap, use drugs, and commit crimes.  if someone from texas wanted to act otherwise, they'd be seen as somewhat un-texan, but still acting white.  if a black person defies these negative stereotypes, they are seen as acting un-black.    given time, the black population will spread and diversify, and what it means to ""be black"" will become much wider.  gradually ""being a criminal"" will not be seen as a part of ""blackness.""    think about this, what if when we thought of black people, we included all of the black africans? suddenly being black has nothing to do with being ghetto or committing crime or even speaking english.  using that definition of black culture, it's like there isn't a black culture at all.  the difference for whites is that ""white"" doesn't mean ""the 13% of americans who descended from poor white southerners 200 years ago"", it means ""most of the western world.""  ""black"" however refers to a very specific group of people that has historically experienced very similar and adverse living conditions.",1,0,0

872289,"&gt; are you suggesting that the u.s. government should regulate commerce by taking more money away from those who are engaging in commerce? and protect humanity's right to be taxed?  in this society, we _all_ engage in commerce. and, in order to finance its activities, and meet its obligations, the government takes money from all of us.   the question is, how much from whom? if you're really interested in healthy commerce, the general welfare of people, and human rights, then you have to address the problems that exist in our economic system.   the concentration of wealth is one of those problems.   you may be unaware of this, but a significant portion of the population in ""the richest country on earth,"" is living is such extreme poverty that they cannot afford to feed themselves well enough to avoid malnourishment. yes, people starve in america. even the current administration estimates that this is roughly 15% of the population.  those of us who aren't living like that are, most likely, living in perpetual debt. but _each_ of the people buffett was speaking to has more money than most _nations_.  no one's even _suggesting_ complete economic equity here. we're discussing an obscene inequity that causes a great deal of suffering and economic stagnation. what buffett is talking about is one way to mitigate it, namely, progressive taxation.",0,,
224037,"most blacks in america started with a lot less than nothing, and it was pretty hard to change that by working. after the civil war, they were systematically discriminated against, and driven into cycles of debt by predatory lending in the sharecropping industry, and hiring discrimination in other industries. some moved either north or west, and those people tended to do somewhat better, but the same point about comparing a population of willing immigrants from the general population also applies there.  a generation is about 20 years. if you assume that systemic racism was ended by the civil rights act of 1964 (which is not the case) blacks have had a shot for less than 3.  asians were also heavily discriminated against until the end of wwii (chinese discrimination was mostly ended during the war, japanese discrimination was obviously worse during and after than it had been before, and lasted as a major force until the mid 50s. with the exception of 1870-1920 for the chinese, and wwii for the japanese, discrimination was generally less severe.  in the south for example, frequent targets of lynchings were blacks who had managed to accumulate money. in the west, lynchings of asians were not uncommon, but tended to focus on the poor, rather than the rich. there also were simply many more lynchings of blacks. blacks were also targeted for undertaking military service, because it made them ""uppity."" for asians, military service was seen as a positive thing by whites.  as another example, while it took the japanese 40 years to get reparations for the internment, former slaves never got anything.  the discrepancy really starts to explode as immigration from asia does. asian immigrants from china skew surprisingly wealthy, partially because the chinese quota was given equally to taiwan and hong kong in '79 (before that only people from taiwan could immigrate)  in 2012, 400,000 asians immigrated into the us, and a quarter were chinese, who again were generally fairly well off. another 30,000 came from south korea and japan, which are also well off.   on the other hand, around 100,000 africans immigrated to the u.s., and over 70,000 of them are listed as coming from other african countries, with around 10,000 coming from egypt, and 6,000 coming from south africa and morocco.   proportionally then, around 30% of asian immigrants come from reasonably wealthy countries, and 15% from africa do. in absolute terms, many more middle-class-wealthy asians come to the us than africans.",1,,1
581443,"&gt;so if the us denied iran use of it's airspace or the erie canal, they would be within their rights to attack us militarily?  this is completely inane analogy. the suez canal was an international zone until nasser nationalized it. when he denied passage to israeli ships, he effectively cut off the whole south of the country.   also, as i mentioned, there were constant, daily attacks by egyptian based forces at israeli towns. if the us would constantly attack irani towns, i suppose it would give iran right to respond - and i dare say most readers here would agree.  here are a few of egypt and syria's pre 1967 threats:  ""we shall not enter palestine with its soil covered in sand, we shall enter it with its soil saturated in blood"" - president of egypt, gamal abdel nasser   ""the battle has come in which we shall destroy israel."" - cairo radio (egyptian state radio) broadcast  ""arab masses, this is your day. rush to the battlefield...let them know that we shall hang the last imperialist soldier with the entrails of the last zionist."" - damascus radio (syrian state radio) broadcast  http://www.bicom.org.uk/six_day_war/s/2472/existential-threat-quotes-from-arab-national-leaders-and-media-outlets-calling-for-the-total-destruction-of-israel-in-may-and-june-1967/",0,,

685309,"god, what a clueless dipshit to post something like this.  motormouth joe biden: warmonger, wordmonger, and political hit man   by webster g. tarpley   washington dc, august 24, 2008 â€“ the vice presidential candidate chosen to run with obama is senator joe biden of delaware, a discredited, sleazy, and shopworn political hack -- and therefore an anti-climax for all the callow and feckless youth who got the word via text message at 3am in the morning. the ability of the trilateral-bilderberg machine which controls obama to put up a person like biden already reflects the further degradation of us political life over the past 9-12 months, largely as a result of obamaâ€™s own demagogic, no-issues, personality cult agitation.   a year ago, there was wide agreement in the us middle class that bush and cheney should be impeached, that the police state be rolled back, and that the iraq war should be ended as soon as physically possible. thanks largely to the advent of the vapid and messianic obama, these issues have now been thoroughly deflated. biden is himself an incurable warmonger who voted for the iraq war and blathered ceaselessly in favor of bushâ€™s aggressive adventure to all who would listen. naming biden is a brutal insult to the antiwar majority of the democratic party, and obama is obviously hoping that the iraq war issue is dead, so nobody will care. last year, obama promised that he would work against the mentality that produced iraq; if anyone incarnates that mentality, it is biden. biden is an incurable imperialist and an eager advocate of the discredited bush-cheney â€œwar on terror.â€ he even tried to use one of the democratic debates last year to whip up hysteria in favor of attacking sudan over the darfur issue, and with some success. ""i went there. i sat in the borders. i went in those camps. they're going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die. we've got to stop talking and act,"" biden postured in manchester new hampshire on june 3, 2007 in an apparent call for bombing sudan, a coup in khartoum, or an invasion. incredibly, the crowd applauded wildly.    biden remains convinced that it is up to the united states to dictate the form of government and economic system of virtually every country in the world. his specialty is blatant interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, with left-cover of soft power issues like human rights and humanitarian concerns furnishing his favorite pretexts. biden has learned nothing from the iraq debacle except that iraq was not the right victim; more appropriate victims and more effective methods will have to be found, argues biden. the real lesson of iraq (and lebanon 2006) is that us-british imperialism and world domination are finished historically, but this is lost on biden.   biden is the author of the odious plan to balkanize, partition, and subdivide iraq into three zones: a kurdish state designed to carve up iran, syria and turkey as well as iraq; a landlocked and oil-poor sunni desert entity; and an oil-rich shiastan in the south that might absorb the arabistan or achwaz province of iran is a later breakup scenario for iran. bidenâ€™s plan is a continuation of the bernard lewis plan to break up the existing states of the middle east in a way destined to create a mosaic of pseudo-independent, squabbling mini-states or micro-states. this approach places biden squarely behind the zbigniew brzezinski â€œdignityâ€ doctrine of breaking up the existing nation states of the world in favor of a crazy quilt of micro-states based on ethnic and religious parochialism and particularism; not one of these micro-states could stand up to exxon-mobil or jp morgan chase.   biden is morally insane on georgia   bidenâ€™s ample track record as an agent provocateur against russia goes back more than a decade to the time he mobilized his mouth to help demonize milosevic of serbia as part of the albright-holbrooke-wesley clark anti-russian campaign of those years, which ended with the nato bombing of serbia, an act of unprecedented historical vandalism. in the past week, warmonger biden has rushed to the side of the latest tin pot mini-mussolini of the brzezinski-soros faction, the infamous war criminal and gangster mikhail saakashvili of georgia. ""i left the country convinced that russia's invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism,â€ raved biden on his return, documenting his own moral insanity by siding with the aggressor. ""the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russia's invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers, and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region,â€ added the orwellian senator.   biden: $1 billion for madman saakashvili   in presenting biden, barky reveled in bidenâ€™s â€œtough messageâ€ for russia; we are sure putin is trembling. biden wants to prop up the madman saakashvili with $1 billion of the us taxpayersâ€™ money, a gesture which is every bit as obscene as the worst bush-cheney excesses. $1 billion would get us on the road to fully funding a program like wic (high-protein foods for expectant mothers) or head start, but this thought does not occur to biden when he is trying to provoke russia. we can see the cruel elitism of a financier-controlled obama regime taking place before our eyes.    obama and biden resemble each other closely, both are insufferable windbags besotted with their own rhetorical verbiage. bidenâ€™s celebrated gaffes will provide comic relief, as long as they do not gaffe us into world war iii, which is always a distinct possibility. obama and biden are addicted to the sound of their own voices, and this may turn out to be the fatal flaw that sinks them when the voters get sick of the endless parade of speeches. obama and biden are in danger of drowning in their own endless blabber. each one has more than a touch of megalomania, which prevents them from seeing their limits. bidenâ€™s middle name is robinette, which is close to the term for a faucet tap in french. biden has never been able to find the tap to turn off his own mouth.   two plagiarists on the democratic ticket   obama and biden are both plagiarists; words are their stock in trade, and even the words are fake. it emerged this spring that obama was spouting verbatim the canned speeches of governor deval patrick of massachusetts, his fellow clone from the trilateral stable. biden is a picaresque paladin of plagiarism. his 1988 presidential campaign was aborted when he was found to have stolen paragraphs of a speech by the labour party leader, neil kinnock. he had also embroidered his campaign biography. biden had also been guilty of plagiarism at the syracuse university law school which he attended, but he had somehow talked his way out of those charges.   biden a creature of the worst credit card gougers   biden represents delaware in the us senate. delaware is not a state, but a giant post box for dupont, general motors, and many of the giant corporations and wall street firms. the state politics of delaware are dictated down to the most minute detail by the bankers and their corporate lackeys, since everything depends on keeping a pro-oligarchical political climate in the state. biden personally is a tool of mbna, a credit card issuer that was recently absorbed by the bank of america, which presumably now also owns biden. biden got at least $215,000 from mbna over the past decade. mbna is notoriously one of the biggest predatory lenders and interest rate gougers in the entire usurious world of credit cards, and bidenâ€™s services to them are precisely in this area: biden was a big supporter of the 2005 bankruptcy law which makes it much harder for working families to escape debt bondage and debt slavery â€“ just what the looters at mbna ordered. biden has also boasted that he wrote the ban on assault weapons, a measure that is sure to cause problems among the bitter clingers of appalachia who are concerned about gun ownership.    obama has voted for the rotten compromise on fisa illegal wiretaps ordered by bush that grants retroactive immunity to the telecoms. biden is also an enthusiastic police state totalitarian. in 1995, after the oklahoma city false flag bombing, biden submitted an oppressive police state bill, in many ways a precursor of bushâ€™s infamous patriot act. ""i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing,â€ boasts biden. â€œand the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill."" bidenâ€™s only regret is that he was not able to undermine political freedom as much as he wanted to.    obamaâ€™s drooling acolytes have argued all summer that to name senator clinton to the ticket would negate barkyâ€™s profile of youth, change, hope, and so forth. clinton has been a national figure for almost twenty years, but she has been dumped in favor of biden, who has been in the us senate for about 36 years and is about as stale and hackneyed as a political figure could be. the difference is that bidenâ€™s track record established him as an obedient servant of the wall street banks that have their post box headquarters in his state; the clintons, by contrast, represent the closest thing we have to political combination not wholly owned by wall street and capable of saying no to the bankers when they demand austerity and aggression, as they are assuredly doing now. rockefeller and soros do not want sen. clinton in the presidential succession under any circumstances, and this is an important positive qualification for the new york senator.   beau biden, the corrupt attorney general of delaware   joe bidenâ€™s son is.. read the rest here: http://www.rense.com/general83/biden.htm",0,,

606450,"motormouth joe biden: warmonger, wordmonger, and political hit man http://www.rense.com/general83/biden.htm  by webster g. tarpley washington dc, august 24, 2008 â€“ the vice presidential candidate chosen to run with obama is senator joe biden of delaware, a discredited, sleazy, and shopworn political hack -- and therefore an anti-climax for all the callow and feckless youth who got the word via text message at 3am in the morning. the ability of the trilateral-bilderberg machine which controls obama to put up a person like biden already reflects the further degradation of us political life over the past 9-12 months, largely as a result of obamaâ€™s own demagogic, no-issues, personality cult agitation.   a year ago, there was wide agreement in the us middle class that bush and cheney should be impeached, that the police state be rolled back, and that the iraq war should be ended as soon as physically possible. thanks largely to the advent of the vapid and messianic obama, these issues have now been thoroughly deflated. biden is himself an incurable warmonger who voted for the iraq war and blathered ceaselessly in favor of bushâ€™s aggressive adventure to all who would listen. naming biden is a brutal insult to the antiwar majority of the democratic party, and obama is obviously hoping that the iraq war issue is dead, so nobody will care. last year, obama promised that he would work against the mentality that produced iraq; if anyone incarnates that mentality, it is biden. biden is an incurable imperialist and an eager advocate of the discredited bush-cheney â€œwar on terror.â€ he even tried to use one of the democratic debates last year to whip up hysteria in favor of attacking sudan over the darfur issue, and with some success. ""i went there. i sat in the borders. i went in those camps. they're going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die. we've got to stop talking and act,"" biden postured in manchester new hampshire on june 3, 2007 in an apparent call for bombing sudan, a coup in khartoum, or an invasion. incredibly, the crowd applauded wildly.    biden remains convinced that it is up to the united states to dictate the form of government and economic system of virtually every country in the world. his specialty is blatant interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, with left-cover of soft power issues like human rights and humanitarian concerns furnishing his favorite pretexts. biden has learned nothing from the iraq debacle except that iraq was not the right victim; more appropriate victims and more effective methods will have to be found, argues biden. the real lesson of iraq (and lebanon 2006) is that us-british imperialism and world domination are finished historically, but this is lost on biden.   biden is the author of the odious plan to balkanize, partition, and subdivide iraq into three zones: a kurdish state designed to carve up iran, syria and turkey as well as iraq; a landlocked and oil-poor sunni desert entity; and an oil-rich shiastan in the south that might absorb the arabistan or achwaz province of iran is a later breakup scenario for iran. bidenâ€™s plan is a continuation of the bernard lewis plan to break up the existing states of the middle east in a way destined to create a mosaic of pseudo-independent, squabbling mini-states or micro-states. this approach places biden squarely behind the zbigniew brzezinski â€œdignityâ€ doctrine of breaking up the existing nation states of the world in favor of a crazy quilt of micro-states based on ethnic and religious parochialism and particularism; not one of these micro-states could stand up to exxon-mobil or jp morgan chase.   biden is morally insane on georgia   bidenâ€™s ample track record as an agent provocateur against russia goes back more than a decade to the time he mobilized his mouth to help demonize milosevic of serbia as part of the albright-holbrooke-wesley clark anti-russian campaign of those years, which ended with the nato bombing of serbia, an act of unprecedented historical vandalism. in the past week, warmonger biden has rushed to the side of the latest tin pot mini-mussolini of the brzezinski-soros faction, the infamous war criminal and gangster mikhail saakashvili of georgia. ""i left the country convinced that russia's invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism,â€ raved biden on his return, documenting his own moral insanity by siding with the aggressor. ""the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russia's invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers, and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region,â€ added the orwellian senator.   biden: $1 billion for madman saakashvili   in presenting biden, barky reveled in bidenâ€™s â€œtough messageâ€ for russia; we are sure putin is trembling. biden wants to prop up the madman saakashvili with $1 billion of the us taxpayersâ€™ money, a gesture which is every bit as obscene as the worst bush-cheney excesses. $1 billion would get us on the road to fully funding a program like wic (high-protein foods for expectant mothers) or head start, but this thought does not occur to biden when he is trying to provoke russia. we can see the cruel elitism of a financier-controlled obama regime taking place before our eyes.    obama and biden resemble each other closely, both are insufferable windbags besotted with their own rhetorical verbiage. bidenâ€™s celebrated gaffes will provide comic relief, as long as they do not gaffe us into world war iii, which is always a distinct possibility. obama and biden are addicted to the sound of their own voices, and this may turn out to be the fatal flaw that sinks them when the voters get sick of the endless parade of speeches. obama and biden are in danger of drowning in their own endless blabber. each one has more than a touch of megalomania, which prevents them from seeing their limits. bidenâ€™s middle name is robinette, which is close to the term for a faucet tap in french. biden has never been able to find the tap to turn off his own mouth.   two plagiarists on the democratic ticket   obama and biden are both plagiarists; words are their stock in trade, and even the words are fake. it emerged this spring that obama was spouting verbatim the canned speeches of governor deval patrick of massachusetts, his fellow clone from the trilateral stable. biden is a picaresque paladin of plagiarism. his 1988 presidential campaign was aborted when he was found to have stolen paragraphs of a speech by the labour party leader, neil kinnock. he had also embroidered his campaign biography. biden had also been guilty of plagiarism at the syracuse university law school which he attended, but he had somehow talked his way out of those charges.   biden a creature of the worst credit card gougers   biden represents delaware in the us senate. delaware is not a state, but a giant post box for dupont, general motors, and many of the giant corporations and wall street firms. the state politics of delaware are dictated down to the most minute detail by the bankers and their corporate lackeys, since everything depends on keeping a pro-oligarchical political climate in the state. biden personally is a tool of mbna, a credit card issuer that was recently absorbed by the bank of america, which presumably now also owns biden. biden got at least $215,000 from mbna over the past decade. mbna is notoriously one of the biggest predatory lenders and interest rate gougers in the entire usurious world of credit cards, and bidenâ€™s services to them are precisely in this area: biden was a big supporter of the 2005 bankruptcy law which makes it much harder for working families to escape debt bondage and debt slavery â€“ just what the looters at mbna ordered. biden has also boasted that he wrote the ban on assault weapons, a measure that is sure to cause problems among the bitter clingers of appalachia who are concerned about gun ownership.    obama has voted for the rotten compromise on fisa illegal wiretaps ordered by bush that grants retroactive immunity to the telecoms. biden is also an enthusiastic police state totalitarian. in 1995, after the oklahoma city false flag bombing, biden submitted an oppressive police state bill, in many ways a precursor of bushâ€™s infamous patriot act. ""i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing,â€ boasts biden. â€œand the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill."" bidenâ€™s only regret is that he was not able to undermine political freedom as much as he wanted to.    obamaâ€™s drooling acolytes have argued all summer that to name senator clinton to the ticket would negate barkyâ€™s profile of youth, change, hope, and so forth. clinton has been a national figure for almost twenty years, but she has been dumped in favor of biden, who has been in the us senate for about 36 years and is about as stale and hackneyed as a political figure could be. the difference is that bidenâ€™s track record established him as an obedient servant of the wall street banks that have their post box headquarters in his state; the clintons, by contrast, represent the closest thing we have to political combination not wholly owned by wall street and capable of saying no to the bankers when they demand austerity and aggression, as they are assuredly doing now. rockefeller and soros do not want sen. clinton in the presidential succession under any circumstances, and this is an important positive qualification for the new york senator. read the rest here: http://www.rense.com/general83/biden.htm",0,,

353340,"this may just serve as a disagreement, however - in my opinion, capitalistic societies do that because they force capitalism on societies that aren't capitalistic.  in order for anyone to be rich - someone has to be poor (just remember that poor is a relative term). that is quite simply the way it is, the two things are dependent on each other and are mutually exclusive. the us, as a country, is rich (in general, most of our average poor person lives better than a lot of country's middle class... i wouldn't say better than their rich though) - because of other poor countries. i'm not going to say that the us has taken advantage of every poor country - some of them, unfortunately, have brought it on themselves - but it has come at the expense of many people.  the -world- is a capitalistic society. i don't think that, currently, there is any country that is immune from capitalism... and the ones that try to be get punished by the capitalist countries. everyone is part of it. in capitalism there are winners and losers on every scale. productivity has a lot of roots in opportunity, and as a us citizen, you have significantly more opportunity to be more productive than people in some third world countries. this is the biggest down side in capitalism - everyone should -start- equal, and then through their contributions they get their higher capital... they do not, currently. capitalist ""countries"" enhance the richness of their people by pushing the poor out of sight and out of mind. in other words, in order for the american standard of living (even for its poor people) to be as high as it is, which is significantly better than most countries, there have to be other countries that are being taken advantage of to do this. and while it's easy to say ""it's their government's fault"" (and in many cases it is), many individuals in these countries don't really have any way to have a realistic influence over what their government does - so they are simply thrown away by the world-based society.",0,,

816824,"&gt;very poor people that feel very entitled to their handout programs, and a number of rich people that feel very entitled to their low tax rates.  there is a big difference between those two things.  a handout is literally paid for with money that was taken from someone else. a low tax rate is not something that rich people are ""given"" from someone else that had to work for it, but it is simply the government saying ""you can keep the majority of what you've earned for yourself.""  if you wanted to make a valid comparison, you should compare actual handouts that rich people get, which probably are very few. or, compare the federal income taxes of wealthy people to poor people. my guess is that poor people would bitch just as much or more if you tried to raise their taxes, as rich people do today when the same happens to them.  don't compare a low tax rate with a handout; they are fundamentally different things. the only way a low tax rate could be misconstrued as ""a handout"" from the government is if you somehow abide by the notion that the government literally owns you as a slave and thus anything it doesn't take from you is a so-called ""gift"".  (this argument would be like shooting someone in the leg and then claiming that you gave him the gift of not being shot in the head instead, and that he should be thankful for it)  &gt;the main difference between the two i think is that the wealthy has the resources to act forcibly on their sense of entitlement, and provide the least benefit to the average citizen (unless one subscribes to the idea of trickle down economics)  while i understand what you mean and this is true to an extent, the poor people do have one thing that the rich do not: more votes, and thus potentially larger representation in government.",0,,

722356,"motormouth joe biden: warmonger, wordmonger, and political hit man http://www.rense.com/general83/biden.htm  by webster g. tarpley washington dc, august 24, 2008 â€“ the vice presidential candidate chosen to run with obama is senator joe biden of delaware, a discredited, sleazy, and shopworn political hack -- and therefore an anti-climax for all the callow and feckless youth who got the word via text message at 3am in the morning. the ability of the trilateral-bilderberg machine which controls obama to put up a person like biden already reflects the further degradation of us political life over the past 9-12 months, largely as a result of obamaâ€™s own demagogic, no-issues, personality cult agitation.   a year ago, there was wide agreement in the us middle class that bush and cheney should be impeached, that the police state be rolled back, and that the iraq war should be ended as soon as physically possible. thanks largely to the advent of the vapid and messianic obama, these issues have now been thoroughly deflated. biden is himself an incurable warmonger who voted for the iraq war and blathered ceaselessly in favor of bushâ€™s aggressive adventure to all who would listen. naming biden is a brutal insult to the antiwar majority of the democratic party, and obama is obviously hoping that the iraq war issue is dead, so nobody will care. last year, obama promised that he would work against the mentality that produced iraq; if anyone incarnates that mentality, it is biden. biden is an incurable imperialist and an eager advocate of the discredited bush-cheney â€œwar on terror.â€ he even tried to use one of the democratic debates last year to whip up hysteria in favor of attacking sudan over the darfur issue, and with some success. ""i went there. i sat in the borders. i went in those camps. they're going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die. we've got to stop talking and act,"" biden postured in manchester new hampshire on june 3, 2007 in an apparent call for bombing sudan, a coup in khartoum, or an invasion. incredibly, the crowd applauded wildly.    biden remains convinced that it is up to the united states to dictate the form of government and economic system of virtually every country in the world. his specialty is blatant interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, with left-cover of soft power issues like human rights and humanitarian concerns furnishing his favorite pretexts. biden has learned nothing from the iraq debacle except that iraq was not the right victim; more appropriate victims and more effective methods will have to be found, argues biden. the real lesson of iraq (and lebanon 2006) is that us-british imperialism and world domination are finished historically, but this is lost on biden.   biden is the author of the odious plan to balkanize, partition, and subdivide iraq into three zones: a kurdish state designed to carve up iran, syria and turkey as well as iraq; a landlocked and oil-poor sunni desert entity; and an oil-rich shiastan in the south that might absorb the arabistan or achwaz province of iran is a later breakup scenario for iran. bidenâ€™s plan is a continuation of the bernard lewis plan to break up the existing states of the middle east in a way destined to create a mosaic of pseudo-independent, squabbling mini-states or micro-states. this approach places biden squarely behind the zbigniew brzezinski â€œdignityâ€ doctrine of breaking up the existing nation states of the world in favor of a crazy quilt of micro-states based on ethnic and religious parochialism and particularism; not one of these micro-states could stand up to exxon-mobil or jp morgan chase.   biden is morally insane on georgia   bidenâ€™s ample track record as an agent provocateur against russia goes back more than a decade to the time he mobilized his mouth to help demonize milosevic of serbia as part of the albright-holbrooke-wesley clark anti-russian campaign of those years, which ended with the nato bombing of serbia, an act of unprecedented historical vandalism. in the past week, warmonger biden has rushed to the side of the latest tin pot mini-mussolini of the brzezinski-soros faction, the infamous war criminal and gangster mikhail saakashvili of georgia. ""i left the country convinced that russia's invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism,â€ raved biden on his return, documenting his own moral insanity by siding with the aggressor. ""the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russia's invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers, and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region,â€ added the orwellian senator.   biden: $1 billion for madman saakashvili   in presenting biden, barky reveled in bidenâ€™s â€œtough messageâ€ for russia; we are sure putin is trembling. biden wants to prop up the madman saakashvili with $1 billion of the us taxpayersâ€™ money, a gesture which is every bit as obscene as the worst bush-cheney excesses. $1 billion would get us on the road to fully funding a program like wic (high-protein foods for expectant mothers) or head start, but this thought does not occur to biden when he is trying to provoke russia. we can see the cruel elitism of a financier-controlled obama regime taking place before our eyes.    obama and biden resemble each other closely, both are insufferable windbags besotted with their own rhetorical verbiage. bidenâ€™s celebrated gaffes will provide comic relief, as long as they do not gaffe us into world war iii, which is always a distinct possibility. obama and biden are addicted to the sound of their own voices, and this may turn out to be the fatal flaw that sinks them when the voters get sick of the endless parade of speeches. obama and biden are in danger of drowning in their own endless blabber. each one has more than a touch of megalomania, which prevents them from seeing their limits. bidenâ€™s middle name is robinette, which is close to the term for a faucet tap in french. biden has never been able to find the tap to turn off his own mouth.   two plagiarists on the democratic ticket   obama and biden are both plagiarists; words are their stock in trade, and even the words are fake. it emerged this spring that obama was spouting verbatim the canned speeches of governor deval patrick of massachusetts, his fellow clone from the trilateral stable. biden is a picaresque paladin of plagiarism. his 1988 presidential campaign was aborted when he was found to have stolen paragraphs of a speech by the labour party leader, neil kinnock. he had also embroidered his campaign biography. biden had also been guilty of plagiarism at the syracuse university law school which he attended, but he had somehow talked his way out of those charges.   biden a creature of the worst credit card gougers   biden represents delaware in the us senate. delaware is not a state, but a giant post box for dupont, general motors, and many of the giant corporations and wall street firms. the state politics of delaware are dictated down to the most minute detail by the bankers and their corporate lackeys, since everything depends on keeping a pro-oligarchical political climate in the state. biden personally is a tool of mbna, a credit card issuer that was recently absorbed by the bank of america, which presumably now also owns biden. biden got at least $215,000 from mbna over the past decade. mbna is notoriously one of the biggest predatory lenders and interest rate gougers in the entire usurious world of credit cards, and bidenâ€™s services to them are precisely in this area: biden was a big supporter of the 2005 bankruptcy law which makes it much harder for working families to escape debt bondage and debt slavery â€“ just what the looters at mbna ordered. biden has also boasted that he wrote the ban on assault weapons, a measure that is sure to cause problems among the bitter clingers of appalachia who are concerned about gun ownership.    obama has voted for the rotten compromise on fisa illegal wiretaps ordered by bush that grants retroactive immunity to the telecoms. biden is also an enthusiastic police state totalitarian. in 1995, after the oklahoma city false flag bombing, biden submitted an oppressive police state bill, in many ways a precursor of bushâ€™s infamous patriot act. ""i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing,â€ boasts biden. â€œand the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill."" bidenâ€™s only regret is that he was not able to undermine political freedom as much as he wanted to.    obamaâ€™s drooling acolytes have argued all summer that to name senator clinton to the ticket would negate barkyâ€™s profile of youth, change, hope, and so forth. clinton has been a national figure for almost twenty years, but she has been dumped in favor of biden, who has been in the us senate for about 36 years and is about as stale and hackneyed as a political figure could be. the difference is that bidenâ€™s track record established him as an obedient servant of the wall street banks that have their post box headquarters in his state; the clintons, by contrast, represent the closest thing we have to political combination not wholly owned by wall street and capable of saying no to the bankers when they demand austerity and aggression, as they are assuredly doing now. rockefeller and soros do not want sen. clinton in the presidential succession under any circumstances, and this is an important positive qualification for the new york senator. read the rest here: http://www.rense.com/general83/biden.htm",0,,
208296,"&gt;yes, arab/muslim animus predates the settlements but not the creation of israel, not at the level we see today.  really? in 1948 there was violence from the arabs we now call palestinians. there was also over active attempts by egypt and jordan and syria and iraq and saudi and kuwait to destroy israel and push the jews into the sea. in 1967 egypt and jordan and syria tried. in 1973 it was egypt and syria. seems to me that the level of violence has actually dropped.   but here is the thing, those against israel keep re-defining the game. the fight has always been the existence of a jewish state in what was once the muslim world, the caliphate. but the big arab countries realized that the only thing that kept their capital cities standing was that israel refrained from leveling them when the arabs started a war. so the propaganda effort shifted. part of that shift was to call this a palestinian/israeli conflict instead of an arab/israeli conflict.   &gt;so the settlements are not the cause of the conflict, but they do serve to see it continually replenished.   ask hamas. they say the problem is that there are non-muslims running what should be muslim land. they say that the problem is that any land that was part of the caliphate belongs to the muslims. the palestinian textbooks show tel aviv as part of palestinian land.  &gt;there is no opportunity for any kind of reconciliation because israel possesses the superior military and therefore gets to dictate such terms,  so ""reconciliation"" can only come if the arabs dictate the terms? do you think a 40+ year campaign of terrorism against israeli civilians might have something to do with the problem? or is the only problem, in your mind, that israel keeps winning or, at least, not losing?  &gt;you would not object if the un suddenly and arbitrarily awarded tel aviv to some other country?  but that is your goal: to give tel aviv to hamas. i don't know what analogy you have here. there was a palestinian state set up,  for the first time in history, in 1948, and the **arabs** refused to accept it. it was **jordan** that annexed the west bank. but all you can see is that israel have the force to survive, so it is the cause of the problems.",0,,

""i went there. i sat in the borders. i went in those camps. they're going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die. we've got to stop talking and act,"" biden postured in manchester new hampshire on june 3, 2007 in an apparent call for bombing sudan, a coup in khartoum, or an invasion. incredibly, the crowd applauded wildly.    biden remains convinced that it is up to the united states to dictate the form of government and economic system of virtually every country in the world. his specialty is blatant interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, with left-cover of soft power issues like human rights and humanitarian concerns furnishing his favorite pretexts. biden has learned nothing from the iraq debacle except that iraq was not the right victim; more appropriate victims and more effective methods will have to be found, argues biden. the real lesson of iraq (and lebanon 2006) is that us-british imperialism and world domination are finished historically, but this is lost on biden.   biden is the author of the odious plan to balkanize, partition, and subdivide iraq into three zones: a kurdish state designed to carve up iran, syria and turkey as well as iraq; a landlocked and oil-poor sunni desert entity; and an oil-rich shiastan in the south that might absorb the arabistan or achwaz province of iran is a later breakup scenario for iran. bidenâ€™s plan is a continuation of the bernard lewis plan to break up the existing states of the middle east in a way destined to create a mosaic of pseudo-independent, squabbling mini-states or micro-states. this approach places biden squarely behind the zbigniew brzezinski â€œdignityâ€ doctrine of breaking up the existing nation states of the world in favor of a crazy quilt of micro-states based on ethnic and religious parochialism and particularism; not one of these micro-states could stand up to exxon-mobil or jp morgan chase.   biden is morally insane on georgia   bidenâ€™s ample track record as an agent provocateur against russia goes back more than a decade to the time he mobilized his mouth to help demonize milosevic of serbia as part of the albright-holbrooke-wesley clark anti-russian campaign of those years, which ended with the nato bombing of serbia, an act of unprecedented historical vandalism. in the past week, warmonger biden has rushed to the side of the latest tin pot mini-mussolini of the brzezinski-soros faction, the infamous war criminal and gangster mikhail saakashvili of georgia. ""i left the country convinced that russia's invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism,â€ raved biden on his return, documenting his own moral insanity by siding with the aggressor. ""the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russia's invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers, and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region,â€ added the orwellian senator.   biden: $1 billion for madman saakashvili   in presenting biden, barky reveled in bidenâ€™s â€œtough messageâ€ for russia; we are sure putin is trembling. biden wants to prop up the madman saakashvili with $1 billion of the us taxpayersâ€™ money, a gesture which is every bit as obscene as the worst bush-cheney excesses. $1 billion would get us on the road to fully funding a program like wic (high-protein foods for expectant mothers) or head start, but this thought does not occur to biden when he is trying to provoke russia. we can see the cruel elitism of a financier-controlled obama regime taking place before our eyes.    obama and biden resemble each other closely, both are insufferable windbags besotted with their own rhetorical verbiage. bidenâ€™s celebrated gaffes will provide comic relief, as long as they do not gaffe us into world war iii, which is always a distinct possibility. obama and biden are addicted to the sound of their own voices, and this may turn out to be the fatal flaw that sinks them when the voters get sick of the endless parade of speeches. obama and biden are in danger of drowning in their own endless blabber. each one has more than a touch of megalomania, which prevents them from seeing their limits. bidenâ€™s middle name is robinette, which is close to the term for a faucet tap in french. biden has never been able to find the tap to turn off his own mouth.   two plagiarists on the democratic ticket   obama and biden are both plagiarists; words are their stock in trade, and even the words are fake. it emerged this spring that obama was spouting verbatim the canned speeches of governor deval patrick of massachusetts, his fellow clone from the trilateral stable. biden is a picaresque paladin of plagiarism. his 1988 presidential campaign was aborted when he was found to have stolen paragraphs of a speech by the labour party leader, neil kinnock. he had also embroidered his campaign biography. biden had also been guilty of plagiarism at the syracuse university law school which he attended, but he had somehow talked his way out of those charges.   biden a creature of the worst credit card gougers   biden represents delaware in the us senate. delaware is not a state, but a giant post box for dupont, general motors, and many of the giant corporations and wall street firms. the state politics of delaware are dictated down to the most minute detail by the bankers and their corporate lackeys, since everything depends on keeping a pro-oligarchical political climate in the state. biden personally is a tool of mbna, a credit card issuer that was recently absorbed by the bank of america, which presumably now also owns biden. biden got at least $215,000 from mbna over the past decade. mbna is notoriously one of the biggest predatory lenders and interest rate gougers in the entire usurious world of credit cards, and bidenâ€™s services to them are precisely in this area: biden was a big supporter of the 2005 bankruptcy law which makes it much harder for working families to escape debt bondage and debt slavery â€“ just what the looters at mbna ordered. biden has also boasted that he wrote the ban on assault weapons, a measure that is sure to cause problems among the bitter clingers of appalachia who are concerned about gun ownership.    obama has voted for the rotten compromise on fisa illegal wiretaps ordered by bush that grants retroactive immunity to the telecoms. biden is also an enthusiastic police state totalitarian. in 1995, after the oklahoma city false flag bombing, biden submitted an oppressive police state bill, in many ways a precursor of bushâ€™s infamous patriot act. ""i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing,â€ boasts biden. â€œand the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill."" bidenâ€™s only regret is that he was not able to undermine political freedom as much as he wanted to.    obamaâ€™s drooling acolytes have argued all summer that to name senator clinton to the ticket would negate barkyâ€™s profile of youth, change, hope, and so forth. clinton has been a national figure for almost twenty years, but she has been dumped in favor of biden, who has been in the us senate for about 36 years and is about as stale and hackneyed as a political figure could be. the difference is that bidenâ€™s track record established him as an obedient servant of the wall street banks that have their post box headquarters in his state; the clintons, by contrast, represent the closest thing we have to political combination not wholly owned by wall street and capable of saying no to the bankers when they demand austerity and aggression, as they are assuredly doing now. rockefeller and soros do not want sen. clinton in the presidential succession under any circumstances, and this is an important positive qualification for the new york senator.   beau biden, the corrupt attorney general of delaware   joe bidenâ€™s son is.. read the rest here: http://www.rense.com/general83/biden.htm",0,,

""that's not leadership. that's not going to happen,"" he added. if india and china's ""carbon footprint gets as big as ours, we're gone."" (afp)  this remarkable statement reveals the true program of a future obama administration: savage austerity, brutal economic sacrifice, and a massive further reduction in the standard of living of the depleted and exhausted us population as demanded by david rockefeller, george soros, and obama's wall street backers. this will be done under left cover through a global warming tax, a third world solidarity tax, and other demagogic frauds, with the revenue going to bail out goldman sachs, citibank, and jp morgan chase. the tired, discredited post-9/11 ""war on terror"" slogans will be dumped. ..continued here http://www.rense.com/general82/obm.htm  this jives perfectly with biden calling for a draft and a new world order:  http://100777.com/node/1291  the united states would ""have to face"" a painful dilemma on restoring the military draft as rising casualties saw the number of volunteers dry up, a senator warned today.  joseph biden, the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee, made the prediction after new data released by the pentagon showed the us army failing to meet its recruitment targets for four straight months.  ""we're going to have to face that question,"" he said on nbc's meet the press tv show when asked if it was realistic to expect restoration of the draft.

(i will give you the ""official story/stories"" and leave out my biased view).   on 9/11, 19 muslim extremists hijacked 4 planes and crashed into the wtc, the pentagon, and a field in pennsylvania which was believed to be on its way to the white house or capital building. this attack was orchestrated by a terrorist network called al-qaeda led by the late osama bin laden in response to the us support of israel, the us sanctions on iraq during the gulf war, and us military bases on the muslim holy land in saudi arabia. this led the government to start the war on terrorism. the united states then invaded afghanistan due to the taliban regimes housing and support of al-qaeda. the war on terror has also been expanded to pakistan, somalia, yemen, and some others.  iraq: shortly after 9/11, the us government was suspicious about the activities of iraqi dictator saddam hussein. the us had previously gone to war with iraq in the 90s due to the iraqi invasion of kuwait. several accusations were made against his government including having connections and supporting al-qaeda, and developing weapons of mass destruction( nukes, chemical weapons ect) that could potentially endanger the us. in 2003 the united states invaded iraq, overthrowing the government and occupying the country until 2011. it turned out that the bush administration was wrong and iraq had no connection to 9/11 or al-qaeda and was not producing and wmds. this led to a lot of controversy and many people think that the bush administration deliberately mislead the public into the war. since the us left, iraq has had a semi-civil war between sunni muslim militias, shia muslim militias, and the iraqi government.  israel: in the late 1800s a jewish political movement called zionism emerged, dedicated to establishing a jewish state. jews started emigrating to the british mandate of palestine. after ww2 and the holocaust pressure was put on the british to give up the land and they eventually did. israel became an independent country in 1948. israel had several wars with its arab neighbors including the six day war and the arab-israeli war of 1948. the arabs who lived in the region before the mass jewish immigration are arabs called ""palestinians"". the palestinians were moved to two areas. one called the west bank and the other the gaza strip. they have been occupied for several decades. there has been immense conflicts between the israelis and the palestinians due to fighting over the land. the united states has been and ally of israel since it's founding.   some extra information: in 1956 the democratically elected leader of iran nationalized iranian oil. the cia and mi6 carried out a military coup to overthrow the iranian government and establish a pro us government. the shah was put in power and was overthrown in 1979  during the islamic revolution led by ayatollah khomeini. the iranians stormed the us embassy and took several americans hostage and demanded that the usa stop giving the shah hospitality and send him back to iran to be tried. the hostages were eventually released. (research the iran-contra affair to find out how they were released) khomeini became the supreme leader of iran and was succeeded by the current ayatollah khameini. the us had a proxy war with iran by supporting iraqs invasion of iran in the 80s. this has led to very bad relations with the us and iran. iran also has bad relations with israel due to their support of an anti-israeli militant muslim group in lebanon called hezbollah. the us government and others have accused iran's nuclear energy program to be a threat to the us and israel. western governments fear iran's nuclear energy program may be used to produce nuclear weapons. this has also led to doubt and controversy because it sounds a lot like the build up the the iraq war.  syria- in 2011 protests against syrian president bashar al-assad's government. this protests turned violent and led to a civil war with the syrian government on one side and an umbrella organization called the free syrian army. the fsa included in its ranks radical organizations like al-qaeda and al-qaeda affiliates. the us started covertly then openly arming the fsa. in 2013 a chemical attack occurred in the syrian city of ghouta killing hundreds of civilians. western governments including the us blamed the assad regime for the attack while assad supporters like russia, iran, and syria itself blamed the rebels. this attack led president obama to attempt to seek military action against the assad regime but it was called off due to low support from the public and congress.  libya- in 2011 president obama along with us allied helped over throw the gaddafi regime in libya and established a new government. this was known as operation odyssey dawn.  i have probably left out a lot. this is just the basics. i would recommend ""crash course"" history on youtube.",0,,

906968,"in response to this article's criticism of obama's opposition to ""natural growth"", at least the settlers have a place to move to, considering they have been illegally taking palestinian territory for decades, the palestinians don't have anywhere to go for their natural growth because most of their land has been taken by israelis and they still don't have an official state.  it's just another pro-zionist neo-conservative hypocrisy to claim israeli settler's who have taken land illegally and living lavishly for decades while palestinians have been living in squalor dealing with israeli occupation, check points, having their land gobbled up by security fences and walls to protect these illegal settlements are now being oppressed and marginalized.  in reality the israeli settlements have been thriving under the oppression and marginalization of palestinians, and if neo-conservatives, aipac, pro-zionist groups and right-wing evangelical's keep dictating middle east policy, there will never be change and peace in the middle east.  i hope obama just ignore these groups, because it was them who have been in control of america's middle east policy for decades, and it has brought nothing but death, destruction, and failure.",0,,

345749,"this may just serve as a disagreement, however - in my opinion, capitalistic societies do that because they force capitalism on societies that aren't capitalistic.  in order for anyone to be rich - someone has to be poor (just remember that poor is a relative term). that is quite simply the way it is, the two things are dependent on each other and are mutually exclusive. the us, as a country, is rich (in general, most of our average poor person lives better than a lot of country's middle class... i wouldn't say better than their rich though) - because of other poor countries. i'm not going to say that the us has taken advantage of every poor country - some of them, unfortunately, have brought it on themselves - but it has come at the expense of many people.  the -world- is a capitalistic society. i don't think that, currently, there is any country that is immune from capitalism... and the ones that try to be get punished by the capitalist countries. everyone is part of it. in capitalism there are winners and losers on every scale. productivity has a lot of roots in opportunity, and as a us citizen, you have significantly more opportunity to be more productive than people in some third world countries. this is the biggest down side in capitalism - everyone should -start- equal, and then through their contributions they get their higher capital... they do not, currently. capitalist ""countries"" enhance the richness of their people by pushing the poor out of sight and out of mind. in other words, in order for the american standard of living (even for its poor people) to be as high as it is, which is significantly better than most countries, there have to be other countries that are being taken advantage of to do this. and while it's easy to say ""it's their government's fault"" (and in many cases it is), many individuals in these countries don't really have any way to have a realistic influence over what their government does - so they are simply thrown away by the world-based society.",0,,

668172,"&gt; israel and usa are fucking retards. why should they be allowed nukes but not iran?  because iran has expressed ambitions to destroy israel on over a dozen occasions just since ahmedinejad has entered office.  &gt; one side having nukes is more risky than both having nukes anyway, because of mutual assured destruction.  are you an idiot? you have to be some kind of 20-something who has never even bothered to study the nightmare that was the cold war. it would only take around 300 nukes to blanket over 75% of the world in nuclear winter, killing *billions*. let's take a look at how close we came to several orders of magnitude worse than that (that have been publicly disclosed!):  the cuban missile crisis: if anyone else had been in the white house other than john f. kennedy and robert mcnamera, you and i wouldn't be alive right now. the world would currently be a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  1969: the sino-soviet border conflict nearly produced a nuclear exchange between the us and the ussr.  yom kippur war: oh shit, would you look at that! israel nearly involved with a nuclear war and another country with nukes, the ussr (threatening to intervene on the behalf of egypt) sent the united states to defcon 3!  false alarms nearly triggered world war iii in the united states and the ussr in 1979 and 1983 respectively.  oh, then of course you have the nuclear capable nations of pakistan and india who could quite easily launch the 300 nukes against one another triggering the global nuclear winter. oh, of which they've come close to doing a half-dozen times, once by a hoax phone call!  mad isn't a deterrent to nuclear war. it creates the absolute worst possible scenarios for nuclear conflict. that is why iran cannot be permitted a nuclear weapon program at any cost. we don't need *another* one of these fucking situations.",0,,
